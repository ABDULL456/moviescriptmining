{"test1_input": "THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS \nWritten by \nTerry McKeown & Charles Gilliam \nMay 26th, 2007 \nLONDON 2007.. NOW \n1   EXT   NIGHT   URBAN TERRACE                                1 \nA row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain. \nA front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver. It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a TV flickers. \nDON Carol!... Carol! \nCAROL (V.O.) What? \nDON Come here! Quick! \nCAROL (V.O.) What is it? \nDON Quick! \nCAROL (V.O.) (irritated) I'm trying to watch this! It's the last episode! \nDON (annoyed) Come here!!! \nCAROL appears in the doorway. \nCAROL What is it? \nBut the wagon and horses have gone. \nDON It's gone! \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                  1 \nCAROL, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her hand and goes back inside. \n2   EXT/INT   NIGHT    PARKED CAR IN STREET                       2 \nA YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car. Music is playing on the radio. \nThey are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles past. \n3   EXT   NIGHT     THE TOWN HALL CLOCK                           3 \nThe clock shows and strikes 2am. \n4   EXT   NIGHT     A DINGY BACK STREET                           4 \nThe wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals. \nShadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof. \nWhile this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street. \nA group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering, laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having \"a great time\". \nThey see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks. \nMARTIN What the...! \nWe now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS. \nPERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals. \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                4 \nANTON/MERCURY Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up! Step up!... I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of Doctor Parnassus! \nPERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him. \nANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D) Doctor Parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. A secret learned in the mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination. Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... If you dare. But... Beware... there are dangers. You will have to choose. Will your soul fly?... Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? The choice is yours and yours alone. Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing. \nA young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward. \nANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps together. They look enchanting and enchanted. \nANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D) (to the audience) Or, if you must... \nNow PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery . \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED: (2)                                             4 \nANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D) ... scour the squalid depths with Putrid's brother, Stench! \n", "test1_true": "PERCY Take a ticket and join the queue! Only five quid a go! There's no greater bargain on planet earth! \nA beer bottle lands on the stage \nThe DRUNKEN YOUTHS cheer. \nANTON/MERCURY You choose... Fulfilment, grace and light or... Waste, filth and darkness. (under his breath, watching the drunk, MARTIN, with contempt) No prizes for guessing what you'll do. \nMARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage. \nHis MATES laugh and shout encouragement. \nANTON (not in character.. he stutters) No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed. You have to t-take a t-ticket first. \nANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'. \nMARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud. \nMARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is still in a trance. \nPERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash. \nMore laughter from the MOB. \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED: (3)                                               4 \nMARTIN (drunkenly to PARNASSUS) Hey you...I wanna audition. I wan... I wanna be a star... I wanna... \nMARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS' nose or pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him. \nVALENTINA Stop! Get off the stage! \nMARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA. \nMARTIN Thas a nice pair of jugs. \nMARTIN'S mates roar their approval. \nVALENTINA Get off the stage! \nMARTIN No. I wan you... I wan you... \nMARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage. \nMARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out tree. \nANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle). MARTIN crashes after her. \nANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide not to but it's a difficult decision. \n5   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      5 \nThe stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees. \n`Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?) \nVALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit. \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                   5 \nMARTIN Come here you little sexpot! \nVALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before striding off. \nMARTIN staggers to his feet. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Come back! You bitch! \nHe rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3 dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground. Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark, terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished. \n6   EXT   THE STAGE     NIGHT                                     6 \nVALENTINA, `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror. Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin. \nANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR PARNASSUS in awe. `Beauty' sighs. She's had enough. \n7   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      7 \nMARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest. \nMARTIN Mum...Mum!... \nHis voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl. \nMARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists should be. They are all howling and jabbering. \nFrom behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by the collar, hoisting him high into the air. \nClearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES swinging on \"vines\". \n", "test1_id": 987, "test2_input": "(CONTINUED) \n7   CONTINUED:                                                     7 \nBut, the \"vines\" are actually long, slim tentacles... dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float through the dark, frightening, sky. \nFrom some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a drink. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Please... I'll never...! Never again!. Honest!... From now on... I swear!.. Not a drop! \nWith a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar. \nDown he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet. \nHe can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears music. Beautiful, ethereal music. \nIn the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit. \nThe HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the \"thumbs up\", and points encouragingly toward the stairway. \nReformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the      stairs. But on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6      feet high. The stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult.      Letters are carved into the first stair...\"THE 12X12 STEP      PROGRAM...GOOD LUCK\". This is going to be tough. \nThe sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink before the long climb. He heads for the club. \nThe door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat. \nMR NICK Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you could use a drink. \n(CONTINUED) \n7   CONTINUED: (2)                                               7 \nMARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside. The door closes followed by the sound from within of much gaiety and laughter. \nTHE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FLAME. \n8   EXT   DINGY BACK STREET                                       8 \nThe sound of police sirens. We are back outside in front of the theatre. \nDR. PARNASSUS rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous trance.... `Beauty\" moves to support him as, exhausted, he loses his balance and snaps out of his trance. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (holding his head) Valentina... \nVALENTINA (indignant) He was chasing me. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (angry) You don't go through the mirror. \nVALENTINA I had to get away. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS You hit him. \nVALENTINA Self defence. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS You're out of control. Ever since your mother died... \nVALENTINA When I was three! \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS I don't want to talk about it! \nVALENTINA (indignant) You brought it up! \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED:                                                 8 \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS turns on ANTON. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS We don't accept drunks! \nANTON We c-couldn't stop him. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS People must be in their right minds when they make the choice. \nANTON I know. I'm s-sorry. \nDRUNKEN GIRL (V.O.) Martin!... \nThe POLICE are dealing with a drunken mob of nightclub REVELLERS, making arrests. \nA distraught, hysterical, DRUNKEN GIRL is looking for MARTIN. \nDRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D) Martin!... Martin!... \nShe sees `Beauty'. \nDRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D) He went with that cow! I'll scratch her eyes out! \nA POLICEWOMAN grabs the DRUNKEN GIRL and drags her, struggling, into police van. \nMARTIN'S FRIENDS are searching for him around the stage. \nFRIEND OF MARTIN Marty!? Marty, where are you? (a POLICEMAN grabs him)) Oi! Leave off..it's them..they've got our mate back there. \nPOLICEMAN (to PARNASSUS) You! Gunga Din! What do you think you're playing at!? \n", "test2_true": "(CONTINUED) \n8    CONTINUED: (2)                                             8 \nDR. PARNASSUS pushes aside the mirror to reveal a door in the back wall of the shallow stage. It is swinging open. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Gone. Will we miss him? I don't think so. \nThe POLICEMAN looks and frowns. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) (to the POLICEMAN condescendingly) Don't worry if you don't understand it immediately. \nPERCY, wisely, decides to head off conflict. He steers DOCTOR PARNASSUS away from the POLICEMAN. \nPERCY (to POLICEMAN) He's doing his bit to save the human race. He thinks it's got a future. Quaint, eh? I keep telling him to get a proper job. (shaking his empty collection cup) Check it out.. another night with nothing in the kitty. \nPOLICEMAN I want you freaks out of here. Now. If I ever see you in this parish again I'll do you. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS bows exaggeratedly, with a hint of mockery. \nThe POLICE OFFICER suspects that DOCTOR PARNASSUS is taking the piss, but decides not to press it. Instead, he knees MARTIN'S struggling friend to the ground. \n9    EXT   BACK STREETS DAWN                                       9 \nThe sky is grey with the first light of dawn. The wagon rolls off down the dark street as a dustcart rumbles into view and its CREW begin emptying bins and picking up rubbish. \n10   EXT   A HOLIDAY FAIR   NIGHT                               10 \nShooting galleries. Music. Loud aggressive rides. PEOPLE milling around. \n(CONTINUED) \n10   CONTINUED:                                                  10 \nThe wagon is parked at the edge of the fair. The stage is set. ANTON dressed as Mercury is trying to attract an audience, without much success. \nANTON Step up! Step up! For one night only! The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus! Not to be missed! \nOn stage is DOCTOR PARNASSUS, `levitating' and in a trance, as before. Incense smoke swirls around him. \nANTON (CONT'D) Test your imagination! Envisage the sublime. Let Doctor Parnassus be your guide. Discover the heights of Wisdom... \nVALENTINA dances forward, looking fabulous as `Wisdom'. \nANTON (CONT'D) ... Or, if you will, visit the doldrums with all that's vile and stinks. \nPERCY steps forward, once again in his mediaeval demon costume. \nPERCY (indicating ticket machine) Take a ticket and wait your turn. Twenty quid a go, reduced to five for one night only! \nANTON The world is full of wonders, beauty, enchantment, for those with eyes to see... \nHe magically produces a bouquet of flowers. Throws it into the air.. it transforms into beautiful doves. \nThis impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly arguing just in front of the stage - THE FAMILY FROM HELL. \nLINDA (aged 7) Mum... Mum... I want to go on the wall of death? \n(CONTINUED) \n10   CONTINUED: (2)                                           10 \nMUM Stop going on, Linda! You're not old enough! \nDAD They won't let you, darling. \nLINDA But I want to!!! I want to!!! \nMUM LINDA! \nDR. PARNASSUS stirs from his trance. He's had enough of this. \nDR. PARNASSUS Excuse me! Excuse me! Would you mind... \nLINDA It's not fair. \nUNCLE BOB It's the fair, but it's not fair! \nUNCLE BOB laughs uproariously. LINDA pushes him into AUNTY FLO. \nAUNTY FLO Ow! Bloody hell! \nDiego - aged 9 and absorbed in his portable video game wanders away from the family. \nMUM LINDA! BEEHAVE YOURSELF! I'M WARNING YOU! \nDAD Leave her alone! \nDR. PARNASSUS Please! This is The Imaginarium! It requires respect, concentration... Kindly go elsewhere and take your detritus with you? \nMUM Is he insulting us? \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_id": 988, "test3_input": "DR. PARNASSUS (smiling) Yes? \nMR NICK stubs out his cigarette. \nMR NICK I tell you what... You're probably not a betting man but... \nMR NICK whispers into the DR. PARNASSUS's ear. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) And so I made a wager with the devil. \n21   EXT   ON THE ROAD (MIDDLE AGES)    DAY/NIGHT               21 \nDR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are travelling the world with a little theatre. Giving performances. Inviting AUDIENCE MEMBERS onto the stage to participate. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) Whichever of us won ten converts first, would win the bet... My argument was the importance of the story, the power of the imagination... His, the power of material things, the supremacy of stuff... Naturally... I won. \nCUT TO another performance. Now the 16TH CENTURY. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O. (CONT'D) My prize...

MODERN CITY STREET     DAY                             22 \nDR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in modern clothes. As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no attention. \nThey look exhausted, like beggars...and very old. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) It seemed as though the Devil, after all... had triumphed... And then... one day.... \nA BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina, but older with different coloured hair) comes into view. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) From the very first moment I saw her, I was head-over-heels in love. She was beautiful, enchanting, delightful, young... But I... I was several thousand years old! How could I woo her? What could I do? \n23   EXT.   CLIFF TOP    EVENING                                   23 \nCUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off the cliff. \nPERCY Don't be a fool! You can't die! You're immortal! You'll just end up broken, in the eternity ward, and I'll be stuck looking after you! Forever! \nDR. PARNASSUS breaks free, stumbles backwards, and pitches out into space. PERCY screams. \nDR. PARNASSUS V.O. At times like these... the devil is never far away. \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:                                               23 \nDR. PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat, snagged on a branch angled out from the cliff face and held, like a fishing rod, by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face. \n24   EXT.   RIVER      DAY                                     24 \nCUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They are in love, very happy to be together. \nPERCY, wearing a blazer, flannels and straw boater is rowing or punting. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) The devil granted me mortality again...and youth and great powers. I won my bride. I was in love. But at what price... \nThe boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up, DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing, smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK . \nThere is a loud and ominous clap of thunder. \n25   INT.   PARNASSUS' DEN        NIGHT                        25 \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS ...at what price.... \nDR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and drops the paper-weight. \nVALENTINA Father!... \nAt that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear frantic banging on the roof. \nDR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on. \nDR. PARNASSUS We've stopped. \nVALENTINA What do you mean `at what price'? \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED:                                                    25 \nDR. PARNASSUS (turning back to his Tarot cards) It'll wait, it'll wait. Another time. Something's happened. You'd better go and see. \nVALENTINA Typical! You insist I listen to a story and then you don't finish it! \nMore banging from above. \nDR. PARNASSUS Go and see! \n", "test3_true": "PARNASSUS looks miserable but, almost relieved.    He turns over the next card. \nIt's The Hanged Man. It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet surrounded by several arcane objects. \nPARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the others. He takes a swig from the bottle. \n26   EXT   WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE     NIGHT                 26 \nThe wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge. It's pouring with rain. \nVALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain, climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon. \nHere she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames. \nANTON Incredible!

Get a rope! \n27   EXT   SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE      MOMENTS LATER      27 \nANTON is `absailing' over the side of the bridge. One end of a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist. \nVALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent. \nMoments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge, the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S. \nThe MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking in his dance of death. His hands are tied behind his back. \nANTON can't reach the MAN. \nANTON (shouting up) I c-can't reach him. \nVALENTINA Try again! \nPERCY Swing in! \nVALENTINA Hurry up. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                               27 \nANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with VALENTINA'S help on her end of the rope begins to swing back and forth. \nEventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp. Dead. \nWith extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the MAN'S rope. \nANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half. \nANTON Arghhh!!!! \nVALENTINA You've done it! Brilliant! \nANTON Argggg!!! \nPERCY Come on, don't hang about! We're getting soaked up here! \n28   EXT   PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER     28 \nVALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet and onto the pavement. \nDR. PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon. Soaked. He's drunk and is swaying. \nDR. PARNASSUS Why are you fishing dead people out of the river? He's dead. Leave him. Let's go. Before the police turn up. \nHe goes, unsteadily, back inside. \nVALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon, out of the rain. \nThe MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit. His jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old and very handsome. \n(CONTINUED) \n28   CONTINUED:                                                      28 \n", "test3_id": 989}

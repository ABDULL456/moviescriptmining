He feels very far away. \nOLIVER Yeah. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLONG-HAIRED MAN I'm so glad you came, Doc. Just really good to get this stuff off my chest. \nOLIVER (in Freud accent) I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in. The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality. We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him. Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session. \nOLIVER V.O. Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a break, actually. She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's not going to give it up. \nOLIVER (back in accent) Well, I guess we should start with your mother. The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver: \"Never had one.\" \nOLIVER Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying. \nOLIVER I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: \"I have laryngitis\" \nOLIVER That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: \"Why are you at a party if you're sad?\" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOLIVER I was doing such a good job of hiding it.

Down the street she points right... \nOLIVER This way? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe nods. Oliver drives up on the sidewalk before the street, heads down it for half a block, then takes her right.

ANNA'S APARTMENT. \nThe door opens, Oliver tentatively enters the empty room. The apartment is very spare, barely lived in. A lone couch, clothes on a rack, a few personal photos taped to the wall. \nOLIVER Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here. \nANNA No. Oliver moves forward into the kitchen. \nANNA (V.O.) This is my kitchen. It's where I eat. Oliver follows her tour, while she's not there, it's strangely intimate. \nANNA (V.O.) This is my bathroom. It's very fancy. The bare, poor bathroom is not fancy. \nANNA (V.O.) Outside my window... \n", "test3_true": "CONTINUED: \nOliver walks and looks out her window. \nANNA (V.O.) ... That's my neighbor's roof. The room at the end is my bedroom... \nINT. ANNA'S BEDROOM \nOliver enters her bedroom. \nANNA (V.O.) That's my closet. Those are my clothes and my pictures. There is a single rack holding up some clothes. Her pictures are taped to the wall. Oliver sits on her bed. \nANNA Why do you leave everyone? Why did you let me go? Oliver thinks for a moment. \nCUT TO PAST \nINT. OLIVER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT \nREPEAT MEMORY: Oliver watches his mother walk down the hallway, very alone, and enter her bedroom - it feels like some gesture of hopelessness. \nWE HEAR OLIVER'S ANSWER OVER THIS IMAGE: \nOLIVER (V.O.) Maybe because I, I don't really believe that it's gonna work. And then I make sure it doesn't work. \nCUT TO PAST \nINT. HAL'S LIVING-ROOM - DAY \nHal lies in the hospital bed set up in his living room. JUAN, a young handsome and probably gay hospice nurse is gently helping him take his morphine. Hal looks at Juan with love and affection. Oliver watches from the kitchen door. \nHAL Isn't Juan's hair wonderful. \nJUAN Thanks. I use this great mousse. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHAL Well it's terrific. \nJUAN Do you wanna try some? Hal turns shy and young. \nHAL Oh, no. \nJUAN Just a little bit? \nHAL I don't think so. \nJUAN Come on. Just try a little bit. It'll be fun. \nHAL \n(LAUGHS) Yeah? \nJUAN Yeah. \nHAL How do you do it? \nJUAN Okay, I'm going to show you how. Juan steps away and grabs his mousse, puts a little in his hand and sits back down on Hal's bed. He begins to spread it gently through wisps of Hal's white hair. Oliver watches Hal close his eyes, and deeply enjoy this simple affection and camaraderie with another gay man. \nJUAN There. \nHAL Is that it? Hal looks into camera which is Oliver's POV. \nHAL How do I look? Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret. \nOLIVER Great. You look great. \nCUT TO PRESENT \nINT. ANNA'S BEDROOM \nOliver's still on her bed, his heart and mind is somewhere else. \n"}

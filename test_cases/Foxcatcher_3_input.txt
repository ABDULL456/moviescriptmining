MARK Why does she... 
He trails off. Then, a bit desperate - 
MARK (CONT'D) The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... 
Dave speaks gently. 
DAVE I got a good thing going here. I got a contract. Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school... 
The reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. He's shell-shocked. 
MARK The Worlds are sixty days away. 
DAVE Tell me your plan. Who you gonna train with? 
MARK (LOST) Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane. (beat, then, very quietly) I don't know how to do this without you. 
DAVE Do what? 
The answer is "everything" -- but Mark just shakes his head. 
DAVE (CONT'D) It sounds like an opportunity. 
MARK Does it? 
DAVE I think you could make something of it. 
MARK Do you? (DAVE NODS) A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. 
DAVE Thank you. 
Dave steps forward and holds out his arms - 
DAVE (CONT'D) Congrats, little brother. 
Mark steps into his brother's arms, folding into him, head on his chest, holding on for dear life. Nancy looks over.

CUT TO: 
EXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY 
Mark rings the doorbell. No answer. He goes to ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID. 
MARK Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. 
Silence. That means nothing to her. 
MARK (CONT'D) I'm here to see John du Pont? 
UNIFORMED MAID Is Mr. du Pont expecting you? 
MARK Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime. 
UNIFORMED MAID Just a moment, please.

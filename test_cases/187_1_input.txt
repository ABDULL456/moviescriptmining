The anonymous message pops up on computer screens all around the classroom. 
Ellen's POV of students (and Stevie). Deciphering reactions. LINGERING ON Stevie's poker face.

Her own poker face now... 
ELLEN Whoever sent that message isn't as anonymous as they think. 
Ellen turns to her console, clicks the REPLY button.    A new mail message window opens up. It's addressed to the anonymous sender, STUDENT #00. Ellen types in: 
GO TO THE OFFICE 
All the while anticipation builds on Stevie's face.    He glances around, starting to get nervous. 
Ellen now clicks the SEND button... 
Stevie's COMPUTER BEEPS...    COMPUTER VOICE:   "You've got mail..." 
... A window opens in the middle of Stevie's monitor revealing Ellen's return message. 
Class erupts and Stevie springs out of his seat... 
STEVIE 'Dat's bullshit, man! 
He rushes up to the front of the class. 
STEVIE You best step off, Ms. H. Cuz you can't prove nuthin'. And I know you can't afford to lose 'dis minimum wage job 'a yers. 
ELLEN (beat and) You're right, Stevie. I can't afford to live in a big house south of the boulevard. Like you do. 
Class erupts again, coming down on Stevie and his wanna-be poor boy from the streets image. They're laughing at him now, not with him. In a rage, Stevie kicks open the hallway door and exits the classroom. 
115   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS MAIN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER             115 
Ellen hastily enters, looking for Stevie. Addresses IRIS (a thirty-something Hispanic woman) behind the counter...

ELLEN Iris, did Steven Littleton come in here? 
IRIS Haven't seen 'im. 
Teacher #1, the insipid woman, checks her mail slot.    It's her conference period. 
TEACHER #1 (appalled) You're not supposed to leave your classroom unattended. 
ELLEN (reacting) Sue me. 
Teacher #1 exits in a flurry. Ellen now glances to her right. Seated there in rigid silence is BENNY CHACON'S MOTHER (51). 
IRIS (offers; sotto) Benny Chacon's mother. Told 'er Garcia had to leave early today but she jus' sits there. She been saying some pretty crazy things. 
Mrs. Chacon begins speaking Spanish in plaintive spurts. Ellen can't decipher what she is saying... 
ELLEN (to Mrs. Chacon) ... Espanol, muy poquito, senora. (beat) Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down. (back to Iris) What's she saying? 
Hesitating.    Now with apprehension... 
IRIS You heard 'bout that body they foun' in the L.A. River... She says she thinks it's Benny. 
OFF Ellen's unblinking gaze... 
116   EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE (DOWNTOWN) -          116 EVENING 
A concrete fortress... Ellen and Mrs. Chacon approach. 
117   OMITTED                                                        117 
118   INT. ASSISTANT CORONER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION            118 
Ellen and Mrs. Chacon sit stiffly in front of the ASSISTANT CORONER (mid-forties). Desk cluttered. Half- eaten sandwich in front of him. He nurses a Styrofoam cup of coffee as he flips through a John Doe folder. 
ASST. CORONER You say he's been missing approximately four weeks? 
ELLEN ... Four, almost five weeks. 
ASST. CORONER That's a long time. Lots a things happen to a body after four or five weeks. Makes it difficult to I.D. 
A faint, incongruous smile. 
ELLEN (indicating John Doe) So he just sits here? 
ASST. CORONER We keep 'um up to thirty days. Lady, we get 80, sometimes 90 Does a month. Floaters, gangbangers, illegals, junkies. Most of 'um cheap homicides. Nobody's even lookin' for 'em. (indicating folder) This guy here, has a dent in his head. Could be post-mortem trauma. Probably hit a retaining wall on his way down river after that rain we had. Who knows. (beat) Yuh ask me, this kid was dead before he got his head caved in. Overdose by morphine. That's what it looks like t'me. 
Ellen weighs it. Assistant Coroner now refers to some sort of questionnaire. 
ASST. CORONER On the phone you said the mother mentioned some identifying marks. 
Ellen refocuses a far-off, introspective gaze.

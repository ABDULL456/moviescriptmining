JEFF I was. 
STELLA (Massaging harder) What'll you do if one of them catches you? 
JEFF Depends one which one. 
She stops massaging, reaches for the oil. 
JEFF Now Miss Torso, for example -- 
Stella hits his back with a palmful of cold oil. It takes his breath. 
STELLA Keep your mind off her. 
JEFF She's real eat, drink and be merry girl. 
STELLA And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable. 
JEFF Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone. 
STELLA Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness. 
JEFF And some man will lose his. 
STELLA Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction? 
JEFF Well, the salesman could be available soon. 
STELLA (Interested in the scandal) He and his wife splitting up? 
JEFF It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case. 
STELLA (So?) Isn't he a salesman? 
JEFF Now what could he sell at three in the morning? 
STELLA (Shrugs) Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up. 
JEFF He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain. 
She helps him to a sitting position. 
STELLA His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward. 
JEFF Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run. 
STELLA (Looks at him) But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it. 
Jeff turns his head away for a moment. She helps him into the chair. Hands him his shirt, which he proceeds to put on. The back of his chair is to the window. 
STELLA (Putting oil and power away) What about this morning? Any developments? 
JEFF No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment. 
STELLA (stops) In this heat? (Turns, looks over his shoulder) They're up now.

He quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window. It is not a casual look, but a long, careful, searching appraisal of all the apartment house windows in his neighborhood, starting from his left to his right. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm. 
JEFF Get back! Out of sight! Quick! 
He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow. 
STELLA (A startled whisper) What is it? What's the matter? 
Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. 
JEFF (Quietly) The salesman's looking out his window. 
Stella relaxes, gives Jeff a disgusted look, and starts to move out of the shadows. 
STELLA A Federal offense. 
JEFF (Sharply) Get back there! He'll see you! 
She moves back into the shadows. 
STELLA I'm not shy. I've been looked at before. 
JEFF (Still peering toward window) It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT 
Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
THE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD, and as it reaches the edge of the window, PANS DOWN and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves away. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe. 
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP 
Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying:

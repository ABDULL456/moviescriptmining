She reclaims the steering wheel.   Straightens up. Hits the accelerator again. 
EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING 
The Plymouth swerves behind on the skid that Della created, corrects itself just before the ditch. 
Della gains speed. The Plymouth lags. 
A stop sign appears ahead. The road's ending. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
Right or left, Della? Make a choice. 
EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING 
There is no choice. A barrier blocks the left hand turn. A big sign reads "LOT FULL". 
EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE ROAD - EVENING 
Della swings right instead. 
The streetlights recede behind her. 
EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING 
Nothing but the darkness of a housing complex under construction ahead. 
But she seems to have shaken off her pursuers. 
She speeds down the road, looking intently for any sign of life. But there's nothing but half-built houses, empty houses, houses just like hers. 
EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN MINI MALL - EVENING 
A Seven Eleven sign appears. She slows down. But it may as well be a mirage, it's an unfinished building with only the sign, in an unfinished mini-mall.

INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
Close to screaming now she speeds up. 
EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING 
More empty houses in varying stages of construction. No sign of life. 
EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING 
Then, what looks like a filling station, one light on in the kiosk. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
Hope. She pulls in and dims her lights, drives right up to the kiosk door. 
Hope dashed. 
EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING 
It's in its final stages of installation but definitely not functioning. And there's no one there. 
EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING 
Back onto the road and she sees far behind her, car headlights that can only belong to the Plymouth, following her through the darkness. 
She dims her lights to just the side lights. Hurtles along the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher. Potholes filled with mud and rain water splash against the car. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
Her wipers struggle to cope. She can hardly see through the front window. 
EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING 
The potholes yawn deeper. The asphalt ends. Gravel deteriorates to dirt. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
She steers the Ford blindly. 
Scene 67Page 38 
EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING 
A wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly ahead.

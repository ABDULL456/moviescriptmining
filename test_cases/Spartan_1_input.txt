HOLD on Anton, who is standing, unassigned, and looking it. 
We see, on an improvised bulletin board, photos of the Boy, Blake, the Professor, and the Girl, blown up from a newspaper shot, and in various photos. As we watch an Agent walks up with a box full of photos, and tacks one up on the board. It is an altered shot showing the young girl with short, spikey platinum hair. 
ANGLE on Scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takes a photo from the box. We see him put it next to the original, blonde photo, and look at both. 
AGENT We ran it up from a description of the colorist from the Beauty Parlor... 
SCOTT Gimme your coat. 
The Agent takes off his suitcoat, and gives it to Scott, who puts it on. 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he holds the photos, and the Regency description. He walks toward the door, through the mass of agents. He stops by Miller, who is on the phone, looking at a photograph of the Professor, as a tech hooks up a video feed of a house on the water, the Professor's house. A photo of a sailboat is tacked up. We read 'The Colophon' on its stern. 
SCOTT (to Miller) I need five thousand dollars. 
Miller gestures "Just a Moment", and then waves to an Aide, meaning "Do It". 
SCOTT How long do we have? Sir? 
MILLER (shakes his head) It hits the papers, and we're done. 
SCOTT No...note? No... 
Miller shakes his head, he holds up the "Regency" note... 
SCOTT (nodding) I've got it... (to Miller) Can I have some backup? 
Miller, gesturing around the room, meaning "what you see is what you get". All the occupants of the room are engaged on some task, save Anton, who sits alone on a bench. Scott looks at Anton, who glances at Scott, trying to keep the appeal out of his glance, "Please take me". 
SCOTT (to Anton) We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren't we? 
ANTON Yes. Sir. 
Scott looks at Anton and shakes his head. He is summoned to the front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash into an envelope. Scott comes over to her, and we see her filling out a slip of paper. She hands him the cash in the envelope, and the slip of paper. 
YOUNG WOMAN I need you to sign it. 
SCOTT You sign it. (He scans the room again, shrugs, and motions to Anton) Come on, Wallflower... (Anton rises and walks over to him) 
Scott turns to Anton. 
SCOTT Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes open, and form on me...Here's where we're going... 
There is the sound of a gunshot. Scott and Anton instinctively take cover against the side of the building, drawing their sidearms. 
HOLD TIGHT on Scott. As he looks through the half-open door. 
We see several of the Swat men, taking up positions, one of them kicks open a door, and his partner enters. Pause. We hear the partner call "clear". 
ANGLE, on Scott, as he re-enters the building, and proceeds, pistol out, toward the room. 
ANGLE HIS POV. On the floor, we see the dead Secret Service Agent, a pistol in his hand. 
We see Miller turn to his team. An Agent kneels to the fallen Secret Service Agent, and prods a small hideout pistol from his hand. Scott turns to leave, and sees Anton standing next to him. 
SCOTT Don't look at him. Don't look at the Downed Man. He's dead... (as he turns his back on the scene) Kick the fool overboard... 
ANGLE on Anton and Scott as they leave. In the BG we see Miller et al. Miller giving directions. 
MILLER ...who is the girl he went to see? Get her in...The girl he was fucking...Who's got the Coastguard... 
TIGHT on Anton and Scott as they exit the building. 
SCOTT I'd hate to be the Lucky Duck who frisked him... (beat) 
ANTON He was off-post when they snatched the girl? 
SCOTT (as he looks at the fallen agent) Yeah. Well, apparently, he felt bad about it... 
EXT. REGENCY CLUB. NIGHT. 
A garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting, getting into their limo. Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up to the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to the club. We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his watch, meaning "closing up". 
ANGLE INS. Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the bouncer. 
ANGLE, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on. 
ANGLE INT. THE REGENCY CLUB. Several well-dressed couples are leaving. A group of raucous, drunk businessmen types push past them. Scott walks up to the bar. The Bartender is beginning to ring out the cash register. In the BG we see a manager eye Scott, and continue to direct the closing operations. 
BARTENDER Closing up... (he points to his watch) Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.

Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the night. 
After a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle landing in water with a splash. 
EXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT 
Skip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp. Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds, finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph. 
Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind, douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse entrance to prepare his joint. 
INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT 
as Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is still. 
Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing sound--completely inhuman. 
SKIP Hello? 
There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring. 
SKIP Who's there? 
Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear. 
Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter and flicks it on. 
Something snags him from behind. 
Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed hands tightens around his neck. 
His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor. 
EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER 
Only the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark. 
INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Rob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him, wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking. Rob throws off the covers. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Rob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door. Everything else is dark and quiet. 
ROB (hushed, at door) Muffy? 
No answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight. 
A beat. Then: 
ROB (cont.) (CONCERNED) Muffy? 
MUFFY'S VOICE (UNCERTAINLY) Yes? 
ROB You OK? 
MUFFY'S VOICE (DISTANTLY) Yes... Thank you... 
He pulls back from the door. 
ROB (reluctantly, puzzled) OK... well, goodnight... 
No response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too. 
EXT. HOUSE - MORNING 
Harvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki, naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air. 
Then she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and pulls back inside. INT. KITCHEN Â­ DAY 
Rob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room, surprising Muffy at the stove. 
KIT (BRISKLY) Good morning! 
Muffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too. 
ANGLE 
Muffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe. Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St. John.

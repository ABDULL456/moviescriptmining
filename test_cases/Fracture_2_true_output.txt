NUNALLY I took Crawford's confession. 
WILLY And now you want mine? 
NUNALLY I'm here to warn you. Take this seriously, because it's serious. This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying in a hospital bed - with brain damage... He struggles to keep himself under control. 
WILLY Are you all right? 
NUNALLY Are you gonna be on this, or what? 
WILLY Yeah.  I'm on it. (Gently) You got a confession. You took the gun out of his hand. It's done. 
NUNALLY I'm just - telling you. Is that okay? Or are you too friggin' busy?! 
WILLY No.   It's okay. Willy waits.    Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons. 
NUNALLY Forget it. (Beat) It's a lock. We're good.   Put him down. Bury him. Willy nods.    Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp. Willy watches him go. Sad. Like he's watching Nunally drown. But he's seen people drown before...and he's not about to put out a hand. Might get pulled in himself. 
INT. CHANDLER PAVILION - LOBBY - LATER 
Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting, sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE. NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his age, but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her. 
NIKKI Are you a shark? 
WILLY Sorry? 
NIKKI You've been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you'd die. 
WILLY If I stopped, I'd be standing around with no one to talk to. At which point, death would be a relief. 
NIKKI Why don't you talk to Bob? Willy stops walking, getting a little careful. 
WILLY "Bob" is talking to the Governor. (Beat) Do I know you? She puts a hand out, gently amused. 
NIKKI Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate, Wooton Sims. 
WILLY (Shakes) Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that called, with the invitation. 
NIKKI On Bob's orders. 
WILLY Listen, I don't...actually know "Bob." I mean, I've only met the man once. Nikki nods, considering this.      And him. 
NIKKI Interesting. They're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction. The lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little. As the CROWD begins to drift toward the auditorium doors: 
NIKKI You like opera? 
WILLY Truth is, I haven't really had that much expos- 
NIKKI Neither do I. With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza doors. Willy follows. 
EXT. ARTS CENTER - SOON AFTER 
They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines. 
NIKKI Bob assigned you to my team. I'll supervise your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you. 
WILLY Kind of like a mentor. 
NIKKI Kind of like a probation officer. Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make sure he's got it.

CROW HORSE Why? So you can get rid of me, too? 
RAY No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go. 
Crow Horse lies there, breathing heavy. Ray on top of him, still clutching his gun. 
INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
Ray and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads. 
CROW HORSE Maybe the old man's visions are still strong. 
Ray nods, concentrating. After a time: 
RAY Do they come in dreams, these visions? 
CROW HORSE Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when. 
RAY Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo. 
When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him. 
CROW HORSE Where was this? 
RAY At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why? 
CROW HORSE You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty. 
RAY Well, it was just a dream, I -- 
CROW HORSE Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you? 
RAY What do you mean? 
CROW HORSE Nothin'. Forget it. 
Crow Horse looks out the window as if to avoid Ray who is confused by the Indian's smoldering. After a moment, Crow Horse looks at him. 
CROW HORSE You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision. 
RAY Sorry. 
CROW HORSE I'm a full-blood Oglala. 
RAY We've driven a long way. Where is this place? 
CROW HORSE Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams? 
RAY Yeah. Fitful dreams. 
Crow Horse feels better. He looks out the window, nodding. But it doesn't last long. 
CROW HORSE Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones. 
RAY What the hell do you want me to do?! 
CROW HORSE Stop. 
Ray brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it. 
EXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT 
The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy. 
He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and spills it on the ground. Then he walks on. 
Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to Crow Horse's offering. 
THROUGH THE BADLANDS 
Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and it illuminates -- 
A RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty stakes. Ribbons blowing in the wind. 
RAY What's that? 
CROW HORSE Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure. 
Ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something frightening occurs. Something... some unseen thing snags him by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING SOUND. 
Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a hole himself. 
The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their bearings. 
Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight scans --

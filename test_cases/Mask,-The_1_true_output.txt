DORIAN/MASK A kiss? 
TINA One last kiss. 
DORIAN/MASK (a beat) Sure, why not... 
Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy TWO-FOOT TONGUE, and stick his eyebrows back. Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up. But Tina turns her head way. 
TINA No! From the real Dorian. The guy I used to love. (BREATHY) Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel. 
ORLANDO No time, boss. This building's going down any minute... 
DORIAN/MASK I make the decisions! And I've decided... 
Tina stares at him dreamily. Ego gets the better of him. He reaches up and RIPS the mask off. SSSSHUPP! 
DORIAN/MASK TRANSFORMS BACK INTO DORIAN 
DORIAN ...to give the girl one last thrill. 
He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly. Tina really gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg that he freed up. And... 
TINA DROP-KICKS THE MASK 
right out of Dorian's hand. It flies into the air. 
A SERIES OF SLO-MO SHOTS AS... 
THE MASK SOARS THROUGH THE AIR... 
DORIAN, ORLANDO and SWEET EDDY ON THE RUN... 
THE MASK REACHES ITS SUMMIT THEN TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH THE AIR... 
HANDS REACH HIGH... FINGERTIPS GRAZE IT... 
But then suddenly... shockingly... 
A SNOUT, FLAPPING TONGUE AND BARE TEETH 
soar straight up through thr human hands and... 
MILO GRABS THE MASK 
as though it were a Frisbee. Everyone's stunned. 
REAL TIME 
The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth. He starts to run away but... Dorian grabs his hind leg. 
DORIAN C'mere, you ugly little mutt... 
MILO 
legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second, he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES. 
DORIAN'S 
eyes widen as 
MILO TRANSFORMS INTO -- DOG/MASK! 
His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized GREEN HEAD with a double-row of JAGGED CANINE TEETH. The plain collar now sparkles with GLEAMING STUDS. RAZOR-TOENAILS distend. The eyes glow hell fire green. 
DORIAN (CONT.) Whoa! 
Reflexively, Dorian lets go. Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly loud SONIC WOOF that explodes glass front slot machines all around them. 
DORIAN (CONT.) Don't let it get away! 
Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks BIG Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll. 
STANLEY 
watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope into a FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH. 
Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn. 
DOG/MASK 
uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down. 
SWEET EDDY Get him off me! 
Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask leaps away in the nick of time. 
ORLANDO C'mon! We've got the money. Let's get the hell out of here! 
DORIAN I gotta have that mask! 
Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.

HOLMES (gallantly) I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight. 
ROGOZHIN That is because she is   forty-nine. (he hands her a   glass of vodka, with an   exaggerated smile) So Madame has decided   to leave ballet and spend life bringing up   her child. 
HOLMES How admirable. 
ROGOZHIN (hands him vodka) Problem now is to find father. 
HOLMES Oh?   Is he missing? 
ROGOZHIN Correct. 
HOLMES And that's why you called me in? 
ROGOZHIN Also correct. We must have father, because without father, how can there be child? 
HOLMES I see. The whole thing is still in the planning stage -- 
ROGOZHIN Correct again. Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful. Since she is beautiful -- she now needs man who is brilliant. 
Holmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova.    She raises her glass. 
PETROVA Za zdorovie. 
ROGOZHIN (raising his glass) Za zdorovie. 
HOLMES Za zdrovie. 
Petrova and Rogozhin down their vodka bottoms up.    Holmes takes one swallow, then stops. 
HOLMES What's in it? 
ROGOZHIN What does it taste like? 
HOLMES Red pepper. 
ROGOZHIN That's what's in it. 
While Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own, Holmes takes another tentative sip. 
PETROVA (to Holmes) Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj? 
HOLMES I beg your pardon? 
ROGOZHIN Madame wants to know how soon you can be ready. 
HOLMES Ready? 
ROGOZHIN To leave for Venice. All arrangements have been made. You will spend one week there with Madame... 
HOLMES Well, this is all very flattering. But surely there are other me -- better men -- 
ROGOZHIN To tell you truth, you were not first choice. We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi -- 
HOLMES That's more like it.   The man's a genius. 
ROGOZHIN Too old... Then we considered the philosopher, Nietzsche -- 
HOLMES Absolutely first-rate mind... 
ROGOZHIN Too German... And we considered Tschaikowski -- 
HOLMES Oh, you couldn't go wrong with Tschaikowski -- 
ROGOZHIN We could -- and we did.   It was catastrophe. 
HOLMES Why? 
ROGOZHIN You don't know? Because Tschaikowski -- how shall put it? Women not his glass of tea. 
HOLMES Pity, that. 
PETROVA (to Rogozhin) Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim resheniem. 
ROGOZHIN Madame is very happy with final choice. 
HOLMES Madame mustn't be too hasty.   She must remember I'm an Englishman. 
ROGOZHIN So? 
HOLMES You know what they say about us. If there's one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it's our love-making. We are not exactly the most romantic of people -- 
ROGOZHIN Perfect. We don't want sentimental idiots -- falling in love, committing suicide. One week in Venice -- she goes back to St. Petersburg with baby -- you go back to London with fiddle.

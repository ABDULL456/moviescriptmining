GABE I have no fucking idea. (holds Qualen's gun) Empty. 
HAL (smiling) Not for long. 
Hal fishes into his pockets and pulls out one of the ammo clips he took from Delmer, Gabe tries to force it into the gun's stock -- but it's the wrong size. 
GABE (sagging against rail) Why can't anything be easy? 
THE HELICOPTER 
thunders around the mountain wall, getting closer -- 
HAL AND GABE 
have crossed the bridge, near the mountain edge -- Gabe, now wearing his pack again, nods over to the wooded area. 
GABE Stay over there -- 
HAL Look -- let me -- 
GABE -- what, throw snowballs at him? Just -- whatever happens -- get Maggie out of here. 
HAL (relenting) Count on it. (beat) And Gabe? Thanks for tagging along. 
GABE (smiles) Thanks for asking. I forgot how much I enjoyed rescue work. 
Gabe limps toward the mountain's edge as Hal runs into the woods. 
THE HELICOPTER 
blasts along the wall towards the lake -- the waterfall and the ladder are just ahead. The copter radio crackles -- 
WRIGHT (O.S.) (from radio) Come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- urgent -- come in -- 
Travers recognizes the voice -- frowning, he snaps off the radio and banks the helicopter up over the top -- 
TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV 
tops the precipice, revealing Gabe, standing on the end of a narrow spur -- it just out from the edge like a diving board. Gabe has his pack on one arm -- the money is visible. Gabe levels Qualen's emptied gun on Travers and the copter -- this bluff is all he has left. 
GABE (over radio) Remember that bet you made? About whether I could find the money for you or not? (holds pack over drop) You won. 
Travers helplessly flies in low, tight circles over Gabe and the spur -- if he shoots Gabe, the money falls too, Travers presses his gun at Maggie. 
TRAVERS (into radio) I'll kill her -- 
GABE (over radio) You do, and the spring thaw's going to be worth thirty million bucks. (pause) No rush. I'm sure you've got lots of time. 
TRAVERS (into radio) All right. Drop the gun first. 
GABE (into radio) When she's safe on the ground. 
EXT. SPUR/COPTER 
Travers has no choice but to give in -- he gives Maggie the handcuff key, and she frees herself as he flies away from the spur, touching the copter down on the mountain top. 
TRAVERS (to Maggie) Get out. 
Maggie moves out the door and stares uncertainly at Gabe. 
GABE (shouting) Run! (she doesn't) Run! 
Maggie runs for the trees. When Gabe is sure she's safe, he throws the gun away -- but keeps the pack suspended over the edge. 
GABE (into radio) Now come and get it. My arm's getting tired. 
EXT. HELICOPTER 
Travers flies the copter up and over, until he and it are five feet away from Gabe's position on the spur. Gabe is buffeted by the copter's wind, but stands firm. Travers levels his gun at Gabe through the open passenger door as Gabe heaves the pack in. Travers doesn't even look down -- he just stares at Gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot. 
GABE (shouting) Don't you want to count it? 
Puzzled, Travers takes his gun hand and rips open 
THE PACK 
The $5000s are there -- but they've been shredded by Qualen's earlier blast of gunfire. Few, if any, of the bills are passable. 
TRAVERS 
stares down, incredulous -- as he does -- 
GABE 
rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt gun from his waist -- 
Travers looks up and raises his gun at Gabe -- but Gabe fires first -- the bolt imbeds itself high in Travers' chest. Gasping, Travers drops his gun -- it falls over the pack and out the open door -- Travers clutches at his chest -- 
GABE Don't spend it all in one place, you son of a bitch. 
Travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the helicopter -- it spins around, and Gabe has to instantly flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him -- Gabe looks down as -- 
THE HELICOPTER 
quickly begins to spiral down in wide, aimless circles -- Travers has clearly lost control -- 
GABE 
stares down coldly, waiting for the crash -- but -- 
INSIDE THE COPTER - TRAVERS 
won't give up -- sweating, bleeding, he sits forward and grabs the stick, seizing control of the helicopter again -- 
GABE'S POV - THE HELICOPTER 
stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and up -- with clear purpose --

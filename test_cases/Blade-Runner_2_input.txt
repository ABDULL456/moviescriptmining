A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end. A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers: 
DECKARD Hello, Roy. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103 
Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time, he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor. He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door, pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG. The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is empty. 
INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104 
Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he turns the know and pushed open the door. 
INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105 
Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to- wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the hallway. 
INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106 
Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap and gym shoes, he's nude. 
BATTY You wanna play? 
Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway. Pops out again. 
BATTY Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent.  I thought you were supposed to be good.  Aren't you the man?! 
The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman- che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol- len, trembling from the thrill of it. 
BATTY This is how we do it up there, lad! Come on! 
In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh. 
Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be- hind him. 
He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head. Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face. Batty kneels next to him. 
BATTY Not hurt, are you?  You better get it up or I'm going to have to kill you.  Unless you're alive you can't play.  And if you don't play, you don't get to be alive. 
Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with his chest and starts to push. 
BATTY That's the spirit. 
Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the doors. 
Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall, towards the jeering voice. 
BATTY'S VOICE Come on, Deckard, show me what you got!  I'm right here on the other side of the door.  But you gotta shoot straight 'cause I'm fast! 
Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty. 
INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107 
The full length mirror on the other side of the room SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand and steps in closer. 
BATTY Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. 
They're face to face. 
BATTY You don't have a chance, do you? 
In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops his head to the side. 
BATTY Looks like I'm gonna have to scale it down for you.  Give you a handicap.  I won't run through any more walls.  Okay?  I promise to use the doors.  Okay? 
Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud- denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall. 
BATTY Come on, let's use that brain! 
INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108 
He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again. 
BATTY Think!  We need a little resilience around here! 
He yanks him further and bashes his head again. 
BATTY Where are those balls of yours?! Let's see a little bravery!

LYNN You want a favor? 
MONIX My knee. 
LYNN Oh, Jesus Christ Monix. It's 4 a.m. Lynn stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs. 
MONIX No one here can drain it right. 
LYNN Fine. Monix nods, then makes a move toward the door. 
LYNN No. You're not coming in. We'll do it in the yard. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - DAYS LATER 
Jackie drives in his car, practicing for the meeting. tries to build some confidence. 
JACKIE MOON (into the rear view, very 
CIVILIZED) Well, hello Commissioner -- Why sure, I would love one of your Puerto Rican cigars -- Oh, I know I'm a legitimate owner, you don't have to tell me that -- We're merging with the NBA? Oh, that's nice -- Ha Ha Ha! Good one, Commish ... 
EXT. INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS 
A brick building on the outskirts of Indianapolis. A sign says. WELCOME ABA OWNERS. Jackie pulls into the lot and parks. He looks in the mirror one last time. 
JACKIE MOON Your Mom would be proud of you today. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Not-quite-Rich guys surround a large oak table. JACKIE is by far the youngest of the owners. 
COMMISH .I'm sure each of you have heard the rumors. And I'm here to tell you, the rumors are true. The ABA will be merging with the NBA at the end of this season. 
JACKIE MOON 
YES!!! (to an old guy) 
GIVE ME TEN, NORTON! YES!! (fists to the ceiling) 
EVERYONE CAN EAT SHIT! I AM THE 
GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD! 
COMMISH Our league is sold. And the NBA agreed to all of our financial demands! Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense. This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life. 
JACKIE MOON (to himself) You're a real owner. You're in the 
NBA. 
COMMISH Four of our teams will be absorbed into the NBA family, the rest of you will terminate operations. 
JACKIE MOON Exactly! You know it! (now hearing) I'm sorry, wait, what? 
COMMISH The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the Pacers will play in the NBA next year. The rest of us will dissolve. 
JACKIE MOON Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How do I dissolve into the NBA? The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle Jackie. 
JACKIE MOON What's happening? 
COMMISH I'm sorry Jackie. We all know how. emotional you get. We waited until the very last second to tell you. Jackie pounds the table. 
JACKIE MOON No. NO! NO!!! He kicks over his chair... 
THE COMMISH We know you're upset, Jackie. But you'll be very well compensated. 
LOSING OWNER #1 Everyone's agreed to a very large sum. 
JACKIE MOON I don't want a sum! I want my team! (to the losing owners) C'mon you guys, you're not going to just sit here and take the money, are you? They are. 
JACKIE MOON (to winning owners) What do the Spurs have that we don't? 
THE COMMISH A huge fan base. A brand new stadium. A solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives. 
JACKIE MOON Oh, c'mon, that's BULLSHIT! 
COMMISH The NBA is taking four teams, Jackie, there's nothing I can do. Jackie goes quiet, thinking... An epic idea hits him.

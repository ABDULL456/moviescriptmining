IVY Where is this coming from? 
Barbara heads up the porch steps and into -- 
88   INT. THE WESTON HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY                             88 
BARBARA Lot of fish in the sea. Surely you can rule out the one single man in the world you're related to. 
IVY I love the man I'm related to-- 
BARBARA Fuck love, what a crock of shit. People can convince themselves they love a painted rock. 
They find Johnna cooking in the kitchen. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Looks great. What is it? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   125. 88   CONTINUED:                                                    88 
JOHNNA Catfish. 
BARBARA Bottom feeders, my favorite. You're nearly fifty years old, Ivy, you can't go to New York, you'll break a hip. Eat your catfish. 
IVY I have lived in this town, year in and year out, hoping against hope someone would come into my life-- 
BARBARA Don't get all Carson McCullers on me. Now wipe that tragic look off your face and eat some catfish. 
They head into the dining room, find Violet smoking, working on her jigsaw puzzle. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Howdy, Mom. 
VIOLET What's howdy about it? 
BARBARA Look, catfish for lunch.   Johnna! (to Violet) You hungry? 
VIOLET Ivy, you should smile.   Like me. 
Johnna enters from the kitchen. 
BARBARA Mom needs her lunch, please. 
VIOLET I'm not hungry. 
BARBARA You haven't eaten anything today. You didn't eat anything yesterday. 
VIOLET I'm not hungry. 
IVY                                          * Why aren't either of you dressed?                      * "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   126. 88   CONTINUED:                                                     88 
BARBARA                                       * We're dressed. We're not sitting here                   * naked, are we?                                          * 
VIOLET                                      * Yeah...                                                 * 
Johnna reenters with plates, then goes. 
BARBARA Eat. 
VIOLET No. 
BARBARA Eat it.    Mom? Eat it. 
VIOLET No. 
BARBARA Eat it, you fucker.   Eat that catfish. 
VIOLET Go to hell. 
BARBARA That doesn't cut any fucking ice with me. Now eat that fucking fish. 
IVY Mom, I have something to talk to you-- 
BARBARA No you don't. 
IVY Barbara-- 
BARBARA No you don't. Shut up.    Shut the fuck up.

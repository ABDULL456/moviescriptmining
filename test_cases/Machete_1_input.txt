Machete's army of workers stream out from their road warrior chop shop rides. 
Machete dismounts. His army behind him. 
He raises his MACHETE against the sun and his army all raise theirs. 
Big battle sequence as they storm the armory. Knives and guns... a ballet of bullets and blood. 
LUZ arrives in one of the HOT RODS from the chop shop. She has a MACHETE GUN that shoots out Machete blades like a Machine gun. 
A minuteman grabs her from behind, but.. 
He is STABBED in the CALF by Pancho! A METAL HARNESS onhis back holds a sharp KNIFE that he stabs with. 
The minuteman falls, Pancho stabs him in the face. 
Luz leads a gang of her customers into the battle. 
Minutemen and Mexicanos of all walks of life--janitors, gardeners, laborers, gangbangers, etc.--fight it out at the armory. Fighting it out with the implements of their trade-- knives hidden in mops, a weedwhacker attack, etc. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 82. 
A wailing AMBULANCE CRASHES through a gate running down minutemen. DOC FELIX and his sexy NURSE get out and help a wounded Mexican. Doc flicks a SCALPEL at an approaching Goon. 
Machete unveils a Gatling Gun with a special mount that affixes to the front of the chopper. 
Booth scrambles to arm himself, but he's cornered. He tries to take cover behind thugs, but-- 
Machete on the motorcycle with the Gatling Gun mows down Booth, machine gunning him in half. 
Booth looks down at his own white shirt, now stained crimson and ripped to shreds as he falls to the ground in TWO PIECES. 
While the battle between chopshoppers and militia rages on-- 
TORREZ appears with ELEKTRA-- 
TORREZ Machete! 
Machete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in Torrez's control. 
TORREZ (CONT'D) You never learned to stay down, pendejo. I killed you once. I can do it again. 
INT. WAREHOUSE 
Machete skids into the warehouse. Fuel barrels line a far wall. 
Torrez is ready for him. 
TORREZ All roads lead to Hell, eh, Machete? 
Machete squints. Flashes back to the earlier scene. The two images blur into one. 
TORREZ (CONT'D) Most people die in the fire, but you survived, you unlucky bastard. 
MACHETE I was born in the fire. It wasn't luck. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83. 
TORREZ Faith? Yeah, faith got you a good job picking melons. While I bought the world. 
MACHETE What good is it... 
TORREZ. .. for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul? Mark 8:36. I know it better than you Machete. Your father taught it to me, too! 
Torrez ATTACKS Machete 
The two FIGHT with sword and machete. 
Elektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows from the samurai swords. 
One sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety. 
The distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand and slash Torrez across the front. 
On the edge of death Torrez seems to soften.

MARTHA Just that... you ask and I'll answer. 
AGNES Anything? 
MARTHA (smiles) Anything. 
21   INT - NUN'S ROOM - DAY 
The elderly nun looks out the window into the courtyard where Martha and Agnes are walking, then pulls the curtain across. 
22   EXT - COURTYARD - DAY 
Martha and Agnes are walking together. Martha is smoking. 
AGNES What's your real name? 
MARTHA Martha Louise Livingston. 
AGNES Are you married? 
MARTHA No. 
AGNES Would you like to be? 
MARTHA Not at the moment, no. 
AGNES Do you have any children? 
MARTHA No. 
AGNES Would you like some? 
MARTHA I can't have them any more. 
AGNES Why not? 
MARTHA (a pause) I've stopped menstruating 
AGNES Why do you smoke? 
MARTHA Does it bother you? 
AGNES No questions. 
MARTHA Smoking is an    obsession with me. Maybe one day    I'll become obsessed with something    else, then I'll stop smoking... Do    you have any more questions? 
AGNES One. 
MARTHA What? 
They both halt. 
AGNES Where do you think babies come from? 
MARTHA From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know. 
AGNES Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes. 
Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her. 
AGNES (Cont.) Mummy wasn't very happy when she died ... and, I think she went to hell because every time I see her she looks like she just stepped out of a hot shower, and I... I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who tells me things! They fight over me all the time. (staring into space) The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and the sun became a cloud, and the cloud became, a Lady. And she told me she would talk to me. And then... her feet began to bleed and I saw there... there were holes in her hands and in her side. And I tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but I couldn't see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in front of them. And she tells me things like, like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie! ... but I don't know what that means. 
Martha stands up, disturbed. Agnes is slightly delirious with happiness. 
AGNES (Cont.) ... and... she uses me to sing, it's as if she's throwing a big hook through the air and it catches me under my ribs and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't move because Mommy's holding my feet and all I can do is sing in her voice... it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!

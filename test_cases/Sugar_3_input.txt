As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork. But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in particular, who... 
...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     52. 
JACKASS (barely audible) Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle. 
Miguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them, and... 
...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other, though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific. 
Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything serious starts. They all hustle out to... 
102   EXT. BIG MUDDY'S PARKING LOT - NIGHT                              102 
The Latin players spill out into the brisk night air with Brad and the Swing's designated hitter, JEFF ELKS. 
They all pile into Brad's car, as a few locals stand near the club's entrance, watching them go. 
103   EXT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                    103 
The car pulls up near the house and Miguel stumbles out, as the wild bunch inside HOOT and HOLLER. 
The car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out with the hum of the engine. 
An upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins' bedroom where Helen's silhouetted figure lingers in the window. He tiptoes inside. 
The sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in, and carries over to... 
104   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                                 104 
With the exception of Miguel, the all-white congregation sings hymns about Jesus and the Lord. He tries to suppress a yawn when he sees Anne Higgins singing in the choir. She notices him as she sings. A smile. 
Miguel perks up. 
105   EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY                                     105 
CHURCHGOERS flood out of the church after the service.    Anne walks alongside Miguel. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   53. 
ANNE How'd you like the service? (off his blank stare) Our church? Hope it wasn't too boring for you. Did you go to church in the Dominican Republic? 
He shakes his head. 
MIGUEL I am sorry.    I do not understand. 
ANNE S'okay. You understand more than a lot of folks around here I bet. 
He nods, still unsure. 
ANNE So listen, me and some friends   are hanging out later. You should    stop by my house after the game. It's    gonna be super chill. Grandma can take    you there, but here... 
She stops a random CHURCHGOER... 
ANNE Can I borrow a pen real quick? 
The churchgoer hands over a pen, and Anne writes her address on Miguel's forearm. 
ANNE After the game. My house...     Good luck, tonight. 
Anne runs off.   Miguel looks after her, mystified. 
106   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                             106 
Half-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey head under one arm. 
Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.

107   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                    107 
ON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses himself. Play ball. 
Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first pitch high for a ball. 
When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where... 
...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to the field in choice box seats. 
He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch.      Ball two. Same for the third. And forth. 
The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES. 
108   INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH                                        108 
Jack Jefferies does his thing on the mic. 
JACK JEFFERIES Santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. Hailing all the way from the Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the club with his power during Spring Training. But he's off to a rocky start tonight. 
109   ON THE MOUND                                                        109 
Jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first. 
JORGE Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we played back home. That's all it is. Just a game, man. So relax. Let's have some fun. Okay?

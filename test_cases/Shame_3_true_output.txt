DAVID Hah? Come on. How about that? Do it. YOu can do it. Get up. 
SKYPE SON OK. 
DAVID Yeah. 
SKYPE SON Mommy? Mommy? 
DAVID's SON exits the computer screen. David looks up at BRANDON. 
DAVID (LAUGHS) What's up, man? 
BRANDON Well, Steven said you wanted to see me? 
DAVID Yeah. Er, Dude. Nine o'clock this morning, where were you? 
BRANDON Dentist. Root canal. 
DAVID Oh, shit. Now, what did I tell you about that? Who d'you see? 
BRANDON Gary Sher... King's practice, West 57th street. 
DAVID Good. Good. You're stinging that company health care plan, I hope, right? 
BRANDON Sure. 
DAVID That's what it's there for, man. Alright brother. 
BRANDON turns to leave. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Listen, one more thing. 
BRANDON turns back. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Your hard drive is filthy, all right. We got your computer back. I mean, it is, it is, dirty. I'm talking like hoes, sluts, anal, double anal, penetration, inter racial facial, man. Cream pie. I don't even know what that is. 
DAVID (CONT'D) Do you think it was your intern? 
DAVID finally looks up, holds BRANDON's gaze, with discreet challenge until- 
BRANDON (beat) On my hard drive? 
DAVID nods, resumes working- 
DAVID Yeah, someone's fucking with your account, man.And we're blowing our wad in cash, you know? It takes a really really sick fuck to spend all day on that shit. 
BRANDON nods, makes to go. 
From beyond- 
SKYPE SON Daddy...Daddy... 
BRANDON exits. 
DAVID Yeah. Hey buddy, Er, what she say? 
SKYPE SON She said I can go to Jason's for half an hour but I have to be home by five for dinner. 
DAVID OK. That's great. See? Best of both worlds. You got everything you want. 
BRANDON takes this opportunity to leave. 
SKYPE SON Yep. 
DAVID You happy? 
SKYPE SON Yeah. 
DAVID Yeah. You better be. Get out of here. 
SKYPE SON OK. Alright. See you 
DAVID OK. 
DAVID looks up, watches BRANDON heading back to his desk, quietly considering. 
A child's painting stuck to the wall behind DAVID.

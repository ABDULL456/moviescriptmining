He presses forward, backing her up , and closes the door behind him.

INT . VELVE T VI P ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
He shoves past cigar smokers and dancing women . He runs from the VI P room. The partiers watch him go and then turn to look at the bathroom, a drop of blue in the overwhelming redness of the VIP room. Mar y stands in the blue light, still looking at the floor . 
INT. WHITE ROOM -- LATER 
The Whit e Room got its name for obvious reasons . Everythin g is white : the shag carpet, the walls , the overstuffed furniture. Monty sits on a large whit e bea n bag in a corner of the room.

CU T TO : 
EXT . CARL SCHURZ PARK PLAYGROUND -- AFTERNOON 
Springtime. Monty sits on a park bench. This is several years ago , and he looks younger, less exhausted.

CONTINUED : 
He is watching two high school girls on the swings. One blonde -- LINDSAY JAMISON -- and one brunette -- a younger Naturelle . Both girls wear the uniform of their private school: white blouses embroidered with the school's initials and green plaid skirts over black tights. Both girls are smoking. But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette clenched in one hand as she swings higher, Naturelle continues taking reckless drags., the crook of her elbow holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward. Monty stands and approaches the swings. The girls pretend not to notice him. 
MONTY 
Hey! The girls keep swinging. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
Could I bum a smoke? 
NATURELLE 
What? 
MONTY 
A smoke. 
NATURELLE 
This is my last one . Lindsay brakes with her feet and stares at Monty . 
LINDSAY 
I've met you before, haven't I? Monty nods slowly. It's obvious he doesn't recognize her , but he doesn't want to be rude. 
MONTY 
Yeah, you look familiar. Naturelle has stopped swinging now. Lindsay jumps off he r swing. 
LINDSAY 
I know wh o you are . Come on , Nat , we've got practice. 
MONTY 
You know wh o I am? Who am I? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Lindsay picks up her bookbag and strides quickly away, looking back once or twice to see if Naturelle is following. Naturelle is not following. 
MONTY (CONT'D) 
So you're Natalie? 
NATURELLE 
Naturelle. 
MONTY 
Really? Naturelle. I like that. Naturelle. So what's your friend's problem? 
NATURELLE 
You're the one that got thrown out of Campbell-Sawyer, right? 
MONTY 
Yeah, well, lots of people got thrown out of Campbell-Sawyer. How come you didn't follow Blondie to practice? 
NATURELLE 
I want to finish my cigarette. He smiles and sits on the swing next to her. He tries swinging a little. 
MONTY 
I never really got the hang of these things. 
- Â·-- " " NATURELLE  -          --       -- 
It's all in the legs. She starts swinging again and he watches her, her long black hair falling beneath her, her legs straight and then bent, straight and then bent. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE ROOM 
Monty's eyes are still closed. Now he opens them. His hands are in Marguerite's hair, but now they drop by his side. Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders. She backs away from him, looking up at his face for a moment before blinking and licking her lips.

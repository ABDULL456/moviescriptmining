Looks even worse on the inside. A dark corridor is lit by bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. An old PROSTITUTE walks past them, her smile signaling she is open for business. They arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large BLACK MAN. Behind him we can see Lamar with ELLWOOD, 20's, sun glasses, his neck draped in gold chains. 
BLACK GUY (very loud) I'm gonna have to search you. 
DANIEL We'll save you the trouble. 
Daniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from Hadley in his waistband. 
BLACK GUY (loudly) You can't come in here with that. 
Daniel looks past him to Ellwood. 
DANIEL What's wrong with this guy? 
ELLWOOD He's my cousin. He's deaf. 
Daniel removes an envelope full of cash. 
DANIEL We're here to buy, not steal. If you guys are straight there's not going to be a problem. 
Ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor.   The black guy feels the vibration and turns around. 
ELLWOOD Let them in. 
The black guy steps aside.   Daniel and Zero enter. 
INT. BARCLAY HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING 
Ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases displaying a variety of weapons. 
ELLWOOD What can I do you for? 
Daniel looks over the merchandise. 
DANIEL How much for the nines? 
ELLWOOD A grand a piece. 
DANIEL I'll need extra clips and ammo. 
Daniel starts counting out the money. Ellwood points a .357 magnum he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them. 
LAMAR What the hell you doing, Ellwood?   I gave them my word. 
ELLWOOD Zammito's offering twenty grand a head for these guys. You think I'm going to settle for four G's when I can make forty? (to Daniel) All right. Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor. 
Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks it under the bed. 
ELLWOOD I said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed. 
Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each word so he can read his lips. 
ELLWOOD Get that and add it to my inventory. 
The black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for the gun under the bed. As he does Daniel glances over at Zero with a look. Ellwood aims his gun at Zero. 
ELLWOOD I assume you're carrying too? 
Zero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm. 
ELLWOOD Okay, put it on the floor... and do not kick it under the fuckin' bed. 
ZERO (flatly) No. 
He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes. 
ELLWOOD No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy, if you're thinking about makin' a move, don't. Nobody is that fast. 
ZERO Zero is. 
ELLWOOD Who's Zero? 
LAMAR He is. 
Ellwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's forehead. 
Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs after them. 
A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what has transpired in the room. 
BLACK GUY Found it! 
EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING 
Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope. 
DANIEL There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do. 
LAMAR What?

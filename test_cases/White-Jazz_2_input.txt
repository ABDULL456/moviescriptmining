ME -and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures? 
Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting. Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior: 
ME (CONT'D) Take the Quiff home. 
QUIFF My name's Franklin- 
ME -of course it is. 
Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me, and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour... 
ME (CONT'D) I need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it- 
DISKANT -don't say my name... 
PETE He gets it. 
ME Someone from the Times will call for a quote. Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real. 
As Pete and I turn to leave: 
DISKANT (not looking at us) You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. That's Hell. 
A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard. 
14   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NEXT MOMENT                        14 
Pete driving. Silence. Tune to an all-night Jazz signal, turn up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts. Toss Pete his cut. A $500 roll. 
PETE (pocketing the money) Y'know Hughes has a job you're tailor-made for. I already gave him your- 
ME -no thanks. 
PETE Stop pretending you're not a pig for all this, Klein. 
ME I still got a day job, Pete- 
PETE -tossing more Bantamweights out                       * windows? 
I wait too long, answer in too high a voice: 
ME The Mutt jumped. 
PETE (laughs small, then:) Not even the people who don't know you believe that. If somebody from the DA's office decides to dig, you could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on a moment's notice. (beat) C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    * just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him. 
Stop in front of Meg's place. Pete leaves the engine running, jumps out. 
PETE (CONT'D) Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        * It'll be worth it. 
I watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I pass...but it just stays put...idling. 
15   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - MOMENTS LATER             15 
Lights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets. A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz. Sam G.' Exhale. Flip to the same jazz station. Sit. Start another futile fight with sleep. 
The last thing I see before I nod black: my War Trophy, a Japanese Officer's Samurai Sword mounted on my mantle. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
16   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                            16 
Artillery barrages from Hell: Okinawa, 1945. A hate-fueled frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine. 
I dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize Sanderline Johnson: his pieced-together face smiling up. Snap awake. My phone ringing. 1 AM. Rip the phone from the wall:         * 
ME (CONT'D) Klein- 
BRADLEY (O.S.) -you know who Hector Magdalena is? 
ME (as cobwebs clear) ...yeah...Narco's Snitch. 
BRADLEY (O.S.) He's missing. His home was broken into at some point within the last hour. 
ME So send Robbery. 
BRADLEY (O.C.) The only thing taken was him. Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get over there right now. 
ME Why me? 
BRADLEY Call it penance.

JUSTINE I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas when I was eleven. My daddy was in the Air Force. 
HOLDEN I wanna knock open your head and see what's inside. I've had so much pain in my life. I know you have too, I can see it. 
(at the hotel, in bed, probably after they made love) 
JUSTINE Holden gave me two of his stories to read. It's like what a story would be. I was about a boy who was put upon, his mother was cold and selfish, and his father wanted him to play football. Other people didn't get him, especially girls. Then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him. So he starts actin' out, drinkin', and doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end the boy kills himself but jumpin' over abridge. The second story was pretty much the same as the first. Except at the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' a bottle of bug poison. 
JUSTINE Your stories are intense. 
HOLDEN I just wanna leave some kind of legacy. Somethin' great. After that I don't care what happens to me. 
JUSTINE Don't say that. I wish there was a story about me. I don't know who would read it though. 
HOLDEN I would. 
JUSTINE I like this. I like havin' a secret. You gave me a secret Holden. 
HOLDEN Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious. And dark and twisted. 
JUSTINE I'm going to hell, aren't I? 
HOLDEN Yes, you are. 
(she rolls on top of him and they kiss) 
(they exit the hotel and Justine sees a car)

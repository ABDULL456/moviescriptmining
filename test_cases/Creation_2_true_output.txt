DARWIN (in pain) Sir, you are talking like a revolutionary and really... 
HUXLEY It is a revolution. And not before time. (MORE) 
HUXLEY (cont'd) Goodbye to the lot of em - damned bishops and Archbishops with their threats of eternal punishment. 
DARWIN And you'd replace Gods Laws with what. 
HUXLEY The laws of logic. The laws of nature. 
DARWIN Knowing, as we do, that most capital crimes are her everyday practises: Theft, rape, murder, adultery, infanticide.... 
Huxley waves it away 
DARWIN We live in a society bound together by the church. An improbable sort of barque I grant you but at least it floats. You suggest we change all that at a stroke. You wish me to rebuild, plank by plank, the very vessel we are sailing in. 
39   EXT. DOWN HOUSE. DAY.                                        39 
The Coach to London has pulled up outside the front gate. Huxley is aboard. Darwin is talking with the coachman 
Hooker comes down the path in his black coat, carrying his Gladstone bag. 
EMMA Mr Hooker. 
He turns. He has already said his good-byes. 
EMMA I beg you, please don't push him. 
HOOKER No-one can push Charles. You know how fixed he is. Bit of a barnacle himself ... his own words. 
EMMA And if you prize him from his rock he will die. I know you all mean well but.... 
COACHMAN (Impatiently) All aboard! 
Hooker gets aboard. Huxley leans out of a window and waves cheerily to the whey-faced Darwin 
HUXLEY We'll meet again, Mr Darwin 
40   INT. THE LANEWAY. DAY                                         40 
The coach pulls away. 
Looking back though the rear window Hooker sees Emma with the boys clustered around her skirts. 
HUXLEY What did she say to you? 
HOOKER That it was killing him. 
HUXLEY A mighty slow death considering the time he's spent. We'll be dead and buried ourselves if he prevaricates much longer. 
Huxley takes off his spectacles and polishes them, embarrassed by Huxley's directness, inspecting his own conscience in the bevelled glass. 
41   INT. DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT                                    41 
In the darkened study, with his specimens and books all around him, Darwin kneels by the box. 
Steeling himself, he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored there. 
The bulk of it is a single manuscript, accumulated over many years, divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes interleaved. 
The Chapters are headed. Variation under domestication, variation under nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural Selection.... 
A noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin. 
Its Annie, ten years old in her checked dress, as she will always be in his imagination. 
ANNIE Why are you scared? 
DARWIN Like you said. You're in it. 
ANNIE Its only a book, silly. 
He sits there regarding the open box, paralysed by indecision. Annie tenderly smooths his hair, rearranging his collar.

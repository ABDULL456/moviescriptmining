GANDHI Very well. 
And Gandhi does understand it -- as a guiding principle. Never humiliate your enemy. And his tone conveys it. 
SMUTS (a bit surprised) Good. Good. (The bland politician: the compromise.) I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation. (He gestures, implying they'll do what they're told.) I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed. 
GANDHI (waiting for the catch) I congratulate them. 
Smuts does a slight double take, a smile, then the "tough" politician. 
SMUTS But they might also recommend that future Indian immigration be severely restricted -- even stopped. 
He measures Gandhi challengingly, obviously expecting some contest. Gandhi mulls it, then 
GANDHI Immigration was not an issue on which we fought. It would be wrong of us to make it one now that we -- we are in a position of advantage. 
Smuts stares at him... a moment, then 
SMUTS You're an extraordinary man. 
GANDHI (his grin; he brushes at his prison garb) I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment. 
And now Smuts smiles with him. He bends suddenly and signs a group of documents. 
SMUTS I'm ordering the release of all prisoners within the next twenty- four hours. You yourself are free from this moment. 
Gandhi stands, a little uncertain about the sudden change in his status. Smuts signs the last document, then sees Gandhi's doubt -- and misreads it. 
SMUTS Assuming we are in agreement? 
GANDHI Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi. 
SMUTS (confused by his hesitation) All right. Fine. 
GANDHI I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money. 
SMUTS Oh! (He quickly feels in his waistcoat pockets -- and realizes he has no money!) Neither have I. (He reaches forth and touches a buzzer.) I'm awfully sorry. 
The tall civil servant (Daniels) enters. 
SMUTS Daniels, would you lend Mr. Gandhi a shilling for a taxi? 
Daniel stares. 
DANIELS I beg your pardon, sir? 
SMUTS (a second thought) How far will you be going, Mr. Gandhi? 
GANDHI (a mischievous smile) Well -- now that this is settled -- I had thought seriously of going back to India (he faces the startled Daniel) but a shilling will do splendidly for the moment. 
Still a little confused, Daniels reaches in his pocket and produces a shilling. He hands it to Gandhi. 
GANDHI Thank you. (To Smuts) Thank you both for a very enlightening experience. 
He bows slightly and starts out the door. Daniels immediately starts to accompany him, but Gandhi stops. A beat. 
GANDHI (ice) I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels, but I will find my own way out. 
And his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the ignominy of his way in. Daniel bows, and he and Smuts just stare as the uniformed "prisoner" goes out through the grand doors, past the stunned men in the office to the outer doors and on to the grand staircase. The prison guard appears in the doorway, looking off in confusion at Gandhi, then back at the office for guidance. Daniels simply shakes his head "Let him be." 
Finally, when Gandhi has disappeared down the stairs, Daniels turns to Smuts. 
SMUTS (a shake of the head) He's either a great man or a colossal fraud... Either way, I shall be glad to see the last of him. 
THE PIER AT BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Ship's siren, military band... a jubilant crowd on the pier, passengers waving to the receiving crowd. A group of First Class passengers, ninety percent English, look down from the upper deck. 
From their point of view. We see the main section of the pier, a crowd of mostly European civilians on one side. A mass of military on the other: European officers, topees and swagger sticks, Indian cavalry, Gurkha infantry, Sikh lanoers -- turbans, rifles, bugles, an Indian military band -- a showy awe-inspiring display. 
Featuring two Englishmen. First Class passengers, white suits, Oxbridge accents; one quite young, the other a bit older, both civil servants coming to "administer" India. 
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN By God, he loves it... 
Their point of view. A British general is coming down the gangplank accompanied by his ADC. The officer commanding and the Guard of Honor await him. 
SECOND ENGLISHMAN I'm sure he hates it. 
The young Englishman glances at him quizzically. The General has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band. 
SECOND ENGLISHMAN Generals' reputations are being made in France today, fighting on the Western Front. Not as Military Governors in India. 
He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening to their conversation. He glances at him and the well-dressed Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little. The second Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down again. 
SECOND ENGLISHMAN What the devil's going on back there? 
He is looking aft. His point of view. 
Another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft section of the ship. Third Class passengers are disembarking here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier. A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person. 
The young Englishman glances back at the well-dressed Indian to make sure of his distance, then speaks quietly. 
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN It must be that Indian that made all that fuss back in Africa. My cabin boy told me he was on board. 
SECOND ENGLISHMAN Why haven't we seen him? (Finding the name) Gandhi? 
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN Yes. That's it. He was traveling Third Class. There he is. 
Their point of view. 
There has been a little hiatus in those disembarking but now Gandhi has appeared, coming down the gangplank with Ba and the children (grown-up sons now), and three or four people behind them, including the tall figure of Charlie Andrews. But Gandhi is wearing an Indian tunic and sandals and he has shaved his hair except for a central section on the top. 
SECOND ENGLISHMAN'S VOICE-OVER God -- he's dressed like a coolie! I thought he was a lawyer. 
The young Englishman glances back cautiously toward the well- dressed Indian again, then 
YOUNG ENGLISHMAN After he came out of jail he refused to wear European clothes. 
THE PIER - THIRD CLASS AREA - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Gandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist. 
GANDHI No, no, I haven't "refused"... I -- I simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed. 
He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception. An English journalist catches him as he turns.

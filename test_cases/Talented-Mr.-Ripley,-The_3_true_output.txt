RIPLEY He's not a man, he's a god. 
DICKIE (excited) Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar. 
MARGE It's vile. 
DICKIE Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. (to Ripley) It's great.  You're going to love it. 
INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT. 
A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie. An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie up onto the stage. 
FAUSTO (improvising in Italian) Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf, all the way from America... etc. 
Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto. 
FAUSTO (cont'd) And a big round of applause for a new friend from New York - Tom Ripley! 
Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent. 
DICKIE (O/S) (reading) I have bumped into an old friend from Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley. He says he's going to haunt me until I agree to come back to New York with him... 
INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON. 
Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table, typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which he has been enjoying a blissful sleep. 
DICKIE (grins) Good afternoon! 
RIPLEY What time is it? (puts on his glasses and checks his watch) Oh God!  Do you always type your letters? (points at the letter) That should be two Ts. 
DICKIE I can't write and I can't spell.  That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up. 
RIPLEY This is so good of you. 
DICKIE Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad alone, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge...a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money? 
Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis. 
MARGE Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life. 
RIPLEY I absolutely agree with Marge. 
INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY. 
Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom. 
INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY. 
Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries, cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of conversation float up to Ripley. 
DICKIE It'll just be for a little while.  He can be... he makes me laugh. 
MARGE Okay, darling. 
DICKIE You'd say if you mind? 
MARGE No, I like him. 
DICKIE Marge, you like everybody. 
MARGE I don't like you.

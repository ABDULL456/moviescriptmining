THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            58. 89   CONTINUED:                                                 89 CELIA (CONT'D) (rising) So, we'll follow up with your staff in the next week or... TOMMY Wait a minute, you just got here. I clean my calendar, and you're out the door. Let's back up, give this stuff the attention it deserves. Car insurance... Ira, what do you pay? IRA Oh, I've got an '85 Plymouth, about six-fifty a year... TOMMY Six-fifty? Highway robbery! A chop shop wouldn't give you more than a hundred forty for a junker like that. (beat) Or so I've heard. (beat) But I'm flying blind here, I need depth. Could Miss Kirby put together a briefing? Maybe schedule a Saturday or two to really dig into the issues? IRA (surprised and pleased) Oh... we'd be delighted. We've got some figures that will amaze you. TOMMY I'm sure you do. CELIA (rising) Well, we won't take up any more... TOMMY Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about child safety? CELIA Well, we're sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys... (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               59. 89   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              89 TOMMY Great! About time! I     hate imported toys. What about food    additives? How about we block out   a few evenings, you can take   me through the details. IRA Celia, if that's what the Congressman wants... any problem? CELIA (to him) You want to do this in the evening? 
IRA I'm away for the next two weeks. She gives him a look.    Ira turns to Tommy. IRA So, when can Celia start your briefings? TOMMY Saturday night? IRA Saturday night sounds fine. CELIA Fine. Wednesday morning.      Nine- fifteen. 90   INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT - CLOSE ANGLE - A SIGN                 90 
On a door in the House sub-basement:    MEMBERS ONLY. 91   INT. HOUSE GYM - NIGHT                                        91 The regular evening pickup basketball game. Even among these ruthless players, Tommy's street moves are outstand- ingly down and dirty. His principal accomplice: Elijah Marshall. 92   INT. LOCKER ROOM - HOUSE GYM - NIGHT                          92 A standing poker game among the towel- and robe-clad Members. It's Tommy's shuffle and deal.    He is convincingly awkward. A BULLDOG of a man examines his hand, tosses two cards in. He assembles his new hand. Four fives and an ace. (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               60. 92   CONTINUED:                                                    92 ON Tommy's hand.   A pair of threes. The betting starts, at a couple of chips, and comes round to Tommy. He pushes a stack of chips to the center. TOMMY Let's get serious, fellas. 93   INT. CATACOMBS (OR CORRIDOR) - NIGHT                          93 Tommy, Marshall, and the Bulldog, back in suits, exit the MEMBERS ONLY door and move through the catacombs. MARSHALL I need your help on the ethics bill, Leon. I want you to co- sponsor my amendments. BULLDOG You make a persuasive case, Eli. MARSHALL That wasn't a yes. BULLDOG (courteously ambiguous) I promise to give it the attention it deserves. The Bulldog gives Tommy a friendly squeeze -- BULLDOG Better luck next time, son. -- and leaves them.   Tommy and Marshall continue on. 
MARSHALL He took six hundred dollars off you that last hand, didn't he? TOMMY Yeah, he's taking a real shine to me. MARSHALL If I didn't know better, I'd say you lost to him on purpose. TOMMY Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while. (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           60A. 93   CONTINUED:                                              93 MARSHALL (shaking his head) You fit in real well up here.   Too well. TOMMY So Eli, how come you haven't asked for my help with your amendments? MARSHALL Give it a rest, Tommy. You've got a great jump shot. But everyone knows you're Dick Dodge's boy. TOMMY (bristling) I'm nobody's boy, mister. MARSHALL (weary) Don't waste your outrage on me. I know what you are. TOMMY I'm no different from anyone else. MARSHALL That's not true. Some people here actually try to do something besides save their own ass. TOMMY You know, Eli, I like you, I really do. You remind me of my father. MARSHALL Oh, really?   How so? TOMMY He thought I was scum, too. BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause, three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy doesn't follow suit. MARSHALL Aren't you going to vote? TOMMY (indicating clocks) Vote? Is that what that is? We got a pool going in the office on when it'll go off next.

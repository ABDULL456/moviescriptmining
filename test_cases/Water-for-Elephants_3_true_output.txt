AUGUST (CONT'D) ...She won't let me apologize... She won't forgive me. 
Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state. 
AUGUST (CONT'D) I don't know what happens to me, Jacob. When I saw that bull running wild with Marlena, I...I lost my mind. But it's because I love her. Why can't she understand that? (Jacob stands coldly) Isn't there anyone who understands? (Jacob remains silent) Ah, it's all my fault, I know it is. I've spent too much money on that bull. I can't pay the workmen. Our debts are piling. We're losing attendance at every show. I have no Star Attraction. I don't know what's going to happen to us if Rosie doesn't sell tickets. 
(CONFESSES) If I lose this circus, I'll lose Marlena - I know it. Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light. 
JACOB I'm sure that's not true. 
AUGUST Maybe you can talk to her. She's tired of my apologies but, this pressure I'm under...Of course, that's no excuse for what I did... (Rubs the images away) ...I can't believe what I did. Is she all right? The bull. Rosie. 
JACOB She'll be OK. 
AUGUST Would you tell Marlena? And tell her...tell her I'll do anything. Anything she wants. 
JACOB August, I can't... 
(THEN) I'm sure she'll forgive you...She loves you...Anyone can see that. August wants to believe him. He seems more hopeful. 
AUGUST Thank you. My friend. Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits; 
AUGUST (CONT'D) Jacob? Jacob stops and turns back as August asks: 
AUGUST (CONT'D) What were you planning to do with that bull hook? Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook. August smiles. 
AUGUST (CONT'D) Ha. You look like me. Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent man. 
AUGUST (CONT'D) Maybe there is someone who understands me. August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the comparison. Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert; 
EARL What's going on? 
AUGUST Everything's fine, Earl. August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit. 
EXT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT 
Jacob jumps down off the platform. Confused and disgusted, he takes the bull hook, wedges it under the train and breaks it in half. 
INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
Jacob enters to find Greg still treating Rosie. 
JACOB How's she doing? 
GREG Oh she's a strong one, this one. 
(TO ROSIE) Jestes dobra dziewczynka Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment. Jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles. 
JACOB Is she drunk? 
GREG 
(LAUGHS) She's four tons..she'll just sleep good. (Screwing ointment top) Potoz noge. Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground. 
GREG (CONT'D) Masz, moja piekna Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a mint, brushing off the lint. Rosie's trunk investigates, then nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth. 
SUDDENLY, JACOB HAS AN EPIPHANY. 
JACOB Oh my God... 
EXT. MIDWAY - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT 
An excited Jacob is leading August to the menagerie tent. 
INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix himself to Toothless' saddle. 
EXT. SKY/FIELD - DAWN 
Hiccup and Toothless zip through the air -- his rudimentary harness and tail controls are working, barely. They crash- land in an open field. Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the tall grass. Hiccup discovers that it's a patch of âdragon- nip.' Toothless writhes on his back, tongue wagging, in complete bliss. 
EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING 
Hiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pulls a fistful of âdragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkle's nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the knees. Hiccup drops the handful of dragon-nip to the ground. The Gronkle goes down with it, whimpering and blissful. From Gobber and the recruits' point of view, Hiccup is controlling the Gronkle with no more than a limp arm. 
EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON 
The recruits walk home together, surrounding Hiccup and 
BOMBARDING HIM WITH QUESTIONS. 
FISHLEGS Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a Gronkle to that before. 
TUFFNUT How'd you do that? 
RUFFNUT It was really cool. He squirms and invents an excuse. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 48. 
HICCUP I left my axe back in the ring. He turns and hurries back. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) You guys go on ahead and I'll catch up with you. Astrid watches, suspicious. 
EXT. COVE - LATER 
Hiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax and fall over. 
EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER 
An angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other kids look on from the sideline in amazement. 
INT. MEADE HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Hiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving Astrid alone. 
FISHLEGS Hey Hiccup! 
SNOTLOUT What was that? Some kind of trick? What did you do? 
TUFFNUT Hiccup, you're totally going to come in first, there's no question. 
EXT. COVE - LATER 
Hiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of light on the ground. Toothless claws and chases the light patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer. 
EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY 
A beam lifts from the door of another dragon pen. 
GOBBER Meet the Terrible Terror. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 49. A tiny, pint-sized dragon steps out and moves toward the recruits.

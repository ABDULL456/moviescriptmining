The family depart. SOPHIE also goes to leave. 
HARRY Would you mind staying around? 
SOPHIE Of course.

HARRY and SOPHIE sit at SPIROS' side. It is late. HARRY is gently singing Varka Sto Gialo (A Boat in the Harbour) to SPIROS - a traditional Greek song. He is humming the parts he cannot remember. 
HARRY So, he saved me twice. Once in the fire, and once after the banks. I was always embarrassed by him, you know. By his thing that he does. You know, his... 'thing'. But the thing that he does. It's a good thing really. These last few months. This year actually. This whole year. God. What a year. What a year. And yet. I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so engaged. Why is that? I mean why? I mean, I'm frying chips. 
SOPHIE shrugs with smile. 
HARRY (CONT'D) I love him. I've always loved him. And I love my children. I love... I love my life. I love it. Why is that? Why do I love it now? What was wrong with it before? 
SOPHIE It's okay. It's okay. 
HARRY It's a crazy, crazy, world. It's up, it's down. You fight. You win. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED:                                                59 HARRY (CONT'D) You lose. You become exhausted. And then you leave. There's no logic. There's no logic. It's insane. It's insane. The whole thing. 
SPIROS wakes. He rips out the respirator from his mouth. 
HARRY (CONT'D) No, no, no, no. Spiro. 
SOPHIE I'll get someone. 
SOHPIE exits. 
HARRY Spiro mou. Spiro mou. 
SPIROS Ella bethi mou. Ella tho. You have to let me go. It's good. Michael's with us. Michael. O Mihalis. He was always there. Always with us. Always. Three brothers. 
HARRY When I was a little boy. You cooked for me. Every time I came home. They were good times Spiro. Efharisto. 
SPIROS Itan Kali zoi. A good life. Now you understand. Levendis mou. 
SPIROS smiles. He closes his eyes and dies. CUT TO:

Fade from black. Music continues. Close up on HARRY who is sitting by himself. He has just come from the funeral and wears black. We see a hand on his shoulder. As the camera tracks back we see it is KATIE's hand. She is also wearing black. He touches it. He is starring into the distance. KATIE sits next to him. JAMES and THEO appear, also in black, and sit next to KATIE. They stare into the distance. The camera continues to track back towards the entrance of the shop. 
CUT TO: 
61   EXT. THE THREE BROTHERS - ROOF TERRACE. DAY 14.             61 
JAMES and HARRY climb up the stairs to the roof terrace. HARRY stops and stares in disbelief. We cut to HARRY's POV and see a beautiful roof garden packed with plants and life.

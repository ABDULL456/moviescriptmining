Because she's at the station right now, demanding to speak with her. Parsons frowns at this, concerned.        Pete studies him. 
INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY 
Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window         panes to insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits,        seated. The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in.        She sits across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be.        A long beat. 
DOROTHY 
How are you? Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere.         Namely back at the barn and how it connects to Rachel. 
DOROTHY 
I needed to see you, but I'm not sure where to begin. I don't know you well, I certainly have nothing but fond feelings for you. Phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his work and -- in any case, I have always thought of you as a very bright, very perceptive doctor. Even though I don't know you well. She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going. 
DOROTHY 
My point is, my point being -- when Rachel died I had, um, I suffered through these spells, these recurring dreams.

CONTINUED: 
DOROTHY (CONT'D) 
And eventually, once I came to terms with her death, they went away. Losing a child is the hardest, most inconceivable event a mother can -- She drifts off.     Takes a beat to collect herself and resume: 
DOROTHY 
The past few days I have been having the same dream. A nightmare. Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that. 
MIRANDA 
That word.   Nightmare.   Welcome to my life. 
DOROTHY 
This nightmare involves Rachel but it also involves you. In the nightmare Rachel holds a box in her left hand. A small box. And she repeats a series of numbers. Now, Rachel never spoke, from the time she was born -- she had a condition -- I often asked God why he punished this child in such a way -- she couldn't speak, but she was extremely bright. She wasn't autistic as the doctors claimed -- Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her tale. 
MIRANDA 
Mrs. Parsons, you need a therapist. Normally I would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you can see -- Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish.       She pulls out a folded piece of paper. 
DOROTHY 
Every night the same box in her hand and the same numbers. I wrote them down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers are: 
A long beat. 
DOROTHY 
It's a message. It's a code for something. I don't know what. But she wants you to have it. Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a realization. 
MIRANDA 
October 22nd, 2001. It's my wedding date. She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click- clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind this somehow. 
MIRANDA 
That code belongs to a safety deposit box my husband kept in a bank up in Newcastle, that's where his parents live. (beat) Dorothy, I need you to drive up there and open it. Dorothy stares at her, scared.     And finally nods. 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY 
Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS. 
PETE 
We can take those off now. Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Don't push it, Doctor. She's cuffed until your people secure her in a cell. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in. Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of the escort. Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she approaches. 
PETE 
Are you alright? 
MIRANDA 
(quietly) I was wrong. It wasn't Phil Parsons. It was Doug. 
PETE 
Can we talk about this later? (to Sheriff) Thanks, Sheriff. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Tomorrow morning first thing my deputies are here.

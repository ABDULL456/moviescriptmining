She shrugs. 
ELLIOT I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful. 
LEE (laughing) Oh, God. 
ELLIOT (overlapping, chuckling) I think to myself (laughing) what problems could she possibly have? 
LEE (gesturing, laughing) Don't let me get started on my childhood. (stopping in her tracks, remembering) Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore. 
ELLIOT (stopping alongside her) Yes? LEE (overlapping, pointing) A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it. 
ELLIOT Yes? 
LEE (nodding) Yeah, you would. 
ELLIOT (looking around for a moment, then gesturing to Lee) Well, i-if-if you have some free time... 
LEE (nodding) Yeah, sure. (chuckling) 
ELLIOT Thank you. 
They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf- like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books.  A piano playing "Bewitched" is heard.  Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves. 
LEE (offscreen) Isn't this great? (chuckling) They have everything here. 
ELLIOT (offscreen, distracted) Yes, it's-it's wonderful. 
LEE (offscreen) What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT (offscreen) What?  Book? 
LEE (offscreen) Your book?  You wanted to buy a book? 
The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf. 
ELLIOT (offscreen) Oh, book?  Oh, no, I... (laughing) I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh... 
LEE (looking up at a row of books) Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read. 
She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her. 
ELLIOT (offscreen) Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee. 
LEE No, I don't have time. 
Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing.  She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee. 
ELLIOT (gesturing) No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I... 
LEE (offscreen, chuckling) You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay? 
ELLIOT (overlapping) No!  No... 
LEE (offscreen) No? 
ELLIOT (gesturing, looking at books) Uh, yes! 
LEE (offscreen) Yes? 
Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up.  He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row. 
ELLIOT (offscreen momentarily, hidden by a shelf as he talks) Yes. 
LEE (offscreen) Everything's okay? (chuckling) 
ELLIOT Yeah.  How are you? 
LEE (offscreen) I'm...all right. 
ELLIOT (offscreen momentarily, hidden by another shelf as he walks) How-how's Frederick? 
Elliot stops walking to browse through some books. "Bewitched" still plays. 
LEE (offscreen) Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio? 
ELLIOT (turning to talk to the offscreen Lee) Oh, yes.  Who doesn't? (pointing) Look! 
Elliot turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed. 
ELLIOT (pointing to a book on a shelf, continuing) e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this. 
LEE (offscreen, laughing) Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much. 
ELLIOT (pulling the book off the shelf and browsing through it) Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much. 
LEE (offscreen) No, I don't think so. 
ELLIOT (gesturing with the book, looking at the offscreen Lee) I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. (nervously laughing, trying to correct his mistake) A poem of (laughing) his and thought of you last-- (laughing) You'll be fine, though. (chuckling) Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book. 
LEE (overlapping) Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this. 
ELLIOT (overlapping, patting the book) Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this. 
LEE (looking down at the book) Well, sure. 
ELLIOT (overlapping) And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime. 
He hands Lee the book.  She thumbs through it, as the movie cuts to: 
The street outside the bookstore.  Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out. 
LEE (laughing, holding up the bag) Well, thanks a lot. 
ELLIOT (pointing to the bookstore) Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on. 
LEE (nodding) Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time. (stepping closer to the curb and hailing a cab) I know you would. 
ELLIOT (pointing to the book) And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.

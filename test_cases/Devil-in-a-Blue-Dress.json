Texas... \nGIRL Do they have an ocean in Texas? \nEASY The Gulf, they have the Gulf. \nShe leans on the rail next to Easy and he glances over his shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around like they've lost someone. \nEASY I think they're looking for you. \nBARBARA Who cares?

It sounds like a bone breaking, and Barbara starts crying in her sister's arms. \nFOOTBALL (quickly) I'm sorry, sir. \nEasy nods but Albright is not satisfied. \nALBRIGHT The question is: \"Are you sorry enough?\" \nFOOTBALL Yessir. \nALBRIGHT Then prove it...

War hero should have been able to pick 'em off one by one before they got you against the rail. \nEASY I don't kill children. \nFor some reason this is hilarious to Albright.

JOPPY'S BAR - DAY                                         A67 \nA crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place band playing \"Happy Days Are Here Again\"; the second with someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a \"Teran for Mayor\" placard with a man in the front passenger seat announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least, Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American flags. \nEasy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car to watch the parade. Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket. \nHe walks with a purpose into the open door next to the butcher shop. \nB67   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               B67 \nEasy stops in the doorway, seeing \nJOPPY as usual buffing the marble top of his bar. T-Bone Walker's \"They Call It Stormy Monday\" is on the jukebox. \nB67   CONTINUED:                                                    B67 \nBACK TO EASY \nHe scans the bar and sees that there are no customers, and walks in. \nJOPPY Hey, Easy. \nEasy stops at the bar and stares at Joppy. \nEASY That girl called me last night. \nJOPPY What girl is that? \nEASY The one your friend is lookin' for. \nJOPPY Uh, huh.   That's pretty lucky, hunh? \nEASY No, Joppy... Wasn't no luck at all. It was you. \nJoppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices Easy's aggressive stance. \nEASY You and Coretta was the only ones that had my phone number who knew I was lookin' for her. And Coretta was busy scammin' Daphne so she wouldn't have done it... It was you, man. \nJOPPY Maybe she looked in the phone book. \nEASY I ain't in the phone book, Joppy... \nJoppy's eyes narrow. \nJOPPY What the hell you mean, coming up here all mad like you gonna do something?!... \nB67   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              B67 \nEASY (yelling) You damn right! Coretta's dead! Your friend Albright is on my ass. The cops done brought me down once -- Why didn't you just tell Albright your damn self? \nJOPPY (yelling back) What did I tell you? To just take that man's money! I didn't tell you to do nothin'! I call myself trying to help you save your house... Don't come up in here startin' no shit with me. \nAnd he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar, but Easy has pulled his hammer and SMACKS it down hard, cracking the beveled wood that frames the marble. \nJOPPY (continuing; panicked) Easy, wait! Watch my marble! My uncle left me that when he died! \nEASY And goddammit, he's about to get it back. \nHe draws back for the downswing, and Joppy drops the baseball bat, holding up his hands. \nJOPPY Let's talk.   Let's just talk. \nEASY What you got me into, Joppy?! \nJoppy inhales, forcing himself to be calm. \nJOPPY She asked me to help her 'cause I told her that Albright was lookin' for her. And I figured I could help you make a few bucks and throw Albright off the trail too. She wanted to know something about you so I told her... I guess I must've give her your phone number... \nEASY Where is she, man? \nB67   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                B67 \nJOPPY I don't know... \nEASY Don't lie to me, Joppy! \nJOPPY I ain't lyin'... I don't even know her that good. She just asked me to help her. And she asked me not to tell nobody... I guess 'cause of her and Frank Green. \n", "test2_true": "JOPPY I swear I don't know.

Man, she's something else. \nEasy can see \"sucker\" written all over Joppy as he fumbles for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with disgust as he lights up. \nEASY Damn, Joppy. Is there any white woman that ever gave you the time of day that you wasn't a sucker for? \nJoppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar. \n67    EXT. T. CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY                                 67 \nEasy turns into the winding driveway through the stone entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished institution on a bronze plate. \nHe parks the car and gets   out, adjusting his dark brown Stetson which matches his   pin-stripped suit. He looks around at the massive and   well manicured grounds and walks into a patio area of this   Spanish-style complex. \nEASY (V.O.) Albright had said that when you're mixed up in something it's best to be mixed up to the top. I could see his point. So that's where I was going... all the way to the top. \n68   EXT. CARTER FOUNDATION PATIO                                   68 \nAn ELDERLY SECRETARY descends an outdoor curved stairway carrying a file. She spots Easy looking around confused and immediately becomes annoyed. \nSECRETARY May I help you? \nEASY Uh... yes.   I came to see Mr. Carter. \nSECRETARY Do you have an appointment? \nEASY No, I don't. \nSECRETARY Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Carter is a very busy man. \nEasy pulls out Albright's business card and hands it to her. \nEASY Well, tell him Mr. Albright sent me, and it's real important. \nShe looks at the card and then up at Easy with annoyed superiority. \nSECRETARY May I ask the nature of your call, Mister...? \nEASY Rawlins. But I'm not so sure he'd want me to tell you. \nSECRETARY I'm quite sure, Mr. Rawlins, that whatever you know is nothing I can't know as well. \nEASY Okay. Well, anyway, tell him I'm here with information about that little chippy of his that dumped him. \nSECRETARY Is this some sort of joke? \nO.S. VOICE Uh... Excuse me... \n68   CONTINUED:                                                     68 \nEasy and the secretary turn to see a TALL MAN in a dark grey suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in the doorway. He forces a smile and comes out. \nBAXTER Mr. Rawlins was it? \nHe holds out his hand and Easy shakes it. \nEASY Yes.   Mister... \nBAXTER Baxter. (to the secretary) I'll take care of this. (and back to Easy) Why don't you come with me, sir? \nThey walk through the door into \n69   A HALLWAY                                                      69 \nBAXTER Not very smart talking about Mr. Carter's business to a secretary. \nEASY I don't wanna hear it, man. It's too much goin' on for me to give a damn about what you think is smart. \nBaxter bristles up and slows down his walk, about to put Easy in his place. But Easy slows down too and squares up on him. Baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone staircase. \n70   INT. CARTER'S OFFICE                                           70 \nBaxter ushers Easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda overlooking a canyon. \nAlone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside is TODD CARTER. \nBaxter walks out and speaks with Carter, while Easy watches them from inside the office. The rich man perks up with interest and hurries inside with Baxter who throws Easy a dirty look on his way out. He pauses uncertainly wearing a simple Sears Roebuck-looking tan suit with a plain open- collared white shirt. The dark circles under his eyes show nights without sleep. \n70   CONTINUED:                                                    70 \nCARTER Mr. Rawlins. \nHe runs a hand through his thinning red hair, and offers an overstuffed sofa. They sit on either end. \nCARTER (distraught) Has something happened to Daphne? \nEASY The last time I saw her she looked fine. \nCARTER You saw her? \nEASY Yeah.   Last night. \n", "test2_id": 352, "test3_input": "standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium. Carter wanders after Daphne, explaining while she paces back and forth in anger. \nEASY I could tell how it was gonna go when Carter asked us to meet him at the Observatory instead of at his house... She knew it, too. But she had come this far and she had to play it out. \nSuddenly, Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back toward the car. Carter follows behind. \nCARTER Daphne!   Daphne, sweetheart! \nHe starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use. \n130   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                               130 \nShe gets in. \nDAPHNE Come on, Easy.

The sun is coming up over the city below... \nEASY (V.O.) For the first time I felt that I could fall in love with her, too... I was even wondering if it was starting to happen when I dropped her off at 63rd and Dinker where her brother, Frank, was waiting... Then it occurred to me that she still had Carter's money... and I felt like a fool. \n133   INT. CITY HALL                                                 133 \nEasy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching kidney. A secretary comes out to meet him and as she leaves, Todd Carter and a group of men in business suits converge on him, shaking hands. \nEASY (V.O.) Evidently Carter had told all his cronies about the pictures because they were all smiles and handshakes and \"how do ya do\"... The Mayor, the police chief... The newspaper; land developers. All the men who ran the City, and who really stood to gain by who was the Mayor for the next six years. \nThe group fans out leaving Carter and Easy alone to walk off down a hallway. \n134   OMIT                                                           134 \n135   OMIT                                                           135 \n136   INT.

And another thousand which I hope will keep this whole thing... you know. \nEasy nods a tentative \"sure.\" \nCARTER (continuing) And I've taken care of your problems with the police. You'll have no more trouble there. And that's a promise. \nEasy nods and starts to go, but... \nCARTER (continuing; to Easy) Mr. Rawlins... did Daphne ever say... she loved me? \nEasy shrugs, not knowing how to answer. \nEASY Would it really matter if she did, Mr. Carter? \nCarter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely figure amidst all his power. \n137   EXT. CITY HALL - DAY                                          137 \nEasy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the granite steps. \nEASY (V.O.) I'd been thinking about Daphne, too... wondering if she meant what she said about what could have happened between us... But at the moment I was wondering if there was any such thing as a sprained chin. But other than that and a headache, a loose tooth and a kidney that a doctor would need to look at, I felt like five thousand, three hundred dollars... And unless Albright was alive somewhere, that feelin' was gonna last a while. \nO.S.

They come over. \nMILLER You got some mighty powerful friends up there... mighty powerful. But, see, we got a problem. \nEasy listens disinterestedly. \nMILLER (continuing) With the Chief sealing these things up like this, it doesn't do much for the morale of the men who've been working on these cases. \nMASON Yeah.   Makes 'em feel like shit. \nMILLER There's a guy who's been callin' on the phone. And we're pretty sure that he was up there with McGee. \nMASON A... uh... colored guy... sounds kinda dumb... \nMILLER (correcting) Not very bright... But he said you accused him of the murder.

The paper treated the mysterious flip-flop like it happened every day. And I could tell that Matthew Teran wouldn't spend a day in jail... Back in the second section of the paper was a small article about an unidentified man found dead, slumped over the steering wheel of a white Cadillac just north of Malibu... \nFURTHER BACK, we see that Odell is reading the newspaper, nursing a can of ale. \nEASY (V.O.) It scared me to think about a world that could kill a man like DeWitt Albright... What could a world like that do to me? \nODELL Hey, Easy, where's your car? \nEasy looks up from pulling weeds. \n138   CONTINUED:                                                138 \nEASY In the shop...

How you gonna live? \nEASY I'm gonna go to work for myself. Take a little money I got saved up and go into real estate... Start fixin' up folks' gardens again... and do a few favors on the side... Favors for friends. \nODELL What you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'? \nEASY Well, like a woman offered me thirty dollars to go track down her husband for her. \nODELL You talkin' about private investigatin' or somethin'... You could get in trouble doin' that. \nEasy keeps working. \nEASY Like a man once said to me, Odell: 'Walk out your door in the morning and you're already in trouble'... It's just how you're mixed up in that trouble that counts. \nEasy gets up and turns on the water hose. \nEASY (continuing) Odell? \nODELL Yeah, Easy... \n138   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               138 \nEASY If you got a friend that does bad and you still keep him as your friend, even though you know what he's like... Do you think that's right? \nODELL All you got is your friends, Easy... \nEasy starts to nod, but then spots \nTHE WOODCUTTER \nhovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the street, his shears ready to cut. \nEASY (calling out) Get out of that yard! (to Odell) Bastard cut down two of my trees. \nEasy picks up a rock and sails it. Odell comes off the porch and does the same. Then a neighbor from across the street joins in. \nTHE WOODCUTTER ambles off toward another block, leaving Easy, Odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the street. \n139   UP THE BLOCK                                                   139 \na man with a pony is setting up a camera.

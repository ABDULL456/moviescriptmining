He'll pay you whether you see anything or not... If it was me I'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness... Ain't nothin' to worry about. \nEasy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the card. \nEASY (V.O.) When somebody tells me \"Don't worry,\" I usually look down to see if my fly is open... I noticed Albright didn't bother to pay for his drink. \n5   EXT. EASY'S '46 PONTIAC - DAY                                    5 \nLittle single family houses with tiny yards of St. Augustine grass rush toward the amber Indianhead hood ornament on Easy's car. \n6   INT. EASY'S CAR                                                  6 \nDuke Ellington's \"Mood Indigo\" plays on the radio as Easy heads for home in thought. \nEASY (V.O.) (continuing) DeWitt Albright reminded me of somebody I knew back in Houston. His name was Raymond Alexander but we called him Mouse... Mouse called hisself a businessman too. And I found out that I shouldn't be nowhere around when Mouse got down to his business... I learned that the hard way. \nA neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as he slows down in front of his house. \n7   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          7 \nHe gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street. \n7    CONTINUED:                                                       7 \nA MAN with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as he opens his gate. \nWOODCUTTER Want me to knock down some of them trees back there for you? \nEASY (irritated) No... Just leave the trees alone. \nEasy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his African violets in a jar next to the front door. \n8    INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                                8 \nHe walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket onto the sofa. Then moves on through the kitchen and out the back door. \n9    EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                              9 \nHe picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet, watering and admiring his apple, avocado, pomegranate and banana trees as he lights a cigarette. \nEASY (V.O.) I had moved to Los Angeles right after the war with three hundred dollars and the G.I. Bill... And I liked coming home to a place that was mine... According to President Truman I had that comin' to me 'cause I had fought in 'the good war' against Hitler in Europe... But that didn't mean a damn thing to a lotta white folks including the foreman on my job... So, here I was out of work needin' thirty-two dollars to pay the mortgage... That was three days pay on my old job -- and I had about three days to get it. \n10   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT                                    10 \nEasy parks in front of a large Spanish-style building.   He gets out and walks to the black wrought iron entrance. \n11    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                           11 \nEasy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses and vines cascading down from office windows on the second floor. \nA12   INT. OFFICE - NIGHT                                             A12 \nSomeone is watching Easy as he looks for the right office. \n12    EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                           12 \nA small white MAN pops out from behind a hedge startling Easy. He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform. \nSECURITY GUARD What are you doing here? \nEASY I'm looking for, uh... \nSECURITY GUARD We only take deliveries between nine and six... \nEASY No, no... I... \nSECURITY GUARD Yes, we do!   Now you'd better leave. \nHe clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open palm. \nEASY Uh... Albright! \nSECURITY GUARD What? \nEASY I'm here to see Mr. Albright. DeWitt Albright! \nSECURITY GUARD Where's your delivery? \nHe holds out his scrawny hand. \nEASY I have an appointment -- I'm supposed to meet him. \n12   CONTINUED:                                                     12 \nSECURITY GUARD Did he give you a note to come in here after hours? \nEasy only stares, hating this little man. \nSECURITY GUARD Well, did he?   Because if he didn't-- \nHe pushes a newspaper across the desk to Easy and Easy holds it up. \nNEWSPAPER \nIt's the front page with the photograph of the wealthy Todd Carter and his beautiful bride-to-be... Despite her smile, there's a sadness in the eyes. \nALBRIGHT (O.S.) Daphne Monet... fianc\u00e9e of Todd Carter, one of the richest men in town... Been gone for two weeks... \nBACK TO SCENE \nEASY She leave him? \nALBRIGHT Evidently... You know how it is with women, Easy... Happens to the best of us... \nHe rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of recognition. \nEASY I ain't never heard of her before. I wouldn't know how to find a woman like that. \nALBRIGHT That's a shame. \nHe laughs a conspiratorial, lecher's laugh and Easy allows a smile. \n16   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                16 \nALBRIGHT See, Daphne has a predilection for the company of Negroes. She likes jazz and pigs feet and dark meat, know what I mean. \nThe insult takes Easy off guard but he should've known. \nEASY So you think she might be down in Watts. \nALBRIGHT I'm sure of it. But I can't go looking for her myself because I'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak. I've been asking Joppy for over a week, but all he could do was introduce me to you. \nEASY What do you want me to do? \nALBRIGHT Just get a location on her. Mr. Carter wants to make up with her... \nEASY That's all. \nALBRIGHT (smiling) That's all. \nHe pulls out a brown secretary-type wallet and counts out 10 ten-dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey. \nALBRIGHT One hundred dollars, and I pay in advance. \nEasy eyes the money.   All he has to do is pick it up. \nEASY I just have to tell you where she is? \nALBRIGHT That's right. And keep it, you know, confidential... \nHe freshens Easy's drink and Easy eyes the money some more. \n16   CONTINUED:   (4)                                               16 \nALBRIGHT Joppy tells me you used to frequent an illegal club down on Eighty- ninth and Central. Somebody saw Daphne there a few nights ago. You could start tonight. \nEasy takes a drink and looks again at the money. \n17   EXT. JOHN'S PLACE (MARKET) - NIGHT                             17 \nStripped down to its dark, naked self, Central Avenue has drawn a crowd from all over town. Neon glistens off slick pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh. \nAn outrage to police even before the era of Police Chief Parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for something -- anything -- because his date is a young white woman. A few onlookers stand back watching, but since this white woman is not Daphne Monet, Easy only glances and walks inside. \n18   INT. JOHN'S BAR                                                18 \nEasy sees his fifth white MAN that day in a disheveled but expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him, reeking of gin. \nDRUNK Hey, colored brother. I need you to do somethin' for me-- \nO.S. WOMAN'S VOICE Go on. What'd I tell you about hair-assing my customers. \nEasy looks over to see HATTIE PARSONS, the small, brown- skinned manager of the place, glaring daggers at the drunk man while watching the commotion out the window. \nEasy starts over toward Hattie and the drunk turns and tries to grab Easy's arm. But his desperation causes him to trip and he winds up sitting against the wall. \nEasy steps over him and joins Hattie at the window. \nHATTIE I just paid these damn cops and they still roustin' my customers. Well, that's what he gets for being with that white woman. \n18   CONTINUED:                                                     18 \nShe walks over to the cash register of this neighborhood corner store; and Easy follows, the drunk beckoning him to bend down to talk as he passes. \nDRUNK Come on, brother help me... \nHATTIE Don't worry 'bout him. I rung Junior ten minutes ago to come get him. \nEasy pulls out two dollars and Hattie deposits them into the till. \nHATTIE I ain't got nobody tonight but Lips and his trio -- Holiday came through here last Tuesday. \nEASY Yeah? \nFinally, Easy spots a fifty-year-old MAN in an old grey tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself. Looking like the God fearing, all fearing Baptist deacon that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of barbecued ribs. \nEasy leans over the counter to the bartender. \nEASY Hey, Lewis. Gimme a couple glasses and a pail of ice and send a quart of bourbon over there to Odell's table. \nLewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto the bar with two short glasses. \nEasy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up over to the corner as he watches... \nTHE BAND \nburn it up. \nBACK TO SCENE \nEasy stops at Odell's table. \nEASY Hey, Odell. \nODELL Easy. \nEASY How's it going tonight? \nOdell doesn't miss a bite as he scopes the crowd. \n20   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               20 \nODELL (slowly) Well... It's goin' alright.   It sure is goin'. \nO.S. VOICE Easy Rawlins, is that you? \nEasy looks up to see \nDUPREE, a big black man with a wide white grin in a white suite with blue pinstripes and a ten-gallon hat. \nDUPREE You ain't jumped outta no windows yet? \nEASY Not yet, Dupree. \nDUPREE Miss you down at the plant... You know Coretta, don't ya? \nHe has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy smile. Short and roundish with cherry-brown skin, she leads with her bosom. \nEASY Hey, Coretta, how are ya? \nCoretta rests her sloe-eyes on Easy and Odell and the church going man almost chokes. \nODELL Oh, my goodness. \nCORETTA Could we sit down with y'all? \nEASY Sure.   Sure. \nDupree and Coretta settle in. \nDUPREE You know Benny just wants you to say you're sorry, Easy. And he'll give you your job back. \nEASY I'm a sorry man, all right. Any man without his paycheck is sorry. \n20   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 20 \nDupree laughs, smacking the table so hard it rattles like an earthquake. And Coretta's smile ignites like a slow fuse causing Easy to feel it all the way down his spine. \nA man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a quart of Old Crow from his overcoat and sits it on the table. \nEasy reaches for his wallet but Dupree beats him to it. \nDUPREE I got it, Easy. Your money ain't no good up in here. \nEASY Naw, Dupree.    This one's mine-- \nDUPREE You sure?   You the one outta work. \nCoretta frowns at Dupree as Easy counts out three dollars. \nCORETTA And you're the one ain't never got no money. \nDUPREE Aw, Baby... (to bootlegger) Get us another couple glasses. \nAnd he peels off a dollar and hands it off. \nEASY Either one of y'all seen a white girl named Dahlia or somethin' with a 'D'? \nOdell shakes his head \"no,\" and Coretta looks away as if insulted leaving silence until \nDUPREE Hey, Coretta got a new job at the phone company. \nHe squeezes his woman in close and Coretta softens up and burns that smile again. \nEasy grins and nods \"congratulations.\" \n21   THE BOTTLE                                                       21 \nCORETTA Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my spot! Oh yeah... yeah! \nThe top of her dress undone, Coretta is straddling Easy who is hitting her spot and his too, in a rhythm. Eyes closed, he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to awaken Dupree, who is sawing logs -- shredding 'em -- in the bedroom. \nSuddenly Coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on his knees. Easy writhes and shakes like a power line shorting out. \nCORETTA (coy, shy) Oooh, that's just too good, Easy. \nEasy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the floor. \nCORETTA I can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is. \n24   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               24 \nEASY (out loud) What things? \nShe shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the bedroom. \nCORETTA You know, Dupree's right there in the next room. \nEASY (full voice) Forget about him! You got me goin', Coretta! \nCoretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses. \nCORETTA But it ain't right, Easy. Here I am doin' this right in the next room and all you doin' is nosin' after my friend Daphne... \nEASY Daphne? (and then remembers) Oh, yeah... I ain't after her, baby. That's just a job. \nCORETTA What job? \nEASY Man wants me to find her. \nCORETTA What man? \nEASY Who cares, what man?   I don't want nobody but you... \nHe pulls her toward him but she pushes him away. \nCORETTA But Daphne's my friend-- \nFrustrated, he sits back against the sofa and Coretta, sensing that he is snapping out of her spell, slides forward onto him giving him her spot again. And within moments they are back at it. \n24   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 24 \nCORETTA Oh, baby. Oh, daddy, you hittin' my spot! Oh, yeah... \nEASY (V.O.) I went on hittin' her spot until just before sun-up. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n25   EXT. CORETTA'S HOUSE - DAWN                                      25 \nThe sky is light purple as Easy stumbles down Coretta's porch. She waves half-heartedly and closes the door as he straightens his clothes and looks around for any \"witnesses\" on his way to his car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n26   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          26 \nEasy's Pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out. \nEASY (V.O.) It occurred to me that Coretta had found out a lot more about what I was up to than I had wanted her to. But I had found out that the rich man's woman had a colored boyfriend... It had cost me a sawbuck to get Coretta to give me that information... Well, let's just say somethin' had cost me ten dollars. \n27   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER                              27 \nGolden morning light streams in through the window. Outside, a dog is barking at a bird on the fence. \nCoffee percolates on the stove and Easy walks over and pours himself a cup. He moves to the breakfast table and sits down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens up a blue envelope in a stack of mail. \nGradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up, his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading aloud. \nEASY \"Since Etta Mae has left me and I am a bachelor I figured I could come out and visit and we burn down the town... (MORE) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                    27 \nEASY (CONT'D) Write me and tell me when's a good time.\" (looks up) Aw shit. \n28   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                       28 \nEasy waters his lawn in deep thought. \nEASY (V.O.) The letter from Mouse was worrying me in more ways than one... All I had to do was call Albright to earn the hundred dollars I already had in my pocket... But the last time I got money that easy I got it from Mouse -- fifty dollars -- And the next day I had to join the Army to leave town. \nFLASHBACK: \n29   INT. STOLEN CAR - NIGHT                                       29 \nA younger Easy is driving, his hair greased up high in a pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip. \nA man in a wide brim Homburg hat looks away out the passenger window. \nMAN Drive to the trainyard, Easy! Let's dump this damn thing. \nEASY (suddenly alarmed) This ain't your friend's car? What'd you do Mouse? \nHe nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the water, hoping she'll leave. \nGIRL It's pretty out here, huh? \nEASY Yeah.   It's all right. \nGIRL I'm from Des Moines in Iowa.    Where are you from? \nEASY (without looking back) Huh?... Uh... Texas... \nGIRL Do they have an ocean in Texas? \nEASY The Gulf, they have the Gulf. \nShe leans on the rail next to Easy and he glances over his shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around like they've lost someone. \nEASY I think they're looking for you. \nBARBARA Who cares? My sister brought me 'cause my parents made her. All she wants to do is make out with Herman and smoke cigarettes. \nPIMPLY-FACED BOY Hey, you!   What are you doing? \nThe five-foot-six-inch twenty-year-old charges straight up to Easy. \n35   CONTINUED:                                                       35 \nBARBARA (yelling) Leave him alone, Herman!   We were just talking! \nHERMAN You were, huh? (to Easy) We don't need you talking to our women. \nEasy braces himself as five of Herman's FRIENDS rush over, including one built like a football player. \nFOOTBALL Hey!   What's wrong? \nHERMAN Nigger's trying to pick up Barbara. \nBARBARA Leave him alone! We were just talking about the ocean! \nBARBARA'S SISTER Barbara! \nFootball gets right in Easy's face. \nFOOTBALL Hey, fella, what's wrong with you? \nA couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are surrounding Easy against the rail. \nEASY I don't want no trouble. \nFOOTBALL You already got trouble, boy. \nEASY Listen... I was just being polite. \nHERMAN No, you weren't. You were talkin' about the ocean! \nO.S. VOICE Excuse me. \nEasy sees Albright's Panama hat appear behind Football. \n35   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 35 \nFOOTBALL What do you want? \nAnd he whirls around to Albright's smiling face, just in time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his coat, leveling it at his eyes. \nALBRIGHT I want to see brains.    I want you to die for me. \nAlbright cocks the hammer. It sounds like a bone breaking, and Barbara starts crying in her sister's arms. \nFOOTBALL (quickly) I'm sorry, sir. \nEasy nods but Albright is not satisfied. \nALBRIGHT The question is: \"Are you sorry enough?\" \nFOOTBALL Yessir. \nALBRIGHT Then prove it... Show him... Get down on your knees and suck his peter. \nFootball starts crying. \nEASY (to Albright) I think he got the point-- \nALBRIGHT (to Football) You heard me. \nHe presses the barrel to the boy's forehead and Football goes down to his knees. The other young men look on in horror. \nALBRIGHT Son of a gun. You were gonna do it, weren't you? \nTHUNK! He slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of the boy's head. Football screams and the others scatter. \n35   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 35 \nALBRIGHT Sick bastard. \nAnd he takes Easy by the arm. \nEASY You arresting me? \nMASON You'll see. \nAnd he starts pulling Easy toward the street. \nEASY I got a right to know why you're taking-- \n37   CONTINUED:                                                      37 \nWHOMP! Easy takes one to the diaphragm, and as he doubles over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his back. \nMASON You got a right to fall down and break your face, nigger. You got a right to die. \nThe two cops drag Easy to the car and dump him into the back seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away. \n38   INT. POLICE STATION                                             38 \nEasy's head sags down as he's dragged through the front door past blurred blue bodies that talk. \nPOLICEMAN (O.S.) You got 'im, huh, Miller? \nMILLER (O.S.) Yeah, we got him coming home. Nothing on 'im. \nA door opens and Easy finds himself being flung inside. \n39   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM                                         39 \nOn his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a single, bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum floor. \nHe crawls to one of the urine-stained corners, and looks down on a dry, flat corpse of a mouse. He pushes his shoulder against the unpainted plaster until he's standing and then stumbles over to the chair and sits. He looks up at the bare pipes that run along the ceiling, dripping water, and at a window with criss-cross chairs instead of glass framing, overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in. \nTHE DOOR opens and Miller comes in first carrying a notebook. \nMILLER Ezekiel Rawlins. \nEASY Yes, sir. \nMason follows and closes the door. \nMILLER We can take off the cuffs if you wanna cooperate. \n39   CONTINUED:                                                     39 \nEASY I'm cooperating. \nMiller motions to Mason and he removes the cuffs. \nMILLER Where were you this morning at about five A.M.? \nEASY (stalling) What do you mean? \nMASON He means-- \nHe plants his foot in Easy's chest and pushes him over backwards. \nMASON --this morning. \nEasy has caught himself and stands back up. \nEASY I don't know... I was out drinkin' and I helped carry a friend home. I could've been on my way home... I don't know... I didn't look at a clock... \nMASON (wandering over) He didn't look at a clock. \nWHOCK! Easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep his balance, wiping away blood streaming down. \nMILLER You were drinkin' down on Eighty- ninth and Central... At an illegal club called John's, weren't you? \nMason moves again but this time Easy turns to face him and the fat man looks back with an innocent face, his palms turned up. \nMILLER You may as well answer 'cause you got bigger troubles than us bustin' an illegal bar, Ezekiel. \nEASY What do you mean?    What's goin' on? \n39   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              39 \nMason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the palm of his hand. \nMASON Means we can take your black ass out behind the station and put a bullet in your head. \nMILLER Now. What time did you leave Coretta James' house this morning? \nEASY I guess about five... five- thirty... \nMiller and Mason glance at each other, and Mason kicks the chair over toward Easy. \nMASON Sit down. \nEASY Why, I'm gonna sit down and you keep trying to knock me down? \nBut he sits down anyway. \nEasy starts to make another move to escape but: \nCHAUFFEUR (continuing) Come on. If we wanted to hurt you it would have already happened... \nHe opens the back door and after a few moments, Easy gets in. \n42   INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                                          42 \nEasy settles into the seat with his back to the driver. \nEdith Piaf's \"Parles Moi D'Amour\" adds sugar to the strong smell of cologne and the portly form of Matthew Teran sits across from him with a small MEXICAN BOY in pajamas seated next to him holding a small elephant. \nTERAN I can see that the police roughed you up a bit... That's a terrible practice of theirs which has to change, Mr. Rawlins... Has to change. \nHe opens his gold cigarette case and offers Easy a cigarette. Easy accepts and Teran lights them both up. \nTERAN (continuing) She was beaten. And died from a heavy blow to the back of the head, Mr. Rawlins. \nEasy begins to feel nauseous. \nTERAN The evening's events have caught my adopted son and I quite off guard... My household was asleep when we got the call that the police had a suspect in Coretta James' murder... Did you know that she was a friend of mine, Mr. Rawlins!? \nEASY No I didn't, Mr. Teran. \n42   CONTINUED:                                                    42 \nTERAN Oh, you know who I am? \nEASY I read the papers.   You're runnin' for mayor. \nTERAN (correcting) I am the next mayor, Mr. Rawlins... And luckily for you, a friend of the Negro... When I arrived at the station I knew right off that you were being improperly detained as is Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree Brouchard. It's this sort of thing that my administration will not tolerate, Mr. Rawlins. Absolutely will not... \nHe sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod of assurance and awaits Easy's gratitude... Then after a moment... \nTERAN (continuing) Yes... Coretta answered phones for a while in my campaign office on 103rd and Western. In fact my people got her a job in the phone company. So when I heard what had happened I got out of bed immediately, personally because of my concern... Was anyone there with you Mr. Rawlins besides Mr. Dupree Brouchard?... Any... other friends of Coretta's? \nEASY No, sir... \nTERAN No young lady perhaps? \nEASY Nobody... \nTERAN Of course not, Mr. Rawlins. And why should you tell a man whom you've only just met. But, believe me, Mr. Rawlins. You can trust me. \n42   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 42 \nEASY (shrugging) There was no one else. \nTeran's face sags with disappointment and then... \nTERAN Well don't worry, Mr. Rawlins... I won't tolerate your being harassed... You or any of my constituency -- I was a city councilman in the Watts area for two terms with a large contingent of colored -- I value all of my supporters equally... humble though they may be -- where can we drop you, Mr. Rawlins? \nEASY You can let me out here. \nTERAN Are you sure, Mr. Rawlins? This must be quite out of your way. \nEASY It's okay. \nThe little boy stares up at Easy through big, dark almond- shaped eyes in the silence that follows. And then, Teran picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head. \nTERAN Norman, pull the car over. \n43   EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT                                      43 \nThe limousine stops and Easy pushes the door open and gets out. \nTERAN Mr. Rawlins, may I offer you cab fare? \nTeran's stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills. \nEASY No thanks. \nEasy closes the door and watches the long Cadillac glide away. \n43   CONTINUED:                                                      43 \nEASY (V.O.) There had been nights during the war that I still had trouble claiming as part of my life... Insane nights I wasn't sure ever really happened. And here I was again... Had I really just gotten out of a rich man's car who was runnin' for mayor?.. Running against the man I was supposed to be working for... Was he really lookin' for the same woman I was trying to find? My ear was killin' me and the buses had stopped running. And I was feeling sick... Sick from wondering if I had really hard that Coretta was dead. \n44   INT. EASY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM                                     44 \nThe room is a mess; trousers strewn here, shirt and shoes over there. And from the corners are haunting, ghostly whispers. \nCORETTA'S VOICE You be sorry if you go... (heavy breathing) I can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is. \nA PINT OF BOURBON, 3/4 full, sits atop the cherry wood nightstand. Another empty bottle lies next to it on its side, in front of a water glass with 1/2 inch of liquor at the bottom. \nEASY'S HEAD rests on a pillow on the bed behind it, sweating, tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder. \nCORETTA'S VOICE Oh yeah, daddy. You hittin' my spot... Oh yeah... oh yeah... \nThe voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear. \nCORETTA'S VOICE Oh, that's just too good, Easy.   Oh daddy... oh yeah... \nEASY Uh... yeah... Guess I have. But you got a boyfriend I don't want no part of... Frank Green. \nShe lights a cigarette. \nDAPHNE You can stop pretending, Mr. Rawlins. I know someone hired you to look for me. In fact I had to pay Coretta not to tell you where I was... you know how Coretta is... (forces a weak smile) She told me you two became 'good friends' yesterday... (tears gather in her eyes) I talked to her this morning before she died. (regaining control) I... uh... need to go across town to see someone. It's very important... I can't seem to reach him by phone. I'm afraid I'd better have someone go with me. \n48   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 48 \nEASY Uh... Miss Monet-- \nDAPHNE Call me Daphne. \nEASY Daphne-- \nDAPHNE I can understand why you'd be nervous... because I threatened you with Coretta... I'm very sorry, but I couldn't think of any other way to get you to come. \nShe takes another drink and stubs out her cigarette though it's less than a third gone. \nEASY I can't -- why don't you ask Frank? \nShe gets up and starts to pace nervously about the room. \nDAPHNE He's out of town -- I... I'm willing to pay you. \nEASY That's nice of you but, see, I'm not really a detective-- \nDAPHNE --I know that. \nEASY I was just hired to ask around to try to find you for a man-- \nDAPHNE I know all about that, Mr. Rawlins. \nEASY But this is a gettin' a little out of hand-- \nDAPHNE --Mr. Rawlins-- \nEASY --Easy. \n48   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                48 \nDAPHNE Easy... If you don't help me, then I'll call the police and tell them that you were with Coretta before she died and that you've been after me too. \nThat stops Easy. \nEASY You'd do that? \nDAPHNE Yes, I would.    I don't want to but I would. \nShe hates herself for threatening and decides to change direction, moving in close. \nDAPHNE Please let me pay you. \nEASY No.    I can't do that. \nDAPHNE Why? \nEASY I don't want no part of all this. \nDAPHNE Please, I'll pay you twenty dollars. \nEASY No dice. \nDAPHNE Thirty... or even more.    Name your price. \nShe moves in closer, massaging with her voice. \nDAPHNE (continuing) Go ahead. There's gotta be something that you want. \nHer eyes make an offer, but he's a better man than me and he's not taking. \n48   CONTINUED:   (4)                                               48 \nDAPHNE (angrily, sarcastically) What? Are you afraid I'll yell rape or something? \nShe walks away and turns up her glass, her desperation, raw, unguarded. \nEASY Uh, Miss Monet... Daphne, I'm sorry but I really better be goin'. \nHe starts out and she runs to stop him. \nDAPHNE Easy, don't touch that door-- \nHe opens it and \nSCREAM!   Like an alarm, she's SHRIEKING all of the scale. \n49   He looks out and sees                                          49 \nLIGHTS GOING ON in other rooms. \n50   BACK TO SCENE                                                  50 \nHe looks back frantically and grabs her by the shoulders. \nAnother wall of glass and \nA DEAD MAN spread out on the king-sized bed, with the contents of the dresser and closet strewn all over the room. \nDAPHNE Oh, my God! \nShe gags and backs out of the room with her hand over her mouth in case she throws up. \nEasy takes out a handkerchief and holds it over his mouth and nose as he gets a closer look at the body. \nIt's the drunk white man he had seen at John's Speakeasy in the same blue suit. He's lying on his back like a crucifix with a butcher knife buried in his chest. There's blood that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like Jello. \nEasy actually does throw up and doubles over, dropping to a knee to keep his balance and some control. He stays there for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt. He lifts it off the floor and smells it. He wipes his mouth with the handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in his pocket. He gets up. \nEASY Daphne! \nHe hears a CAR ENGINE start up and GEARS SHIFTING.     Then runs out the door. \n58   EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       58 \nA pink Studebaker whips backward out the driveway. Easy runs alongside trying to stop Daphne as she screeches into the street. \nEASY Hey, wait a minute! \nShe speeds off down the canyon. \nEASY Dammit! \nHe stands in the middle of the street, watching her go. \n59   INT. EASY'S CAR - SUNRISE                                          59 \nFiery orange light bounces off the hood of the car into Easy's face as he turns the corner onto his block. He is surprised to see \nA WHITE CADILLAC parked in front of his house.      And now it's his front door that's open. \nBACK TO EASY \nHe pulls in behind the Caddy and gets out. \n60   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                                  60 \nHe pushes open the door. Shariff loiters just inside, grinning at him, and Manny stands in the middle of the living room looking at the floor. From a RADIO in another room Tommy Dorsey plays \"Blue Skies\" with Frank Sinatra out front. And so Easy walks past the two hoods into \nTHE KITCHEN \nAlbright turns from looking out the backyard window with a porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand. \nALBRIGHT Easy. \nEasy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at Albright, smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in the same clothes he had on at the pier. \nEASY What you doin' in my house, man? \nALBRIGHT I expected you to be home, so Manny used a screwdriver on the door. What happened to your face? \n60   CONTINUED:                                                      60 \nEASY You got no excuse to be breakin' into my house -- What if I broke into your place? \nALBRIGHT (still smiling) I'd tear your nigger head out by its root. \nEasy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour himself a cup of coffee. \nEASY So what do you want? \nALBRIGHT Where have you been this time of morning, Easy? \nEASY I went to see a girl. Don't you get none, Mr. Albright? \nThe smile leaves Albright's face and his eyes turn even colder. \nALBRIGHT I didn't come here to play, boy. You got my money in your pocket and we've been over at that address waitin' all night for Frank Green and now we've found out that he moved from there over a year ago. \nEasy is scared and confused but he plays it off. \nEASY So what do you want me to do about it? You don't think I did my job. Shit, I give you the money back. \nAnd he reaches for his pocket, but Albright reaches too -- and suddenly, Manny and Shariff are in the room and on Easy like a vice. Albright presses the barrel of the .45 against Easy's forehead. \nALBRIGHT Do you believe in God, Easy? 'Cause I'm curious to see if death is any different for a religious man. \nEasy looks down, away from the gun, and swallows hard. \n60   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                60 \nEASY I seen her. \nAfter a moment, everyone relaxes and Easy sags out from under their grip and staggers into \n61   THE LIVING ROOM                                                 61 \nManny and Shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair and Albright stalks in holstering his gun. \nHe dials the operator. \nEASY (V.O.) I needed help... Albright didn't flinch at hearing that Coretta was dead and he seemed to know all about Richard McGee too... \nOPERATOR (O.S.) Number please... \nEASY Raymond Alexander on... \nHe pauses, speechless as \nOPERATOR (O.S.) Yes? \nEASY (after a moment) Forget about it, operator. \nHe hangs up, his eyes trained in thought. \nA67   EXT. JOPPY'S BAR - DAY                                         A67 \nA crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place band playing \"Happy Days Are Here Again\"; the second with someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a \"Teran for Mayor\" placard with a man in the front passenger seat announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least, Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American flags. \nEasy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car to watch the parade. Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket. \nHe walks with a purpose into the open door next to the butcher shop. \nB67   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                               B67 \nEasy stops in the doorway, seeing \nJOPPY as usual buffing the marble top of his bar. T-Bone Walker's \"They Call It Stormy Monday\" is on the jukebox. \nB67   CONTINUED:                                                    B67 \nBACK TO EASY \nHe scans the bar and sees that there are no customers, and walks in. \nJOPPY Hey, Easy. \nEasy stops at the bar and stares at Joppy. \nEASY That girl called me last night. \nJOPPY What girl is that? \nEASY The one your friend is lookin' for. \nJOPPY Uh, huh.   That's pretty lucky, hunh? \nEASY No, Joppy... Wasn't no luck at all. It was you. \nJoppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices Easy's aggressive stance. \nEASY You and Coretta was the only ones that had my phone number who knew I was lookin' for her. And Coretta was busy scammin' Daphne so she wouldn't have done it... It was you, man. \nJOPPY Maybe she looked in the phone book. \nEASY I ain't in the phone book, Joppy... \nJoppy's eyes narrow. \nJOPPY What the hell you mean, coming up here all mad like you gonna do something?!... \nB67   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              B67 \nEASY (yelling) You damn right! Coretta's dead! Your friend Albright is on my ass. The cops done brought me down once -- Why didn't you just tell Albright your damn self? \nJOPPY (yelling back) What did I tell you? To just take that man's money! I didn't tell you to do nothin'! I call myself trying to help you save your house... Don't come up in here startin' no shit with me. \nAnd he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar, but Easy has pulled his hammer and SMACKS it down hard, cracking the beveled wood that frames the marble. \nJOPPY (continuing; panicked) Easy, wait! Watch my marble! My uncle left me that when he died! \nEASY And goddammit, he's about to get it back. \nHe draws back for the downswing, and Joppy drops the baseball bat, holding up his hands. \nJOPPY Let's talk.   Let's just talk. \nEASY What you got me into, Joppy?! \nJoppy inhales, forcing himself to be calm. \nJOPPY She asked me to help her 'cause I told her that Albright was lookin' for her. And I figured I could help you make a few bucks and throw Albright off the trail too. She wanted to know something about you so I told her... I guess I must've give her your phone number... \nEASY Where is she, man? \nB67   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                B67 \nJOPPY I don't know... \nEASY Don't lie to me, Joppy! \nJOPPY I ain't lyin'... I don't even know her that good. She just asked me to help her. And she asked me not to tell nobody... I guess 'cause of her and Frank Green. \nCARTER She's still in town? \nEASY She was last night. \nCARTER What did she say -- what was she wearing? \nEASY A blue dress.    Blue heels. \nCARTER And a pin on her chest? \nEASY Yeah, on the left side. \nCARTER (carried away) Oh yes, that's her. That's her. You know I've never known a woman who could wear perfume so slight that-- \nEASY --Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter-- \nCARTER What did she say? What did she say?... Oh, I'm sorry. Brandy? \n70   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              70 \nHe points to a crystal decanter near Easy. Easy pours himself a drink and takes in Carter as he wrings his hands to keep from going to pieces. This guy's got it bad. \nEASY Mr. Carter. I came here to get some answers. \nCARTER Yes...? \nEASY I don't know... I'm takin' a helluva chance... \nCarter runs his hand through his hair again, the suspense killing him. \nEASY (continuing) I guess it's just that when I'm working for somebody, I wanna know what I'm gettin' myself into... \nCarter leans in as if he missed something. \nCARTER I beg your pardon. \nEASY Well, I'd like to know the real reason why Mr. Albright hired me. \nCARTER (after a moment) Mr. Albright? \nEASY Yeah. The man you hired to find Daphne. \nCARTER There must be some mistake... I'm sorry, busy... Who are you talking about? \nEasy and Carter stare at each other, not sure how to proceed. \nEASY You didn't hire somebody to find your girlfriend? \n70   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 70 \nCARTER No... Until just now I was sure that she was hundreds of miles away from here... You say someone is looking for her? \nEasy nods, his brow furrowed in thought. Carter gets up and walks to the door, looking out into the canyon. \nCARTER (half to himself) Someone is looking for her. \nEASY What's goin' on between you two? \nCarter shrugs and stammers nervously. \nCARTER Uh... I don't know... We were going to be married... We had a fight... (then recovering) Uh... that's none of your concern, Mr. Rawlins. \nHe stops and looks to the floor, the gravity pulling him down... way down. \nCARTER (continuing) Someone's... after her? A Mr. Albright? And he said he's working for me? \nEASY Yeah... Do you know a man named Richard McGee? \nCARTER No... I can't say that I do. \nEASY Why would someone be after her, Mr. Carter? \nCARTER Uh... I can't say -- I don't know... \nHe's lying and Easy knows it. \n70   CONTINUED:   (4)                                              70 \nCARTER (continuing) Do you think you could find her again? \nEASY I don't know. \nCARTER It's important, Mr. Rawlins, for her sake... I'm willing to pay you. \nEASY Mr. Carter, why did she leave? \nCARTER I can't tell you any more Mr. Rawlins -- I'll pay you to find her... \nEasy thinks about it, and then nods. \nEASY Okay... a thousand dollars. \nCARTER A thousand dollars?! \nEasy buries himself back against the sofa. \nEASY (machine gun quick) Naw. I got five hundred dollars for you. Rich man wants to talk to a white girl you know. Daphne... \nFrank's eyes flame and he presses the knife, drawing blood. \nFRANK You a dead man-- \nWHAP!   WHAP!   WHAP! \n80   CONTINUED:                                                     80 \nO.S. VOICE Easy, you in there? \nFrank's head whips toward the door and Easy knocks the knife away and comes up tussling. \nFrank scrambles to get away and Easy tackles him, straining to keep Frank from reaching the knife. \nTHE FRONT DOOR springs open and SPATS ON PATENT LEATHER SHOES clump in, the last one stomping down on Frank's outstretched fingers. Frank screams and cradles his hand in agony. \nEasy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at \nMOUSE, dressed in a plaid zoot suit with Broadway suspenders down the front of his shirt, a long-barreled .41 caliber pistol held loosely in his hand. \nMOUSE Want me to kill him? \nEASY (exhaling relief) Mouse! Aw, man naw, it's all right... \nMOUSE Well, what's happenin'? \nHe holds out his hand and helps Easy to his feet. \nFrank makes a slight move towards the knife and Mouse levels the pistol at his head, his gold-rimmed teeth glittering from a smile that wants Frank to go for it. \nMOUSE I'll blow your goddamned nose off... \nEASY No, don't! (to Frank) Where's Daphne Monet? \nFrank just stares up at Easy, his eyes sharp and defiant. \nEASY Look, if you don't know where she is, maybe we can help each other find her. \nAfter a moment, Mouse cocks the hammer. \n80   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                 80 \nMOUSE Nigga, you heard him. \nEASY No, Mouse.    Don't kill him. \nThe phone RINGS next to Mouse and he picks it up, eyes still on Frank. \nMOUSE Huh?... He's busy right now, you gonna have to call back. \nHe hangs up. \nEASY Frank, a rich man she knows is willing to pay a thousand dollars just to talk to her. A thousand bucks, man. \nFrank still won't talk and that does it for Mouse.   He releases the hammer. \nMOUSE Easy, lemme try. \nTHUNK!   He slaps Frank upside the head with the pistol. \nMOUSE You better... (THUNK!) Talk... (THUNK!) You stupid-- \nEasy grabs Mouse's arm and Frank slumps to the floor. \nEASY Let him go! \nMOUSE Get out of my way! \nEASY Let him be! \nThe two friends struggle, and Frank rears up and plows into Easy, sending him sprawling to the floor on top of Mouse. Then Frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room, out the door. \n81   Mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the       81 pistol, but it's too late. Easy stands up and Mouse points the gun at him. \nMOUSE Damn you, Easy. Don't you never grab me when I got a gun in my hand! \nEasy silently eyes the pistol and gives Mouse a chance to calm down. After a moment Mouse looks down at his jacket. \nMOUSE Look at the blood you done got on my coat. Why you wanna go and do that? \nHe looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase. Then spots the bathroom and moves to it, taking off his jacket and hanging the pistol in his belt. \nEasy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and catches his breath as Mouse runs water in the bathtub. \nMOUSE Now we got to find that girl so we can get that money. \nEASY No, we don't, Mouse. I don't need your kinda help or I would've called you. \nMouse comes out of the bathroom, scrubbing at a spot on his jacket with a washcloth. \nMILLER He just happened to have a note in his pocket with 'C. James' written on it. \nHe holds the slip of paper up for Easy to see. \nMASON Any of this making you feel talkative at all, 'cause I'll bet ya six bits to a bottle of piss that we're looking at a double here... All we need is to place you in the dead man's house. \nEASY I ain't been there. \nMILLER Where? \nEASY I ain't been in no dead man's house. \nMiller stands back and pats his pockets for a smoke. \n87   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               87 \nMILLER How 'bout a smoke, Ezekiel? \nEasy taps out one and Miller places it in his mouth. \nMILLER Got a light? \nEasy pulls out his lighter and sparks the flame. \nMILLER May I? \nEasy shrugs and passes the lighter to Miller who fires himself up. \nMILLER Nice lighter... \nHe holds the lighter out of Mason who wraps it up in a handkerchief. \nMILLER And we got our print. \nEASY What do you mean? \nMASON Oh, hadn't you heard? We found a cigarette lighter in the dead man's house with the killer's fingerprints on it. \nEASY (total disbelief) Naw, man. I didn't do it. \nMASON Course you did, we got evidence. \nEASY (frantic) I didn't do it. You know I didn't... \nAnd Miller leans in hard. \nMILLER We know that you know more than you're lettin' on. And now a white man's been killed. (MORE) \n87   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                 87 \nMILLER (CONT'D) Now you better tell us what you know, or you're goin' down for the murder of Richard McGee and Coretta James. \nHe straightens up and Easy stands up, too. \nEASY (shouting) I don't know nothin'. \nMILLER (to Mason) Put the cuffs on. Let's take him down. \nAs Mason reaches for the cuffs, Easy sees Mouse peek out from the kitchen doorway then disappear inside. \nEASY Uh, listen!    I don't know who did it! \nMILLER But we do... \nHe sees Mouse draw his gun, his eyes trained on Miller's back. \nMASON And that's all that counts. \nEASY Dammit, I didn't do it. \nMILLER Tell it to the D.A. \nMouse is trained with the hammer cocked and Easy is about to give the signal, but then: \nEASY Look, gimme some time to find out. \nMILLER Forget it. \nEASY Gimme till tomorrow... Tomorrow mornin'... \nMiller thinks about it and then-- \n87    CONTINUED:   (4)                                                  87 \nMILLER Okay.   Tomorrow morning, that's it. \nHe nods to Mason and Easy looks up to see Mouse raise the gun and slide back into the kitchen. \nMason unlocks the cuffs. \nMASON Have a nice evening, Ezekiel. \nAnd he and Miller walk out. \nHe nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws two others into place on his way to the refrigerator. \nEasy and Mouse sit down and Junior brings over a quart of PABST BLUE RIBBON BEER and two glasses that he wipes out with a rag. \nEASY What ya smokin'? Zapatas? \n93   CONTINUED:                                                     93 \nJunior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into the glasses for Easy and Mouse, and drinks from the bottle. \nEasy unfolds the handkerchief in his pocket on the table, uncovering the cigarette butt from Richard McGee's house. \nEASY (to Junior) This is one of yours, ain't it? \nJunior looks at the butt and shrugs. \nEASY You the only one I know cheap enough to smoke this shit... Why'd you kill Richard McGee? \nJUNIOR Huh?   What you talkin' 'bout? \nEASY Ain't no time to play, Junior.    I know you the one killed him. \nJUNIOR You crazy, man. You crazy! \nAnd he stands up to emphasize his indignation. \nMOUSE Sit down, Junior. \nJunior shifts awkwardly from side to side and then sits back down. \nEASY Tell me what happened, Junior. \nJUNIOR I don't know what you talkin' 'bout. \nEASY Well, the police will. When they find out that they got your fingerprints up there in that man's house. \nJUNIOR What fingerprints? What house? \n93   CONTINUED:   (2)                                               93 \nEASY Hattie had you pull that man out of John's the night I was there. And he was laying up there dead with the same suit on and a knife in his chest. \nJUNIOR I ain't killed nobody. \nEASY Quit lyin', you big ole sweaty- thick headed-cornbread eatin'-- \nMouse can't keep from laughing and Junior starts up after Easy. \nJUNIOR You thick-headed, ya damn self!! \nBut Mouse is up, still laughing with the pistol in his hand. \nMOUSE Sit down, man... 'fore I blow your brains out. \nJUNIOR What kinda shit y'all trying to pull here? \nMOUSE (last warning) Sit down. \nJunior sits down and throws himself around in the chair like a child throwing a fit. \nEASY You better tell it the way it happened. And maybe I'll forget what I know... Otherwise, I'm gonna tell Mouse to shoot ya 'cause you know I don't like your ass and he don't like you either. \nMouse slaps the table, laughing so hard he's in tears. \nMOUSE Aw, man... \nAnd he aims the pistol and cocks the hammer, causing Junior to throw himself around some more. \n93   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                93 \nEASY You killed him to take his money, didn't ya? \nJUNIOR I don't even know who you-- \nEASY You just had to rob him, didn't ya! \nJUNIOR I didn't! I didn't touch nothin' in his house! \nSILENCE. But it's in the open now and Junior frowns and shakes his head. \nJUNIOR Hattie had me take him out to his car. And he say he give me ten dollars to drive him home. \nMouse is busy working a toothpick between his front teeth. \nMOUSE I know you took that. \nJUNIOR Hell, yeah. Then he asked me about that white girl you was askin' everybody about at the club. And I told him I seen her with Coretta... What the hell I care if he know? \nEASY You tell him but you won't tell me. JUNIOR I don't like your ass, Easy.   And he gimme fifty dollars. \nEASY (disbelievingly) Fifty dollars? Just to tell him you seen her with Coretta? \nJUNIOR Naw.   To deliver a letter. \nDAPHNE Easy, put the phone down. \nEASY Why don't you try screaming again? 'Cause I bet police like white women with Negro boyfriends who hijack trucks... \nDAPHNE Easy, please. \nShe reaches for the phone and he pushes her away. \nEASY I bet they like pimps, and whores, too, who scam rich white men like Carter runnin' for mayor. \nDAPHNE Easy, please, put it down... \nEASY And I'm sure they like it when these white girls tell their colored men to lay low 'cause they killed a woman over some pictures of another rich white man. \nShe gathers herself, just as: \nOPERATOR'S VOICE Number please... \nDAPHNE (soberly) Frank is my brother. \nEasy is about to speak, but then stands still. \nOPERATOR'S VOICE Number please? \nHe hangs up. \n105   CONTINUED:   (4)                                              105 \nShe looks away, worn out, tired. \nDAPHNE We have different fathers. Mine is white... Frank doesn't even know that Todd and I broke up. So far I've kept him out of all this. \nShe gets up and takes Easy's cigarettes and taps one out. \nDAPHNE See, Coretta's the only one out here in L.A. besides my brother who knew about me... (she lights up) And about a month ago she took a job working for, of all people, Matthew Teran. She made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that she'd heard that Teran was a pedophile. And Coretta got carried away and told her that Todd Carter was engaged to a colored woman. She was sorry and didn't think it would get to Teran... but it did and he got a hold of my birth records. \nEASY Who killed her, Daphne? \nDaphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face ignoring the question. \nDAPHNE (continuing) Todd and I broke up and I paid a guy for the pictures of Teran. But somehow Coretta got them. \nEASY Who killed her? \nDAPHNE It was an accident. Coretta and I were still mad at each other. I mean, she threatened to sell Teran the pictures. \nEASY Who killed her goddammit!? \n105   CONTINUED:   (5)                                               105 \nDAPHNE I just asked Joppy to go over and put a scare in her... It was an accident. \nFLASHBACK: \n106   INT. KITCHEN - CORETTA'S HOUSE                                 106 \nJoppy points a finger in Coretta's face, backing her against the counter. She grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left out to dry. \nDAPHNE (V.O.) Joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him... \nShe swipes at Joppy and he backhands her against the stove... She struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down. \n107   BACK TO SCENE                                                  107 \nDaphne looks down at her hands. \nShe stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed. \nDAPHNE God, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... It's just that with the pictures I can-- \nEASY What? Marry Carter?   Be white again? \nDAPHNE Don't judge me, Easy! Do you think I like pretending that I'm someone else? Do you know how I've been treated by people, colored and white, when I've tried to live as a colored woman in a colored community. Do you have any idea what any colored man whose ever been with me has had to go through? Don't you dare judge me! \nShe sees Easy hesitate and she stands up. \nDAPHNE (continuing) Come on, Easy. Help me. \n107   CONTINUED:                                                     107 \nShe moves in close, caressing. \nDAPHNE (continuing) Come on, you know it's the right thing to do... You know if things were different what would happen between us. \nEASY I'll tell you what can happen between us. You get Carter to clear me up from all this and you can have your pictures. That's all that could have ever happened between us. \nDAPHNE (genuinely hurt) Sure, baby. Of course, sweetheart... \nThe sound of the front door pushing open startles them, and Albright knocks on his way in. \nALBRIGHT Well I'll be damned. You found her. \nAnd Manny and Shariff step in, too, carrying baseball bats. \nEasy can barely make out Shariff passing the window.   He strains to see more. \nALBRIGHT'S VOICE You said he didn't know anything. \nDAPHNE'S VOICE I was lying!! \nALBRIGHT'S VOICE Okay. Grab that for me, Shariff. It's ready. \nAnd then SCRE-E-EAM!! The kind that drops the bottom out of your stomach. The kind more akin to fear than the word itself... The kind that fries your skin with the cold chill of horror. S-C-R-E-EAMS again!! \nDAPHNE'S VOICE No-o-o-o!   Please. No-o-o! \nALBRIGHT'S VOICE Now talk to me, goddammit! \n123   CONTINUED:                                                         123 \nDAPHNE'S VOICE No-o-o! \n124   Easy's gotta make a move. KABLANGALANGLE! He smashes the           124 window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up. \nManny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning her down on a battered old sofa. \nAlbright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff, standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him. \nEasy starts blasting.   KABLAAM!   Manny takes one to the throat. KABLAAM! \nAlbright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming. \nManny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the side door just ahead of another KABLAAM! that digs out a chunk of the wall. \nEasy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side door. He HEARS more steps stumble out and then... SILENCE. \nAnd then, KABLAAM! BLAAM! Two huge blasts rip right through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to the side of the house, underneath another window with the shade pulled down. \nALBRIGHT (O.S.) (to Shariff) Who the hell's out there? \nSHARIFF (getting frantic) I don't know! \nALBRIGHT (O.S.) That you, Easy? (SILENCE) Tell us what you want, buddy.   See what we can work out. \nEasy HEARS footsteps coming alongside the house where he had been moments ago. KABLAAM! BLAAM! Albright has fired from the inside again, thinking it's him. \nEASY (whispering) Mouse? \n124   CONTINUED:                                                       124 \nBut it's Manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air, stumbling aimlessly off down the hill. A walking dead man... EASY hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a moment the gurgling stops. \nALBRIGHT (O.S.) Easy... Hey, Buddy (then to Shariff) Come on, goddammit! \nDaphne cries out and KLABLANGLE! Easy breaks the window with the gun but KABLAAM! BLAAM! BLAAM! The windowsill tears out above his head and Daphne screams again. \nEasy looks up to see Shariff, holding her in front of him as a shield. He's headed straight for Easy, drawing a bead on him for the kill. And then KABLAAM! the back of Shariff's skull flies off and \nMOUSE is in the side door, blasting.     BLAAM! \nAlbright breaks for the window. BLAAM! The slug spins him halfway around but he hurls himself through the window backwards. \nEasy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM! The bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car and returns fire. BLAAM! BLAAM!... Easy hits the deck. \nAlbright's engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the gravel. Mouse appears on the other side of the house and CLICK! CLICK! he's out of ammo. He pulls out the other pistol, but it's too late. \nMOUSE Damn, damn, damn! I hit him!     I hit him! \nEasy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front door. \n125   INT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN                                            125 \nEasy finds Daphne standing in the middle of the room, her whole body quaking in shock. He takes off his jacket and drapes it around her. \nEASY Come on... You all right? \nHer top lip is swollen and bloody and she has a dark bruise on her cheek... She jerks her head, nodding \"yes.\" \n125   CONTINUED:                                                     125 \nAs he leads her through the doorway, he stops to look back at Shariff's legs sprawling out on the floor from behind the sofa. \n126   EXT. ALBRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT                                  126 \nHe leads her down the front porch and hears. \nMOUSE There's blood all over here... I got him. \nMouse gets up from squatting down, grinning, the gold rims of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through the door. He looks Daphne over, admiring. \nMOUSE Damn.   Sweetheart. \nEasy leads her past, quickly. \nMOUSE She okay? \nEASY Yeah.   Let's go. \nstanding on the lawn in front of the planetarium. Carter wanders after Daphne, explaining while she paces back and forth in anger. \nEASY I could tell how it was gonna go when Carter asked us to meet him at the Observatory instead of at his house... She knew it, too. But she had come this far and she had to play it out. \nSuddenly, Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back toward the car. Carter follows behind. \nCARTER Daphne!   Daphne, sweetheart! \nHe starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use. \n130   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                               130 \nShe gets in. \nDAPHNE Come on, Easy. Let's go. \nEasy throws a look over at Carter. \nDAPHNE (continuing) Don't worry, you can give him the pictures yourself. \nAnd she throws them down on the seat. \n131   OMIT                                                           131 \n132   Easy fires up the engine and pulls away with Daphne            132 looking straight ahead. \nEASY Hey, I'm sorry. \nThe slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the tears flow. The sun is coming up over the city below... \nEASY (V.O.) For the first time I felt that I could fall in love with her, too... I was even wondering if it was starting to happen when I dropped her off at 63rd and Dinker where her brother, Frank, was waiting... Then it occurred to me that she still had Carter's money... and I felt like a fool. \n133   INT. CITY HALL                                                 133 \nEasy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching kidney. A secretary comes out to meet him and as she leaves, Todd Carter and a group of men in business suits converge on him, shaking hands. \nEASY (V.O.) Evidently Carter had told all his cronies about the pictures because they were all smiles and handshakes and \"how do ya do\"... The Mayor, the police chief... The newspaper; land developers. All the men who ran the City, and who really stood to gain by who was the Mayor for the next six years. \nThe group fans out leaving Carter and Easy alone to walk off down a hallway. \n134   OMIT                                                           134 \n135   OMIT                                                           135 \n136   INT.

It's cold and official like the job itself. \nCarter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket, not unlike Albright. \n136   CONTINUED:                                                    136 \nCARTER Here's the remaining eight hundred that I owe you... in cash... And another thousand which I hope will keep this whole thing... you know. \nEasy nods a tentative \"sure.\" \nCARTER (continuing) And I've taken care of your problems with the police. You'll have no more trouble there. And that's a promise. \nEasy nods and starts to go, but... \nCARTER (continuing; to Easy) Mr. Rawlins... did Daphne ever say... she loved me? \nEasy shrugs, not knowing how to answer. \nEASY Would it really matter if she did, Mr. Carter? \nCarter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely figure amidst all his power. \n137   EXT. CITY HALL - DAY                                          137 \nEasy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the granite steps. \nEASY (V.O.) I'd been thinking about Daphne, too... wondering if she meant what she said about what could have happened between us... But at the moment I was wondering if there was any such thing as a sprained chin. But other than that and a headache, a loose tooth and a kidney that a doctor would need to look at, I felt like five thousand, three hundred dollars... And unless Albright was alive somewhere, that feelin' was gonna last a while. \nO.S.

They come over. \nMILLER You got some mighty powerful friends up there... mighty powerful. But, see, we got a problem. \nEasy listens disinterestedly. \nMILLER (continuing) With the Chief sealing these things up like this, it doesn't do much for the morale of the men who've been working on these cases. \nMASON Yeah.   Makes 'em feel like shit. \nMILLER There's a guy who's been callin' on the phone. And we're pretty sure that he was up there with McGee. \nMASON A... uh... colored guy... sounds kinda dumb... \nMILLER (correcting) Not very bright... But he said you accused him of the murder.

VOICE You know, when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns. \nThey screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer. \nO.S.

Skin darker than a Louisiana Creole. \nHe takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the whiskey. As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet kicked up on the desk, fully in charge. \nA Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948. \nBENNY (continuing) And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd give you your job back... All I said was that I'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing... Do you have something to say? \nA stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously. \nMAN Mr. Giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him. \nBENNY Fella, what'd I tell ya?

Now... Do... you... have... something... to say? \nEasy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about swallowing his pride as well. And then: \nEASY I want my job back, Mr. Giacomo. I need to work and I need a good job. \nBENNY (O.S.) Is that all? \nEasy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep from bowing his head. \nEASY No, that's not all... I need money so that I can pay my mortgage and eat... I need a house to live in and a place to raise children... I need to buy clothes so I can-- \nBENNY I'm sorry, fella, but I gotta get back to work... \nAnd he swings his feet down and stands up to go.   But Easy is up too, blocking his way out the door. \nEASY Ezekiel, Mr. Giacomo. \nBENNY Hunh? \nEASY My name is Ezekiel...

Dammit, what'd I tell you? \nThe fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading \"Fuller vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT.\" We could make out more of the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasn't so smoky in the place. \nEASY Joppy, how much they payin' out there at McDonell Douglas? \nJOPPY I don't know.   Don't it say-- \nHis words hang as his eyes stray toward the door. \nEasy looks up also at \nTHE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to the far end of the bar. \nEasy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private. \nEasy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks.

Any time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock-down-drag-out- fisticuffs... Where you from, Easy? \nEASY (awkwardly) Houston. \nALBRIGHT Houston... Joppy's hometown. \nJoppy pours Albright a straight shot of Wild Turkey and the big man sips it. \nALBRIGHT So I hear you need a job. \nEasy throws a look at Joppy, but Joppy is busy buffing the bar and putting more of Easy's business in the street. \nJOPPY Aw yeah, Easy always tryin' to do better. Got his high school certificate from night school. He's threatenin' up on some college. And he's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house. Shoot, he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man. \nALBRIGHT Property owner, hunh? \nHe turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the counter. \n4   CONTINUED:   (3)                                              4 \nALBRIGHT (continuing) These big companies, don't give a damn, do they? \nHe reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card and scribbles something on it. \nALBRIGHT (continuing) If you need a job, drop by this address at seven tonight. \nEasy takes the card and glances at it. \nEASY What kind of work you do? \nALBRIGHT I do favors...

I know it was a sign, 'cause she was so religious... \nMOUSE It's all right, big man... it's all right... \nAnd he pours Dupree a half glass of rye. \n99    THE BOTTLE - LATER, NIGHT                                        99 \nBarely a \"corner\" of whiskey lies at the bottom and \nDUPREE is snoring like a buzzsaw, sound asleep. \nMOUSE squints into his glass, wondering why it's empty, and looks down the length of the kitchen leading into \n100   THE BEDROOM - NIGHT                                             100 \nDrawers are pulled out on the dresser, and Easy is rifling through another until he pulls out a bible. He fans the pages, finding \nTHE LETTER \nalready opened.    His fingers pull out a photograph and then two more. \nBACK TO EASY \nHis excited face goes sick, and he silently mouths: \nEASY Holy shi-it... \n100   CONTINUED:                                                       100 \nEASY (V.O.)

Come on, I think that girl is gonna call again. \nMOUSE That Dupree is a good man, but he sure can't hold his liquor. \nEasy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on, stuffing the letter in his coat pocket. \nEASY You got your sails up pretty far too, Raymond. \nMOUSE You callin' me drunk? \nEASY Well, you been puttin' it away along with him and-- \nMOUSE If I was drunk could I do this? \nAnd in less than a heartbeat he has pulled that long- barreled pistol and is aiming it at Easy's forehead. \nMOUSE Ain't a man in Texas can outdraw me! \nEASY (forced calm) Put it down. \nMOUSE Go on. \nAnd he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster. \n101   CONTINUED:                                                    101 \nMOUSE Go for your gun. Let's see who gets kilt. \nEASY I don't have a gun, Raymond.   Come on, let's go. \nMOUSE You fool enough to go without a piece then you must wanna be dead. \nHe lays the pistol on the table then draws a .32 automatic from his waist, this time cocking the hammer, the muzzle only inches from Easy's head. \nEasy can tell from the glazed look in Mouse's eye that instead of seeing him, his friend is glaring at some demon he carries around in his head. So he stands stock still. \nEASY (quiet, soothing) Let him go, Raymond... He done learned his lesson. If you kill him then he won't have got it. \nMOUSE He fool enough to call me out and he ain't even got no gun? I'll kill the motherfucker. \nEASY Let him live, Raymond, and he be scared whenever you walk in the room. \nMOUSE Motherfucker better be scared. I kill a motherfucker. I kill him! \nEasy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment until Mouse blinks, then nods and lets the pistol fall down into his lap. His head on his chest, he's sound asleep. \nEasy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other. Then walks to the doorway and turns out the light. \n102   INT.

I was sure of that, too. \n", "test2_true": "Easy's car pulls up and he gets out and looks around cautiously before starting up the walkway. \nEASY (V.O.) (continuing) For the first time I hated walking up to my house... I still didn't know if I could go to the police. But Albright was liable to be showing up in a few hours asking about Frank Green. I was thinking I oughta forget the girl and leave town, back to Houston or Galveston where they didn't know me too good. \nEasy gets to the door, still literally looking over his shoulder, and hears the phone RINGING inside. He unlocks the door and bursts in. \n104   INT. EASY'S HOUSE                                              104 \nHe races through the dark living room and into \n105   INT.

Damn! \nHe whacks the nightstand with the receiver, dying with frustration. And SOMETHING MOVES in the dark.

And... \nDAPHNE                          EASY (continuing)                    (he joins her) I need you to help me           You need me to help you find him.                       find him. \nEasy shakes his head, amused, and lights a cigarette. \nEASY --I already have the pictures... \nDaphne stiffens, as if from an electrical shock, and then: \nDAPHNE Easy, I paid seven thousand dollars for those pictures. They belong to me. \nEASY Oh yeah? Matthew Teran may have somethin' to say about that. \nDAPHNE Easy, you wouldn't dare. \nEASY Try me.   Who killed Coretta? \nDAPHNE I don't know -- I'll pay you for them. I'll give you a thousand dollars. \nEASY You gave Richard seven. \n105   CONTINUED:   (2)                                        105 \nDAPHNE Okay, I'll give you seven. \nEASY Where'd you get seven thousand dollars from? \nDAPHNE Never mind. I'll give it to you. Easy, please. They're very important to me. \nEASY Coretta's life was important to a few people too. What's say you tell me who killed her? \nDAPHNE Easy, honey, I don't know. \nEASY 'Honey?' Do Frank and Carter really fall for that stuff? Come on... You and Todd Carter have a fight and all of a sudden he doesn't wanna be mayor no more... You leave, he's worried but he can't even get his buddies in the police department to help him find you... And now you wanna buy some pictures of Teran. Why? 'Cause he's got some dirt on you. \nShe gets up and walks away. \nDAPHNE Easy, why don't you just take the money! \nEASY Is that what Frank told Coretta? \nShe whirls around to face him. \nEASY (continuing) Was she being too nosy? Or was she just being Coretta and trying to bargain up the price? \nDAPHNE Easy, please.  How much do you want? \n105   CONTINUED:   (3)                                              105 \nEASY Tell me. Is Frank your husband or your pimp? \nSMACK!

BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE: 
An impressionistic montage: 
A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We never see him fully. 
The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint. 
On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL COMBAT. 
IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be... 
IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND. 
Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus 
A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION and we see -- 
A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the communication ... 
AII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN: 
EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING 
Two groundskeepers on "ride 'em" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's alone, across the cemetery. 
BENNIE You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away. 
ACROSS THE CEMETERY 
Brig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996. 
HUMMEL Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking. 
Hummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off. 
EXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Heavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas covered ARMY TRUCK blows a tire in the road.  The DRIVER gets out. Inspects the tire. 
INT.  ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT 
FOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD. 
EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT 
Three ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly. 
ARMY M. P. General Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel expecting you, sir? 
HUMMEL Held better be.  This is a security inspection. 
ARMY M. P. Yes, sir! 
The M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply. 
INT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT 
The four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they go -- 
EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT 
The four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered positions in the compound. 
200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY "MAGAZINE CHECKERS" emerge from a building with clipboards, on routine check. 
INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room, sleepy-eyed. 
COLONEL CALLAHAN General Hummel!  This is a surprise! 
HUMMEL That's the idea, Colonel. 
EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT 
Two marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker compound's elevated watch tower.

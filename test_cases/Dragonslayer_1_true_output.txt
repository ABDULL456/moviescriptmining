At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering irridescent disks as big as saucers. 
ULRICH All right. How did you come by these? 
VALERIAN (proudly) I found them. At the mouth of the lair. 
ULRICH (grim) What else? 
Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table. 
VALERIAN A claw. 
ULRICH That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the gods! 
He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at his visitors. 
ULRICH And you want me to do battle with that? 
Valerian has lost all trace of timidity. 
VALERIAN Who else can we turn to? We all know what we're dealing with here. This is a basilicok. (he takes a step forward) A cockatrice. (another step, bolder) A dragon. (he leans close to Ulrich) This is no stag, no bear, no natural creature. This is one of your kind. And only a necromancer such as yourself can rid us of it. 
ULRICH Did you try the Meredydd sisters? What about Rinbod? I've heard it said he killed a dragon once. 
VALERIAN They're all dead. You're the only one left. 
With a sigh, Ulrich lowers himself into a chair. He rubs his withered legs and shakes his head. 
ULRICH It's a long way to Urland. 
VALERIAN Every quarter, upon the solstices and the equinoxes there's a new victim. 
Greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up. 
GREIL My daughter, for one. 
OTHER TRAVELERS My sister... cousins... 
ULRICH All women? 
VALERIAN Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen by lot. 
Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and tooth. 
GALEN Master, don't you think -- 
ULRICH Silence! 
He broods for a long time. 
VALERIAN Are you afraid of dragons? 
ULRICH No. Sorcerers and dragons go back a long long time together. If it weren't for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any dragons. (pause) All right. I'll go.

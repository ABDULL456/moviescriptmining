PHIL Congratulations. Phil reaches into his pocket, pulls out two tickets and hands them to Doris. 
DORIS What is this? Oh, no way! No way! Ahhh! Doris throws herself on Fred and jumps up and down. Fred grabs the tickets. 
FRED Wrestlemania! No way! No way! Doris throws herself on Phil. 
DORIS How did you know? 
FRED We're like going to be in Pittsburgh anyway. 
PHIL I don't know. I just thought about you two, tried to picture what you ' d want more than anything in the world and it came to me. Bing! Wrestlemania. 
FRED Thanks, Mr. Connors. You're a real pal. 
DORIS This is the best! Doris gives Phil a kiss. She and Fred move on. 
RITA I don ' t understand . You rush from one person to the next in a town you only visit once a year, you know everything before it happens , and you -- - I don ' t know , you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s leading citizen. The band finishes a set. The guests stop dancing and head for the refreshments. Phil and Rita are left alone for the moment 
PHIL What do you want to know? 
RITA Who are you? 
PHIL I really don't know. 
RITA No, there's something going on with you. 
PHIL Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney on February second -- every day. It's supernatural. I don't even try to explain it anymore. So, I live each day as if it's the only day I've got. Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only good, true things. 
RITA That's pretty amazing. " 
PHIL You want to know what's really amazing? I've been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. I dream of you every night of my life. You've been my constant weapon against total despair, and just knowing you exist has kept me alive. How's that? Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing anybody has ever said to anybody. Mary the piano teacher notices Phil. 
MARY Phil! (to her friend) This is the guy. 
PHIL Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one of Punxsey's finest musicians. 
Â·MARY Give me a break. You should talk. Why don't you play something? 
PHIL N o , I-- 
MARY Please. 
FRED Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it. Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs. Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears. Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp. Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in, everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance. An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up a storm. 
LEO That's a great guy you've got there. Doctor Connors fixed my back, you know. 
RITA Do ctor Connors? 
Rit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano. 
CUT TO: 
EXT . STREET - NIGHT 
It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita. She looks like an angel. 
PHIL Wait! Don't move! 
Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously, joyously, then rolling it into a large ball. 
RITA Making a snow man? I'll help. 
PHIL No, stay there. Stand right th ere. 
Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LATER 
Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work. 
RITA Can I look? 
PHIL O kay, look. 
It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.

She resumes nibbling on his neck. 
DANNY Yes. Closer. 
She runs her nails down his chest, slowly, teasing. Her hand finds his groin. What she finds makes her smile. 
CAT Is this close enough? 
DANNY (SMILES) ...Yes. 
She gently lowers his hands to his sides, holds them there. Kisses him deeply. Pushes him down onto the floor. And lowers herself on top of him. A small moan escapes his lips as she takes him inside her. 
FADE TO 
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - DAWN 
Danny wakes. His face holds the smile of the memory of the night before. He turns his head, lazily. The pillow beside him is empty. 
DANNY Jen...? 
Cat is gone. Danny's smile fades. 
EXT. ELEVATOR TRAIN - MORNING 
Emilio walks down the stairs, carrying a shopping bag. 
TRACK WITH HIM ALONG THE STREET. Until he comes to a Laundromat. 
INT. LAUNDROMAT - MORNING 
Emilio loads laundry from the shopping bag into a machine, puts in the coins, then sits down on a bench to watch the cycle. Seems to talk to himself. 
EMILIO Safe? 
And then we see he is talking to... 
CAT On my end. You? 
EMILIO Safe. 
CAT What do we have? 
Emilio takes a manila envelope out of the bag. Places it on the seat next to him. Cat picks it up, looks through it. 
EMILIO You remember the guy who was in the news for running that Ponzi scheme about a year ago? 
CLOSE ON A MAGAZINE PULLED FROM THE ENVELOPE 
The cover features WILLIAM WOOGARD, 45, the most unassuming, baldheaded, pudgy faced man, a nerd. Under the headline: PREDATOR. 
EMILIO He disappeared fifty billion dollars. The money was never recovered. Skipped out and bought himself citizenship on some shit hole of a Caribbean island that calls itself a country with no extradition laws. Lot of very pissed off people lost everything. 
Cat goes to get up. 
EMILIO There's something else. 
He slaps the newspaper down with Rizzo's picture on the front page. 
EMILIO How long has this been going on? 
CAT (BLUFFING) Not long. 
EMILIO The paper says twenty two. All like this. Tell me why. 
CAT No reason. 
EMILIO Since you're a kid, you don't do anything for no reason. Don't play dumb, it insults me. 
CAT I've got to get ready. 
As she goes to rise, Emilio grabs her hand. 
EMILIO It's not just you in this. It's me, Mama. 
CAT Tio. You're removed. You book the work, you collect the fees... 
EMILIO I watch your ass. Each and every job, I vet, I double vet. For every one I book you, I turn down five, ten. I promised to keep you safe. I KEEP YOU SAFE. Cataleya. It's a full time job, no matter what you think. Those pictures...they freaked me out. OK? I didn't realize... 
CAT I come to you at nine. I say I want to be a killer. What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind. (BEAT) I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter. Stop playing the innocent with me. You know this. Forever. 
EMILIO Sure. Of course. But the way you're playing it. They even have a name for you. The Tag killer. I would have stopped it a long time ago. Had I known about this. 
CAT Why? 
EMILIO Because I love you. 
Cat smiles. A smile that could melt ice in winter. But a knowing smile. A 'Don't bullshit a bullshitter' smile. 
CAT If you do, you would never have let me get involved in the first place. 
The truth of her words deprive him of his. She kisses him him on the forehead. 
CAT I love you too. 
And she exits, leaving Emilio more concerned. He looks down at the picture. 
CLOSE ON THE ORCHID WHICH MORPHS INTO... 
A REAL CATALEYA ORCHID ON A COMPUTER SCREEN WITH THE WORD CATALEYA BEING TYPED IN THE SEARCH BAR 
PULL BACK TO 
INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY 
Ross is at his computer, staring at the screen and the orchid, alongside a map of Colombia and the specific region where the Cataleya is found. He thinks.

KAY Press the little green button, on three. 
Jay raises his weapon; they press their green buttons. 
KAY (CONT'D) One...two... 
They pull their triggers. 
For a moment, nothing happens, as if it were a misfire. But then, there is a VACUUM WHUMP, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the barrel of the guns. 
Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, THUDDING to their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it HITS the ship -- 
-- and it too is sucked back down. Hurtling back toward them. 
EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT 
She flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
The saucer CRASHES through the Unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock... 
Jay and Kay come to their feet... 
In front of them, the dust clears... Trees uprooted, stones and dirt thrown everywhere...a dumpster has been cast to their left... 
And the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a mound of debris... 
A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, walking slowly toward them, with contained fury. 
EDGAR You don't get it. I've won. It's over. 
KAY You are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand over any galaxy you might be carrying. 
EDGAR You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a few seconds you won't even be matter! 
KAY Move away from the vehicle and put your hands on your head. 
He pumps the gun for emphasis. 
EDGAR Put my hands on my head? 
Edgar stares at him. Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin. 
He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be twelve feet across. 
Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug raises himself aloft on his legs. 
He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally 
Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each. 
He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. The GALAXY hangs on a chain around his neck. 
BUG Like this? 
Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug. 
Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and Kay's grasp, then swallowing them. 
Jay and Kay have only a second to react before -- 
The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR. 
EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT 
She flinches as she sees them hit the ground. She starts to climb the tree. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts. 
JAY That did not go at all like I had planned. 
They look up to see the Bug moving for the second tower -- and the second flying saucer. Kay gets to his feet. 
KAY This guy's really starting to bug me.

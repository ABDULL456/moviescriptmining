She checks her watch nervously: getting close to nine. 
MA Jack, it's late. Come on. 
Jack jumps in and snuggles down. Pictures of Dora and her monkey Boots are glued on the back wall; this is a tiny room within Room. Ma covers him up for the night. 
She begins to sing `The Big Rock Candy Mountain'. 
12   INT. ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT                               12 
A little later. Dim light comes through the slats. Jack lies stroking the dangling clothes, the pictures glued to the wardrobe. He freezes at the sound of the beeps that mean the outside door is about to open. 
He lies absolutely still, listening for Old Nick's entrance. He savors the scent of fresh air, but shivers: winter. 
Boom: now the door's shut again. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Hey. 
(CONTINUED) 12   CONTINUED:                                                  12 
MA (O.S.) Hey. 
Jack goes up on his elbow to squint through the slats but only sees a bit of the man's down jacket as he takes it off. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Here's the jeans. 
MA (O.S.) Thanks. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) The grapes were way too much, so I got canned pears. 
Jack can see Ma as she puts groceries away. 
MA OK. 
Now OLD NICK moves into view too. Forties, solidly built, blue-collar: a ordinary monster. 
OLD NICK What's that? A birthday cake? 
He cuts himself a piece and eats it in a few bites. 
Ma starts getting undressed. 
OLD NICK (CONT'D) Shoulda told me, I'd have brought him a present. 
Jack twitches at this thrilling possibility. Old Nick starts undressing too: like some dull marriage. 
OLD NICK (CONT'D) What's he now, four? 
Jack, in the wardrobe, is all agog for Ma to correct him. 
JACK (too low to be heard) Five. 
Sounds of the adults getting into bed. The lamp clicking off. 
Then the familiar creaks of the bed. Jack doesn't know what they mean but is troubled. He counts them under his breath. 
(CONTINUED) 12   CONTINUED: (2)                                           12 
JACK (CONT'D) One, two, three, four... 
JACK (V.O.) There's Room, then Outer Space, then Heaven. Plant is real but not trees. Spiders are real and one time the mosquito that was sucking my blood. But squirrels and dogs are just TV, except Lucky my dog that might be some day. Mountains are too big to be real and the sea. 
In the dark of the wardrobe, Jack is still counting. 
JACK One twenty-eight, one twenty- nine... 
JACK (V.O.) TV persons are flat and made of colors with red mouths and clothes instead of skin but me and you are real. Old Nick I don't know if he's real, maybe half? Green beans are real and chocolate but not ice cream. 
The bedsprings are speeding up. 
JACK Three hundred six, seven, eight - 
A primal grunt from Old Nick. The creaking is done. Jack is asleep at the bottom of the wardrobe. Old Nick goes over to the TV and switches on sports. 
MA Shh. 
He turns down the volume. The sound of the sports broadcast overlaps with the thud of the door closing. The wardrobe door opens admitting the faint light of the L.E.D on the keypad. 
We cut to a shot of Ma putting a sleeping Jack into the bed. As she starts to climb in beside we pull back and crane up. 
13   INT. ROOM - DAY                                              13 
Next morning. Jack watches a nature programme on TV: time- lapse photography of one glorious tree. 
(CONTINUED) 13   CONTINUED:                                               13 
Ma is using a needle and thread to take in Jack's new, much- too-big jeans. Jack finds a trodden cigarette butt under the corner of the rug. Old Nick must have brought it in on his shoe. Jack studies it. 
TV NARRATOR (V.O.) Fallen leaves decompose and return nutrients to the soil. 
MA (to herself, referring to the jeans) Cheap piece of ... 
Jack looks at the sad African violet on the bedside table. 
JACK Why Plant doesn't make flowers anymore?

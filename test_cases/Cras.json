{"train": "\"CRASH\" \nScreenplay by \nDavid Cronenberg \nBased on a novel by \nJ.G. Ballard \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. AIRFIELD -- DAY \nWe are moving through a small airfield full of parked light planes. There are no people around. We move through the cluster of planes toward a hangar on the edge of the field. \nINT. HANGAR -- DAY \nWe are still moving through light planes, but now we are inside the hangar. Some of the planes have their engine covers open, parts strewn around. Others are partially covered with tarps or have sections missing. There is even a sleek executive jet parked in one corner. \nAs we float past the planes we notice a woman leaning against the wing of a Piper Cub, her chest against the wing's trailing edge, her arms spread out to each side, as though flying herself. As we get closer we see that her jacket is pulled open to expose one of her breasts, which rests on the metal of the wing. \nCU breast on metal. CU hard nipple and rivets. \nCU woman -- Catherine. Early thirties, dark, short hair, stylish executive clothes. Her eyes are wide open but unfocussed. A hand grips her shoulder from behind. We follow the hand down behind Catherine and discover a man crouched behind her, kissing her back. \nCatherine is standing on a low mechanic's platform and her skirt has been raised and hooked over the wing's flap. She wears garters and stockings but no panties. \nThe man, handsome, cruel-looking, rises up behind her, enters her, kisses her neck. Catherine half closes her eyes. She rotates her pelvis gently against the thrusting. \nEXT. FILM STUDIO -- DAY \nWe are floating toward the modest gates of a small film studio; the sign above the gates says 'CineTerra' in Art Deco script. \nINT. FILM STUDIO -- DAY \nCATHERINE In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in. \nJAMES Did you come? \nCATHERINE No. What about your camera girl? Did she come? \nJAMES We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set... \nCatherine turns toward James and pulls open her blouse, exposing her left breast. She pulls James's face down and presses her nipple against his cheek. \nCATHERINE Poor darling. (pause) What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest. \nJAMES I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE. LINGERIE DEPARTMENT -- DAY \nJames lingers among racks of nightdresses outside a changing cubicle. Monitored by a bored, seen-it-all middle-aged saleswoman, James glances now and then through the curtains to watch Karen help Catherine try on underwear. \nKaren, Catherine's secretary, a moody, unsmiling girl, is methodically involved in the soft technology of Catherine's breasts and the brassi\u00e8res designed to show them off. \nKaren touches Catherine with peculiar caresses, tapping her lightly with the tips of her fingers, first upon the shoulders, along the pink grooves left by her underwear, then across her back, where the metal clasps of her brassi\u00e8re have left a medallion of impressed skin, and finally on the elastic-patterned grooves beneath Catherine's breasts themselves. \nCatherine stands through this in a trance-like state, gabbling to herself in a low voice, as the tip of Karen's right forefinger surreptitiously touches her nipple. \nINT. UNDERGROUND PARKING-LOT -- DAY \nJames sits in the car beside his wife. She watches as his fingers move across the control panel, switching on the ignition, the direction indicator, selecting the drive lever, fastening his seat-belt. \nAs the car moves off, James puts his free hand between Catherine's thighs. \nINT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nJames studies storyboards for an automotive battery commercial, which are spread out over a broad architect's table. He makes notes on each panel of the boards with a sharp pencil. \nAs we move around him, we reveal his secretary, Renata, sitting and watching him intently from the vantage point of her corner chair, her hand poised to write down anything he might say in a small, leather-bound notebook. \nTraffic is beginning to back up behind the accident and a growing circle of spectators, some of them pedestrians, some drivers who have left their own cars, begins to form. \nThe more adventurous members of the crowd paw hesitantly at the seized doors of the two cars, afraid really to yank them open in case the violence of that act might trigger some further unnamed catastrophe. \nINT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT \nNumbly watching James as she fumbles to undo her seat-belt, the woman in the other crashed car inadvertently jerks open her blouse and exposes her breast to James, its inner curve marked by a dark, strap-like bruise made by her seat-belt. \nIn the strange, desperate privacy of this moment, the breast's erect nipple seems somehow, impossibly, a deliberate provocation. \nINT. HOSPITAL -- DAY \nWe are close on a face having makeup applied to it. It is a very pale, blotchy face, and the makeup is smoothing it, making it appear healthy and even slightly tanned. There are also some crude black stitches in this face, and we realize that it is James's face, and that a very serious Catherine is applying the makeup. \nJames's legs are up in a sling, drainage tubes coming from both knees. Wounds on his chest: broken skin around the lower edge of the sternum, where the horn boss had been driven upwards by the collapsing engine compartment; a semicircular bruise, a marbled rainbow, running from one nipple to the other. Stitches in the laceration across the scalp, a second hairline an inch below the original. Unshaven face and fretting hands. \nCatherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline executive than to visit her husband in hospital. \nCATHERINE There, that's better. \nJAMES Thank you. \nJames examines himself in her hand-mirror, staring at his pale, mannequin-like face, trying to read its lines. \nCatherine looks around her as she puts her makeup away. There are twenty-three other beds in the briskly efficient-looking new ward, all of them empty. \nCATHERINE Not a lot of action here. \nJAMES They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air-crash victims. The beds are kept waiting. \nCATHERINE If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you. \nJAMES I'll listen for you buzzing over. \nCatherine crosses her legs and tries to light a cigarette with a heavy, mechanically complex lighter with which she is obviously unfamiliar. \nJames waves the folder away. Catherine examines his body, aloofly curious. \nJAMES Where's the car? \nCATHERINE Outside in the visitors' car-park. \nJAMES What!? They brought the car here? \nCATHERINE My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station. \nJAMES Have you seen it? \nCATHERINE The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive. \nJAMES It's about time. \nCATHERINE It is? \nJAMES After being bombarded endlessly by road-safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in an actual accident. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS -- NIGHT \nJames is taking his walk through the hallways, trundling his IV stand along with him like an awkward pet. \nA white-coated doctor -- Vaughan -- steps into the ward from a room at the end of the hall. He is bare-chested under his white coat. His strong hands carry a briefcase filled with photographs, which he pauses to shuffle through, as though checking a map. \nAs James approaches this new visitor, Vaughan's pockmarked jaws chomp on a piece of gum, creating the impression that he might be hawking obscene pictures around the wards, pornographic X-ray plates and blacklisted urinalyses. He sports copious scar tissue around his forehead and mouth, rumpled and puckered as though residues from some terrifying act of violence. \nVaughan looks James up and down, taking in every detail of his injuries with evident interest. \nVAUGHAN James Ballard? \nJAMES Yes? \nVAUGHAN Crash victim? \nJames steps from the car, his right knee giving way after the effort of driving. At his feet lies a litter of dead leaves, cigarette cartons and small drifts of safety-glass crystals. \nA hundred yards behind them, a dusty old Lincoln is also parked on the verge. The leather-jacketed driver watches James through his mudspattered windshield, broad shoulders hunched against the door pillar. As James crosses the road the man picks up a camera fitted with a zoom lens and peers at James through the eye-piece. \nSpotting the man, Renata opens the car door for James. \nRENATA Who is that man? Is he a private detective? \nJames gets back into the car. \nINT. RENTED CAR -- DAY \nRENATA Can you drive? \nJAMES I can drive. \nJames shifts the car into gear and cruises slowly toward the man with the camera. As they approach him, he gets out of his own car, ignoring them, and kneels down to study the hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface. \nAs James and Renata drive past the kneeling man, the sunlight highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around his mouth. \nThe man looks up at James and he recognizes Vaughan, the young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport hospital. \nEXT. AIRFIELD. HANGAR -- DAY \nJames proudly shows off his new car to Catherine and Karen at their offices at the airport. The car is identical to the one he crashed. \nJames sits sideways in the driver's seat, door open, weirdly jaunty. \nCATHERINE I can't believe you've done this. \nKAREN This is the exact same car as your old one, isn't it? \nCATHERINE Yes, it is. (to James) Are you planning to have another car crash? \nJAMES I'm not thinking about the crash at all. \nHELEN This is your car? \nShe reaches out a gloved hand and touches the radiator grill, feeling a chrome pillar torn from the accordion, as if searching for some trace of her husband's presence among the blood-spattered paintwork. \nJAMES You'll tear your gloves. \nJames gently takes her hand and moves it away from the grill. \nJAMES I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult. \nHELEN Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. (pause) I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped. \nJAMES Can I give you a lift? (almost apologetically) I somehow find myself driving again. \nINT. JAMES'S CAR -- DAY \nJames is driving Helen Remington away from the police pound. \nJAMES You haven't told me where we're going. \nHELEN Haven't I? To the airport, if you could. \nAt these words, James is stricken by an odd feeling of loss. \nJAMES The airport? Why? Are you leaving? \nHELEN Not yet -- though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy. \nJAMES I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them. \nHELEN I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to. \nJAMES So -- why the airport? \nHELEN I work in the immigration department there. \nHELEN I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi-driver to drive me around for an hour. 'Anywhere,' I said. We sat in a massive traffic jam under an off- ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards. (pause) I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger -- something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case. \nJAMES The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes? \nHELEN Yes. \nJAMES Isn't that rather too close...? \nHELEN That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment. \nThey have now reached the top level of the multi-story car- park, and James pulls into a parking spot overlooking a major runway. An immense jumbo jet is maneuvering into its take- off position. \nJames turns off the car and puts his arms around Helen. She offers no resistance, as though the whole scenario were well understood and agreed upon. James kisses her mouth, her eyelids, unzips her dress. \nWith the jet engines screaming for accompaniment, Helen lifts her right breast from her brassi\u00e8re, pressing James's fingers against the hot nipple. Helen now straddles him and, awkwardly meshing with the technology around them, they make love in the driver's seat of the car. \nINT. BALLARD APT. -- NIGHT \nJames and Catherine make love in the same position as in the preceding scene. \nJames's thoughts keep flashing back to himself and Helen in his car, the images mixing confusingly with his present lovemaking to Catherine. \nINT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- DAY \nJames is back in his office, but it is obvious that he is only nibbling at the work that has piled up in his absence. Renata comes in. \nRENATA I almost forgot to give you this. Probably because I know you're going to like it. \nRenata hands James a brown manila envelope with no markings on it. \nJAMES What is it? \nRENATA A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discreet about the location. \nJAMES Really? What kind of exhibition is it? \nHELEN That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital. \nJAMES Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash. \nHELEN When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now. \nVAUGHAN (over speakers) The second star is stuntman and former race driver -- Colin Seagrave, who will drive our replica of James Dean's car. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT \nSeagrave, a coarse and burly man, wriggles his way behind the wheel of the delicate little race car without acknowledging the cheers of the crowd. He wears James Dean clothes -- a red windbreaker, a white T-shirt, jeans, loafers, prescription glasses with clip-on sunshades. \nAs he talks, Vaughan tours the phalanx of tripod-mounted cameras to check their placement, and chats off-mike with the pair of cameramen with hand-held cameras. He seems to be more the director of the event, possibly the ringmaster, than an actor in it. \nVAUGHAN (over speakers) I myself shall play the role of James Dean's racing mechanic, Rolf W\u00fctherich, sent over from the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen, Germany. This mechanic was himself fated to die in a car crash in Germany twenty- six years later. And the third and in some ways most important party, the college student Donald Turnupseed, played by movie stuntman Brett Trask. \nTrask, slim and wiry, wearing loafers and a blazer, waves his hand and gets into a replica of Turnupseed's two-tone, black-and-white 1950 Ford sedan. He starts up the Ford, which smokes badly, and drives it up the hill about 100 yards. \nVAUGHAN (over speakers) Turnupseed was on his way back to his home in Fresno for the weekend. James Dean was on his way to an automobile race in Salinas, a dusty town in northern California. The two would only meet for one moment, but it was a moment that would create a Hollywood legend. \nAt this point Vaughan, who is dressed in light-blue cotton 1950s mechanics' overalls, sees James and Helen in the thin crowd and waves to them, as though they were long-standing aficionados of crash spectacles. He doesn't wait to see if they react, but immediately steps into the passenger side of the Porsche, microphone still in hand. \nVAUGHAN (over speakers) You'll notice that we are not wearing helmets or safety padding of any kind, and our cars are not equipped with roll cages or seat-belts. We depend solely on the skill of our drivers for our safety, so that we can bring you the ultimate in authenticity. All right, here we go. The fatal crash of James Dean! \nVaughan hands the microphone to a stills cameraman who also functions as an assistant, and then sinks down into the silver car. \nSeagrave starts the Porsche, which settles quickly into a husky idle. A few blips of the throttle, and then the Porsche is reversed down to the edge of the lighted strip of road. \nWhen the Porsche stops, the excited crowd goes quiet. An assistant with a walkie-talkie kneels beside the silver car on the driver's side, co-ordinating the start with his opposite number standing next to the Ford over the hill. \nThere is a calculated pause before anything happens, and then the Porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the hill. \nFrom their vantage point in the stand, James and Helen can clearly see that the Ford has also started and that the two cars are headed toward each other, each in its respective lane. \nThe Porsche accelerates hard, the Ford lumbers along at a moderate pace, swaying clumsily on its soft springs. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT \nJames follows Vaughan down a cramped corridor to a photographic workshop formed out of a warren of small rooms. Vaughan eases James into the first room and then carefully closes the door behind them. \nJAMES Do you live here? With Seagrave? \nVAUGHAN (laughs) I live in my car. This is my workshop. \nPinned to the walls and lying on the benches among the enamel pails are hundreds of photographs. The floor around the enlarger is littered with half-plate prints, developed and cast aside once they have yielded their images. Vaughan makes a sweeping gesture that takes in all the photographs. \nVAUGHAN And this is the new project, Ballard. \nAs Vaughan hunts around the central table, turning the pages of a leather-bound album, James looks down at the discarded prints below his feet. Most of them are crude frontal pictures of motor-cars and heavy vehicles involved in highway collisions, surrounded by spectators and police, and close- ups of impacted radiator grills and windshields. \nVaughan opens the album at random and hands it to James. He leans back against the door and watches as James adjusts the desk lamp. \nThe first thirty pages record the crash, hospitalization, and post-recuperative romance of the young woman Gabrielle -- a social worker, the photos suggest -- who is currently getting very stoned in the next room. \nBy coincidence, her small sports car had collided with an airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the site of James's own accident. Vaughan had obviously been there, shooting film, moments after the crash. The incredibly detailed photos end with her affair with her physical therapy instructor. \nThe remainder of the album describes the course of James's own accident and recovery, and includes his sexual encounters with Renata, Helen Remington, and his own wife, Catherine. Vaughan stands at James's shoulder, like an instructor ready to help a promising pupil. \nJames closes the book. \nJAMES What kind of help can I possibly be to you? You seem to be everywhere at once as it is. \nAt that moment, there is a knock at the door, and then Gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room on her shackled legs. She holds out a couple of joints to Vaughan. \nGABRIELLE Thought you might be missing these. (to James) So here you are at the nerve centre. Vaughan makes everything look like a crime, doesn't he? \nVaughan takes the joints and lights them both. He hands one to James, who takes it gratefully. \nJAMES What exactly is your project, Vaughan? A book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic? \nVAUGHAN It's something we're all intimately involved in: the reshaping of the human body by modern technology. \nCATHERINE Do you find him attractive? \nJAMES He's very pale. Covered with scars. \nCATHERINE Would you like to fuck him, though? In that car? \nJAMES No. But when he's in that car... \nCATHERINE Have you seen his penis? \nJAMES I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident. \nCATHERINE Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty... \nThey both have huge orgasms within moments of each other. \nINT. HELEN'S CAR -- DAY \nWe are close on the distracted, solicitous face of Helen Remington. \nHELEN Have you come? \nHelen Remington and James are having sex in the back seat of Helen's car, Helen sitting on James's lap with her back to him. She dismounts him and touches his shoulder with an uncertain hand, as though he were a patient she had worked hard to revive. \nEXT. AIRPORT CAR-PARK -- DAY \nHelen's car is parked on the upper level of the airport car- park, which is currently quite busy. Streams of traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular, flow past the car. \nINT. HELEN'S CAR -- DAY \nJames lies against the rear seat of the car while Helen dresses with abrupt movements, straightening her shirt around her hips like a department-store window-dresser jerking a garment on to a mannequin. \nJAMES Please finish your story. \nHELEN The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage. \nRENATA I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift? \nJAMES No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan. \nEXT. FILM STUDIO. PARKING-LOT -- DUSK \nJames walks out into the nearly deserted parking-lot to find two cars parked in front of Vaughan's Lincoln: a police patrol car and Catherine's white sports car. \nOne policeman is inspecting the Lincoln, peering through the dusty windows, with Vaughan fidgeting beside him. The other stands beside Catherine's car, questioning her. \nJames slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to Vaughan. Catherine spots James and walks crisply over to him. \nCATHERINE They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally. \nJAMES Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians. \nAs if taking their cue from this, the policemen walk back to their car. Vaughan watches them go, head raised like a periscope. \nCATHERINE You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours? \nJAMES At home. I couldn't face all this traffic. \nCATHERINE I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive? \nAs Catherine and James walk toward Vaughan, he reaches into the rear seat of his car and pulls out a white sweatshirt. As he takes off his denim jacket, the falling light picks out the scars on his naked abdomen and chest, a constellation of white chips that circle his body from the left armpit down to his crotch. \nEXT. JAMMED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT \nThe Lincoln has entered an immense traffic jam, and brake- lights flare in the evening air. Vaughan sits with one arm out the passenger window. He slaps the door impatiently, pounding the panel with his fist. \nA police car speeds down the descent lane of a flyover, headlights and roof-lamps flashing. Ahead, two policemen steer the traffic from the nearside curb. Warning tripods set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic 'Slow... Slow... Accident... Accident...' \nEventually, they begin to edge past the accident site, which is lit by a circle of police spotlights. Three vehicles -- a taxi, a limousine and a small sports sedan -- have collided where an on-ramp joins the main roadway. A crowd has gathered on the sidewalks and on the pedestrian bridge that spans the road. \nBeside the taxi, its three passengers lie in a group, blankets swathing their chests and legs. First-aid men work on the driver, an elderly man who sits upright against the fender of his car, face and clothes speckled with drops of blood. \nWhen the roof of the sports sedan is levered up, the hair of the driver, its only passenger, comes off with it as though scalped, stuck to the roofliner with drying blood. But it's soon apparent that it's not hair, but rather a cheap, tangled, platinum blond wig. \nVaughan makes his way over to the sedan, intrigued by the dangling 'scalp', which is almost phosphorescent in the road- rescue work lights. Catherine trails obediently behind him, like a harshly disciplined puppy. \nWhen the body of the driver is exposed to the lights, the effect is doubly grotesque, for not only is the driver dead and partially crushed, but he is also a cross-dresser: Seagrave, in Jayne Mansfield drag. His long, greasy hair is tied up in a knot on his head, he is unshaven, his huge, fake bosom is bloody and askew; his bloated, muscular body strains against the pink 60s skirt and jacket, the blue suede boots with high heels. \nThere is also a dead Chihuahua bitch inside the car with Seagrave, which Vaughan manages to move with his foot until a cop, outraged, shoos him away. The dog is stiff with rigor mortis, obviously dead long before the crash. \nAn excited Vaughan has spotted James and now approaches him, breathless. \nVAUGHAN It's Seagrave. He was worried that we would never do Jayne Mansfield's crash, now that the police were cracking down. So he did it himself. \nVaughan turns back to look at the wreck again, almost reverent. This is Seagrave's own solitary work of art. \nVAUGHAN (shakes his head) The dog -- God, the dog is brilliant, perfect. I wonder where he got it? \nNow Vaughan turns to James, his face flushed, incandescent with joy. \nVAUGHAN Come with me, James. I have to document it. \nVaughan lopes off toward the Seagrave wreck. \nBut James hangs back, watching, as the passengers from the taxi are carried on stretchers to an ambulance. The dead chauffeur of the limousine lies with a blanket over his face, while a doctor and two ambulance men climb into the rear compartment. \nBeyond them, Vaughan begins to snap away at every possible aspect of Seagrave's wreck, beginning with the dead Chihuahua. \nEXT. MOTORWAY VERGE -- NIGHT \nSome time later, as the crowd disperses and the traffic begins to flow normally, James kneels beside the Lincoln and shows Vaughan the blood on his door. Catherine sits in the back seat. \nJAMES We must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. \nVaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood. \nVAUGHAN You're right, Ballard. There's an all-night car-wash in the airport service area. \nAt just this moment, Catherine looks into James's eyes in an instant of complete lucidity. Her expression shows both irony and affection, an acceptance of a sexual logic they both recognize and have prepared themselves for. \nJames sits quietly in the front seat as the white soap sluices across the roof and doors like liquid lace. Catherine cries out, a gasp of pain cut off by Vaughan's strong hand across her mouth. He sits back with her legs across his hips, slapping her with his free hand. His sweaty face is clamped in an expression of anger and distress. The blows raise blunted weals on Catherine's arm and hips. \nEXT. DESERTED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT \nJames drives the Lincoln home along a deserted motorway. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT \nThe street-lamps illuminate Vaughan's sleeping face in the rear of the car, scarred mouth lying open like a child's against the sweat-soaked seat. \nCatherine sits forward, freeing herself from Vaughan. She touches James's shoulder in a gesture of domestic affection. In the mirror, James can see the weals on her cheek and neck, the bruised mouth that deforms her nervous smile. \nEXT. BALLARD APT. BUILDING -- NIGHT \nThe Lincoln pulls up at the Ballards' apartment building. James and Catherine get out and stand in the darkness beside the now-immaculate black car. Vaughan is still asleep in the back. James takes Catherine's arm to steady her, holding her bag in his hand. \nAs they walk toward the entrance, Vaughan gets up and climbs unsteadily behind the steering wheel. Without looking back at James and Catherine, he starts the engine and quietly drives off. \nINT. BALLARD APT. BUILDING. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT \nIn the elevator, James holds Catherine closely, lovingly. \nINT. BALLARD APT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nThat night, James kneels over Catherine as she lies diagonally across the bed, her small feet resting on his pillow, one hand over her right breast. \nShe watches him with a calm and affectionate gaze as he explores her body and bruises, feeling them gently with his fingers, lips and cheeks, tracing and interpreting the raw symbols that Vaughan's hands and mouth have left across her skin. \nINT. AIRPORT CONVENTION CENTER. AUTO SHOW -- DAY \nJames and the crippled Gabrielle visit the annual auto show, which occupies the immense halls of the airport convention center. He watches appreciatively as she swings herself on her shackled legs among the hundreds of cars displayed on their stands. \nGabrielle approaches the imposing Mercedes stand and, pivoting about on her heels, seems to take immense pleasure from these immaculate vehicles, placing her scarred hands on their paintwork, rolling her injured hips against them like an unpleasant cat. \nJames stands pacing as the dolly shot is reset, lighting is adjusted. An AD brings him a cellular phone. \nAD Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want it? \nJames nods. The AD presses the TALK button and hands the phone to James. \nJAMES Hello? Ballard. \nINT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT \nWe are close on Vaughan's scarred mouth. \nVAUGHAN I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project. \nJAMES (phone) Where are you? \nEXT. MALL. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT \nJames drives up to the tattoo parlor, which is located in a small mall. It is next to a small, private medical clinic, and has the same antiseptic, untextured look of the ear, nose and throat suite next door. \nINT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT \nJames enters to discover Vaughan getting a wound tattoo on his abdomen, one that looks as though it could have been made by the fluted lower edge of a plastic steering wheel. The woman giving Vaughan the tattoo is sexless and professional. She could be a nurse or a hospital dietician. \nJames sits next to them, barely acknowledged by the woman. Vaughan has messy papers spread out in front of him that include stylized sketches of famous crash wounds, photos of Andy Warhol's scars, automotive styling-detail drawings from a 50s Detroit design studio. \nVAUGHAN (to tattooist) You're making it too clean. \nTATTOOIST Medical tattoos are supposed to be clean. \nVAUGHAN This isn't a medical tattoo. This is a prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty and ragged. Make it dirty and ragged. \nTATTOOIST (a hint of sarcasm) Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy or global prophesy? \nVAUGHAN There's no difference. James -- I want you to let her give you this one. \nKnowing that Vaughan will not stop, will kill him, James presses himself against the concrete wall. The Lincoln swerves after him, its right-hand fender striking the rear wheel housing of the car James has just left. It swings away, ripping the open passenger door from its hinges. \nA column of exploding dust and torn newspaper rises into the air as it slides sideways across the access road. The Lincoln remounts the curb on the far side of the road, crushing a ten-yard section of the wooden palisade. \nJames can see Vaughan flicking a look back, his hard eyes calculating whether or not he can make a second pass at him. The rear wheels regain their traction on the road surface and the car swings away on to the motorway above. \nJames leans against the roof of the abandoned car. The passenger door has been crushed into the front fender, the deformed metal welded together by the impact. \nJames retches suddenly and emptily. \nShreds of torn paper eddy through the air around him, pasting themselves at various points against the crushed door panel and radiator hood. \nEXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- DAY \nJames sits on the balcony of his apartment, watching the sky. A single-engined airplane floats above the motorway, a glass dragonfly carried by the sun. It seems to hang motionless, the propeller rotating slowly like a toy aircraft's. The light pours from its wings in a ceaseless fountain. \nBelow it, the traffic moves sluggishly along the crowded concrete lanes, the roofs of the vehicles forming a continuous carapace of polished cellulose. \nSuddenly, Catherine is behind him. She puts her hands on his shoulders and he turns to her as though in a dream, gestures toward the airplane. \nJAMES I thought that was you, up there. \nCATHERINE My last lesson's next week. (pause) James... my car... \nJames can see now that Catherine is frightened. He takes her hand. \nJAMES What? Tell me. \nEXT. BALLARD APT. DRIVEWAY -- DAY \nCatherine's car sits in the driveway. The paintwork along the left-hand side has been marked in some minor collision. Catherine and James stand examining the mark soberly, archeologists faced with a problematic hieroglyph. \nCATHERINE I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking-lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate? \nJAMES One of your suitors? \nAt first she fails to recognize him. Her firm eyes cut across him to Catherine's elegant figure, as if suspicious of her cross-legged posture. \nJames gets out of the car and approaches Vera. He points to the suitcases in the rear seat of Vera's car. \nJAMES Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm trying to find Vaughan. \nVera finishes with the girl and, still staring at Catherine, steps into her car. \nVERA The police are after him. An American serviceman was killed on the Northolt overpass. \nJames puts his hand on the windshield, but she switches on the windshield wipers, almost cutting the knuckle of his wrist. \nVERA I was with him in the car at the time. \nBefore James can stop her, she accelerates toward the exit and turns into the fast evening traffic. \nJames gets back into Catherine's car. \nJAMES I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport. \nCATHERINE James... \nJames turns the car into the traffic. \nEXT. AIRPORT ROADWAYS -- NIGHT \nVaughan is waiting for them at the airport flyover. He makes no attempt to hide himself, pushing his heavy car into the passing traffic stream. \nApparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward when the lights change. His left hand drums across the rim of the steering wheel as he swerves the Lincoln to and fro across the road surface. \nHis face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out of the traffic lanes, surging ahead in the fast lane until he is abreast of them and then sliding back behind them, allowing other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watchful position in the slow lane. \nJames can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching the ground as Vaughan corners. \nWhen they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his move. He pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously across three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside. The nose of the Lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car, which spins down the road. \nEXT. POLICE POUND. GATEHOUSE -- NIGHT \nJames stands talking to the officer at the gatehouse window, holding Catherine's arm around his waist, pressing her fingers against the muscles of his stomach. \nJAMES I'd like to register a claim for the black 1963 Lincoln, the one that came in a couple of days ago. Is there a form I can fill out? \nPOUND OFFICER There certainly is, but you'll have to come back between 7:30 and 4:30 to get one. What's your attachment to that thing? \nJAMES A close friend owned it. \nPOUND OFFICER Well, it's got to be a total write- off. I don't see what you could possibly do with it. \nEXT. CROWDED RAIN-STREAKED ROADWAY -- SUNSET \nWe are close on the huge, battle-scarred grill of Vaughan's Lincoln, now brought back to swaying, bellowing life. \nThe restoration of the Lincoln is as Vaughan would have wanted it: just enough to get it running and nothing more, with ugly brown primer slapped on to the replaced panels, and whatever was cracked, scraped and crumpled still cracked, scraped and crumpled -- a mobile accident rolling on badly misaligned wheels. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- SUNSET \nWe pull back to see James alone in the car. The road is crowded and manic; James is intense, hard, exhilarated, alert -- a hunter. The car is full of junk, pop cans, styrofoam containers, all suggesting that he has basically been living in the car for some time. \nJames is searching for something among the lanes of traffic, threading the immense car in and out of the shifting holes that appear and disappear, driving with a fluid recklessness that is recognizably Vaughan's style. \nSuddenly, James becomes tense, focused: he has spotted what he has been looking for. \nEXT. CROWDED RAIN-STREAKED ROADWAY -- SUNSET \nThrough the Lincoln's insect- and oil-smeared windshield we can see the unmistakable shape of Catherine's white sports car, itself winding its way aggressively through the braids of vehicles. \nThe Lincoln lurches out on to the narrow emergency lane and takes off after Catherine's car, scraping the low concrete wall as it wallows from side to side, clipping the corner of a truck that has made the lane too narrow. \nINT. CATHERINE'S SPORTS CAR -- SUNSET \nIn her mirrors, Catherine spots the Lincoln charging toward her along the emergency lane. Her demeanor is just as predatory as James's, and she does not hesitate to react. \n", "test1_input": "JAMES What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet? \nCATHERINE No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her. \nEXT. ROAD HOME FROM HOSPITAL -- DAY \nCatherine and James travel home in the back seat of a taxi. Learning against the rear window of the taxi, James finds himself flinching with excitement toward the approaching traffic streams, which now seem threatening and super-real. \nCatherine watches him, aware that he is over-exhilarated, very excited herself by his new sensitivity to the traffic. \nEXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- DAY \nJames sits in a reclining chair on the balcony of his apartment, looking down through the anodized balcony rails at the neighborhood ten stories below. \nCars fill the suburban streets, choking the parking-lots of the supermarkets, ramped on to the pavements. Two minor accidents have caused a massive tail-back along the flyover which crosses the entrance tunnel to the airport. In one of them, a white laundry-van has bumped into the back of a sedan filled with wedding guests. \nJames gazes raptly down at this immense motion sculpture, this incomprehensible pinball machine. \nCatherine comes on to the balcony, kneels down beside him, begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees. \nCATHERINE Renata tells me you're going to rent a car. \nJAMES I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant. \nCATHERINE How can you drive? James... your legs. You can barely walk. \nJAMES Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident. \nCATHERINE I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you? \nJAMES I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine. \nCATHERINE I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her. \nJAMES You're not envious? \n", "test1_true": "INT. BALLARD APT. GARAGE -- DAY \nJames stands at the entrance to his apartment building's underground garage. Only about a dozen cars are there; most of them have been driven to work. James walks among those that remain, absorbing the details of the personal things left in them -- a silk scarf lies on a rear window-sill, a pair of sunglasses hooked over a carpeted transmission hump. \nJames stops in front of the empty bay marked 'Balladr'. He stares at the familiar pattern of oil-stains marking the cement. \nINT. RENTED CAR -- DAY \nA steering wheel, an instrument panel, a windshield. Renata's hips gripped by the fabric of the passenger seat, her legs stowed out of sight beneath her red plastic raincoat. James drives Renata in a rented car, his first drive since the accident. \nEXT. FIRST CRASH SITE -- DAY \nThe rented car slows and stops on the concrete verge a few yards from the spot where James's crash took place. \nINT. RENTED CAR -- DAY \nRENATA Are we allowed to park here? \nJAMES No. \nRENATA I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case. \nJames unbuttons Renata's raincoat and places his hand on her thigh. She lets him kiss her throat, holding his shoulder reassuringly, like an affectionate governess. \nJAMES There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it? \nRENATA I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil. \nJAMES You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love. \nRENATA Are you still involving me in your crash? \nAn airline coach passes, the passengers bound for Milan staring down at the couple in the car. Renata buttons her coat. \nEXT. FIRST CRASH SITE -- DAY \n", "test2_input": "Just as James and Helen step on the road, six police cars, lights flashing and sirens wailing, converge on the lit stretch of road, three from each end. They screech to a halt and dozens of cops pour out of the cars. \nThe crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to the road. A loudspeaker mounted on one of the police cars begins to blare. \nPOLICE (over loudspeaker) This is an illegal and unauthorized automotive demonstration which is in contravention of the Highway Traffic Act. You are all liable to fines and possible arrest and confinement... Disperse at once! Disperse at once! \nBecause James and Helen are just in advance of the first wave of spectators, they manage to link up with Vaughan as he helps haul a still-groggy Seagrave off the road and into the woods. Helen takes Seagrave's free arm. \nHELEN (to Vaughan) What's the matter with Seagrave? \nVAUGHAN Hit his head, I think. His balance is off. \nThe police spread out through the crowd, collaring people at random before they are able to escape into the woods. \nEXT. WOODS -- NIGHT \nJames and Helen help Vaughan hustle Seagrave through the woods. The din of the roadway fades away behind them. \nJAMES Why are the police taking this all so seriously? \nVAUGHAN It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are. \nIn the gathering darkness of the woods, it is apparent that James doesn't really know who they are either. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- NIGHT \nVaughan drives the Lincoln through a scarred, bleak landscape. In the front seat with him are Helen and James. Seagrave is lying down in the back seat with his eyes closed. \nVAUGHAN That was glib, wasn't it? 'James Dean died of a broken neck and became immortal.' But I couldn't resist. \nVaughan puts his hand between Helen's thighs. She seems not to notice, but her eyes close dreamily every once in a while. James watches microscopically. \nSometimes, when the flow of traffic allows, Vaughan stares intently at James while his hand works away between Helen's thighs, and James looks away, flushed, like a schoolgirl. \nEXT. SEAGRAVE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "They get out of the car, helping the woozy Seagrave through the door at the side of the showroom, which leads to the stairway up to the apartment above the garage. \nINT. SEAGRAVE APT. -- NIGHT \nThe Seagrave apartment is dirty and depressing, featuring cheap, cigarette-scarred leatherette furniture. \nJames watches Helen and Vaughan steer Seagrave into the living- room, where two people sit on a couch watching television with the sound turned off: Gabrielle, a sharp-faced young woman who is rolling a hash joint; and Seagrave's wife, Vera, a handsome, restless woman of about thirty. \nVera stands as they come in and rushes over to the shaky Seagrave. \nVERA Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie down. \nVera and Helen lay the confused Seagrave down on the three- seat sofa, while Vaughan sits next to Gabrielle and helps her prepare another hash joint. James, awkwardly left standing, notices long scars on Vera's thighs and legs. \nHELEN They did the James Dean crash. It seemed to go perfectly. But he started to feel nauseous on the way back. I'm sure it's concussion. \nVERA Ah, well... We're familiar enough with that, then, aren't we? \nJames watches Gabrielle and Vaughan. As she rolls a small piece of resin in a twist of silver foil, Vaughan brings a brass lighter out of his hip pocket. Gabrielle cooks the resin, and shakes the powder into the open cigarette waiting in the roller machine on her lap. \nOn Gabrielle's legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus scars, faint circular depressions on the kneecaps. She notices James staring at her scars, but makes no effort to close her legs. \nOn the sofa beside her is a chromium metal cane and, as she shifts her weight, James sees that the instep of each leg is held in the steel clamp of a surgical support. It now becomes obvious from the over-rigid posture of her waist that she is also wearing a back-brace of some kind. \nGabrielle rolls another cigarette out of the machine, but does not offer it to James. Instead, Vaughan gets up and takes it over to Seagrave, who has managed to sit up. \nVAUGHAN I'd really like to work out the details of the Jayne Mansfield crash with you. We could do the decapitation -- her head embedded in the windshield -- and the little dead dog thing as well. You know, the Chihuahuas in the back seat. I've got it figured out. \nSeagrave takes the lit joint and draws heavily on it. He holds the smoke in his lungs for a while, studies the grease on his hands before he answers. \nCOLIN You know I'll be ready, Vaughan. But I'll want to wear really big tits -- out to here -- so the crowd can see them get cut up and crushed on the dashboard. \nJames turns to go, leaving Helen to her conversation with Vera, but Vaughan follows him through the door, holding his arm in a powerful grip. \nVAUGHAN Don't leave yet, Ballard. I want you to help me. \n", "test3_input": "James looks down at the silk-suited wife of a Ministry official standing beside him. Her eyes watch the film with a rapt gaze, as if she were seeing herself and her daughters dismembered in the crash. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT \nJames rides in Vaughan's car. Vaughan drives aggressively, rolling the heavy car along the access roads, holding the battered bumpers a few feet behind any smaller vehicle until it moves out of the way. \nVAUGHAN I've always wanted to drive a crashed car. \nJAMES You could get your wish at any moment. \nVAUGHAN No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus's Facel Vega, or Nathaniel West's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else. \nJAMES Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car crash? \nVAUGHAN The case could be made. \nThey approach a major intersection. For almost the first time on this drive, Vaughan applies the brakes. \nThe heavy car sways and goes into a long right-hand slide which carries it across the path of a taxi. Flooring the accelerator, Vaughan swerves in front of it, tires screaming over the blaring horn of the taxi. \nAs they settle down, Vaughan reaches behind him and lifts a briefcase off the back seat. \nVAUGHAN Take a look at this and tell me what you think. \nJames opens the briefcase and slides out a thick packet of glossy photographs, all of them marked up with coloured ink pens. \nThe photos are culled from a variety of sources -- newspapers, magazines, video stills, film frames -- blown up to uniform 8' x 10' size. Each one depicts a famous crash victim in the prime of life, and each one has the wounds to come marked up very explicitly -- lines circling their necks and pubic areas, breasts and cheekbones shaded in, section lines across their mouths and abdomens. Handwritten notes complement the circles and arrows. \nA second packet of photographs shows the cars in which these famous people died. Each photo is marked to show which parts of the cars destroyed or fused with which famous body part: for example, a close-up of the dashboard and windshield from the Camus car -- Michel Gallimard's Facel Vega -- is marked 'nasal bridge', 'soft palate', 'left zygomatic arch'. \nJAMES It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why. \nVAUGHAN It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event -- a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project. \nJAMES What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project. \n", "test3_true": "The traffic has jammed up to a walking pace. Using his horn, Vaughan forces the drivers in the slower lanes to back up and let him across on to the hard shoulder. Once free, he accelerates past the lines of traffic, occasionally scraping the right flank of the Lincoln against the cement divider. In the distance the airport car-park looms. \nINT. AIRPORT CAR-PARK -- DAY \nThe Lincoln spirals its way up toward the upper levels of the airport carpark. James just spots a sharp-faced young woman in a very short skirt, an airport whore, provocatively bent over a railing ostensibly to watch airplanes land and take off, when Vaughan slams on the brakes and jumps out of the car. \nVAUGHAN You drive. \nThe startled James numbly obeys, sliding over into the driver's seat as Vaughan approaches the whore and begins to negotiate with her. James gingerly maneuvers the boat-like car to one side to allow traffic to pass as Vaughan returns with the gum-chewing whore in tow. \nAs the girl, with short black hair and a boy's narrow-hipped body, opens the passenger door, Vaughan hands her a joint and lights it for her. Then, lifting her chin, he puts his fingers in her mouth and plucks out the knot of gum, flicking it away into the darkness. \nVAUGHAN Let's get rid of that. I don't want you blowing it up my urethra. \nEXT. AIRPORT ROADS -- NIGHT \nJames drives the Lincoln along the bizarrely lighted roads that ring the airport. Vaughan and the whore are in the back seat. \nINT. LINCOLN -- NIGHT \nJames adjusts the rear-view mirror so that he can see into the rear seat. Vaughan is having strange, disconnected sex with the whore. James realizes that he can almost control the sexual act behind him by the way in which he drives the car. \nIt is, in that sense, a sexual threesome -- or, more properly, a foursome, because the sex between Vaughan and the whore takes place in the hooded grottoes of the luminescent dials, surging needles and blinking lights of the black, brooding Lincoln. \nINT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- DAY \nJames and Renata sort through some storyboards together at the architect's table. Renata takes a few cast-offs and walks past the window toward the filing cabinet. She takes a quick peek out the window on her way. \nRENATA Your friend's still out there. \nJames leaves the table and looks out the window. Vaughan is sitting in his car in the center of the parking-lot. Most of the staff are leaving for home, taking their cars one by one from the slots around Vaughan's dusty limousine. \nRENATA What does he want from you? \nJAMES Hard to say. \n"}

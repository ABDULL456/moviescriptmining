{"test1_input": "James steps from the car, his right knee giving way after the effort of driving. At his feet lies a litter of dead leaves, cigarette cartons and small drifts of safety-glass crystals. \nA hundred yards behind them, a dusty old Lincoln is also parked on the verge. The leather-jacketed driver watches James through his mudspattered windshield, broad shoulders hunched against the door pillar. As James crosses the road the man picks up a camera fitted with a zoom lens and peers at James through the eye-piece. \nSpotting the man, Renata opens the car door for James. \nRENATA Who is that man? Is he a private detective? \nJames gets back into the car. \nINT. RENTED CAR -- DAY \nRENATA Can you drive? \nJAMES I can drive. \nJames shifts the car into gear and cruises slowly toward the man with the camera. As they approach him, he gets out of his own car, ignoring them, and kneels down to study the hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface. \nAs James and Renata drive past the kneeling man, the sunlight highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around his mouth. \nThe man looks up at James and he recognizes Vaughan, the young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport hospital. \nEXT. AIRFIELD. HANGAR -- DAY \nJames proudly shows off his new car to Catherine and Karen at their offices at the airport. The car is identical to the one he crashed. \nJames sits sideways in the driver's seat, door open, weirdly jaunty. \nCATHERINE I can't believe you've done this. \nKAREN This is the exact same car as your old one, isn't it? \nCATHERINE Yes, it is. (to James) Are you planning to have another car crash? \nJAMES I'm not thinking about the crash at all. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. POLICE POUND -- DAY \nJames enters the gate of the police pound on foot, and shows his pass to the guard at the gate. His pass now stamped, he hesitates for a beat before he enters. \nINT. POLICE POUND -- DAY \nSome twenty or so crashed vehicles are parked in the sunlight against the rear wall of an abandoned cinema. At the far end of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abruptly contracted around the body of the driver. \nUnnerved by these deformations, James moves from one car to the next until he comes to his own. The remains of towing tackle are attached to the front bumper, and the body panels are splashed with oil and dirt. He peers through the windows into the cabin, runs his hand over the mud-stained glass. \nWithout thinking, he kneels in front of the car and stares at the crushed fenders and radiator grill. \nTwo policemen cross the yard with a black Alsatian dog. They watch James hovering around his car as if they vaguely resent his touching it. When they are gone, he unlatches the driver's door and, with an effort, pulls it open. \nJames eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat, tipped back by the bowing of the floor. He nervously lifts his legs into the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the pedals, which have been forced out of the engine compartment so that his knees are pressed against his chest. \nThe two policemen are exercising their dog across the yard. James opens the glove compartment, forcing the shelf downwards. Inside, covered with dirt and flaked plastic, are a set of route maps, a mildly pornographic novel, a polaroid of Renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with her breasts exposed. \nJames pulls open the ashtray, which promptly jumps on to his lap, releasing a dozen lipstick-smeared butts. \nSomeone passes in front of the car. A policeman's voice calls from the gatehouse. Through the windshield, James sees a woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wrecked cars. The woman -- Helen Remington -- approaches the car next to his, a crushed convertible involved in a massive rear-end collision. \nJames sits quietly behind the steering wheel. Helen turns from the convertible. She glances at the hood of James's car, clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her husband. As she raises her head she sees James through the glassless windshield frame, sitting behind the deformed steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband. \nHelen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one hand rises involuntarily to her cheek. She takes in the damage to the car, then takes in James. Without giving away anything, she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns and comes back as James gets out of his car. \nShe gestures toward the damaged vehicles, then speaks to James as though continuing a conversation already in progress. \nHELEN After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one? (pause) I'm trying to find Charles's car. \nJAMES It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people... \nHELEN They said it was here. They told me this morning. \nShe peers critically at James's car, as if puzzled by its distorted geometry. \n", "test1_id": 2694, "test2_input": "James stands pacing as the dolly shot is reset, lighting is adjusted. An AD brings him a cellular phone. \nAD Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want it? \nJames nods. The AD presses the TALK button and hands the phone to James. \nJAMES Hello? Ballard. \nINT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT \nWe are close on Vaughan's scarred mouth. \nVAUGHAN I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project. \nJAMES (phone) Where are you? \nEXT. MALL. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT \nJames drives up to the tattoo parlor, which is located in a small mall. It is next to a small, private medical clinic, and has the same antiseptic, untextured look of the ear, nose and throat suite next door. \nINT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT \nJames enters to discover Vaughan getting a wound tattoo on his abdomen, one that looks as though it could have been made by the fluted lower edge of a plastic steering wheel. The woman giving Vaughan the tattoo is sexless and professional. She could be a nurse or a hospital dietician. \nJames sits next to them, barely acknowledged by the woman. Vaughan has messy papers spread out in front of him that include stylized sketches of famous crash wounds, photos of Andy Warhol's scars, automotive styling-detail drawings from a 50s Detroit design studio. \nVAUGHAN (to tattooist) You're making it too clean. \nTATTOOIST Medical tattoos are supposed to be clean. \nVAUGHAN This isn't a medical tattoo. This is a prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty and ragged. Make it dirty and ragged. \nTATTOOIST (a hint of sarcasm) Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy or global prophesy? \nVAUGHAN There's no difference. James -- I want you to let her give you this one. \n", "test2_true": "JAMES Where do you think that one should go? \nVaughan spreads his legs in a mechanical, unsexual way and grabs the right inner thigh of his greasy jeans. \nVAUGHAN It should go here. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT \nWe are close on the fresh tattoo on James's inner thigh. It looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real wound. We can see it because James's trousers are down around his knees. \nVaughan's face comes into frame. He gently kisses the tattoo. James lifts Vaughan's face to his own and kisses his mouth, touches his tongue to each of the scars around Vaughan's mouth. \nEXT. UNDERPASS NEAR AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT \nWe see that the Lincoln sits in the shadow of an underpass at the edge of an abandoned auto-wrecker's yard, looking quite comfortable next to the stacks of crushed auto hulks and piles of wheels and bumpers visible through the chain- link fence. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT \nJames and Vaughan show their wounds to each other, exposing the scars on their chests and hands to the beckoning injury sites on the interior of the car, to the pointed sills of the chromium ashtrays, to the curtain of wheel covers hanging on a web of twisted wire just outside the car window. \nThey touch, embrace, kiss. \nEXT. UNDERPASS NEAR AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT \nJames steps unsteadily from the Lincoln into the roadway, followed for an instant by Vaughan's uncertain arm reaching for him. \nHe moves away from the car, along the palisade to the overgrown entrance of the wrecker's yard. Above him, the cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks. \nEXT. AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT \nJust outside the fence of the auto-wrecker's yard, a wreck, its engine and wheels removed, sits on its axles. James opens the door on its rusting hinges. A confetti of fragmented glass covers the front passenger seat. \nJames gets in and sits there for a moment, crouched over the mudstreaked instrument panel, his knees tightened against his chest wall. A moment or two of this strangely comforting foetal security, and then James unfolds and begins to get back out of the car. \nAn engine starts with a roar. As James steps back into the roadway he is briefly aware of a heavy black vehicle accelerating toward him from the shadow of the overpass where he and Vaughan embraced together. Its white-walled tires tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in the gutter, mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him. \n", "test2_id": 2695, "test3_input": "At first she fails to recognize him. Her firm eyes cut across him to Catherine's elegant figure, as if suspicious of her cross-legged posture. \nJames gets out of the car and approaches Vera. He points to the suitcases in the rear seat of Vera's car. \nJAMES Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm trying to find Vaughan. \nVera finishes with the girl and, still staring at Catherine, steps into her car. \nVERA The police are after him. An American serviceman was killed on the Northolt overpass. \nJames puts his hand on the windshield, but she switches on the windshield wipers, almost cutting the knuckle of his wrist. \nVERA I was with him in the car at the time. \nBefore James can stop her, she accelerates toward the exit and turns into the fast evening traffic. \nJames gets back into Catherine's car. \nJAMES I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport. \nCATHERINE James... \nJames turns the car into the traffic. \nEXT. AIRPORT ROADWAYS -- NIGHT \nVaughan is waiting for them at the airport flyover. He makes no attempt to hide himself, pushing his heavy car into the passing traffic stream. \nApparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward when the lights change. His left hand drums across the rim of the steering wheel as he swerves the Lincoln to and fro across the road surface. \nHis face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out of the traffic lanes, surging ahead in the fast lane until he is abreast of them and then sliding back behind them, allowing other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watchful position in the slow lane. \nJames can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching the ground as Vaughan corners. \nWhen they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his move. He pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously across three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside. The nose of the Lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car, which spins down the road. \n", "test3_true": "Catherine and James slam spinning into the tail of a tanker which has all but stopped. The traffic behind them has already been slowing and thus easily avoids hitting the sports car when it comes bouncing to a halt across two traffic lanes. \nCatherine lies back, sprawled in her seat, eyes wide and staring with fright, body rigid, bleeding from a small cut on her cheekbone. James jumps out of the car, then immediately slows with a limp. He continues, working his way doggedly through the motionless cars to the edge of the ramp. \nWhen he looks over the edge, James sees that Vaughan's Lincoln has plunged into the top of an airline coach which was running on the roadway below. With the Lincoln now inside it, the coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other vehicles. \nWreckage, flames and blood are everywhere. \nJames's eyes are wide: not with horror, but with excitement. \nEXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT \nCatherine and James stand at the gatehouse of the police pound, collecting the gate key from the mustachioed, sharp- eyed young officer there. \nThey then walk down the lines of seized and abandoned vehicles. The pound is in darkness, lit only by the street- lights reflected in the dented chromium. \nThey soon find Vaughan's crashed Lincoln, massive and charismatic even here, even in death. James manages to wrench open the passenger-side rear door enough to allow them both to get inside. \nINT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT \nSitting in the rear seat of the Lincoln, Catherine and James make brief, ritual love, her buttocks held tightly in his hands as she sits across his waist. \nEXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT \nAfterwards, they walk among the cars. The beams of small headlamps cut across their knees. An open car has stopped beside the gatehouse. Two women sit behind the windshield, peering into the darkness. \nA pause, and then the car moves forward, its driver turning the wheel until the headlamps illuminate the remains of the dismembered vehicle in which Vaughan died. \nThe woman in the passenger seat steps out and pauses briefly by the gates. It is Helen Remington. When she helps the driver out of the car, James and Catherine see that it is the crippled Gabrielle, her leg shackles clacking as she and Helen begin to walk toward Vaughan's car. \nThey stroll haltingly, arms around each other, like strange lovers in a cemetery visiting a favorite mausoleum. At one point, Helen kisses Gabrielle's hand, and it is obvious that they have become lovers. \nJames and Catherine circle away from the couple and make their way back to the gatehouse. \nIn the depths of the pound, Helen helps Gabrielle into the Lincoln. In the darkness of the back seat, they embrace. \n", "test3_id": 2696}

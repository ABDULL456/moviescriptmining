They embrace each other. 
B.B. I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me - I dreamed of you? 
The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins to creep into her voice; 
THE BRIDE Every single night, baby. 
She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better look at her. 
THE BRIDE Now let me look at you. My my my... What a pretty girl you are. 
B.B. You're pretty too, Mommy. 
B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair. 
THE BRIDE Thank you. 
All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor. 
BILL When I showed you Mommy's picture, tell Mommy what you said. 
The little girl gets shy. 
BILL 
C'mon shy girl, you know what you said, tell Mommy, it'll make her fell good. 
As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says; 
B.B. I said - I said - You're the most beautiful woman I ever saw in the whole white world. 
BILL That's the truth. That's what she said. 
B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the Bride's wedding gown. 
B.B. What's that? 
MOMMY Oh, Mommy spilled something on her dress. 
B.B. Blood? 
MOMMY No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid? 
B.B. No. 
BILL Do you not like it, or do you not know what it is? 
Parroting Bill; 
B.B. I do not know what it is. 
MOMMY Well, it's a very tasty beverage that I used to drink, when I was a little girl. It comes in a lot of different flavors and colors, and it's really good. Maybe we should fix some sometime. Want to do that? 
The little girl gives a big nod, yes. 
BILL Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating, I think it's dinner time don't you? 
B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes. 
BILL (to Mommy) When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you didn't happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old, did ya? 
MOMMY No. 
BILL (wiping imaginary sweat off his brow) Whew, then dinner should be done. (shouting to the other room) Josephina! You can come out now, we're ready for dinner. 
JOSEPHINA (O.S.) Yes, Mr. Bill. 
He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then says to B.B.; 
BILL Want to go on top of the world? 
She says excitedly; 
B.B. Yeah! 
He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of their songs. 
INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT 
The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating. 
BILL B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world? 
B.B. Yes I do. 
BILL In fact it's better than pretty. What's better than pretty? 
B.B. Gorgeous. 
BILL Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous. 
The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill. 
BILL You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy. 
B.B. 
Why? Where you a bad daddy? 
BILL I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy. (to Mommy) Our little girl learned about life and death the other day. (to B.B.) You want to tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio? 
B.B. I killed him. I didn't mean to, but I stepped on him and he stopped moving. 
BILL Emilio was her goldfish. She came running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said, "Really, that's so sad. How did he die?" And what did you say? 
B.B. I stepped on him. 
BILL Actually young lady, the words you so strategically used were, "I accidentally stepped on him." Right? 
B.B. Yeah. 
BILL To which I queried, "And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him. (beat) Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the 
carpet? And Mommy, you would have been real proud of her, because she didn't lie. She said she took Emilio out of his bowl, and put him on the carpet. And what was Emilio doing on the carpet, baby? 
B.B. He was -- flapping. 
BILL And then you stomped on him? 
B.B. Uh-huh. 
BILL And when you lifted your foot up, what was Emilio doing then? 
B.B. Nothing. 
BILL He stopped flapping, didn't he? 
B.B. Uh-huh. 
BILL And you knew what that meant, didn't you? 
B.B. Uh-huh. 
BILL What did that mean? 
B.B. He was dead. 
BILL (to Mommy) She told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. So powerful even a five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better. And I asked her, why did she step on Emilio? And she said, she didn't know. But I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right? 
B.B. Uh-huh. 
BILL And what happens when you stomp on Emilio, is you kill him. And you discovered that, didn't you?

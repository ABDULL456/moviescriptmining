You almost drowned, Edmund was almost killed! \nEDMUND Which is why we have to stay. \nThey all look at him. \nEDMUND I've seen what the White Witch can do and I've helped her do it, and we can't leave these people behind to suffer for it. \nLucy holds Ed's hand. \nSUSAN Well I guess that's it then. *gets up* \nPETER Where are you going? \nSUSAN (picks up bow and quiver) To get in some practice. \nNarnians cheer. \nWHITE WITCH How will I know your promise will be kept? \nAslan roars. the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians laugh.

First let him be shaved. \nMore jeers and catcalls... \nWHITE WITCH Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever! \nWHITE WITCH You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed in you. Did you really think that by giving your life you would save the Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your life, and saving no one. So much for love. \nWHITE WITCH In that knowledge... Despair... and DIE!!!!!! \nShe plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes slowly close \nGRYPHON They come, you highness, in numbers and weapons far greater then our own. \nOREIUS Numbers do not win a battle \nPETER No, but I bet they help \nArrival of the Witch's army \nWHITE WITCH I take no interest in prisoners.

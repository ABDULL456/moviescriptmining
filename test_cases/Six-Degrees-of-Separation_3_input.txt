OUISA We can skip the shmoozing. Pick the boy up, take him to the police and be at Sotheby's before eight. 
INT A FORMAL DINING ROOM Of all the PARTIES we've been to, this is the most luxurious of all, given by one of New York's legendary hostess's, a glamorous woman who must be in her late 80s, MRS. BANNISTER. OUISA and FLAN are here. This dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that United Nations type at MRS. BANNISTER'S right. But FLAN and OUISA have captured the table. 
OUISA t The story ended there... 
FLAN It did not! Clearly OUISA is as disturbed by the telling of the events as FLAN is energized. 
OUISA There are so many other people here tonight. We didn't mean to take up so much MRS. BANNISTER slams her napkin down. 
MRS. BANNISTER No! It's my supper and I command you to sing! 
FLAN We called our new best friend, the detective. 
OUISA We told them Paul was at the Waverly theater. FLAN (to his dinner partner) Sixth Avenue and Third Street. The lobby. 
OUISA But we had promised Paul that we would bring him to the police. We told the police he was special. 
FLAN Well, Ouisa did. 
OUISA The detective said he'd honor our promise. 
FLAN We skipped the cocktails 
OUISA But we didn't count on 
EXT TRAFFIC ON FIFTH AVENUE OUISA and FLAN in dinner clothes are stuck in a traffic jam. 
OUISA (VO) Traffic traffic traffic FLAN gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of honking horns. 
EXT WAVERLY MOVIE THEATER, GREENWICH VILLAGE NIGHT FLAN and OUISA speed up Sixth Avenue and double park in front of the Waverly Movie Theater. Two Cop cars are there. Red lights spinning. PEOPLE gape on the street. 
THEY see PAUL being dragged into one of the two Cop cars, t kicking and screaming. THE COPS throw PAUL into the back seat. FLAN tries to talk to one of the POLICE while OUISA runs up to the Cop car window. PAUL, being handcuffed, looks at OUISA. HE smiles as if HE's bumped into DUISA at a cocktail party. 
PAUL The Kandinsky is painted on both sides. DUISA is startled. THE COP slams the car door on PAUL. 
OUISA Paul? Officer? Let me go with you - I promised I'd take him! 
OFFICER Lady. Out of the way -- FLAN takes OUISA's-arm. 
OUISA We have to do soaething! 
FLAN 
Let's just get the hell out of here. THE COP CAR pulls away, sirens blaring. PAUL turns and looks at OUISA. Betrayal. 
BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM 
MRS. BANNISTER There's nothing more you can do - 
FLAN What could we do? We tried. 
OUISA went to the precinct. 
INT THE PRECINCT DAY DUISA hands the detective's card to the DESK CLERK. 
CLERK He's transferred. 
OUISA Since yesterday? He's been handling this 
CLERK He's transferred - 
OUISA This is about an arrest made yesterday at the Waverly Movie theater - THE CLERK checks the records. 
CLERK This precinct didn't do any business at the Waverly Theater. 
OUISA I didn't imagine it - 
CLERK I'm not saying you did. 
OUISA Could you find out which precinct - THE CLERK looks through the book. 
CLERK The name? 
OUISA Poitier. He's a young black man. Or maybe Kittredge. I don't know the exact name - 
CLERK Are you family? 
OUISA Not exactly. But the detective promised me yesterday that I could go with the young man when he was arraigned to let them know he was special. 
CLERK We have no record of it. Some other precinct must have made the arrest. It sounds like your special friend was wanted for something else.

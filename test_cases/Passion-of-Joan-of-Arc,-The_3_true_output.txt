34   But Jean d'Estivet is incapable of controlling himself. He gets up, goes right up to her, spits in her face and hisses: 
Do you not understand that what you are saying is blasphemy? 
Then he goes back to his place. But on Joan's face there lingers the expression of one who is far removed from this world. From time to time throughout this episode two of the judges, Nicolas de Houppeville and Martin Ladvenu, have been seen to show signs of sympathy for the accused. 
35   After this last outrage on the part of the Promoter, de Houppeville can control himself no longer. Provoked to the limit, he rises and shouts: 
This is unworthy ... 
The whole room turns to him in amazement. He continues fearlessly: 
... it is persecution! 
36   He leaves his place; Ladvenu tries to restrain him, but he approaches the bishop and says to him: 
We are treating this woman like an enemy - not like a human being on trial! 
37   Then he casts a look full of tenderness at Joan, who at this moment is drying her cheeks, still wet from Jean d'Estivet's spittle. Houppeville continues: 
For me she is a saint! 
He goes over to her, genuflects before her, and turns to go out through the door. 
38   Warwick has followed these proceedings with an attentive eye. He whispers a few words to an officer, who follows Houppeville the length of the chapel. 
39   When he reaches the porch the officer takes two soldiers with him and follows on Houppeville's heels. 
Each of the judges in the room understands the fate in store for Houppeville, and is seized with fear. An icy, unquiet silence prevails.

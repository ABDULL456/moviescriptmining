{"train": "REMEMBER ME \nWritten by \nWilliam Fetters & Jenny Lumet \nRevised April 16th, 2009 \n1   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1 \nIt's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City \nLINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train. \nLinda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully. Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in The City. \nAlicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on her right wrist. \nThe mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform. \nTWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft, SLURRED SPANISH to each other. \nLinda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand. \nThe Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station. \nTheir focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder. \nAnd so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the stairwell behind them. \nNot until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun. \nLinda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks terrified. \nThe train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band. \nOne of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her. \nThe other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away. \nWe hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell. \nNow the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic. \n-- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --. \nThe Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform. \nThrough the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK OF CONTEMPT. \nThe boy clocks it. Who does she think she is? \n-- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE -- \nWhen a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the car doors from closing. \nA forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ... There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself. \nAlicia's face, shock, terror and blood. \n2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2 \nA WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell. \nBLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big, plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches the platform, he stops. \nCraig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees it. Then he turns... \nTHE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence. Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket. \nAlicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face. Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her legs not quite working. \nCraig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground. \nAlicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but can't. \nCraig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps. \nThe closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment. Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down, he's back up. \nCraig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs. \nWE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN TOWERS STAND TALL. \n3   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING        3 \nTyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass. \nDIANE (to Caroline) Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait? \nCaroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at her mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly tone. \nCAROLINE Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait? \nTYLER Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait? \nDIANE (smiling) You two. I quit. \nShe flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les' hand. \nCAROLINE ...She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler. \nThe WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to the table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek Phillippe. \nTYLER Young Whistler... good... 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history. \nDIANE She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious. \nCaroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline. \nDiane, again, flickers a glance at Charles. \nCAROLINE I would be the youngest one, ever, practically... \nCHARLES Tyler, would you please pass the butter? \nBeat. \nDIANE Caroline was speaking. \nTYLER (to Charles) Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like this? \nDiane touches Caroline's hair. \nCHARLES Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed? \nCAROLINE I'm okay. \nCHARLES (solicitous, to Caroline) I didn't mean to change the subject. \nTYLER What was the subject? \nCHARLES Excuse me? \nTYLER The subject we were discussing. What was it? \nBeat. \nCHARLES Now's not the time for your heroics Tyler \nTYLER No. It's the perfect time. \nCharles makes a minute adjustment to his collar. \nFather and son lock eyes until... \nTYLER (whispering, to Caroline) Do you need me to take you anywhere? \nCaroline shakes her head. \nCAROLINE I'll stay with mom. \nDiane glares at her ex-husband. \nTyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead. \nTYLER Then I'll see you after school. \nCAROLINE Kay. \nHe exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's eyes. \n6   INT. SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER                                 6 \nTyler standing although there are a few seats available. The car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and button down and ties them both around his waist. \n7   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER                             7 \nTyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out of place amidst all the business types. \nHe sits in the last booth facing the street. His tattered JOURNAL lies open in front of him, a BINDER CLIP holds his page as he works quietly crafting an entry. \nCAROLINE Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the bathroom. \nTyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground. \nCAROLINE Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna...like, listen to me? \nTYLER Dad loves you. \nCaroline gives him a look. \nCAROLINE So? You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them. \nCaroline is climbing around Alice. Her hands on Alice's hair. \nTYLER You've got that right. \nCAROLINE Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a \"yule tide homicide.\" \nTYLER That's because Aunt Sara drinks... You don't drink, right? \nCAROLINE Duh. \nTYLER So why would anyone wanna avoid you? \nCaroline shrugs, not convinced. A silent moment passes. \nCAROLINE Michael used to drink. \nTYLER Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21. \nA shared smile. \nCAROLINE You're 21. \nTyler's smile fades. \n13   INT. THE STRAND BOOKSTORE -- DAY                            13 \nTyler on a rolling ladder, shuffling books around. Aidan on the floor, eating two pieces of pizza, folded down the middle, at the same time. \nAIDAN What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year? Get a suite. Couple of ladies. You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think? \nTYLER I think I'd rather be sodomized. \nAIDAN Hey, it's your day. \nHe gestures to the shelves. \nAIDAN What's the point? How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway? There's like... \nAIDAN/TYLER \"Eight Miles of Books!\" \nTYLER I don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together... \nAIDAN No shit? \nTYLER And ended up dead or in prison. \nBeat. \nAIDAN This is why chicks dig you. \nTyler laughs. \nAIDAN Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me. \nTYLER Eh. \nAidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels. \nTYLER Hey! \nAIDAN Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here. (MORE) \nAIDAN (cont'd) I can't deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man. I'm ready to set up an intervention. \nA silent moment passes. \nTYLER You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking? \nAIDAN One drink. Come out for one drink. \nTYLER When's the last time you had one drink? \n14   INT. DON HILL'S -- THAT NIGHT                                14 \nMUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and lurches again. \nMUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car. \nMUSICIAN#2 What's your problem? \nNEANDERTHAL DRIVER My problem? Keep your hands off my car, asshole. \nMUSICIAN#2 Blow it out your ass, Guido. \nMUSICIAN#1 Go back to Long Island. \nThe car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat at his side. \nNEANDERTHAL DRIVER I'm from Queens, faggot \nA Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped into the pavement. \nTYLER'S GIRL So we were thinking we could go... \nTyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her. \nAIDAN (under his breath) God damn it. \nAidan runs off after Tyler. \nTyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not stopping. \nAidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back. It's a brawl. \nAidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl, following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself. \nA Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl. She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement, splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy. \n16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16 \nAn AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site. \nTHE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb. \nSERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we first met him at the train station, is standing with the Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn. \nCraig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction. \nCraig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger, is on the radio to Dispatch. \nCraig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan... \nCRAIG Cut those two loose. \nLeo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys. \nLEO (quiet) Take a walk. \nTyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his wrists, gestures \"Let's go\". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl and... \nCraig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1. \nCRAIG Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein? \nCraig finds a packet, or a vial. \nCRAIG Nice. You like to get high and hit women? \nAidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in the action. \nNEANDERTHAL#1 I don't even know the bitch. \nRage flickers across Craig's face. \nCraig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going through their pockets. \nCRAIG How about you two? \nTyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action. \nMUSICIAN#1 It wasn't us, man! \nNEANDERTHAL#1 That cocksucker kicked my car! \nCRAIG Shut up, genius. \nMUSICIAN#1 (to Neanderthal) Eat shit, pencil dick. \nCRAIG Alright. That's it. Everybody goes downtown. \nTYLER This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing. \nCaroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles. \nCAROLINE Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where are we meeting mom? \nTYLER Guggenheim. What's up with those girls? \nCAROLINE I just...they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out. \nTYLER When you're drawing? \nCAROLINE Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today. And everybody laughed and they all think I'm a freak of nature. \nCaroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the school. \nTYLER Je m'appelle \"Freak of Nature.\" \nCaroline smirks. \nTYLER Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je m'appelle \"Freak of Nature\". Sacre Bleu. French Toast. \nCAROLINE What are you going to tell mom about your face? \nTYLER I finally found something I'm good at? \n26   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS BELOW THE FLAGS -- DAY            26 \nAidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual. \nAIDAN ...I know by every numerical measurement I didn't pass but what I was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass. My commitment to effort. My commitment to commitment...Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus. \nCraig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags. Ally gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the stairs, right past Aidan. \nAIDAN (distracted) I mean... uh... life's only about what we put into it. It's about people. And what they put into it. And I'm -- ah, screw it. \nAidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps. \n27   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                   27 \nTyler, again with the guitar. Aidan enters, excited. \nAIDAN He's got a daughter. \nTYLER Who? \nAIDAN The cop... The cop who busted your face all up. He's got a daughter. And she's hot! I smell revenge! \nTYLER Revenge. What do you want me to do, kidnap her? \nAIDAN You introduce yourself...go on a few dates...be your charming, gentlemanly self... And then, flip the script. \nTYLER What does that mean? \nAIDAN Screw her brains out and make her call you daddy. Steal her underwear and sell it on ebay. Put her in Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and post them on her high school's home page. I don't know. Be creative. \nTYLER You should be incarcerated on general principle. \nAIDAN Hey. What happened to you was very emasculating. Tell me you don't want to get that asshole and I'll drop it. \nTYLER I don't want to get that asshole. \nAIDAN Just meet her. \nTYLER I don't want to meet her. \nAIDAN She's cute. \nTYLER I don't care. \nAIDAN You're meeting her. \nTYLER I'm not meeting her. \n28   INT. COFFEE SHOP. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.- DAY            28 \nA Student Hangout. The place is bustling. Numerous NYU STUDENTS move, sit, eat, lounge. Aidan scans the crowd. Tyler stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic. \nTYLER This is one of those moments I'm already regretting. \nAIDAN She was here yesterday. \nTYLER What am I supposed to say to this girl? \"Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?\" \nAIDAN Well don't call her doll face. \nCaroline notices her teacher staring. She doesn't like it and shifts to block her view. The teacher gently eases her back. Smiles softly. \nCaroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room. Caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when... \nThe BITCHY GIRLS we've seen before start whispering and smirking. One of them mouths... \nCHUBBY GIRL Kiss ass freak. \nCaroline's smile shrinks away and she goes back to work. \n30   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME ALLY'S BEDROOM-- NEXT EVENING         30 \nAlly in sweat pants, an ancient tee-shirt, her hair in a Scrunchie, eating Mallomars from the bag and reading. \nCraig yells from the bottom of the stairs. He carries a bag from a video store. \nCRAIG Don't be mad... \nALLY Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already. You always cry. \nCRAIG O/S I do not. \nALLY It's embarrassing. \nHer cell phone rings. \nALLY Hello? \n31   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. RAILROAD FLAT.                            31 \nTYLER Hey. It's Tyler. \nINTERCUT: \nAlly winces. \nALLY Hi. \nTYLER You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be devastated. \nALLY No... I...I was just... \nTYLER You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V. \nALLY No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm just...getting dressed. \nShe wipes her hands on her sweats, smearing them with chocolate. \nALLY And I'm going to meet you at the place at..what time again? \nTYLER Eight. \nALLY Right...yes. Eight...okay. \nShe hangs up. \nALLY Shit. \nShe whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the bathroom. \n32   INT.CRAIG HOUSE. KITCHEN.                                   32 \nAlly comes down the stairs, putting on her earrings. \nCraig looks at Ally, confused. \nALLY I'm going out. \nCRAIG I can see that. \nALLY Well, you're a trained investigator. \nShe is moving quickly, grabbing her bag, her wallet. Craig tosses her keys. \nCRAIG Who are you going with? \nALLY A boy from school. \nBeat. \nCRAIG Okay. \nALLY I wasn't asking for permission. \nCRAIG (sharply) I know. (more gently) Have a good time. Here's cab fare. \nAlly carries a GIANT PANDA under her arm. Tyler walking beside her with a self-satisfied smile. \nALLY I don't know what you're smiling about. \nTYLER I won. \nALLY Paying off the attendant is not winning... It's cheating. \nTYLER I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great. \nALLY Aha. By the way, what happened to your eye? \nTyler touches the bandage. \nTYLER Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight. \nALLY How butch. \nTYLER I know. I'm practically a pirate. \nALLY Okay, Captain Morgan... \nTYLER (laughing) You've got some serious timing. \nALL It's getting late. \nTYLER I'll walk you to the train. \nALLY I'll take a cab. \n37   EXT. SIDEWALK -- JUST AFTER                               37 \nTyler is just hailing her a taxi. He stands there holding the door open. \nALLY Thanks. \nBeat. \nTyler leans in to kiss her. Ally turns away. \nALLY Not tonight. Not never... just... not tonight. \nCAB DRIVER We goin' or what? \nALLY Hey! Turn on the meter. \nTyler respectfully leans back. \nTYLER So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid... yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night... no. \nAlly considers. \nShe gives him a quick but tender kiss. \nALLY You're really weird. \nShe gets in the cab. \nALLY (to the driver) I'm going to Queens and I don't wanna hear about it. \nOff she goes in the taxi. Tyler watches her go. \n38   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.               38 \nCaroline exiting with the crowd. One of the Bitchy girls shoulder checks her from behind as she passes. Tyler, waiting on his perch, catches it, walks up to her. \nTYLER Happy end of sixth grade! \nCAROLINE Finally. \n39   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE IN WONDERLAND STATUE -- AFTERNOON39 \nCHILDREN climbing all over the bronze statue. Caroline among them. She sits on a mushroom cap, letting her legs dangle. Tyler watches her from their usual bench, his bike leaning next to him. \nCAROLINE They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt... \nTYLER I heard. \nCAROLINE It's very prestigious due to my artistic greatness. \nTYLER Don't pretend. I know you're proud. You should be. \nCaroline allows herself a tiny grin. \nCAROLINE There's, like, a thing... \nTYLER I don't actually get grades. \nBeat. \nTYLER I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing. \nALLY Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice. \nTYLER I like the books. \nHe indicates the dishes. \nTYLER You don't have to help me, you know. \nALLY At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you when. \nHe flicks a bit of water on her shirt. Ally takes a beat. \nALLY This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right? \nTYLER (horsing around) You make it sound so cheap. \nAlly's not having it. \nALLY It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times. \nTyler's a little confused. \nTYLER I'm sorry. I didn't... \nALLY You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job? \nTyler blinks helplessly. \nALLY This. \nAn entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host. Bits of spaghetti cling to him, tiny tomatoes and zucchini on his shoulders like little barnacles. He sputters and gasps and blinks. \nALLY No, that usually never happens. \nShe calmly goes back to washing dishes. \nBeat. \nSpaghetti guy stares at her. \nShe gives it right back to him, 100% New York City. \nBeat. \nIn one move Tyler slings Ally over his shoulder. She grunts, unglamorously. \n42   INT. BATHROOM -- SECONDS LATER                               42 \nTyler bursts through the bathroom door. Ally over his shoulder. Never one to waste a moment, she uses the opportunity to check out what's in his wallet. He turns on the shower. She has his drivers licence. \nTYLER Apologize. \nALLY Never. Your middle name is Keats? Your parents are pretentious as hell. \nTyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower head and turns it at him. \nTyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for the shower head. \nTYLER Apologize. \nALLY I'd rather eat monkeys. \nThis cracks Tyler up. He stops struggling for the shower and gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in surrender. Ally stands there, holding the shower head, giggling. \nThey lock eyes for a moment. The air is charged. \nAlly spritzes him in the face. \nTYLER I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless. \nHe slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally follows. \nALLY Victory at all costs. \n43   INT. BATH TUB -- LATER                                       43 \nTyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched. Their feet hang over the edge of the tub. Tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet. He squeezes out water. \nTYLER Now... I'm furious. \nTYLER You're up. \nBeat. \nTYLER Can I get you anything? \nShe nods. \nTYLER I'll be out here if you need me. \nBeat. \nAlly takes off the shirt and lets it fall. \nShe stands there. \n53   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                             53 \nWe interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion. Tyler sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making. \nIn the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping, a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise and recognition. \nThen again. Young, hungry, aggressive. \nTIME LAPSE \nThey lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place. Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in this dream state, to make love all over again. \n54   INT. BEDROOM -- BEFORE SUNRISE                               54 \nThe sheets have been torn loose from the mattress. Ally lies asleep, curled in the comforter. Tyler lies awake beside her, he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to brighten. \nTyler gets out of bed. Grabs his journal. \nA NOTE propped up next to the bed: \"Please don't leave. I'll be back.\" \n55   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                       55 \nTyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop. \n56   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- SUNRISE                      56 \nThe place is empty. A few early RISERS get coffee to go. He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the binder clip. He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him. \nJanine enters. Orders two coffees. She sees Tyler, smiles. She picks up her coffees and approaches him. \nJANINE I can't believe you still come down here. \nTyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees. \nTYLER It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk? \nJANINE (shrugs) Old habits. You're not writing anything bad about me, are you? \nTYLER Not today. \nJANINE I gotta run. Early meetings. \nJanine turns to go, remembers something, turns back. \nJANINE I probably won't see you before Saturday so...happy birthday. \nTyler nods, tries to smile. Janine glances back as she goes. \nJANINE I'll be sure to tell your father that you said hello. \nTyler nods sheepishly. \n57   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- LATER                   57 \nTyler returns with breakfast. From Aidan's room, a pathetic croak... \nAIDAN O/S Bialy. \nTyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal. \nAlly lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little. \nTYLER Hey... \nALLY Hey... \nTyler sits. She shifts and curls next to him. \nALLY Where did you go? \n59   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                  59 \nAidan sits in the living room, trying to assemble an IKEA television stand. A joint smolders in the ashtray. The BUZZER rings. \nAidan goes to answer it. \nAIDAN Hello? \nDIANE Aidan, it's Diane. \nHe blinks. \nAIDAN Oh, hey Diane. \nHe throws down the keys, then yells towards the roof... \nAIDAN T! It's your mom. \nWith Diane's knock the door swings open. \nAIDAN Hey Diane. \nHe gives her a kiss on the cheek. \nDIANE You really have to fix that door. I'm so sorry to just show up. I called but your phone was busy. \nAidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the hook, as just the handset, wrapped in duct tape, is visible on top of the sofa. \nAIDAN No problem. Come on in. \nTyler and Ally enter the apartment through the fire escape \nTYLER Hey mom. \nDIANE Hey. I'm so sorry honey. I tried to call but... \nTYLER. It's okay. Mom, this is Ally. Ally, this is my mom, Diane. \nALLY Hi. Nice to meet you. \nDiane is thrilled. She has a huge mom grin. \nDIANE Ally. It's lovely to met you. Just lovely. \nDiane is pumping Ally's hand like she's drilling for oil. \nTYLER Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something? \nShe navigates the IKEA carnage and sits on the sofa, the joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her. Aidan ever the gent, removes the ashtray to the window ledge. \nDIANE Yes. Aidan, would you bring back that spliff, please? \nBeat. \nAIDAN Uh..okay. \nTyler looks completely befuddled. Aidan passes Diane the joint. She takes a deep hit. \nDIANE Thank you. \nAIDAN How's work, Diane? \nDIANE Well ... (BIG exhale) I just found housing for a family that had been in shelters for three weeks. So that's good. On the other hand, I have six other families. \nThe women measure each other. \nDIANE But Tyler, I wanted to talk to you. \nALLY Come on, Aidan. \nAIDAN What? \nALLY Nice to meet you, Diane. \nShe starts to drag Aidan out the window, back up the fire escape, but he makes a brief detour. \nAIDAN Don't freaking bogart that joint, Diane. \nDIANE Sorry. \nShe hands it back to him and Aidan and Ally climb away. Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette. \nDIANE Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house. I wish you'd told me. \nTYLER I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers? \nTYLER Caroline's show. \nCHARLES O/S What about it? \nTYLER (ready to kill him) You are coming, right? \nCHARLES O/S Fine. Yes. I'm coming. We'll go to dinner first. Alright?... (to Janine) Janine? \nTYLER Dinner? That's not... \nCHARLES I'll make a reservation and have Janine call you. \nHe hangs up. Tyler stares at the phone a sec, then hits his head, once, against the bathroom door. \n64   INT. DIANE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- A WEEK LATER   64 \nTyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with Ally standing behind him with her hands over his eyes. \nCaroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's BIRTHDAY CAKE. She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from the ALICE statue in frosting. \nIt reads \"A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU\", and has \"22\" in numerical candles and \"+ 1 TO UNGROW ON\" written next to that. \nShe's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing. \nThere's a flash from a camera off screen. It's Les. \nCaroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally takes her hands away just as they finish the song. \nTyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's efforts. He takes a huge breath... \nCAROLINE Make a wish. \nHe looks at her and blows out the candles. Everybody applauds, Diane longer than anyone else. Her eyes are shining. \nCUT TO: \n65   INT. DINING ROOM --LATER                                       65 \nThe cake totally devoured. Les is obsessively eating frosting. \nCaroline is trying to teach Aidan how to waltz in the living room. He is... \nCAROLINE Retarded. Tyler? \nTyler rises from the sofa and takes over as Caroline's partner. She puts her feet on top of his feet and they waltz. \nTYLER/CAROLINE \"One, two. three. One, two, three\" \nAlly and Diane are washing dishes in silence. \nBeat. \nALLY You're the second member of this family I've washed dishes with. \nBeat. \nDIANE He was doing it to impress you. He's never washed a dish in his life. \n66   INT. CAROLINE'S ROOM.                                     66 \nCaroline at her desk, sketching. Her door is ajar. Ally enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on Caroline's collection of artwork on the walls. \nALLY Wow. \nCaroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH, cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. A perfect rendering of a fleeting moment. \nALLY May I? \nCaroline shrugs. Ally looks over Caroline's shoulder. \nALLY That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert. \nCaroline smiles. \nALLY I can't believe he smokes in front of you. \nCAROLINE Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable. \nAlly smiles. Caroline goes back to work. Ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls. It stirs a memory. \nALLY You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite. \nCAROLINE Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world. \nALLY So... I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up. \nCHARLES It has to do with significant ball playing. You were a Yankees fan when you were little. You were Lou Piniella for Halloween. \nTYLER Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were. \nCHARLES (serious as a heart attack) Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me. \nTYLER (right back at him) It's a metaphor... \nCharles adjusts his tie and goes back to his steak. \nTYLER Roger Clemens. \nCharles looks at his son. Puts his fork down. \nSilence at the table. \nBack to the steak. \nBeat. \nALLY Shane Spencer. \nCharles looks up, taken aback. \nALLY Nick Johnson. \nTyler tries to get a word in. \nCHARLES (his mouth full of steak) He's big boned! \nCharles and Ally burst out laughing. Tyler rolls his eyes \n--TIME CUT \nDessert. Ally is working on an enormous profiterole. Tyler, another whiskey. \nCHARLES How long has your dad been a cop? \nALLY Twenty-two years. \nHis cell phone lights up. Charles gently puts his hand on hers. \nCHARLES Would you excuse me please... I'm so sorry. \nALLY It's OK. \nCharles gets up from the table. Tyler, not able to help himself, shoots him a glance. Ally clocks it. \nALLY It's just a call. He held out 'til dessert. \nCharles returns. \nCHARLES I'm sorry...And your mother? \nALLY She passed away when I was eleven. \nCHARLES Ah. \nALLY She was murdered. I was there. \nCharles and Tyler are stunned to silence. \nALLY (to Tyler) I never told you that part. \nTYLER Why are you saying this now? \nALLY I don't know. \nThe men look at her. She's a hero. \nCHARLES And, here you are. \nALLY Yup. Here I am. \n70   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME. KITCHEN.                            70 \nThere is an empty Lean Cuisine box, and two empty Beer Cans on the counter. \nCraig stands by the microwave as it counts down...4,3,2,1. BEEP. He removes an Eggplant Parmigiana and slides it carefully on to a waiting plate. \nHe takes it, along with a fresh beer, to the living room. He sits heavily on the sofa and hits a remote, unpausing ERIN BROCKOVICH. \n71   EXT. IN FRONT OF THE FOUR SEASONS-- LATER                    71 \nTyler and Ally wait in front of the restaurant as Charles takes another call. A TOWN CAR and DRIVER wait as well. \nALLY White girl. \nAIDAN Please. Like falling off a log. As a matter of fact... \nALLY Shut up. Black girl. \nAIDAN But of course. \nALLY Asian. \nAIDAN Twice. \nALLY Latina. \nAIDAN Oui! \nALLY A Latin girl actually slept with you? What's her name? She's out of the club. \nTyler is laughing. Ally thinks for a moment. \nALLY Eskimo. \nAidan gives a satisfied smile. \nTYLER/ALLY No way! \nAIDAN Monica Ipellie. She works at the Public Library on 96th street. \nALLY You slept with an Eskimo? \nTYLER You went to the library? \nThe car doors open and a MAN ushers his family through.   It's Craig's partner Leo, in plain clothes. \nAIDAN Inuit. In-u-it, Ally. Try not to show your ignorance. \nALLY I don't believe you. \nAIDAN Fine. Nice girl. While we were doing it, I couldn't get this little, like, song out of my head... \nHe begins to bob his head to a rhythm. \nAIDAN \"Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum...\" \nAlly and Tyler collapse in laughter as Craig's Partner passes He notices Ally immediately. She doesn't see him. He takes a long look at Tyler as he follows his wife and kids into the next car. \nALLY Prove it. Ten bucks. \nThe train makes a stop at Patchogue. Leo and family disembark. \nAIDAN You wanna go to the library? \nALLY The minute we get off this train. \nAIDAN Fine. \nALLY Tyler, are you coming? \nTYLER I'll skip this particular bloodbath, thank you. \n80   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- HALLWAY -- LATER          80 \nTyler, his bag on his shoulder, returning home, fishing in his pocket for his keys. \nHe sings the Inuit song to himself... \nTYLER bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum... \nHis front door is unlocked. \nTyler freezes. Takes a beat. Scans the room, silently dropping his bag. He reaches behind him for the aluminium bat against the door. Wielding it, he takes two steps into the apartment. \nCraig, in plain clothes, sitting on Tyler's bed, amidst the carnage of Tyler's stuff. He has been rifling through everything. The guitar is propped haphazardly against the wall. \nCraig looks up. The men lock eyes. \nCraig's eyes go to the bat. \nTyler leans it slowly against the wall. \nBeat. \nCRAIG Where is she? \nTYLER What are you doing in my house? \nALLY I hate him! \nShe lunges for the phone. Tyler stops her hand. \nTYLER There's more. \nShe looks like she's starting to panic. \nTYLER He knows me. Before I met you. He arrested me and Aidan. He gave me that gash over my eye. \nALLY I don't understand. \nTYLER I mouthed off to him. He ... responded. Then Aidan saw you guys together at school. \nShe isn't quite getting it. \nTYLER Aidan suggested...I...introduced myself to you. \nShe's got it. \nBeat. \nTYLER Ally... \nALLY I'm going to be sick. \nShe bolts from the chair to the sink and dry heaves. Tyler reaches out to comfort her. \nTYLER Hey. \nShe reels around and cracks him across the face. Not like a chick. Like her dad. \nThe sound hangs in the air. \nAlly goes to the bedroom and starts throwing her stuff in her bag. Tyler follows her. \nTYLER Don't do that. What are you doing? \nALLY Do you realize what you've done? \nTYLER Yeah. \nHe doesn't. \nALLY Did you think I would never find out? I mean, think about it. I had to find out eventually. You set it up that way. \nTYLER But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you, \nALLY No. That's exactly what you meant to do. \nShe pushes past him and out the door. \n82   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRWELL --           82 \nAlly heads down. Aidan heads up. He smiles wide. \nAIDAN Hey. \nAlly pushes past him. \nALLY Prick. \n83   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LATER THAT NIGHT                     83 \nTyler sitting on the ratty couch. Aidan eats old Chinese food from the container. He offers some to Tyler. They sit in silence. Tyler swelling. Aidan eating. \nAIDAN You had to tell her eventually... \nThis is no comfort. \nAIDAN Glass half full... you just saved yourself an awkward Thanksgiving. \nSincere now. \nAIDAN She'll be back, T. \nTyler heads into his bedroom and shuts the door. \n84   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT                  84 \nSergeant Craig working on a sink full of dirty dishes. He scrubs at a filthy pan with a piece of steel wool. He's manic but there's not a beer can in sight. \nALLY O/S You know you're not supposed to use that on non-stick pans... \nCraig turns, finds her there in the doorway, bag at her feet. \nALLY And... \nCraig popping back like an eel from a wreck.    He's got the mangled Honey Bear. \nALLY Dad... \nHe goes again. Pfft. Aidan's visibly relieved. \nAIDAN Tyler's not. \nShe starts to close the door. \nAIDAN Wait. Shit. This isn't really my thing. \nALLY He lied to me. \nAIDAN He's in love with you. \nALLY He'd like to think he is. \nAidan doesn't get it. \nAIDAN I don't know what that means...I've seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you. She's a lot shorter and shares his DNA. \nAlly looks away. \nAIDAN You don't have to forgive him today... just forgive him. \nCraig reappears from the deep. \nCRAIG Thanks for stopping by. \nFather and daughter go back into the house. \nAidan exhales. \n91   INT. HOFFMAN FAMILY HOME -- CAROLINE'S BEDROOM -- LATER      91 \nDiane is on the house phone, preparing a tray of tea and cinnamon toast for Caroline as she talks. \nDIANE Are you telling me, Ms. Spencer, that you intend to let those girls stay in your school?...Of course they're all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap!... \nShe slams a cabinet closed as Les picks up the tray and WE TRACK HIM down the hall to CAROLINE'S ROOM. Les is speaking on his cell phone. \nLES (sotto, into the phone) She's pretty traumatized. I wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone... \n92   INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM.                                     92 \nCaroline and Tyler are lying on Caroline's bed. Her head is nestled on his shoulder. She looks even tinier than usual. Tyler is reading to her, softly, from The Book of Greek Myths, his other hand stroking her butchered hair. \nShe looks pale, wasted. Her eyes are sunken and she's fighting sleep. A losing battle, she's exhausted. Her lids finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice. \nLes, at the door, places the tray on Caroline's desk... \nLES (on the phone) There's no witnesses and it didn't happen on school property. The school won't do anything. They'll probably get away with it... \nTyler's eyes, registering anger and shock, jump from the page as he hears this. \n93   INT. FOYER.                                                  93 \nDiane opening the front door for Aidan and Ally. Aidan wraps his arms around Diane and gives her a hug. Ally hangs back a bit, unsure, then embraces Diane. \nTyler emerges from the hallway. \nTYLER (to Diane) She's asleep. \nHe sees Aidan and Ally. Stops short. \n94   EXT. FRONT STEPS -- LATER                                    94 \nTyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a cigarette. Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it behind her. \nTYLER Last one ever. I swear. \nALLY I don't care. \nBeat. \nTYLER I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here. \nA silent moment passes. \nTYLER For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. \nALLY It's not worth much. You made everything between us a lie. \nTyler nods. \nCharles appraises his son. \nCHARLES Try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime. \nCharles walks ahead, pulling out his cell phone. \nTyler calls after him. \nTYLER Thank you for bailing me out. \nCharles, without turning around, \nCHARLES No problem. \n101   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS -- BEAUTIFUL SEPTEMBER MORNING     101 \nTyler leaning against the bike rack, waiting. He sees Ally running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the crowd. \n102   EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- JUST AFTER.                 102 \nNo mimes, just dealers. Ally with a girlfriend, walking towards the East Side. Tyler catches up to her. \nShakes the friend's hand. After a beat, Ally agrees to walk with him. He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away, but walks next to him. \n103   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE STATUE -- JUST AFTER.            103 \nTyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline with him. \nTyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally watches from a bench. \nAs befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early September tanning possibilities. \nTyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her. \nBeat. \nALLY Using the little sister is dirty pool. \nTYLER (carefully) Is it working? \nBeat. \nALLY Maybe. \nTyler has a smile the size of New York City. \nAlly smiles back. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n104   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING                    104 \nBright sun pouring through the window. Ally lying asleep. \nTyler is up and dressed now, he grabs his journal off his desk, kneels beside Ally. He is bathed in the pool of light streaming in. \nTYLER (nuzzling) Hey...Hey. \nALLY Hmmm. \nTYLER I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office. \nALLY (sleepily) Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast? \nTYLER Whichever tastes better a la mode. \nAlly smiles. \nALLY Say hi to your dad for me. \nTyler watches her lying there. \nTYLER If I said I love you... what would you say? \nALLY (laughing) I love you. \nTYLER I love you too. \nTyler kisses her. Then heads out into the... \n105   INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                        105 \nAidan passed out on the couch still wearing the clothes he went out in the night before. Tyler watches him sleep. \n113   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- LATER                                113 \nThat line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off. Charles' Town car rolls to a stop. Caroline gives him a kiss on the cheek. It registers, sort of. She gets out. Charles watches her all the way into the school. \nHis DRIVER sees him watching Caroline in the rear view mirror. \nCharles gives the Driver a look \"you're waiting for an invite?\" \nThe Driver peels out. \n114   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- LATER                  114 \nAlly has made a mess making french toast. Aidan is yakking on his phone. \n115   INT. TOWN CAR -- LATER                                      115 \nCharles in traffic. All around him DRIVERS curse, honk, hate each other. Charles rides, not letting it bug him. \n116   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- LATER                   116 \nCaroline drawing at her desk as her Teacher comes in and gets ready to start the day. \n117   INT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                      117 \nTyler is still watching the screen saver when Janine enters. \nJANINE Good Morning, Mister Roth. \nTYLER Did you know about this? \nJanine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of Tyler and Michael naked in the tub pop up. She smiles. \nJANINE Who do you think scanned all the pictures? \nTyler smiles. Janine smiles, Then a photo of Michael comes up. Those smiles fade. Silence. \nJANINE How old would he be? \nTYLER Twenty-nine last May. \nTyler stands and looks out one of the floor-to-ceiling windows separated by columns. He stares out at mid town and a perfect blue sky. Janine looks befuddled. \nJANINE It's really been that long? I could've sworn it was... \nTYLER May 18, 1993. \nA silent moment passes. Janine reflecting. \nJANINE I should be able to remember that. I'm sorry. \nTyler looks at her, his face easy... \nTYLER It's okay. \n118   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- LATER                118 \nCaroline's Teacher writes the date on the board as Caroline sits quietly doodling. The teacher looks her way. \nTEACHER Caroline?

CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                         119 \nWe're now looking at Tyler from just outside Charles' office window and we're PULLING BACK... \nUntil we see Tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily familiar grey metal siding... \nUntil we see can barely see Tyler and the base of a giant white antenna... \nUntil we can no longer see Tyler as he's disappeared into the composite of the building and we've pulled back far enough to reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the... \n92nd Floor of The North Tower of the World Trade Center. \nA moment of still perfect silence. The Towers. The blue sky. \nThen we hear the faint sound of AA Flight 11's ENGINES as it closes in on the North Tower. \nCUT TO BLACK. Silence. Darkness. We wait in it. \nTYLER V/O Whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it because... \n120   EXT.

FAR ROCKAWAY - CRAIG FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN -- MORNING   18 \nAlly, with a cup of coffee, is on the house phone. \nALLY So when would that be available?...No, that's sooner than I'd thought. And is there any kind of deposit?.. Okay. \nCraig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink. \nALLY I'll call you back. Thanks. \nAlly hangs up. Makes a quick appraisal of her dad. He has a little blood on his cuff. He splashes his face with water. \nOn automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug. \nShe packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps his coffee. \nALLY What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight? \nThe toaster dings. She extracts an English muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear. \nCRAIG Breathe. \nALLY Did you? \nCRAIG I did. I'm breathing right now. Who was that? \nALLY The lady from student housing. We talked about it. Remember? \nBeat. \nCRAIG Sure. \nAlly grabs her sweatshirt. \nALLY Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me. \nCRAIG I'll drive you. \nShe flounces out the door, holding her own cup of coffee and the English Muffin.

She drops them in her bag. \nALLY Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it. \nCraig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car. \nShe flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup. \nALLY You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench. \nThey start to back out. \nALLY This drive is too long. \n20   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- DAY                     20 \nTyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area. English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST types away across the room. Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Draws the ire of... \nTHE RECEPTIONIST You know you can't smoke in here. \nTyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him. It's clearly never been used. \nTYLER So what's with the ash tray? \nTHE RECEPTIONIST It completes the room. \nTyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the pristine surface. He smiles a charming smile at the aggravated woman. \nTYLER Tease. \nJANINE O/S Tyler... \nJANINE, Charles' long time assistant, late forties, kind eyes, watches Tyler from the hallway. \n", "test1_true": "21   INT.

And you smell like french fries and cigarettes. \nTYLER Nice to see you too. \nJANINE You want me to lie? \nTyler smiles, he likes that she doesn't lie. Janine scrolls through a Palm Pilot as she walks. They approach the double doors to Charles' office. \nJANINE Try not to give him a heart attack. \nTYLER Okay. \nTyler bangs through the doors. Janine grimaces. \n22   INT. CAVERNOUS EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- LATER                     22 \nA row of floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds. Sunlight glows behind them. There's a lot of leather, brass and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen computer, but no personal effects anywhere. \nCharles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles' face. Tyler stands. \nTYLER I came to see how much it costs, because I'm giving you the money back. \nCHARLES How much what costs? \nTYLER That lawyer. \nBeat. \nCHARLES Ah. That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450 dollars an hour. \nIn spite of himself... \nTYLER Christ. \nCHARLES Tell me about it. \nTYLER I wanted to make sure you understood it wasn't me who called you. \nCHARLES I understand. You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail \nTYLER I don't want to be bailed out of anything. \nCharles looks at his son. \nTYLER I'll get an invoice from Janine. \nTyler leaves, slamming the door behind him. \n23   INT.

WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER.                    24 \nTyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot tapping fast.

JUST AFTER.                            25 \nIt's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker. \nTyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on a fire hydrant. \nTYLER (to Caroline) Hey. \nHe looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a group swoon. \nHe takes Caroline by the elbow... \nTYLER Excuse us, we're due in surgery. \nHe gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth Avenue. \nCAROLINE What happened to your face? \nTYLER Horrible threshing accident. \nCAROLINE You're so retarded. \nTYLER Don't mock the afflicted. Here, I brought you something. \nHe hands her the book of Myths. \n", "test1_id": 1686, "test2_input": "AIDAN I'm sorry. \nALLY Tyler... \nTyler kneels down. Ally pushes her purse at him, she looks like she's about to pass out. \nALLY I, need, you... to call... my dad. \nTyler and Aidan share a look. Aidan shrugs. \nTYLER Oh. OK. Sure. \nTyler pulls out her cellphone - the battery is dead. \nTYLER Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him... \nTyler turns around to find Ally passed out on the floor. He tries to gently nudge her awake. \nTYLER Ally? Ally? \nSERGEANT CRAIG (O.S.) I know Ally's a good kid, Leo. \n45   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- ALLY'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT       45 \nThe bedside clock reads 3:47. Craig is on the phone while searching through Ally's desk drawers. For anything. He finds a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it. \nCRAIG ...She was supposed to be back. She's not back ... call Ted Proferes ... and what's his face in the 9th...and call me back. Just do it, Leo! \nCraig hangs up the phone. \nBeat. \nHe picks it up again and starts dialing, still flipping through the notebook. \n46   INT TYLER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT MORNING                          46 \nAlly wakes up alone in Tyler's bed, hung over, confused, trying to put the pieces together, then she sees the clock. And a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed. \nALLY ...oh God oh God oh God oh God... \n47   INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER                                    47 \nTyler sleeps on the couch using Aidan's Irish Flag as a blanket. Ally comes in pulling on her shoes. Tyler stirs in time to see her run out the door. \n48   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- LATER                              48 \nCraig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone. Ally enters, drops her keys on the counter. Her father doesn't look at her as she pours herself a coffee. \nALLY ...I'm sorry. I fell asleep... \nCraig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling the Bear. Not looking at her. \nAlly notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone. \nCRAIG You turned your phone off. \nALLY I forgot to charge it. \nIt dawns on her... \nALLY That's mine. From my desk. \nCraig says nothing. Just stirs his coffee. Ally is furious. \nALLY How could you? \nCRAIG You were gone all night. I was trying to get some information. \nALLY How could you go through my stuff like I'm a suspect? \nCRAIG Then stop acting like one. \nALLY What is the matter with you, Dad? You have no respect for me and the way I'm feeling, my privacy. We talked about this! You're totally paranoid... \nCRAIG You watch your mouth! \nALLY You don't do anything. You don't go anywhere except work. You have no life. \nCRAIG My life is right here! In this house. The same place as yours. But you're spitting all over it. \nALLY Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a date! \nCRAIG I smell alcohol... \nRight back at him. \n", "test2_true": "Beat. \nALLY Dad... \nCRAIG THIS IS MY HOUSE! \nALLY YOU WANNA BURY ME IN IT? \nCRACK! He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of his body. Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on the cabinets. \nCRAIG Ally! \nHis face is contorted with panic and shame. \nAlly's disoriented. Her ears are ringing. Her lip is split. A knot is starting to form where she hit her head. \nShe straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has no idea who he is. \nBeat. \nCraig tries to envelop her. With a guttural snarl she pushes him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. She scrambles up the stairs. \n49   EXT. RAILROAD FLAT-- ROOFTOP -- DAY                         49 \nSunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway, a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach chair, trying again with the guitar. \nAIDAN ...So? She just left? No good bye? \nTyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. Aidan finishes up a set. \nAIDAN Maybe she heard you play the guitar. \nTYLER You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat. You almost killed her. \nAidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of weight on the bar. \nAIDAN There are sins of omission and sins of commission, my friend. I've dealt with mine and I've forgiven myself... you should do the same. \nAidan lifts. It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains. \nAIDAN ...little help, T... little help, little help, lotta help... TYLER?! \nTyler blows three perfect smoke rings. Finally he puts down the guitar and helps get the bar up. Aidan panting, rubbing his chest. \nAIDAN What the hell was that? \nTYLER Penance. I have to get to work. \n50   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                   50 \nTyler and Aidan come into their apartment, Aidan still rubbing his chest. Ally is standing there in the middle of the living area. A packed bag at her feet, her face a mess. \nALLY I didn't know where else to go. \n51   INT. LIVING ROOM -- SUNSET                                51 \nAidan sits on the couch still in his gym clothes drinking a protein shake out of a blender. Tyler comes out of his bedroom gently closing the door behind him. \nAIDAN How's she doin'? \nTYLER She's pretty shaken up. \nTyler takes a seat beside him. Takes out a cigarette. \nTYLER We've really got to fix that dead bolt. \nAIDAN My bad. Sorry. \nTYLER Don't be. You think she'll sleep? \nAIDAN You realize if she had had the S.L.U.T \nIf looks could kill... \nAIDAN Too soon? \nA silent moment passes. \nTYLER I told her she could stay here... Are you alright with that? \nAIDAN As long as she needs. \n52   INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT                      52 \nTyler has just finished making up the ratty sofa as a bed. Ally appears from the bedroom, framed by the open door. She has slept in one of Tyler's button down shirts. \n", "test2_id": 1687, "test3_input": "TYLER You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her. \nCHARLES If I have any questions about what my daughter may believe, I'll let you know. \nTyler gestures with the portrait \nTYLER Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life? \nCHARLES I've heard this song before, Tyler. \nSUBORDINATE#1 We can come back... \nThe subordinates rise. \nCHARLES It's fine, Khaleel. \nThey sit. \nThere is still distance between the two men. \nBeat. \nCHARLES Who is this display for? \nTYLER You, Mr. Roth. \nBeat. \nCHARLES She knows I will take care of her. \nTYLER And...? \nThe subordinates rise again. \nSUBORDINATE#1 We really can come back another... \nCHARLES Sit the fuck down. \nThey sit. \nCHARLES And that I love her. I love her. Good God, you toss that word around like currency. You have no idea what it means. \nTYLER Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it? \nCHARLES I have provided her world. And yours. \nTYLER That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do. \nCHARLES Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake. You have to take care of nothing. You are responsible for no one. You're a kid. You think you're the first one to lose anything? Do you think that there is anything you feel that I haven't already felt? \nTYLER You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch. \nCharles goes, snarling, for his son, and Tyler is more than willing. \nJanine and one of the Subordinates get between them. \nJANINE Stop! Stop! \nThe men are pulled apart. Tyler is white and trembling with rage. Charles' face is completely dark and closed. \nJANINE Get out of here Tyler. \nTyler runs for the door. Stumbling over furniture, Caroline's portrait crushed under his feet. \n75   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- RIGHT AFTER.                        75 \nAlly, still in her dress, trying to excavate an ice tray frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her eyes widen... \nALLY Oh my God. \nShe runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and understand. He kisses her, so she won't see. Tyler is completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is going to get him through. \nALLY Okay. \nShe yanks his head up. \nALLY It's okay. \nThey kiss. She brings his hands up into her hair, around her face. They kiss. He kisses her like he's starved for her. \nCUT TO: \n76   TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                                      76 \nTyler and Ally, wrapped around each other, both deeply asleep. \n", "test3_true": "Craig, home from work. He hits the button on the answering machine. There's just one message. \nALLY O/S (on the machine) Dad, it's me. I've been invited...I'm going away to the beach for Labor Day...They're nice people. If there's any problem I'll call. Or they will. Okay...Bye. \nAs he takes off his jacket, Craig hits rewind and plays the message again... \nALLY O/S (on the machine) Dad, it's me... \n78   INT. DIANE'S MONTAUK BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT -- SUMMER'S END     78 \nRaucous laughter. Caroline, Tyler, Les, Ally and Aidan are in the living room playing charades. \nEveryone is a little sunburnt, the adults are a little drunk. Ally is wrapped up in Tyler, Caroline is on her mom's lap on the floor, Les next to them, lying on his stomach. Aidan is up and God only knows what he's doing \nLES (totally flabbergasted) I genuinely have no idea...are you having a seizure? \nCAROLINE Time. \nAIDAN Berlin Alexanderplatz! \nMore raucous laughter. \nAIDAN You people are culturally bankrupt. \nTYLER Whose was that anyway? \nCAROLINE Mine. \nWhoops of laughter heretofore unheard in Montauk. \nDIANE Okay, you. Bed. \nLES. Me? Yeah, baby. \nCAROLINE Gross. Gross. Gross me out the door. \nShe rises and flees into the kitchen. Les rolls over and ends up with his head in Diane's lap. He looks at her for a moment. \nLES You're just the prettiest girl. \nDiane beams at him. \nTyler smiles at his mom and Les, then at Ally. Diane takes a deep look at her son. Her eyes shining. \nAIDAN Holy crap. What's with all the smiling? \nCaroline travels through the living room with a popsicle. She is headed for her bedroom. \nCAROLINE A child could do Berlin Alexanderplatz, you spaz. \nLes snorts with laughter. Diane rises, dumping him to the floor. \nLES Hey! \nDIANE I want five minutes with my child before she ceases to be a child and decides I'm ruining her life. \nOn her way out, Diane pauses and gently pushes one of Ally's stray curls behind her ear. Smiles down at her. \nDIANE Aren't you a treasure. \nAlly stares up at Diane for a beat, her eyes shining. \n79   INT. AMTRACK -- PASSENGER CAR (MOVING) -- DAY               79 \nTanned and rejuvenated, Ally, Tyler, and Aidan sit together on the train back to the city. \nAlly and Tyler kiss. Aidan watches them. \nAIDAN I want a girlfriend. \nTYLER What? \nAIDAN Dinners out, movies. Regular sex. That could be all right. For like, a summer. \nALLY You're such a romantic. \nAIDAN And I've had all the races. \nALLY Excuse me? \nAIDAN I've had all the races. I've been with girls from every...race. \nAlly laughs. \nTYLER That is the stupidest thing you've ever said, including that time with the bong in the emergency room. \n", "test3_id": 1688}

{"test1_input": "REMEMBER ME \nWritten by \nWilliam Fetters & Jenny Lumet \nRevised April 16th, 2009 \n1   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1 \nIt's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City \nLINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train. \nLinda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully. Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in The City. \nAlicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on her right wrist. \nThe mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform. \nTWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft, SLURRED SPANISH to each other. \nLinda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand. \nThe Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station. \nTheir focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder. \nAnd so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the stairwell behind them. \nNot until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun. \nLinda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks terrified. \nThe train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band. \nOne of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her. \nThe other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away. \nWe hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell. \nNow the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic. \n-- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --. \nThe Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform. \nThrough the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK OF CONTEMPT. \nThe boy clocks it. Who does she think she is? \n-- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE -- \nWhen a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the car doors from closing. \nA forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ... There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself. \nAlicia's face, shock, terror and blood. \n2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2 \nA WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell. \nBLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big, plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches the platform, he stops. \nCraig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees it. Then he turns... \nTHE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence. Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it into his pocket. \nAlicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face. Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her legs not quite working. \nCraig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting her as the blanket falls to the ground. \nAlicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but can't. \nCraig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps. \nThe closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment. Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down, he's back up. \nCraig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs. \nWE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN TOWERS STAND TALL. \n3   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING        3 \n", "test1_true": "Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the bed. \nTYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration etched in his face. \nA forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed. \nTyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple of hours. \nThe Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone... \nBLONDE (out of it) Hello? \nTyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes widen in alarm. \nTYLER Yeah... (listens) Of course. I'm on my way. I know...I know...I know...I know. \nTyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark suit pants. Before he pulls on his white undershirt we observe a TATTOO that simply says \"Michael\" over his heart. \nHe searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a reasonably clean button down shirt... \nTYLER V/O Gandhi said that whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it... \n...And scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher brush. \nTYLER V/O ...I tend to agree with the first part. \n4   EXT. GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER                     4 \nA cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a funeral. It's a memorial. \nA beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day. \nTyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse. Time is money. \nTyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins towards the mourners. \nHis mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but doesn't want anyone to know she has. \nTYLER (sweetly) Hello, your majesty. How are you? \nDIANE I'm fine... you look good... \nHe kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his stepfather... \nLES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos. \nThe weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's holding a little paper bag. \nShe flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers... \nTYLER Thanks for organizing everybody. \nCaroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him. \nCAROLINE You smell like Listerine and beer. \nHe snorts and kisses her cheek. \nCaroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names: \"Mom\" \"Tyler\" \"Les\", \"Dad\", \"Caroline\". She begins to arrange them in a little circle on the grave. \nTyler's father... \nCHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator. \nCHARLES (aside, to Tyler) You couldn't wear a tie? \nTyler holds his father's eye. \nTYLER Could have. \nBeat. \nCharles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive. \nPOV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side- by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline sits on the ground, arranging the stones. \n5   INT. JUNIOR'S RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER                  5 \nThe family sits together in a booth. Tyler rolls a Bic lighter over his knuckles. Caroline draws a funny portrait of Tyler on her napkin. He is smoking nine cigarettes at once. Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. Les is eyeing the Cheesecake. Charles subtly aligns his silverware. \nDIANE ...This is nice... I think it's nice that we still do this... \nCAROLINE (gently) Mom. \nDIANE I forgot. I'm trying to purge \"nice\" from my vocabulary. Michael would like that we still do this. \n", "test1_id": 1686, "test2_input": "CAROLINE Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the bathroom. \nTyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground. \nCAROLINE Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna...like, listen to me? \nTYLER Dad loves you. \nCaroline gives him a look. \nCAROLINE So? You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them. \nCaroline is climbing around Alice. Her hands on Alice's hair. \nTYLER You've got that right. \nCAROLINE Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a \"yule tide homicide.\" \nTYLER That's because Aunt Sara drinks... You don't drink, right? \nCAROLINE Duh. \nTYLER So why would anyone wanna avoid you? \nCaroline shrugs, not convinced. A silent moment passes. \nCAROLINE Michael used to drink. \nTYLER Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21. \nA shared smile. \nCAROLINE You're 21. \nTyler's smile fades. \n13   INT. THE STRAND BOOKSTORE -- DAY                            13 \nTyler on a rolling ladder, shuffling books around. Aidan on the floor, eating two pieces of pizza, folded down the middle, at the same time. \nAIDAN What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year? Get a suite. Couple of ladies. You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think? \nTYLER I think I'd rather be sodomized. \nAIDAN Hey, it's your day. \nHe gestures to the shelves. \nAIDAN What's the point? How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway? There's like... \nAIDAN/TYLER \"Eight Miles of Books!\" \nTYLER I don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together... \nAIDAN No shit? \nTYLER And ended up dead or in prison. \nBeat. \nAIDAN This is why chicks dig you. \nTyler laughs. \nAIDAN Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me. \nTYLER Eh. \nAidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels. \nTYLER Hey! \nAIDAN Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here. (MORE) \nAIDAN (cont'd) I can't deal with this brooding introvert shit anymore man. I'm ready to set up an intervention. \nA silent moment passes. \nTYLER You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking? \nAIDAN One drink. Come out for one drink. \nTYLER When's the last time you had one drink? \n14   INT. DON HILL'S -- THAT NIGHT                                14 \n", "test2_true": "AIDAN Hey, Megan! \nShe ignores him. \nAIDAN You look great! Can I get two Heinekens? \nMEGAN Do. Not. Speak. \nTyler snorts with laughter. \nAIDAN (genuine) Is she mad at me or something? \nTYLER No no. Girls are like that when they're way into you. \nAIDAN Oh. \nTwo nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder. \nGIRL #1 Excuse me? \nAidan flashes a winning smile. \nAIDAN Well, hello... \nGIRL #1 Could you take a picture for us? \nShe holds out her camera. Aidan hesitates, then smiles. \nAIDAN My pleasure... \nThe girls pose. Aidan takes the camera. Turns it around. Extends it. Smiles. And promptly SNAPS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF. He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman. \nMegan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan. \nAIDAN Thanks. You've met my roommate... \nMEGAN I hope you die. \nTyler laughs his ass off. \nTYLER She's all over you. Cheers. \nThey clink bottles. \n15   EXT. GREENWICH STREET -- LATE NIGHT                          15 \nTyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a fine time. \nAIDAN I love this street. I love this city. Where are you guys from, again? \nAIDAN'S GIRL Miami. \nAIDAN Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New York is it, man. God broke the mold when he made this city. \nTYLER You ever actually been to any of those places? \nAIDAN What's your point? \nThere's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a tiny dress. \nAIDAN'S GIRL What are we doing? I'm freezing. \nAIDAN Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me. \nO/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into the night... \nVOICE O/S Michael...Mi-i-chael! \nTyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and fishes out his pack of cigarettes. \nAIDAN'S GIRL (to Aidan) Asshole. \nShe walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed. \nAIDAN'S GIRL Are you coming? \nTyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied. \nTYLER'S GIRL (to her friend) Hold on, Lauren. \nThe girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully. \nTyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND EQUIPMENT. \nA quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them. \n", "test2_id": 1687, "test3_input": "TYLER You're up. \nBeat. \nTYLER Can I get you anything? \nShe nods. \nTYLER I'll be out here if you need me. \nBeat. \nAlly takes off the shirt and lets it fall. \nShe stands there. \n53   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                             53 \nWe interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion. Tyler sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making. \nIn the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping, a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise and recognition. \nThen again. Young, hungry, aggressive. \nTIME LAPSE \nThey lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place. Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in this dream state, to make love all over again. \n54   INT. BEDROOM -- BEFORE SUNRISE                               54 \nThe sheets have been torn loose from the mattress. Ally lies asleep, curled in the comforter. Tyler lies awake beside her, he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to brighten. \nTyler gets out of bed. Grabs his journal. \nA NOTE propped up next to the bed: \"Please don't leave. I'll be back.\" \n55   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                       55 \nTyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop. \n56   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- SUNRISE                      56 \nThe place is empty. A few early RISERS get coffee to go. He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the binder clip. He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him. \nJanine enters. Orders two coffees. She sees Tyler, smiles. She picks up her coffees and approaches him. \nJANINE I can't believe you still come down here. \nTyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees. \nTYLER It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk? \nJANINE (shrugs) Old habits. You're not writing anything bad about me, are you? \nTYLER Not today. \nJANINE I gotta run. Early meetings. \nJanine turns to go, remembers something, turns back. \nJANINE I probably won't see you before Saturday so...happy birthday. \nTyler nods, tries to smile. Janine glances back as she goes. \nJANINE I'll be sure to tell your father that you said hello. \nTyler nods sheepishly. \n57   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- LATER                   57 \nTyler returns with breakfast. From Aidan's room, a pathetic croak... \nAIDAN O/S Bialy. \nTyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal. \nAlly lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little. \nTYLER Hey... \nALLY Hey... \nTyler sits. She shifts and curls next to him. \nALLY Where did you go? \n", "test3_true": "ALLY Why? \nTyler pulls his JOURNAL from his pocket. Hands it to her. \nTYLER There's a coffee shop. I brought you a Bialy. \nALLY New York is full of coffee shops. \nTYLER This one was our place... Michael's and mine. We had breakfast there all the time ... Maybe not as many times as I think we did. But enough times. Anyway we ate there that morning. It was the last place I saw him. \nALLY Oh. So you go there to write? To him? \nTYLER Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I guess I wanted to tell him about you. \nAlly is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses not to overdo it. She flips through the journal. She hands it back to him. Then out of nowhere. \nALLY My mom was murdered eight years ago. The same year your brother died. \nTyler is stunned. \nALLY You don't need to say anything, I know you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry, you know? \nHe does. \nALLY It's just, I need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy. (MORE) \nALLY (cont'd) I don't want you to think that because I'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not...I don't know, it's just recently, he seems really... \nShe looks at Tyler's face. His eyes are so patient. \nAlly tears up. \nALLY Wounded? Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something. \nTyler strokes her hair. \nALLY I don't feel like that, though. I feel like I'm getting stronger and like I'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself. \nShe is weeping. Tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can. Holding her and kissing her hair. \n58   INT. SIXTH PRECINCT -- 2 DAYS LATER.                         58 \nSergeant Craig standing with a ROOKIE OFFICER, berating. \nCRAIG Tell me something, Matthews, do you like paperwork? \nMATTHEWS No, sir. \nCraig is working up a head of steam. \nCRAIG Me neither. Nobody likes paperwork. But paperwork keeps our ship afloat. Paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags. But I can't do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing... \nLeo interrupts. \nLEO Jim... \nCraig snaps his head around. \nCRAIG ...What? \nLeo gestures to speak privately. \nLEO Ally called Sharon. \nCRAIG What? \nLEO She said to tell you, she's with friends, and she's fine. \nCRAIG What friends? \nLES She didn't say. \nCRAIG That's all? \nHis partner nods. Craig looks away. \nLEO I'm sorry, Jim. Listen, why don't you come over this weekend? We'll get the grill going. Sharon wants to see you. We can have some people, nice people...You can circulate a little... \nCRAIG No. \nLEO Jim... \nCRAIG Leo, no. Stop. \nCraig goes back to his desk. Leo looks after him. \n", "test3_id": 1688}

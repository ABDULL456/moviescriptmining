LARRY Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous. 
DEIRDRE And then... 
VINCENT And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned. 
DEIRDRE Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid. 
EXT. A POSH HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT 
A ROW OF ROOMS, each one with a light behind a shade.  Even as we watch the light in each room goes off: one two three four five six lights -- one for each member of the team.  The night before the big event nobody breaks curfew. 
ACROSS THE STREET - 
A BAR - 
Through the bar window we see the Watcher's silhouette.  A match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette, REVEALING his face for the first time: weathered, sharp, treacherous.  THE MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so do we. 
FADE IN ON: 
EXT. THE HILLS OF NICE - MORNING 
A PRIVATE ESTATE IN THE HILLS - 
A CARAVAN OF BLACK ARMOR PLATED CARS, all idling, ready to pull out, filled with muscular men in suits with bluges under their jackets, all of them waiting for - THE TARGET.  Except we've seem him before and he wasn't called the Target: he was the Killer from the first scene of the film: the gunman in the cathedral who made off with -  THE BRIEFCASE.  Which the briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.  Now the Target gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and - 
THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the length of the town adjacent to the beach.  It's a special place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for tourists.  Here we come upon - 
AN OUTDOOR CAFE - 
Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a HEADSET.  And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get a look at - 
THE REST OF THE CAFE - 
Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops, or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.  She types a sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out loud. 
DEIRDRE Alright, Gregor, I'm... 
CUT TO: 
INT. A CRAMPED COMPTUER CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME 
GREGOR (finishing her sentence) Ready when you are... 
Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's message, which we can read on his laptop.  Gregor also has a much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.  This is a map of incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice. Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city as it searches for the proper signal.  The computer isolates an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.  Now - On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET. The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR, driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the Target.  THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on - 
EXT. A SIDE STREET 
Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent sitting inside. 
INT. THE FIAT 
Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him, loading a small arsenal of weapons. 
The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent. 
EXT. ANOTHER STREET 
A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.  The DRUMS continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're jarring, setting our nerves on edge. 
INT. THE VOLVO 
LARRY Where is this broad? 
SWEDE You should learn a little patience. 
LARRY Is that right?

The gang's GASPING for BREATH. And then, unbelievably 
BENNY & THE BEAST 
Are coming right at them! They race across the sandlot. Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's pants. 
THE BEAST'S 
muscles flex. 
BENNY 
just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor. 
BENNY LOOK OUT! 
He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He careens toward the bottom of 
MR. MERTLE'S FENCE 
hits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN FIBERGLASS PANELS! 
BENNY 
jets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps - standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor "Singin' In The Rain" trick! 
THE BEAST 
sucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping maw first, right for 
BENNY 
who pushes off the top of the fence. 
THE BEAST 
GNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens, 
BENNY 
DROPS 
THE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH 
and comes tumbling down after the ball. 
BENNY (CONT'D) Oh noooooo! 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY 
Benny HITS the dirt with a gut twisting THUD! Dust everywhere. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY 
The gang climbs the fence. They look down into 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY 
where, when the dust clears, they see 
BENNY 
holding the Babe Ruth Autograph up high like a trophy. 
BENNY I GOT IT! 
THE GANG 
hops down and races over. Suddenly, from the 
FENCETOP 
His shirt snagged: 
SCOTTY Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help him! 
THE BEAST 
is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles - choking to death - right below Scotty. 
THE GANG 
petrifies where they stand. 
SCOTTY 
tears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs. Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in seconds. 
SCOTTY Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off! (DESPERATE) COME ON! 
NOBODY 
moves. They wanna but they can't! 
SCOTTY 
goes for broke. He reaches out and puts his hand on The Beast's head. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) (CONTACT) Easy. Easy, boy.

GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8 \nAs the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, then glances in the rearview mirror. \nGRADY That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it? \nMISS SLOVIAK Why yes. How did you know? \nGRADY Lucky guess. \nCRABTREE You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip?? \nGRADY It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money. \nCRABTREE He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire. \nGRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto butane. \nGRADY He said something about being between things. \nCRABTREE Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs. \n9\tEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER \nA YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger window. \nGRADY Hi, Tanya. (to the others) This is Tanya. My wife's secretary. \nCRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint. \nTANYA Grady.. ..Emily's not here. \nGRADY just smiles, nods. \nTANYA (cont'd) Is there anything I can do for you? \nGRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through Tanya's sad umbrella. \nGRADY You're leaking, Tanya. \nTanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain. \nCRABTREE Trip? ? \nGRADY She left me. Crabs. \nCRABTREE Left you...?  Who? Emily? \nGRADY This morning. I found a note in the kitchen. \nCRABTREE But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here? \nGRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield, turns on the ignition. \nGRADY I thought maybe I made it all up. \n10\tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING \nThrough the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching halt across the street, parks in front of another fire hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air. \nMISS SLOVIAK That's a nice greenhouse. \nGRADY It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby. \nCRABTREE I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp. \nGRADY Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today. \nCRABTREE Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do. \n11\tEXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE \nAs the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch. \nSARA Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you again. \nCRABTREE Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing. \nSARA Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to--oh! \nAs Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches forward ...into Grady's arms. \nGRADY Easy there. \nSARA I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things. \nMISS SLOVIAK Practice. \nSara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye. \nSARA I don't believe we've met... \nPoe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's. \nCRABTREE Walter! I see you've met my friend. \nWALTER GASKELL Yes . She' s charming. \nMISS SLOVIAK (taking her drink) Walter's been telling me the most fascinating things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it? \nWALTER GASKELL Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of American popular culture. Joe DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be controversial, I personally believe every woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn Monroe. \nMISS SLOVIAK Oh, I couldn't agree more. \nNEW ANGLE \nGRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN (\"Q\"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting the make on Hannah Green. \nQ And while my latest has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what I consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five. So, I find myself conflicted. \nGRADY Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in the Hamptons. \nHANNAH GREEN (brightening) Grady. \nQ eyes GRADY over his wine glass. \nQ Hello.. .Professor. \nGRADY Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' material for her. \nAs GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN. \nMAN IN TWEED (to short man) A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot bookstore like they need another goddamn cow. (as GRADY passes) Grady! \nGRADY Hello, Nathan. \nMAN IN TWEED My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for you, Grady. (to his friend) GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter, \nThe short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand. \nSHORT MAN Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years running. \nGRADY (pulling away) No wonder it's still in print. \nAs GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette. \nWOMAN WITH CIGARETTE ...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover the cancer in your heart every time, but God forbid they find a decent dry cleaner. \n14\tEXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT \nGRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE accosts him. \nMAN'S VOICE There you are. \nGRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK. \nWALTER I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you? \nSARA I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it. \nWALTER You'd recognize it if you tasted it. \nSARA I doubt it, darling. \nWALTER (angling & bottle to the light) Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour... \nSARA You want to keep him happy. \nWALTER If he' s happy. . . (kissing her as he exits) I'm happy. \nAs Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house. \nGRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch. \nGRADY James? \nJames Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm. \nJAMES LEER It's fake. \nJames' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL. \nJAMES LEER It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school. \nGRADY It's very convincing. \nJAMES LEER It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps. \nGRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat. \nJAMES LEER It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet... \nGRADY ...You carry firearms. \n15\tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nIt's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past the departing guests and toward the stairs. \nHANNAH GREEN Hey, you two. \nGRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer. \nHANNAH GREEN (cont'd) Are you riding with me, James? \nJAMES LEER No, I'm going ho-- \nGRADY He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right? \nHANNAH GREEN Ail right. By the way, his friend...? \nGRADY The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly? \nCRABTREE Here we are! \nCRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry. \nCRABTREE (spying James) Nell, hello there. \nCRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string. \nGRADY James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree. \nHANNAH GREEN James'll know about George Sanders. \nJAMES LEER George Sanders? \nHANNAH GREEN Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how. \nJAMES LEER Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room. \nThe few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue. \nCRABTREE How comprehensive of you. \nHANNAH GREEN Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else. \nJAMES LEER There's so many... \nHANNAH GREEN Just a few then. The big ones. \nJames glances at the loose group of people around him, watching, then... \nJAMES LEER Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . . (a trace of irony) He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia? \nHANNAH GREEN I haven't heard of half of those. \nCRABTREE You did them alphabetically. \nJames turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs shyly, looks away. \nJAMES LEER That's just how my brain works, I guess. \nCRABTREE Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me. \nJAMES LEER Actually. ..I just want to go home. \nCRABTREE Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip. \nAs he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if to say: \"Bring him.\"   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James glacially as we CUT TO: \nBLACK \nThe dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day. \n16\tINT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE \nGRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN- STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR. \nJAMES LEER Is that really it? \nGRADY That's really it. \nJAMES LEER The one she wore on her wedding day? \nGRADY So I'm told. \nJames, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments, stands speechless. \nGRADY (cont'd) Go ahead. \nJAMES LEER Really? \nGRADY Really. \nJames swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust. \nGRADY Yea, James. \nJAMES LEER What are we going to do with... \nJames glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange blue eyes gleaming. \nGRADY I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog. \nJAMES LEER You? \nGRADY Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman. \nJAMES LEER Does she want to hear it was one of her professors? \nGRADY I've got tenure. \n19\tEXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) \nAs sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE. \nGRADY Okay. \nJames totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs. \nJAMES LEER He's still a little warm. \nThey lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING. \nJAMES LEER Yuck. \nGRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets. \nJAMES LEER That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly. \nGRADY (searching) That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding... \nJAMES LEER Whose tuba is that anyway? \nGRADY Miss Sloviak's. \nJAMES LEER Can I ask you something about her? \nGRADY She is. Ah. Here we go... \nGRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane- size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of boxers. \nJAMES LEER Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he-- gay? \nGRADY Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here? \nGRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3. \nGRADY Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. (handing the bottle to James) Have one. \nJAMES LEER No thanks. I'm fine without them. \nGRADY Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle. \nGRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James. \nGRADY I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that. \nRecklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket. \nGRADY How 'bout we try that again. \n20\tINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER \nOn the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium. \nWALTER ...really needs no introduction. Walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at you. You all know the name, you all know the books, so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call.. .Q. \nAs the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID with a GOATEE .who regards him warily. \nQ Good evening. \nGRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory hush. Finally, he speaks again. \nQ I am a writer. \nAs the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement. \nQ (cont'd) As a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story. Every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a. story that would make a \"great book\" or a \"great movie.\" Presumably, each of you has an idea. (gestures to the audience) But, how do you go from there to here? How do you go from having an idea to having a book? How do you get across? What is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you... \nGRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far EXIT. A blink later, she is gone. \nQ (cont'd) ...and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell. \nGRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head... \nAbruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady. \nAs they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear. \nJAMES LEER This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out. \nGRADY Is he ail right? \nCRABTREE (rolling his eyes) He's fine. He's narrating. \nJAMES LEER We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time. \nSARA Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you to make that mistake, wait here. \nAs Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak. \nMISS SLOVIAK I need a ride. \nGRADY I'm your man. \n24\tEXT. STREET 24 \nAs the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase. \nGRADY There's an explanation. \nMISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, unzips her suitcase. \n25\tINT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING \nAs GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS. \nMISS SLOVIAK Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? \nGRADY James is. ..I don't know... \nMISS SLOVIAK Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed. \nGRADY I'm not sure that's possible. \nMISS SLOVIAK Sure it is. \nGRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her forehead. \nGRADY Listen, Antonia-- \nMISS SLOVIAK Tony. Now that I'm home. \nGRADY Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. \nMISS SLOVIAK Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind? \nTony angles the rearview mirror toward himself. \nGRADY He's writing his name in water. \nMISS SLOVIAK What's that? \nGRADY Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one. \nMISS SLOVIAK That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit. \nGRADY He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit. \nTony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks. \nMISS SLOVIAK You mean because his career's ruined and all? \nGRADY Jesus. Is that what he told you? \nMISS SLOVIAK He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of .a. . . \nAs Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse of his own swollen eyes. \nMISS SLOVIAK ...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good that he'll be able to keep his job. \nHearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points. \nMISS SLOVIAK (cont'd) Turn here. \n26\tEXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE \nGRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a little white BAND SHELL painted with stars. \nGRADY That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap. \nMISS SLOVIAK It's a bathtub. What she's standing under. \nThe PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN squints through the screen door. \nMISS SLOVIAK There's Pop. (turning) Let me see it. The gun. \nGRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony smirks. \nGRADY Wait here. I'll be right back. \nCRABTREE Where would we go? \n34\tINT. LOBBY \nThe JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps his hand against the glass. \nJANITOR It's open. \nGRADY pushes on the door and it opens. \nJANITOR (cont'd) Hey, Professor Tripp. (off Grady's look) Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. Then I dropped out of school. \nGRADY I hope it wasn't my fault. \nTRAXLER (taking him seriously) No. I guess you're here for the backpack. \nGRADY Oh.. .yeah. \n35\tINT. AUDITORIUM \nThe knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail. \nTRAXLER I saw the manuscript inside. So when you showed up, I figured. . . \nGRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and then, halfway down, TEXT. \nTRAXLER Is it good? \nGRADY (reading) I don't know. It might be... \n36     CUT \n37\tEXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER \nGRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops. \nCrabtree. Q. The car. Gone. \n38\tINT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT \nTraxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR. \nTRAXLER Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer? \nGRADY Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know? \nTRAXLER Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you? \nSam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch. \nGRADY Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb. \nTRAXLER Sick. \n39\tEXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) \nSam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street from the Gaskell's house. \nTRAXLER Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your wife? \nGRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse. \nGRADY No, my wife's out of town. \nJust then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. Walter appears on the front steps. \nTRAXLER (cont'd) Who's that guy? \nGRADY Her husband. \nTraxler looks anxiously at the police car. \nTRAXLER What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp? \nGRADY (staring at Sara) Taking the long way home. \n39A\tEXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER \nAs Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens. \n40\tINT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE \nGRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him. \n41\tINT. LIVING ROOM \nThe room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T- shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his disappointment--only the red cowboy boots. \nHe picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits. \nGRADY Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right. \nJAMES LEER I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single-spaced? \nJames has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on Grady's desk. \nGRADY Afraid so. \nJAMES LEER That's a big book you're writing. \nGRADY I think it's sort of writing itself at this point. \nJAMES LEER Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but-- \nGRADY But . . . ? \nJAMES LEER Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people--some of the kids in workshop--thought maybe you were... \nGRADY Washed up? \nJAMES LEER Blocked. \nGRADY Ah. I don't believe in writer's block. \nJames takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript. \nJAMES LEER No kidding. \nA LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, materialize in the hallway. \nCRABTREE Good morning, boys. James. \nJames waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag. \nGRADY (re: James' \"attire\") If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, I'd put on something a little less comfortable if I were you. \nAs GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE seems to have made him suddenly queasy. \nJAMES LEER Professor Tripp? \nGRADY Hm. \nJAMES LEER How did I get here last night? \nGRADY No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch. \nJAMES LEER And ...and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad? \nGRADY Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia. \nAs James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now parked at the bottom of his driveway. \nGRADY Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide. \n46\tEXT. FRONT PORCH \nA POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the door opens, GRADY appears. \nOFFICER PUPCIK Good morning... (eyeing Grady's robe) Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but I understand you attended an event at Sara and Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one of the last to leave... \n47\tINT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47 \nJames lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the sleeping bag, straining to hear. \nOFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.) ...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of place. Suspicious maybe... \n48\tEXT. FRONT PORCH \nGRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought. \nGRADY Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey. \nOFFICER PUPCIK A jockey? You mean, like-- \nGRADY Horses, right. Vernon something... (thinking... ) Hardpple \nPupcik stops on his pad, looks up. \nOFFICER PUPCIK Hardapple? \nGRADY I could be wrong. What happened anyway? \nOFFICER PUPCIK Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing. \nGRADY That's weird. \nOFFICER PUPCIK We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over. \nGRADY The perpetrator. \nOFFICER PUPCIK No, the dog. \nGRADY I don't know... (unconvincingly) Me. \nGRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST PAPERBACK. GRADY frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS. \nA thought evolves. \nGRADY (cont'd) (the balloons) What do you think of these? \nJames takes another chug from his jug, nods. \nJAMES LEER Nice. \n51\tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING \nGrady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off. \n52\tINT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS \nGRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the glovebox, then peers at the house. \nJAMES LEER (the house) Isn't this...? \nGRADY Hm. \nGRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down. \nGRADY You better ease off that stuff, James. It's pretty acidic. \nJames takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, studies it curiously. \nJAMES LEER I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me. \nGRADY Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you? \nAs GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets the donut in precisely the same place. \n53\tINT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER \nThrough the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement. \nSARA O.S.) Feeling guilty? \nGRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands. \nSARA (cont'd) I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick. \nGRADY Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk? \nSara nods, moves the ficus to another table. \nSARA Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too. \nGRADY I-heard. \nSARA You heard? How? \nGRADY A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning. \nSARA Did you confess? \nGRADY looks up, mildly alarmed. \nSARA Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom. \nGRADY Really? That was fast. \nSARA (frowning) I'm kidding. Hello? \nGRADY Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell... \nSARA Are you limping? Why are you limping? \nGRADY Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . \nSARA Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere? \nGRADY No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something. \nSARA All right. \nSara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting. \nGRADY I... \nAs GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. \nGRADY (cont'd) ...want to be with you. \nSara looks at him. \nSARA Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I don't know whether to swoon or smirk. \nGRADY Carvel? Where's Carvel? \nJAMES LEER Outside Scranton. \nGRADY I never heard of it. \nJAMES LEER It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years. \nGRADY Your father worked in a mannequin factory? \nJAMES LEER Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer. \nGRADY What kind of dancer? . \nJAMES LEER Whatever kind they wanted her to be. \nGRADY (in disbelief) James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper? \nJAMES LEER I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt. \nGRADY Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school? \nJAMES LEER When we fall, we fall hard. \nGRADY Amazing. \nGRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then notices-with surprise--James has his hand out. \nGRADY (cont'd) I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions. \nJAMES LEER Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself. \n55\tEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER) \nGRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers. \nJAMES LEER This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? \nGRADY Kinship. \nJAMES LEER Kinship. And what's here? \nGRADY Unless I miss my bet...my wife. \nJames' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise. \nJAMES LEER The one that left you? \nGRADY That's right. That one. \n56\tEXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE \nGRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window, squints inside. Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's sitting in the indentation. \nJAMES LEER Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..- \nGRADY How can you tell? \nJAMES LEER You can see the outline of a butt. \nAs GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box. \nJAMES LEER (cont'd) Want one. They're incredible. Incredible. \nGRADY Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box. \n58\tEXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER) \nAs GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows. \nJAMES LEER Maybe she didn't come here. \nGRADY She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through. \nJames stares at the \"Doggy Door\" cut into the back porch door. \nGRADY Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. \nJAMES LEER It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you know-of what's in the car. In the trunk. \nGRADY (a pang of guilt himself) Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that. \nJames takes another sad glance at the little door, then drops onto ail fours. \n59\tINT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nGRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that people will gather together, light a fire, talk. \nJAMES LEER It feels really... good. ..here. \nGRADY I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. (moving off) Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. \nGRADY Mom. Dad. \n70\tINT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) \nHank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool. \nHANK Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you to-find someone who knows what they're doing. Here. Put your foot up. \nGRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author is himself. \nHANK So he's one of your students, this boy? \nGRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James is looking out the window, a curious expression on his face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances back into the living room, he and James make brief eye contact, then blink, look away. \nGRADY Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up. \nHANK Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine. \nGRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book. \nGRADY What made you pull out that old thing? \nHANK (shrugging) I was thinking of you. \nGRADY And? \nHANK It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young. \nGRADY Maybe I should read it. \nHANK Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady. \nGRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time. \nGRADY Where's Emily, Hank? \nHANK I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you that, Grady. \nGRADY I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. ..want to know where I stand. \nHank looks up, incredulous. \nHANK Where you stand? \nGRADY (embarrassed) l-just want to say I'm sorry. \nHANK She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist. \nGRADY Neurologist? Why? What's wrong? \nHANK (frowning) Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together. \nGRADY (sheepishly) Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and-- \nHANK Ah, right. The book. \nGRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa. \nGRADY Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. \nHANK Why did you come here, Grady? \nGRADY gestures vaguely. \nGRADY I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this-everything that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't mean \"Goodbye.\" \nHANK Give me a break, Grady. \nHank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle. \nHANK You're done. \n71\tINT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71 \nGRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting out any heat. \nJAMES LEER I'm having a really good time, Professor Tripp. \nGRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc. \nGRADY I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's not for amateurs. \nJames looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat LEVER. \nJAMES LEER I just wanted a little sip. \nGRADY (squinting at him) I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy? \nJAMES LEER Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night. \nGRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose face bears not the slightest trace of irony. \nFinally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY kicks open his door, steps out. \n73INT/\tEXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER \nGRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he speaks. \nGRADY C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm sure. It's outside Scranton. \nGRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by himself on the far side of the coffee shop. \nGRADY You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd be pretty interested to learn that the good people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this up as I go along-- \nGRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head. \nGRADY (cont'd) Never mind. My mistake. \n74\tEXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74 \nGRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch. \nHe takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it says only: \"On File.\" But if one was to dial the PHONE NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the Greyhound depot who picks up. \n75\tINT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER) \nThe remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars that whip by on the highway beyond the window. \nJAMES LEER Want a bite? \nGRADY No thanks. \nJAMES LEER That's why you're having them. Your spells. \nGRADY Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells. \nJAMES LEER What would you call them then? \nGRADY I don't know. ...'Episodes.' \nJames shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie. \nJAMES LEER It's because you don't eat. \nGRADY I eat. \nJAMES LEER When? \nGRADY When nobody's looking. \nGRADY watches a pair of headlights approach... \nJAMES LEER (mouth full, garbled) I just worry about you, that's all. \n...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks at him. \nGRADY You just worry about yourself, James. Okay? \nJAMES LEER Okay. \nJust then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises. \nJAMES LEER (cont'd) Where you going? \nGRADY Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat. \nGRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words. \n76\tEXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL \nAs GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of the sun visor. \nMAN (eyeing GRADY dubiously) Professor Tripp? \nGRADY Grady. \nMAN Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda. \nGRADY (re: their clothes) Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening. \nFRED LEER Hardly. \nAMANDA LEER We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck would have it, the club was on the way, so... (snapping shut the visor) We were able to put in an appearance. \nFRED LEER Otherwise we would've been here earlier. \nGRADY Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a little dinner. \nFRED LEER Well, certainly we'll reimburse you. \nGRADY That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might be good for James to be with his family this weekend. \nFRED LEER Well, of course, we can understand that. \nGrady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the Galaxie in the middle of the street. \nGRADY (knowingly) Crabtree. \n81\tINT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nTimes Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs. \n82\tINT. GRADY'S OFFICE \nHannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT. \nGRADY (entering) Hey. \nHANNAH GREEN Grady! \nShe slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at her thigh. GRADY stares. The manuscript. It's his. \nHANNAH GREEN (embarrassed) I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and-and--I suck. \nGRADY No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around? \nHANNAH GREEN I don't know--maybe- I don't think so. \nGrady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere. \nGRADY Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt. \nHANNAH GREEN He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one. \nGRADY Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What? \nHANNAH GREEN At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet - \nGRADY Jesus. \nHANNAH GREEN CRABTREE said it sounded like something James would be messed up in. \nGRADY Crabtree? He doesn't even know James. \nHANNAH GREEN Who does? \nJust then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway outside. \nCRABTREE (O.S.) Trip?! Where are you' \nGRADY looks anxiously toward the door. \nGRADY The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day? \nHANNAH GREEN I told you, Sewickly Heights. \nGRADY But where? I need the street. \nHANNAH GREEN I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner. \nCRABTREE (O.S.) Trip?! \nGRADY Shit. \nAs GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger inside his belt buckle. \nHANNAH GREEN No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for you. \nGRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks terrified. \nGRADY Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I-- \nCRABTREE (bursting in) Tripp, where the hell. . . \nCRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him. \nCRABTREE (cont'd) Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student- teacher conference? \nGRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, points at Crabtree. \nGRADY You stay there. \nCRABTREE What? Ohhhh. Is that... it? \nCRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked on Grady's desk. \nCRABTREE Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you? \nGRADY Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room. \nCRABTREE Sometimes we have to improvise. \nGRADY (ignoring him) Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and. ..me? \nCRABTREE James? My James? What's happened? \n86\tEXT. BASEMENT DOOR \nThe DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves. \nJAMES LEER Hey. What are you guys doing here? \nCRABTREE We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on. \nAs they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once- over. \nGRADY I can't believe you made fun of my robe. \n87\tINT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87 \nElectric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY. \nCRABTREE I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in? \nJAMES LEER The candelabras were my Gran's. \nGRADY Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here. \nCRABTREE Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing-- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed. \nJames scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning. \nJAMES LEER Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this again. Professor Tripp? \nGRADY Ah, wear whatever you want. \nJames flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom. \nCRABTREE So modest. \nGRADY So sensitive. \nCRABTREE (nosing around the room) Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack. \nGRADY It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth. \nCRABTREE The-truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Key, check this out... \nCRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage. \nCRABTREE Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.' (with an amused smile) Sound like anyone we know? (resuming) But it was later, when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight... (frowning) Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely needs an editor. (resuming) ...and muttered simply, \"It means nothing. All of it. Nothing,\" that the true shock came. It was then that the boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in a darker place. His heart...' \nCRABTREE stops abruptly. \nGRADY Yes? 'His heart...' \nCRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on: \nCRABTREE 'His heart, once capable of inspiring others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It beat now only because it could. ' \nGRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns. \nJAMES LEER I'm ready... \nJames stops, sees the two men looking at him. \nJAMES LEER You all right, Professor Tripp? \nCRABTREE He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast. \nJAMES LEER Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call the police or.. .something. \nCRABTREE Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference. \nJAMES LEER (brightening) Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams. \nGRADY No. \nCRABTREE and James turn. \nGRADY I've got something better than a teddy bear. \nCUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' bed. \n88\tINT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) \nGRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment. \nGRADY Sweet dreams, Jimmy. \n89\tEXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER \nThe lights are still blazing, the front door is wide open, but not a soul remains. \n90\tINT. LIVING ROOM \nA quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and GRADY appear. \nGRADY Sara. I'm in love with her. \nSilence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, administrative. \nWALTER'S VOICE Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now. \nGRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice. \nGRADY No. \nWALTER'S VOICE Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning. \nAs the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's just done. \n95\tEXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) \nA CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling from-the window. \n96\tINT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME \nA heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the piece of paper curling from his typewriter. \nGRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE \nIt's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara. \n97\tEXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE \nGRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn.. \nGRADY Sara. \nSARA I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong... \nSara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone. \nSARA (cont'd) ...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was ringing loud and clear this morning. \nGRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure it's not good. \nGRADY Oh? \nSARA It seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed. \nGRADY (slumping to the porch) I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my- \nSara raises her hand, silencing him. \nSARA I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady? \nGRADY Inside. \nSARA And the jacket? \nGRADY Over there. In the backseat of the... \nGrady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil stain roughly the shape of North Dakota. \nGRADY (cont'd) Someone stole my car. \nSARA Grady. \nGRADY Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night. \nSARA Are you sure you parked it there? \nGRADY Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back. \nSara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb. \nSARA I'll deal with this. You dig up James. \n98\tINT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nCRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the . sole visible part of .James Leer. \nGRADY (swinging in) Is he awake? \nCRABTREE I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid. \nGRADY Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away. \nJAMES LEER (from under the covers) That same guy? \nCRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one eye. \nJAMES LEER You snore. \nCRABTREE So I hear. \nJAMES LEER (studying Grady) No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy. \nVERNON Shut up. (to Oola) Cupcake. Please. Inside. \nOOLA You' re not going to shoot him, are you? \nVERNON I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that gun down. \nGRADY It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore. \nVERNON Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun. \nGRADY No, really.... \nGRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead. \n107\tINT. HANNAH'S RENAULT \nCRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind. \nCRABTREE Holy shit. \n108\tEXT. KRAVNIKS \nVernon stands half-hunched, stunned. \nVERNON Are you crazy! \nThe gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand. \nVERNON (cont'd) Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you see the condition my girl's in? \nAs GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on Oola's tummy. \nVERNON You all right, cupcake? \nOOLA Who's Vernon? \nA rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them. \nVERNON What the...? \nGears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails wildly, then kicks open the passenger door. \nCRABTREE Tripp! Run! \nGRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then turns back for another pass. \nVERNON Who the hell is that? \nGRADY A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch. \nThe car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, Vernon, and Oola. \nVERNON Woah. \nVernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine. \nVERNON (cont'd) Pull off, you crazy motherfucker! \nFrantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and the oncoming Crabtree. \nGRADY No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver. \nCRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky. \nOnly, these ain't birds.  \u0095 - ^ \nGRADY Oh... my... God! \nThese are PAGES. Seven years of-pages. \nCRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS. \nAs Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the Ohio River. \nGRADY (cont'd) (to Vernon) I take it back.  Shoot him. \n109\tINT. GALAXIE - MOVING \nVernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print. \nCRABTREE Naturally you have copies. \nGRADY I have an alternate version of the first chapter. \nCRABTREE You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage. \nGRADY That was MacCaulay. \nCRABTREE Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories. \nGRADY He was never able to reproduce them. \nGRADY Came to my senses. CRABTREE \nAh. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his? \nGRADY Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that. \nCRABTREE Do you know he won't expel him? \nGRADY No. But I don't think that matters. \nCRABTREE That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher. \nGRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant. \nGRADY Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell them what you know. You tell them to find their voice and stick with it, because that's all you have in the end. You tell the ones who have it to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way to get where you're going. (ruefully) Of course, it helps if you know where you want to go. (thoughtfully) Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara-- that's made the last seven years worthwhile. \nGRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles cryptically as he considers it. - \nGRADY (cont'd) As for James, he doesn't need me anymore... \nWithout warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack. \nGRADY (cont'd) He's got you. \nCRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, watches GRADY walk away. \nCRABTREE Me? What can I do? \nGRADY Gee, I don't know, Crabs... (over his shoulder) Improvise. You're good at that. \nGRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as he walks toward the buildings in the distance. \nCRABTREE I'm sorry, Tripp. \nGRADY stops, turns. \nGRADY You peeked, didn't you? \nCRABTREE I peeked. \nGRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter anymore \nCRABTREE It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a lot to admire. I've ...never read anything quite like it. \nIf there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, and show. And GRADY knows it. \nGRADY You're not just trying to make me feel better? \nCRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend. \nCRABTREE Scout's honor. \nCRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation. \nGRADY Well, thanks for that, Crabs. \n111\tINT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT \nDead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the stairwell, then GRADY limps into view. \n112\tINT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nGRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks. \nHe walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner down into a triangle along the first crease... \n113\tEXT. QUAD \nA moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove. \n114\tINT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER \nGRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER. \nGRADY Sara! \nSara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him. \nQ Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's a description of a bald cypress that left' me breathless. \nGRADY (pushing past him) Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank teller's breasts in your last one. \n115\tINT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL \nGRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way behind the back row, scanning the aisles. \nGIRL'S VOICS Hey, Professor Tripp. \nIt's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- next to her. \nCARRIE MCWHIRTY If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the aisle. \n...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back. \nSARA Grady, what are you doing, you idiot? \nGRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face. \nGRADY Looking for you. \nHe wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS... \nfaintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH upward until we see that she is... \nKISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue. \n121\tINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nGRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW fall outside. \nThe DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. His NAMETAG says GREENHUT. \nGRADY I passed out. \nGREENHUT You did. \nGRADY I've been doing that a lot lately. \nGREENHUT So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand. \nGRADY Do you think that's why I've been having these... (grabbing James' term) ... spells? \nGREENHUT How long have you been having them? \nGRADY The last month maybe. \nGREENHUT How long have you been smoking marijuana? \nGRADY Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe. \nGREENHUT That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? \nGRADY I've been trying to finish a book... \nGREENHUT And your wife left you. \nGRADY Is that in my chart? \nGREENHUT I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did. \nGRADY considers the larger ramifications of this statement \nGRADY I know. \nGREENHUT (tapping the glucose bottle) You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well. \nGRADY She told you about. . . \nGREENHUT Her dog, yes. \nGRADY Actually, it was her husband's dog... \nGreenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the first time, and GRADY stops. \nGREENHUT Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately. \nGRADY They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing. \nGREENHUT Better luck next time. \nGRADY So is my friend...is Sara still here? \nGREENHUT No. There's no one here. \nGRADY I have to see her. As soon as possible. \nGreenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch. \nGREENHUT Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and I want you to follow it to the end-no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else. All right? \n122\tINT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON \nGRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that connects one building to another. \nGRADY I wonder if you could show me something. \n123\tEXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER \nGRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple and crazy with veins. \nGRADY Are these the only ones you have? \nThe nurse's eyes crinkle. \n", "test1_input": "THE WONDER BOYS \nWONDER BOYS \nBASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON \nScreenplay/Steve Kloves \nJanuary 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) January 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) December 18,1998 \nAll IS A BLUR. . . \n...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES. \nGRADY 'The young girl sat perfectly still in the confessional... \n1\tINT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON \nGrady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop. \nGRADY ...listening to her father's boots scrape like chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then grow faint, then disappear altogether.' \nAs he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads: \nWELCOME TO WORDFEST \nGRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if they've been on a field trip to the DMV. \nGRADY (cont'd) (a wave of the pages) So. .Anyone? \nA GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the window. \nCARRIE MCWHIRTY Let me get this straight. The girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession--only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is that it? \nJames Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY OVERCOAT he wears. \nCARRIE MCWHIRTY I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics? \nGRADY All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, shall we? Howard, what about you? \nHOWARD I hated it. \nGRADY That's not exactly what I meant by constructive, Howard. \nHOWARD I think James should try to be more constructive. This is my second semester with him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me want to kill myself. \nGRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. \nGRADY Yes, Hannah? \nHANNAH GREEN I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes . . . courage . \nGRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative. \nGRADY Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I think. (as the students rise) Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30. \nHannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady. \nGRADY Thanks for that. He all right? \nHANNAH GREEN I think so. ..What about you? \nGRADY Me? Sure. Why? \nHANNAH GREEN Just checking. \nGRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. \nJAMES LEER Turn out the light, please. \nGRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK. \n2\tINT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) \nGRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful of SLICK PROGRAMS. \nSARA (calm but firm) No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for today. This means we have no programs for the weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are going. (shaking her head) It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it. \nGRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. There is the slightest of hesitations, then.... \nSARA Professor Tripp. \nGRADY Chancellor. \nSARA I got the message you called. \nGRADY I got the message you called too. \nThis hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and continue on, without so much as a backward glance. \n3\tINT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING \n", "test1_true": "WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28 \n4\tEXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH \nGRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. \n5\tINT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT \nGRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half the length of the terminal, until... \n6\tINT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT \n...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels. Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the woman's ear, then spots Grady. \nCRABTREE Tripp! \nGRADY How are you, Crabtree? \nCRABTREE Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia. . .uh. . . . \nWOMAN Sloviak. \nCRABTREE I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. Trip? ? \nGRADY (a slight beat) The more the merrier. \nMISS SLOVIAK Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was ail so interesting. \nCRABTREE I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor... \nGRADY I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling. \nMISS SLOVIAK (indicating Crabtree) That's exactly what he said. \nCRABTREE We know each other pretty well. (to Grady) So where's Emily? \nGRADY Emily? \nCRABTREE Your wife. \nGRADY Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown. \nCRABTREE Perfect. Well then, shall we? \nGRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree. \n7\tINT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER \nGRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact. \nCRABTREE Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh. \nGRADY Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities. \nCRABTREE If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me. \nGRADY She's a transvestite. \nCRABTREE You're stoned. \nGRADY She's still a transvestite. \nCRABTREE Mm. \nGRADY Isn't she? \nCrabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he watches the carousel spin. \nCRABTREE So how's the book? \nGRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so soon. He tries to act casual. \nGRADY It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of. ..tinkering with it. \nCRABTREE Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible? \nGRADY I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . juncture . \nCRABTREE I thought you were tinkering. \nGRADY I just mean. . . \nCRABTREE Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But... (pointedly) ...I get pressure. Know what I mean? \nGRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's face brightens again. \nCRABTREE Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would be? \nGRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto the carousel. \nGRADY That would be a tuba. \n", "test2_input": "CRABTREE Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. .Curtis Hardapple. \nGRADY Not Curtis. \nCRABTREE Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled. \nGRADY And now he's addicted to painkillers. \nCRABTREE He can't piss standing up anymore. \nGRADY He lives with his mother. \nCRABTREE And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . . a. . . \nGRADY Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames Vernon for his death. \nCRABTREE (stumped) Because. . .because. . . \nJAMES LEER (sleepily) .. .he was killed, when a gangster named Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite horse. He took the bullet himself. \nGRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens one bloodshot eye to regard them. \nJAMES LEER Vernon, over there, was in on the hit. \nJames' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady. \nCRABTREE That was good. \nGRADY He heard everything we were saying. \nJust then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots. \nHANNAH GREEN Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me. \n30\tINT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30 \nGRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a sexy, measured blues. \nHANNAH GREEN I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. \nGRADY I thank you. \nHANNAH GREEN And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. \nGRADY I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get. \nGRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair from James Leer's forehead. \nHANNAH GREEN So what are you going to do? \nGRADY Do? \nHANNAH GREEN I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home. \nGRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The tile that would reflect his head is missing. \nGRADY Are you holding me up or am I dragging you down? \nHannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest. \nHANNAH GREEN Shush. \n31\tEXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM) \nGrady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender. \nGRADY Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay? \nHANNAH GREEN I would if I knew where I was taking him. \nGRADY Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives? \nHANNAH GREEN Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it. \nGRADY That strikes me as odd. \nHANNAH GREEN James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... (remembering) Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember. \nJames MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car. \nJAMES LEER Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap.... \nGRADY What's he saying? \nHANNAH GREEN His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside. \nGRADY Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was... \nGRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. CRABTREE and Q huddle inside. \nGRADY Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium. \n", "test2_true": "GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door. \nGRADY (cont'd) All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa. \nHANNAH GREEN The one in your office? It's the best one .for naps. \nGRADY I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point. \nAs GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady. \nGRADY Ail right. In my office. \nAs GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his face. \nHANNAH GREEN Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up. \nGRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears. \nVernon Hardapple. \nVERNON HARDAPPLE You driving this car? \nGRADY Excuse me? \nVERNON HARDAPPLE This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car? \nGRADY It's mine. \nVERNON HARDAPPLE Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker. \nGRADY You must be mistaken. \nVERNON HARDAPPLE Bullshit. \nGRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door. \nGRADY Go home to your mother, Vernon. \n32\tINT. GALAXIE \nGRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat. \nGRADY \nAll right, what's the matter? \nCRABTREE just keeps smiling. \nGRADY Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma. \nCRABTREE Tripp. \nGRADY Yes. \nCRABTREE Hit your brakes. \nGRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield. \nQ (squinting) Oh my God! What is that? \nIt's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the beams of light. \nGRADY What's this guy's problem? \nCRABTREE Just go around him. \nGRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances back in front of Grady's grille. \nGRADY Shit. \nCRABTREE Back up. Go out the other way. \nGRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie. \nAs GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins. \nGRADY Now what? \nQ (mischievously) You could always go over him. \nThen, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the night. \nQ What just happened? \nGRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood. \nGRADY I just had my car jumped on. \n33\tEXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER) \nGrady stops the car in the red zone and gets out. \n", "test3_input": "GRADY I think I might have. \nSARA And what do you think you might have said? \nGRADY I think I might've said I was in love with you. \nSara's face remains .unchanged. \nGRADY (cont'd) He told you. \nSARA He told me. \nGRADY And what did you say? \nSARA I said it didn't sound like you. \nSara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt which claims \"Ativan Chases the Clouds Away.\" \nCRABTREE So- what do we do now? , \nGRADY Find the jacket. \nCRABTREE Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that? \nGRADY First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car. \nCRABTREE It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas. \n100\tINT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100 \nHannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the foot of-her bed, fully clothed. \nGOATEE KID I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent homosexual love. Look at the way they dance-- it's sodomy. \nHANNAH GREEN (laughing) Stop it. \nHannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave. \nHANNAH GREEN Grady. Hi. What's up? \nJeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily. \nGOATEE KID I'll be ...somewhere else. \nGRADY Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall. \nJeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks. \nGRADY He cribbed that from Borges. \nHANNAH GREEN It beats 'What's your major?' \nGRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice. \nGRADY Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission. \nHANNAH GREEN Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. ..to your book. \nThe hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a cloud. \nHANNAH GREEN I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep. \nGRADY That good, hub? \nHANNAH GREEN No, it's not that, it's... \nHannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady. \nHANNAH GREEN It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us '-that writers make choices--at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great-I mean, really great- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and ail the dental records and so on-and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... (with trepidation) ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence. \nGRADY (stung) Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence. ' \nHannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers his manuscript and exits. \n101\tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nCrabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs. \nCRABTREE Want some help with that? \nGRADY (passing by) Don't touch it. \n102\tINT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING \nCRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic. \nCRABTREE Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car. \nGRADY Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give. \nCRABTREE So whose car is it? \n", "test3_true": "CRABTREE The hood jumper? \nGRADY He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his. \nCRABTREE Such as. \nGRADY 'That's my car, motherfucker.' \nCRABTREE Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car... \nGRADY ...we find the jacket. \nCRABTREE There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up. \nGRADY No wonder he screwed us over. \nCUT TO: \nBILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT STOREFRONT. \n103\tINT. HANNAH'S CAR \nCRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, and blinks in amazement. \nCRABTREE Christ, Tripp. How did you know? \nGRADY Call it a hunch. \nParked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie. \nCRABTREE I'd call it genius. \nGRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat. \nGRADY It's good to know I'm still talented at something. Keep the motor running. \n104\tEXT./\tINT. GALAXIE    104 \nGRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box, and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it anyway, then spies something else. \nJames Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL. \nGRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a SWEET, SOFT BLUR... \n105\tINT. HANNAH'S RENAULT \nCRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a man who has pulled off the road to take a nap. \nCRABTREE What the hell... \n106\tINT. GALAXIE \nAs GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes it's not a cloud at all, it's \nMARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a bright pink dress under her wedding jacket. \nMARILYN I know you. . . \nMarilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and besides, she's ...fat. \nMARILYN (cont'd) Double Dickel on the rocks. \nThe last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds- standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from the Hi-Hat Club. \nGRADY Oola. \nOOLA I never forget a drink. \nGRADY I never forget an Oola. \nSuddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK. \nMAN'S VOICE (0.S.) Forget me? \nGRADY starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his temple. Grady's eyes slide. \nGRADY Vernon. \nVERNON (to Oola) Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun. \nGRADY Who's got a gun? \nVERNON You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it! \nGRADY Relax, Vernon... \nOOLA Why's he calling you Vernon? \nVERNON Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's why. He probably calls everybody Vernon. \nGRADY Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K. \n"}

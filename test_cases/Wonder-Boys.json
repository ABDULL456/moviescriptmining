LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nIt's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past the departing guests and toward the stairs. \nHANNAH GREEN Hey, you two. \nGRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer. \nHANNAH GREEN (cont'd) Are you riding with me, James? \nJAMES LEER No, I'm going ho-- \nGRADY He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right? \nHANNAH GREEN Ail right. By the way, his friend...? \nGRADY The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly? \nCRABTREE Here we are! \nCRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry. \nCRABTREE (spying James) Nell, hello there. \nCRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string. \nGRADY James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree. \nHANNAH GREEN James'll know about George Sanders. \nJAMES LEER George Sanders? \nHANNAH GREEN Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how. \nJAMES LEER Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room. \nThe few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue. \nCRABTREE How comprehensive of you. \nHANNAH GREEN Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else. \nJAMES LEER There's so many... \nHANNAH GREEN Just a few then. The big ones. \nJames glances at the loose group of people around him, watching, then... \nJAMES LEER Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . . (a trace of irony) He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia? \nHANNAH GREEN I haven't heard of half of those. \nCRABTREE You did them alphabetically. \nJames turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs shyly, looks away. \nJAMES LEER That's just how my brain works, I guess. \nCRABTREE Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me. \nJAMES LEER Actually. ..I just want to go home. \nCRABTREE Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip. \nAs he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if to say: \"Bring him.\"   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James glacially as we CUT TO: \nBLACK \nThe dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day. \n16\tINT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE \nGRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN- STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR. \nJAMES LEER Is that really it? \nGRADY That's really it. \nJAMES LEER The one she wore on her wedding day? \nGRADY So I'm told. \nJames, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments, stands speechless. \nGRADY (cont'd) Go ahead. \nJAMES LEER Really? \nGRADY Really. \nJames swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust. \n", "test1_true": "GRADY Like the lady herself. \nGRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it. \nJAMES LEER She was small. Most people don't know that. The shoulders are small. (touching the satin) It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time she wore it. That day. She must've felt so ...happy. \nGRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, lifts it lightly. \nJAMES LEER It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot. \nGRADY I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things. \nJAMES LEER You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you? \nGrady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains unchanged, consumed with the jacket. \nGRADY (carefully) Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too. \nJAMES LEER I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this. \nGRADY Right. \nA DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away. \nGRADY We, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- James? You ail right? \nJames is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, knapsack between his knees, head in hands. \nJAMES LEER I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad. \nGRADY Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight. \nJAMES LEER You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? (off Grady's look) Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a note. \nGRADY Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now. \nWithout thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today. \nJames just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows. \n17\tINT. HALLWAY \nA LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in Grady's direction. \nGRADY Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . . \nGRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle. \nGRADY Jesus! \nGRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap. \nGRADY Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch! \nPoe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp... \nCRACK! CRACK! \nPoe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto Grady's legs. GRADY turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen. \nGRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James. \nGRADY Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog. \nJAMES LEER I had to. Didn't I? \nGRADY Couldn't you've just pulled him off me? \nJAMES LEER No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 thought -- \nGRADY Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me. \nGRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through life with a slight overbite. \nJAMES LEER Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing. \nGRADY He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one. \nJames looks miserably at Poe. \nJAMES LEER What are we going to do? \nGRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand. \nGRADY First you're going to give me that little cap gun of yours. \n18\tINT. GALAXIE - MOVING \nGRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield. \nJAMES LEER Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question? \n", "test1_id": 1302, "test2_input": "GRADY Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right. \nJAMES LEER I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single-spaced? \nJames has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on Grady's desk. \nGRADY Afraid so. \nJAMES LEER That's a big book you're writing. \nGRADY I think it's sort of writing itself at this point. \nJAMES LEER Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but-- \nGRADY But . . . ? \nJAMES LEER Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people--some of the kids in workshop--thought maybe you were... \nGRADY Washed up? \nJAMES LEER Blocked. \nGRADY Ah. I don't believe in writer's block. \nJames takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript. \nJAMES LEER No kidding. \nA LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, materialize in the hallway. \nCRABTREE Good morning, boys. James. \nJames waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag. \nGRADY (re: James' \"attire\") If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, I'd put on something a little less comfortable if I were you. \nAs GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE seems to have made him suddenly queasy. \nJAMES LEER Professor Tripp? \nGRADY Hm. \nJAMES LEER How did I get here last night? \nGRADY No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch. \nJAMES LEER And ...and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad? \nGRADY Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia. \nAs James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now parked at the bottom of his driveway. \nGRADY Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide. \n46\tEXT. FRONT PORCH \nA POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the door opens, GRADY appears. \nOFFICER PUPCIK Good morning... (eyeing Grady's robe) Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but I understand you attended an event at Sara and Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one of the last to leave... \n47\tINT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47 \nJames lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the sleeping bag, straining to hear. \nOFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.) ...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of place. Suspicious maybe... \n48\tEXT. FRONT PORCH \nGRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought. \nGRADY Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey. \nOFFICER PUPCIK A jockey? You mean, like-- \nGRADY Horses, right. Vernon something... (thinking... ) Hardpple \nPupcik stops on his pad, looks up. \nOFFICER PUPCIK Hardapple? \nGRADY I could be wrong. What happened anyway? \nOFFICER PUPCIK Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing. \nGRADY That's weird. \nOFFICER PUPCIK We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over. \nGRADY The perpetrator. \nOFFICER PUPCIK No, the dog. \n", "test2_true": "Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under \"Dealing With Assholes.\" \nOFFICER PUPCIK One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you? \nGRADY I might have his number on campus. \nOFFICER PUPCIK That's all right. We'll find him. \nPete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door... \nHANNAH GREEN (O.S.) There you are... \nGRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy- eyed and delectable. \nHANNAH GREEN I thought we were going to talk. Last night. \nGRADY Oh. Well. I... \nHannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up her thighs. \nHANNAH GREEN It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me. \nGRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik drive away in his big police car. \nJAMES LEER What do we do now? \n#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him #####RINGS. \nGRADY Hello? \nSARA'S VOICE Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened. \nGRADY Could you hold on a minute, honey? \nWith a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever- so- gently ...hang up the phone. \nGRADY How 'bout we get the hell out of here? \n49\tEXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) \nJames, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of KEYS. \nGRADY You start her up. \nAs GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides behind the steering wheel. \nJAMES LEER (as the engine roars) How's that? \nGRADY Well done, James. \nAs GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand. \nGRADY (cont'd) Shit! \nJames blinks, pokes his head out the window. \nJAMES LEER You're bleeding. Professor Tripp. \n50\tINT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER) \nGRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a neighborhood MARKET. GRADY has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering his ragged thumb. \nGRADY Where exactly do you live, James? \nJames, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of ORANGE JUICE, stops. \nGRADY Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as to the location of your apartment. \nGRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic hand basket, begins to move down the aisle. \nJAMES LEER I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave. \nGRADY I guess there's probably a story behind that. \nJAMES LEER There is, but it's not that interesting. \nGRADY So where have you been staying? \nJAMES LEER (a long pause) The bus station. \nGRADY stares incredulously at James. \nJAMES LEER It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. \nGRADY (trying to fathom this) But James. I mean. ..How long? \nJAMES LEER A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection. \nGRADY Jesus, James, you should've told someone. \nJAMES LEER Who? \n", "test2_id": 1303, "test3_input": "Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY kicks open his door, steps out. \n73INT/\tEXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER \nGRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he speaks. \nGRADY C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm sure. It's outside Scranton. \nGRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by himself on the far side of the coffee shop. \nGRADY You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd be pretty interested to learn that the good people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this up as I go along-- \nGRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head. \nGRADY (cont'd) Never mind. My mistake. \n74\tEXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74 \nGRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch. \nHe takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it says only: \"On File.\" But if one was to dial the PHONE NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the Greyhound depot who picks up. \n75\tINT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER) \nThe remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars that whip by on the highway beyond the window. \nJAMES LEER Want a bite? \nGRADY No thanks. \nJAMES LEER That's why you're having them. Your spells. \nGRADY Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells. \nJAMES LEER What would you call them then? \nGRADY I don't know. ...'Episodes.' \nJames shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie. \nJAMES LEER It's because you don't eat. \nGRADY I eat. \nJAMES LEER When? \nGRADY When nobody's looking. \nGRADY watches a pair of headlights approach... \nJAMES LEER (mouth full, garbled) I just worry about you, that's all. \n...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks at him. \nGRADY You just worry about yourself, James. Okay? \nJAMES LEER Okay. \nJust then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises. \nJAMES LEER (cont'd) Where you going? \nGRADY Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat. \nGRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words. \n76\tEXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL \nAs GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of the sun visor. \nMAN (eyeing GRADY dubiously) Professor Tripp? \nGRADY Grady. \nMAN Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda. \nGRADY (re: their clothes) Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening. \nFRED LEER Hardly. \nAMANDA LEER We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck would have it, the club was on the way, so... (snapping shut the visor) We were able to put in an appearance. \nFRED LEER Otherwise we would've been here earlier. \nGRADY Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a little dinner. \nFRED LEER Well, certainly we'll reimburse you. \nGRADY That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might be good for James to be with his family this weekend. \nFRED LEER Well, of course, we can understand that. \n", "test3_true": "GRADY Well. Let me go get him. \nGRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back. \nGRADY (cont'd) I \"hope you won't consider this forward of me, Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you ever attend Catholic school? \nAmanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly. \nAMANDA LEER Excuse me? \n77\tINT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77 \nJames is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns. \nJAMES LEER I'm not going with them.. \nGRADY James. Listen. Things-things are a little weird with me right now and I-- well--I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand? \nJAMES LEER I'm not going, with them. \nGRADY James, like it or not, they're your parents. \nJAMES LEER Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead. \nGRADY stares at-James wearily. \nJAMES LEER I swear. My father had his own airplane he used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and my mom were flying up to our house in the Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in the newspaper. \nGRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded. \nJAMES LEER I 'swear. My father was a senior vice president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. Her maiden name was Guggenheim. \nGRADY starts to protest, then pauses. \nGRADY I remember that. Five or six years ago. \nJAMES LEER Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton. \nGRADY (sardonically) Near Carvel? \nJAMES LEER I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak. (nodding towards Amanda) \nShe makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me. \nGRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns. \nGRADY James, come on. That man is obviously your father. You look just like him. \nJames looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and speaks in a voice heavy with implication. \nJAMES LEER There's a reason for that. \nGrady's addled brain grapples with this dark little riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting. \nGRADY Get out of here. \nJAMES LEER That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement. \nGRADY In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up. \nAs GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it. \nJAMES LEER I swear. \n78\tEXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER       78 \nAs Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat. \nFRED LEER Thank you.

You can be sure of that. \nFred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns. \nGRADY Hey! \nGRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns, elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack.

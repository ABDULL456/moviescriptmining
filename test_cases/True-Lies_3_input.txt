86   EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Malik sprints straight into traffic.  A car screeches, not stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.  Harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him.  Malik sees Harry coming after him like a juggernaut. 
He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street, accelerating from a right-turn.  Malik runs at him, clothes- lining him right off the bike.  The terrorist picks up the nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps on.  He pops the clutch and takes off.  Harry pounds after him like a locomotive.  He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path into a large PARK.  Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal. 
87   EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
ON HARRY, running.  Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.  Harry doesn't break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.  The cop turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet). 
HARRY Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect!  Sorry. 
Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him. 
MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.  He looks back, amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.  They scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs. 
TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.  Malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees. Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling. Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it. He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the last bit of throttle out of it.  They are going flat out, through the trees, in a kinetic blur. 
88   EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT 
Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.  The Unit Seven car pulls out as well, up the block. 
GIB Harry, what's your twenty? 
89   EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT 
Harry is legging the police horse hard.  He has his reigns in one hand, his Glock in the other.  It's the wild west. 
HARRY Westbound in the park... suspect is on a motorcycle... he's going to  come out on Franklin.  Hang on-- 
Harry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase. 
HARRY (CONT'D) I want you on 14th in case he turns south.  And I need Seven on the north side to box him in. 
90   INT. /EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT 
Gib is weaving furiously through traffic.  He slides into a turn. 
GIB Copy that. 
HARRY And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired. 
ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?" 
91   EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT 
Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street. Cars skid around him, out of control.  He turns south.  Weaving through traffic.  Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and gallops among the spun-out cars.  He goes right over the hood on one which is blocking his path.  The driver ducks as the horse's hoof cracks the windshield. 
92   EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT 
Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.  Malik goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.  Gib's car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes barrelling down the street toward him.  Gib cranks the wheel the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.  Malik locks up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.  Then the terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT REGENCY HOTEL. 
Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them. The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby. 
HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him. 
93   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Acres of marble and red carpet.  Liveries porters.  Guests dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women. And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with Harry charging along behind him.  Malik guns it across the lounge, knocking over tables.  He gets air at the top of  the steps going up to the RESTAURANT. 
Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop.  He gathers the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the bassist, who is diving for the carpet.  Harry and horse land deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after Malik. 
94   INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Malik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way out.  Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier. Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be flying at once as people dive out of the way. 
95   INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT 
MALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees-- the ELEVATORS.  The door is just closing on one of them.  He guns it and slides through the doors. 
HARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of Malik as the doors close. 
96   INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just been boarded by an older couple.  He has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door.  The animal barely fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be-- 
A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises, right to the top of the building.  Harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet away.  Malik is inside, punching a button.  He glances up and sees Harry.  There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's car ascends rapidly.  Malik's malevolent glare is etched on Harry's retinas. 
The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's panting, snorting horse.  It clomps around the tight elevator. The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall. 
HARRY Can you just press the top floor, please. 
The man nods mutely and complies.  Their elevator takes off, rising after Malik's. 
97   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 
Gib runs in with Faisil and Keough.  They follow the path of destruction, growing more and more amazed.  Gib yells to one of the porters. 
GIB The guy on the horse?! 
The porter points at the elevators. 
98   INT. / EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT

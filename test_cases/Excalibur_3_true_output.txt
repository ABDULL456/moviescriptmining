Gawain's death cry and the din of the ritual carries to Perceval's ears as he wanders through the wasteland. He draws down his visor and spurs his horse forward. 
EXT. HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY 
He gallops toward the giant's head. He checks his sword and lowers his lance. 
The knight charging forward on his war horse is an awesome sight, but the crowd around the giant's mouth is strangely unfrightened. Morgana is excited; she turns to the boy. 
MORGANA Look, Mordred, a true prize for the giant. The lamb rides into our jaws. 
Perceval is galloping toward them when the ground gives way beneath the horse, and he and the animal plunge into a pit. The cheering crowd rushes to the edge of the trap. 
MORGANA (to Mordred) You must kill him, for this knight is dear to your father. You must do it and learn to enjoy your father's pain. 
Her knights drag Perceval, unarmed, into Morgana's presence. 
MORGANA Have you found what you search for? Have you found what Arthur seeks? 
Perceval doesn't answer, defiant and hiding his fear. 
MORGANA You haven't, or you would be smiling now in the face of death. Your quest is an impossible one. 
PERCEVAL That it might be impossible makes it all the more necessary. 
MORGANA Fool! (to the men holding Perceval) Uncover him. I'll show you the mystery of life. It's death... (to Mordred) Do it, Mordred! 
Holding Perceval by his limbs and hair, the men force him down on the bloody grating, drawing back his head, exposing his throat. Morgana kneels by his head, and draws the boy beside her. She holds the tip of the dagger to Perceval's neck and takes Mordred's hand and wraps it around the handle. Perceval is choked with fear, his heart pounding in his throat. 
MORGANA Feel the life through the dagger, child. It belongs to you. 
The boy looks up at his mother. The vein in Perceval's neck pushes against the dagger's point. 
MORDRED I feel it, Mother. I will give his blood to the giant. 
The boy raises the dagger, and hesitates just a bit. Perceval resigns himself bravely. He looks the child calmly in the eye. Mordred brings down the blade without strength, just piercing the skin with the tip. He lets go of the dagger, afraid now of his mistake. 
The dagger clatters to the grating and slips away down the drain, before Morgana can retrieve it. She rages against Mordred. In the confusion, Perceval tears loose, the men holding him slipping on the blood-wet stone. 
Perceval runs through the crowd. Immediately, lance lowered, a knight is upon him. Perceval leaps toward him, catching the lance in his hand, and pulling down the rider with it. He jumps the rider and draws the knight's sword. Whirling the lance and cutting the air with the sword, he keeps back the other knights for a moment, giving him time to see his chance. He leaps onto the riderless horse and charges off through the crowd. He reins in abruptly, the horse rearing. He is wary of the ground before him; there could be a hidden pit. But there is no time to think. Knights and men on foot are rushing him. He spurs forward into a gallop, the horse striding mightily And its hind leg sinks into a pit, the animal losing its gait. But the momentum carries the horse forward, and it recovers from the stumble. 
Perceval gallops away. 
Morgana is enraged. She shakes Mordred by the hair. 
MORGANA You didn't kill him! You didn't kill him! 
But suddenly she begins kissing him tenderly. 
MORGANA My dear, sweet boy... 
He just stands there emotionless, the dead center of her turbulent passions. 
EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY 
Perceval gallops down a trail. The black-armored knights of Morgana chase him. 
Perceval reins into deep cover alongside the trail. The pursuers thunder past and the sound of hooves recedes. Perceval checks his newly found sword, slashes the air to feel the weapon's balance. He re-sheathes it. He pats the horse. 
PERCEVAL We'll become good friends. 
He starts off again, into the patchless forest of dead trees. 
He is suddenly set upon by a wildman who, swinging a small uprooted tree, knocks him off his horse. Perceval crashes to the ground and before he can use his sword the wildman has knocked it out of his hand. 
It is Lancelot, demented, who furiously rains battering blows on Perceval's armor, bellowing with rage. All that Perceval can do is attempt to avoid the blows. Lancelot addresses Perceval as if the young knight were Lancelot himself. 
LANCELOT Where are you going, Lancelot, in your iron tomb? Still trying to save the world? (He hammers blows into Perceval's armor) The best... the bravest... the greatest... fool that ever lived. Now the world rots. Death is king of the earth. And it is you who make it so, Lancelot. 
Before Perceval can speak, Lancelot disappears again into the forest, his eyes blank, as though his encounter with the young knight had never happened. 
A knot of pain, Perceval pulls himself up. He tries to rise into the saddle. He is too hurt to do it. He starts off on foot, slowly, leading the horse. 
EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT

22   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
RITA and the YOUNG MAN are seated on the couch. Still no buzzer. As the YOUNG MAN talks, RITA is staring at a woman's shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a lamp. 
YOUNG MAN Did you know that you have remarkable hair? 
RITA Yeah? You know what?       I feel like going to a movie. 
YOUNG MAN Now? 
RITA Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of ten. We can make a ten o'clock show. 
The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes. 
YOUNG MAN Why don't we make our own movie? 
RITA No.    I don't think so. 
YOUNG MAN Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance. 
RITA I want to go to the movies, that's all. 
YOUNG MAN We can go to the movies later. 
RITA pulls her hands away. 
RITA Let's stop playing games, okay. I'm not a kid. 
YOUNG MAN You have something against pleasure? 
RITA 
I'm just not interested in being tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay? 
YOUNG MAN Shall I freshen up your drink? 
RITA shakes her head. 
YOUNG MAN (growing irritated) What exactly did you think we were going to do up here?

24   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The YOUNG MAN is practically sitting on RITA's lap.   He has RITA backed up against the end of the couch. 
YOUNG MAN Look, if you've got sexual problems let's talk about them. It helps clear the air. 
RITA There's nothing wrong with me. 
YOUNG MAN Then it's me? 
RITA I don't even know you. 
YOUNG MAN Then find out. Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers. 
RITA I don't think so. 
YOUNG MAN I'm sure this could lead to something beautiful. 
The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly. 
YOUNG MAN Passive resistance, huh? 
RITA Let's just write this thing off as a big mistake. What do you say? 
YOUNG MAN What's wrong with me? 
RITA Nothing.   I just want to go home. 
YOUNG MAN I can see I'm not turning you on. 
RITA (smiles) You noticed that, huh? 
YOUNG MAN Come on.   What's wrong with me? 
RITA You really want to know? 
YOUNG MAN Yeah. 
RITA How can I put it? Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out.

P Only his face -- as his eyes and mouth open wide in shock and disbelief and sudden death. 
CLOSE SHOT - JAMES (SLOW MOTION & SILENT) His face peeking out from behind- a pillar, the flashes from Grey's gun reflected in his eyes and on the pillar. 
MED. SHOT - GREY (SLOW MOTION & SILENT) as he continues firing. 
FLASH CUTS - GREEN, BROWN, PASSE` SERS (SLOW MOTION & SILENT ) Astonished; unfeeling; horror-struck. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - CAZ (SLOW MOTION & SILENT) as his dead body hits the ground, bounces, and rolls over, face up, eyes still-open. 
INT. FIRST CAR - BLUE (TRAVELLING) 
The SOUND returns with a rush. Blue rushes out of the Motorman's cab and runs down the length of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING as he goes past Green and Brown without speaking to them. He looks out the rear or for a moment, at the dead body. 
GREY I warned the bastard but he kept on coming anyway. 
BLUE Was he alone? 
GREY I didn't see anybody else. 
(A PAUSE) I guess I got us on the scoreboard, huh? Without a word, Blue moves to Brown at mid-car. 
BLUE Take over back there. I want Mr. Grey up closer to me so I dan keep an eye on him. 
BROWN He' s a little trigger-happy. 
BLUE Maybe it was necessary -- I didn't see it. 
BROWN He loved every minute of it. 
INT. TUNNEL - JAMES 
as he-peers around the pillar he's hiding behind. Smoke from the gun still hangs in the air. He ducks back behind the pillar, unslings his radio and, holding it close to his mouth, whispers into it. 
JAMES Patrolman James calling Operations 
RADIO (GARBER )- This is Garber -- It comes in too loud and James frantically lowers the volume.

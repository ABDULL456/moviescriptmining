KILGORE Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line. 
65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON 
Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the coast. 
66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE 
KILGORE Fucking savages. WILLARD Who? KILGORE The enemy. Who else? 
67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS 
The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange napalm along the trees. 
KILGORE (O.S.) (on radio) Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest you follow with cannon fire. 
68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT 
They circle the battle. 
RADIO (V.O.) This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left. 
KILGORE Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you. 
He turns to door gunner. 
KILGORE (continuing) Right along the doors, boy. 
The gunner FIRES leaning out -- 
KILGORE (continuing) Fine... fine... little higher. Through the roof; yeah, that's good. 
He leans back in. 
KILGORE (continuing) Didn't anybody bring me any bombs, grenades, claymores or anything? 
LIEUTENANT You didn't tell me to, sir. 
KILGORE (grumbling) You shoulda known. 
Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore is thrown down where he hangs on. 
KILGORE (continuing) Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt? 
WILLARD Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's. 
KILGORE The trees, eh... 
He grabs the R.T. 
KILGORE (continuing) Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees. 
RADIO (V.O.) Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left. 
KILGORE Take her in low, Lieutenant. 
69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS 
The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS. 
Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around them -- they scream and fall FIRING back. 
70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD 
Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third. 
KILGORE Hold it, boy. 
He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings back inside. 
KILGORE (continuing) Take her up to 300 feet, Lieutenant. 
They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's harness. 
KILGORE (continuing) Rifle. 
A hand passes him a M-16. 
KILGORE (continuing; hard) My rifle, soldier. 
There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300 Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and opens the bolt. 
71  VIEW ON WILLARD 
Amazed at these proceedings. 
72  VIEW ON KILGORE 
as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets into the sling and slams the bolt shut. 
73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C. 
He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud. The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol. 
74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD 
Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy. Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back into the copter.

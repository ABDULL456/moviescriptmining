CUT TO: 
INT. UNIVERSITY OF BOSTON FRANKLIN THEATER. NIGHT. 
APPLAUSE. Joe sits on stage with three academic types. In the hundred seater auditorium, just a couple dozen or so students. 
PROFESSOR Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, "If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope." Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand. He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero. 
JOE That's not quite true. It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room. 
Laughter. 
INT. CORRIDOR. CPD. LANGLEY. DAY 
Valerie walks with MIKE and ALI, briefing him. 
VALERIE Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory. In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart. They're all say the same thing Mike. Everyone. 
BACK TO: 
THE AUDITORIUM. 
A nervous history major stands. 
STUDENT Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security? 
JOE I haven't seen the intelligence. I'm not qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I've looked him in the eye, so I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster. 
VOICE - SERGEANT AT ARMS Mr Speaker, the President of the United States! INT. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. NIGHT. 
Through a scrum of pumped-up Representatives, an exalted George Walker Bush makes his way to the podium. 
PRESIDENT Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union. This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead. INT. LOGAN AIRPORT. NIGHT. 
STUDENT We'd like you to have this coffee mug. And some Pennants. For your kids. Thank you so much for coming and speaking to us. 
Joe shakes the kid's hand and walks towards Departures. 
INT. LOGAN AIRPORT. NIGHT. 
Joe walks underneath a TV screen playing: 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America... Joe looks up at DEPARTURES: "AA22 DULLES. CANCELLED." Resigned, he looks at his watch. 
INT. PAVITT'S OFFICE. NIGHT. 
VALERIE, MIKE, ALI, BILL all sit in JIM PAVITT's OFFICE. 
PAVITT So you got thirty nuclear scientists interrogated by Iraqis, inside Iraq, who are all saying the same thing. 
BILL Jim, these people took a great risk- 
PAVITT To bring us what? I could have saved us the air-fare- 
BILL The White House is getting STOVEPIPED. (MORE) 
BILL (cont'd) Someone is cherry picking raw data and serving it up to the press as fact. And then they look to us to confirm it. It's bullshit. 
JIM PAVITT (With intent) You know we can bark about this all night. But that's all we're doing. Barking. You, me, all of us.. We're guard dogs. We can bark and bark, but at the end of the day, someone's gotta listen. Because it's not our house. Even if it is on fire. 
CUT TO: 
A TV in the corner of the Starbucks concession plays: 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) Today the gravest danger facing America and the world is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. JOE WILSON Can I get an American please. Just a regular American? 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Joe glances at the TV as he pays. 
JOE WILSON Thank you. 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. CUT TO: 
Joe sits amongst stranded passengers, most asleep. ON TV: the President. Joe sips his coffee. Grimaces. He looks tired. 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. JOE stares, motionless, at the screen. The only one awake. 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Joe doesn't blink. 
PRESIDENT (ON TV) This nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come. We seek peace. We strive for peace. And sometimes peace must be defended. PUBLIC ADDRESS Ladies and Gentlemen Flight 22 to Dulles is boarding immediately at Gate 20. We apologize for the delay due to adverse weather conditions- 
Everybody wakes up. Starts to move. Joe stays seated.

ANDY WARHOL I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. 
BASQUIAT You don't even work on your stuff! 
BRUNO It doesn't matter how much you worked on 
them. It matters how much you can get for them. 
BASQUIAT I can get ten. 
ANDY WARHOL I'll take two. This one and... that one. (to Bruno) Can I borrow some money, Bruno? 
Bruno pulls out a hundred dollar bill. 
BRUNO Here. Do you have change? 
As WAITER arrives with the tray, Jean pockets the bill. 
BASQUIAT You made a good deal. Here, you can have these, too. 
He leaves all the cards and walks toward the door.

FADE TO BLACK 
FADE IN: 
Over the following MONTAGE we HEAR: 
RENE (O.S.) ... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called our bed the cloud. And there we'd float. The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up. We'd bathe together afterwards. Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food... The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out over all New York...

{"train": "\"Alien\", early draft, by Dan O'Bannon \nALIEN \n(project formerly titled STARBEAST) \nStory by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett \nScreenplay by Dan O'Bannon \nSYNOPSIS \nEn route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language, originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet. \nMankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers. \nCertain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries- old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and cannot be removed. \nAn examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not kill it on the ship. \nUltimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship, and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose on the ship. \nA series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's bizarre life cycle. \nFinally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien. \nCAST OF CHARACTERS \nCHAZ STANDARD, Captain.................A leader and a politician.  Believes that any action is better than no action. \nMARTIN ROBY, Executive Officer.......Cautious but intelligent -- a survivor. \nDELL BROUSSARD, Navigator...............Adventurer; brash glory-hound. \nSANDY MELKONIS, Communications..........Tech Intellectual; a romantic. \nCLEAVE HUNTER, Mining Engineer.........High-strung; came along to make his fortune. \nJAY FAUST, Engine Tech.............A worker.  Unimaginative. \nThe crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women. \nFADE IN: \nEXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future. \nWherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic machinery chuckles softly to itself. \nAbruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken. Circuits close, lights blink on. \nCAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal: \nINTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT \nA stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid. \nOccupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers. \nFOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the freezers pop open. \nSlowly, groggily, six nude men sit up. \nROBY Oh... God... am I cold... \nBROUSSARD Is that you, Roby? \nROBY I feel like shit... \nBROUSSARD Yeah, it's you all right. \nNow they are yawning, stretching, and shivering. \nFAUST (groans) Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead. \nBROUSSARD You look dead. \nMELKONIS The vampires rise from their graves. \nThis draws a few woozy chuckles. \nBROUSSARD (shakes his fist in the air triumphantly) We made it! \nHUNTER (not fully awake) Is it over? \nSTANDARD It's over, Hunter. \nHUNTER (yawning) Boy, that's terrific. \nSTANDARD (looking around with a grin) Well, how does it feel to be rich men? \nROBY (punches buttons) Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message? \nCOMPUTER (a mechanical voice) I have interrupted the course of the voyage. \nROBY What?  Why? \nCOMPUTER I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise. \nSTANDARD Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about? \nCOMPUTER I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin. \nSTANDARD A transmission? \nCOMPUTER A voice transmission. \nMELKONIS Out here? \nThe men exchange glances. \nCOMPUTER I have recorded the transmission. \nSTANDARD Play it for us, please. \nOver the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls silent. \nThe men all stare at each other in amazement. \nSTANDARD Computer, what language was that? \nCOMPUTER Unknown. \nROBY Unknown!  What do you mean? \nCOMPUTER It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man. \nThere is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME. \nSTANDARD (silencing them) Just hold it, hold it! (glares around the room) Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission? \nCOMPUTER Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate. \nROBY Oh my God. \nSTANDARD Well, it's finally happened. \nMELKONIS First contact... \nSTANDARD Sandy, can you home in on that beam? \nMELKONIS What's the frequency? \nSTANDARD Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission? \nCOMPUTER 65330 dash 99. \nMelkonis punches buttons. \nMELKONIS I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds. \nSTANDARD Dell -- show me that on a screen. \nBROUSSARD I'll give it to you on number four. \nBroussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen. \nBROUSSARD (CONT'D) That's it.  Let me straighten it out. \nHe twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in the center. \nSTANDARD Can you get it a little closer? \nBROUSSARD That's what I'm going to do. \nHe hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS. \nBROUSSARD (CONT'D) Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers. \nMELKONIS It's tiny! \nSTANDARD Any rotation? \nBROUSSARD Yeah.  Two hours. \nSTANDARD Gravity? \nBROUSSARD Point eight six.  We can walk on it. \nStandard rises. \nBROUSSARD Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission. \nSTANDARD What's the terrain down there? \nBROUSSARD Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain. \nSTANDARD Is it solid? \nBROUSSARD It's... basalt.  Rock. \nSTANDARD Then take her down. \nBROUSSARD Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams. \nThere is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders. \nROBY Locked. \nBROUSSARD Kill drive engines. \nThe engines fall silent. \nROBY Engines off. \nBROUSSARD Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen. \nEXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT \nThe night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly. \nLanding struts unfold like insect legs. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nBROUSSARD And we're... down. \nEXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT \nThe ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nThe whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT. \nBROUSSARD Jesus Christ! \nThe lights come back on again. \nSTANDARD What the hell happened? \nROBY (hits a switch) Engine room, what happened? \nFAUST (over, filtered) Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking. \nROBY Has the hull been breached? \nBROUSSARD Uh... (scans his gauges) No, I don't see anything.  We've still got pressure. \nThere is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then: \nFAUST (over, filtered) Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell. \nSTANDARD (strikes his panel) Damn it!  How long to fix? \nROBY (into microphone) How long to fix? \nFAUST (over, filtered) Hard to say. \nROBY Well, get started. \nFAUST (over, filtered) Right.  Talk to you. \nSTANDARD Let's take a look outside.  Turn the screens back on. \nMelkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black. \nBROUSSARD Can't see a blessed thing. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT \nOnly a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute darkness around it. \nTHE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING LIGHTS. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nSTANDARD Kick on the floods. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT \nSTANDARD Any microorganisms? \nROBY Not a one.  It's dead. \nSTANDARD Anything else? \nROBY Yeah, rock particles.  Dust. \nSTANDARD Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source? \nMELKONIS No problem. \nBROUSSARD I volunteer for the exploration party. \nSTANDARD I heard you.  You want to break out the side arms? \nINTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY \nStandard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves, boots, jackets, and pistols. \nBroussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut, sealing them into the lock. \nThey all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks. \nSTANDARD (adjusting the radio on his mask) I'm sending.  Do you hear me? \nBROUSSARD Receiving. \nMELKONIS Receiving. \nSTANDARD All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me? \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nROBY Read you, Chaz. \nINTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY \nSTANDARD Open the outer door. \nPonderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE WIND OUTSIDE. \nA mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it hits the ground. \nStandard walks out into the storm, followed by the others. \nEXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY \nThe three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet. Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock. \nThe men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at their clothes.  Nothing can be seen. \nSTANDARD Which way, Sandy? \nMelkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder. \nMELKONIS (pointing) That way. \nSTANDARD You lead. \nMelkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the others. \nSTANDARD Okay, Martin.  We're on our way. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nRoby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a screen. \nROBY Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board. \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open. \nEXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY \nThe three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements, they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean. \nMelkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction finder. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Can't see more than three meters in any direction out here.  We're walking blind, on instruments. \nThey wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nMELKONIS My signal's fading. \nHe studies the direction finder. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nStandard appears in the doorway. \nSTANDARD Alas, poor Yorick. \nRoby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (nodding at the screen) Find anything we missed? \nROBY (shrugs) I don't even know what I'm looking for. \nSTANDARD Still worried? \nROBY Oh well... you know me. \nSTANDARD I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me. \nRoby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL. \nROBY What would you say that was supposed to mean? \nSTANDARD Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them... \nROBY But why draw it on the wall? \nRoby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily. \nHe rises and goes to the coffee machine. \nROBY (CONT'D) (picking a hair out of the coffeepot) This ship is full of cat hair. \nSTANDARD Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed -- \nBEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and presses the button. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) This is Chaz. \nBROUSSARD (over, filtered) Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute? \nSTANDARD What's up? \nBROUSSARD (over, filtered) Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see. \nSTANDARD I'm on my way. \nHe and Roby head for the door. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nBroussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive. \nSTANDARD What is it? \nBROUSSARD Take a look. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY \nThe dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nBROUSSARD I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen. \nSTANDARD What is it, I can't -- \nBLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image. \nThe screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon. \nThey all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien ship. \nStandard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille. \nSTANDARD This is Chaz.  All hands topside. Now. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER \nANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the room. \nSTANDARD Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there? \nMELKONIS That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it... \nBROUSSARD Maybe they built it. \nFAUST As what? \nBROUSSARD A marker for buried instrumentation? \nHUNTER Or a mass grave. \nAnother PAUSE as he listens to the earphone. \nROBY (CONT'D) Well come on, come on!  What does it say? \nAnother PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His mouth works. \nAbruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE. \nHUNTER (looking over at Roby) What?  What was that? \nROBY The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning. \nEXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY \nBROUSSARD Maybe we can get in by the top. \nSTANDARD You want to try? \nBROUSSARD Sure. \nBroussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire. \nBROUSSARD (CONT'D) You guys just wait down here till I say it's okay to come up. \nBroussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side of the pyramid. \nOMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust blowing, the wind shrieking. \nEXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY \nThe peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones. \nBROUSSARD There's a hole at the top. \nEXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY \nSTANDARD Can we come up? \nBROUSSARD (over, filtered) No, it's too small, only room enough for one person. \nSTANDARD Can you see anything in the hole? \nEXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY \nBroussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness. \nFreeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on the \"flashlight\" function, and shines it down into the hole. \nBROUSSARD I can see... partway down.  It just goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth walls.  I can't see the bottom -- light won't reach. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nFaust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face. \nFAUST Yes?  What is it? \nROBY Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability. \nFAUST (quickly) Why, what's wrong? \nROBY The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming. \nFAUST What do you mean? \nROBY It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it: (reads from a strip of paper) \"... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... \" (looks up at the others) And that's all it could translate. \nEXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY \nHanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from his belt. \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here. \nBROUSSARD No, I want to go in. \nEXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY \nStandard and Melkonis exchange a glance. \nSTANDARD Okay, Dell, but just for a preliminary look-around.  Don't unhook yourself from your cable.  And be out in less than ten minutes. \nEXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY \nBROUSSARD Right. \nBroussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end of it to his chest unit. \nHe climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole. \nBROUSSARD (CONT'D) Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down. \nMELKONIS Sun will be down in a minute. \nINTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON \nFace bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED. \nHe walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it. \nHe lifts his mask radio to his lips. \nBROUSSARD I don't know if you can hear me, but the place is full of large bottles or jars, just like the one we found on the other ship -- except these are all sealed.  Also they're soft to the touch. \nHe peers more closely at the leathery object. \nBROUSSARD (CONT'D) Another funny thing -- I just put my hand on it, and now there are these raised areas appearing where my fingertips were. \nEXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY \nTHE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom. Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights. \nSTANDARD Let's go. \nHe attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up. \nINTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT \nBroussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters. \nHe pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he turns back to the \"urn\" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN THE TOP OF IT. \nHe shines his light on the floor at the base of the \"urn.\"  There lies the \"lid\" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular. \nThen he turns the light to the now-open \"urn.\" \nHe bends over the mouth of the \"urn\" shining the light in, AND WITH SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD. \nWith a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the thing with his hands. \nEXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT \nThe dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top, lights bobbing in the darkness. \nSTANDARD (puffing with exertion) Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to. \nMELKONIS It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something. \nSTANDARD But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact. \nMELKONIS Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes. \nStandard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole. \nSTANDARD (making up his mind) No, I told him to be out in ten minutes.  It's been much longer. Let's get him out of there. \nStandard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which Broussard's line dangles. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) The line's slack.  Christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself? \nHe switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the motor slows down, laboring under the added weight. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) There, it caught! \nMELKONIS Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something? \nSTANDARD No, it's coming. \nMELKONIS Can you see anything? \nStandard shines his light down into the hole. \nSTANDARD No, I can't see far enough.  The line's moving, though. \nFor a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid, saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls. Then Standard shines his light back down in. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) I can see him!  Here he comes! \nThe winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Get ready to grab him! \nBroussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Look out!  There's something on his face! \nMelkonis attempts to come to his aid. \nMELKONIS What is it? \nSTANDARD Don't touch him, watch it! \nHUNTER (pointing) It's eating a hole in the floor! \nAbruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out. \nStandard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They begin to smoke. \nFrantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves. Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY \nSTANDARD That stuff's eating right through the metal!  It's going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull! \nBy this time Standard has started to run for the stairs. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP \nFollowed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to the level below. \nSTANDARD There!  Look! \nA droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and drips to the floor. \nIt bubbles on the floor. \nMELKONIS Jesus, what can we put under it? \nStandard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below. \nINTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW \nStandard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at the ceiling. \nSTANDARD (pointing) There.  Should be coming through about there. \nHUNTER Careful, don't get under it! \nINTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE \nRoby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid sizzles. \nMELKONIS Christ, that stinks. \nRoby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the floor. \nROBY Seems to have stopped penetrating. \nHunter comes charging up the steps. \nHUNTER What's happening up here? \nROBY I think it's fizzled out. \nHunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by the end. \nMELKONIS I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid. \nHUNTER But this thing uses it for blood. \nMELKONIS Hell of a defense mechanism.  You don't dare kill it. \nStandard comes up the stairs. \nSTANDARD It's stopped? \nMELKONIS Yes, thank heaven. \nSTANDARD We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken weeks to patch it. \nMELKONIS Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans. \nROBY My God, what about Broussard? \nThey turn and run up the stairs. \nINTERIOR - INFIRMARY \nThey all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen). Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face. \nROBY Did it get on him? \nStandard approaches and peers at Broussard's head. \nSTANDARD No, thank God... just missed him. \nMELKONIS Is it still dripping? \nSTANDARD (examining it) It appears to have healed itself. \nHUNTER It makes me sick to see him like that. \nHUNTER Now we're in for it. \nSTANDARD The door was closed.  It must still be in here. \nThey immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the door.  Standard grabs his arm. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping. \nHUNTER (very nervous) Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us -- \nSTANDARD Maybe we can catch it. \nStandard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) As long as we're careful not to damage it... \nTray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly around the room.  There are very few places to hide. \nHe bends down and peers under the bunk. \nAs he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD. \nHe rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO THE FLOOR. \nSTANDARD (leaping back) Shit! \nBut the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey. \nWithout taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not respond. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) I think it's dead. \nWith great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid. \nINTERIOR - LABORATORY \nStandard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up. \nWearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument. \nSTANDARD Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him. \nROBY Is that its mouth? \nMELKONIS More likely that organ -- the tube- like thing -- fits up in there. \nWith a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ. \nROBY Ugh. \nSuddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS. \nSTANDARD Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with! \nIt begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE. \nRoby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes the thing in the tongs. \nIt is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Christ!  Let's get it out of here! \nCarrying the thing, he heads for the door. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP \nThe men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK \nThey come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom: \nROBY (shouts into intercom) For Chrissake, open the main lock! \nINTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY \nRoby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed by the inevitable dust. \nStandard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all. \nEXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY \nThe parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust, smouldering and fuming. \nINTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY \nThe outer door rolls shut. \nROBY (slumping against the wall) My God, it's lethal even when it's dead! \nThe pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Retract landing struts. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY \nThe ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force. The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nSTANDARD Take us up. \nROBY (into intercom) Up one kilometer, Jay. \nEXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY \nThe SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nSTANDARD Switch on lifter quads. \nA POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES. \nEXTERIOR - \"SNARK\" - DAY \nThe hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking atmosphere. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nSTANDARD Engage artificial gravity. \nRoby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES. \nROBY Engaged. \nSTANDARD Let's take her into an escape orbit. \nThe men get busy with switches. \nROBY I'm altering our vector now; should give us an easy escape velocity -- \nA HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP. \nROBY & MELKONIS (in concert) What was that? \nIn answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS. \nFAUST (over, filtered) This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again! \nSTANDARD Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all! \nThe pitch of the engines changes, deepens. \nEXTERIOR - SKY - DAY \nThe SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds. Visibility is zero. \nINTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM \nFaust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to suck up some of the dust. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY \nOn the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim, set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically they mutter technical instructions to each other. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY \nAbruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE \nThey all CHEER. \nROBY (pounds his panel) We made it!  Damn, we made it! \nSTANDARD You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive. \nROBY With great pleasure. \nRoby begins to punch buttons. \nMELKONIS I feel like an escapee from Hell. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER \nThe ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around. \nROBY Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs. \nSTANDARD Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean. \nFAUST I kind of like it. \nROBY You like this shit? \nFAUST It grows on you. \nROBY You know what they make this stuff out of? \nFAUST (annoyed) Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  You're eating it. \nROBY I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all. \nHUNTER Do we have to talk about this kind of crap at the dinner table? \nSuddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS. \nSTANDARD What's wrong? \nBROUSSARD (his voice straining) I don't know... I'm getting these CRAMPS! \nThe others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips. He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles whitening. \nSTANDARD Breathe deeply. \nBROUSSARD (screaming) OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD! \nROBY What Dell -- what? \nBroussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot. \nBROUSSARD (incoherent shriek) OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!! \nA RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC. \nTHEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT. \nEverybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and bolts. \nThe disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground. \nWhen they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped. Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest, spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime. \nHUNTER Oh, no.  Oh, no. \nFAUST What was that?  What the Christ was that? \nMELKONIS It was growing in him the whole time and he didn't even know it! \nSlowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse. \nROBY That thing used him for an incubator! \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE \nA hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped body tumbles silently out. \nAN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into eternity. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nThe entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge. \nMELKONIS We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose. \nHUNTER We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers. \nROBY But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space. \nFAUST Shit... \nSTANDARD We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. \nMELKONIS (sighs) Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting. \nSTANDARD We've got about a week left, right? \nHUNTER And then we run out of food and oxygen. \nFAUST The water will still recycle. \nROBY We won't need it then. \nSTANDARD All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time. \nROBY But if we haven't caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway. \nStandard takes the device and studies it. \nSTANDARD These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear? \nROBY Even simple. \nStandard shoots him a vicious look, then continues: \nSTANDARD For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe. \nFaust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room. \nFAUST It's clear. \nSTANDARD All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team. \nThey start doling out the equipment. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) We'll all carry communicators.  We want to keep in constant touch. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP \nMelkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it, carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to side. \nFAUST Nothing yet... nothing... we can move pretty fast as long as there's nothing on the tracker. \nINTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS \nStandard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nRoby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when: \nFAUST Hold it. \nFaust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes. \nFAUST (CONT'D) I've got something. \nImmediately, they grow very tense and start looking around. \nROBY Where's it coming from? \nFAUST (peers closely at tracker and frowns) Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial. \nMELKONIS Is it malfunctioning? \nFaust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes. \nFAUST No, just confused.  It's coming from below us. \nThey all look down at their feet. \nINTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL \nRoby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship. \nThe corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining. \nThey stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading the net across the corridor. \nROBY Okay. \nFAUST (looking at tracker and nodding down the passageway) That way. \nThey begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring.  It is extremely dark. \nROBY What happened to the lights? \nFAUST Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em. \nThey switch on the helmet lights. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN: \nFAUST (CONT'D) Hold it. \nThey all stop quickly, almost stumbling. \nFAUST (CONT'D) (whispering) It's within 4 meters. \nRoby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal. \nHe moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker. \nThe tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall. \nBehind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside. \nROBY Now what? \nSTANDARD What do you think?  Now we go in. \nStandard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows out. \nINTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM \nThe room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in their gasmasks. \nThe food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered all over the floor. \nFAUST Looks like he helped himself. \nCarefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised. \nThen Hunter points. \nHUNTER God damn it. \nThey all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN. \nHUNTER (CONT'D) It escaped. \nThey move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it. \nROBY Where does that go? \nFAUST All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure. \nSTANDARD Then let's go and do it. \nThey head for the door. \nHUNTER Have we got any food at all left in the ship? \nThey slam the door shut and seal it. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nThe screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of ventilator shafts. \nFAUST That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end -- \nHUNTER -- And the cooling unit on the other. \nSTANDARD So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out. \nFAUST Poison gas... \nHUNTER We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship! \nSTANDARD The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out. \nROBY Are you crazy? \nSTANDARD The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him. \nFAUST How about a flamethrower?  That wouldn't poison the air. \nMELKONIS So one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along -- \nSTANDARD While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net. \nHUNTER Sounds like a rough one. \nSTANDARD Got a better idea? \nHunter shrugs. \nROBY So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft? \nSTANDARD Let's be democratic. \nHe tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball. \nHe rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Martin, take one. \nRoby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank. \nMelkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank. \nFaust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They are both blank. \nThey all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Open it up, Cleave. \nHunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the flamethrower. \nHUNTER (whispers) Hey, you guys. \nINTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM \nSTANDARD (into communicator) Yes! \nINTERIOR - AIR SHAFT \nHUNTER (whispering) I don't think this shaft goes on too much farther... anyway it's getting pretty hot in here... \nINTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM \nSTANDARD (into communicator) Okay, our screens show you as being near to the opening.  We'll open it up, then we'll cue you and you can start blasting.  That'll drive it right out.  You don't have to go any farther. \nINTERIOR - AIR SHAFT \nHUNTER Good. \nHe readies the flamethrower. \nINTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM \nSTANDARD Okay, get ready. \nHe and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric prod. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Open the vent, Sandy. \nMelkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops down, opening up the shaft. \nA SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES. \nMelkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN, THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK. \nCLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT. \nStandard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter climbs out of the shaft. \nHUNTER What happened?  Where is it? \nThey break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into darkness. \nSTANDARD (awed) How did it get so big? \nROBY By eating our food supplies. \nHUNTER Where's Melkonis? \nINTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM \nFaust is still waiting. \nFAUST (into his communicator) Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on? \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's huge now. \nFAUST Right. \nFaust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks the door behind him. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nStandard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge. \nHUNTER You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him? \nROBY It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nStandard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows shortly.  They all look blank, stunned. \nFAUST What happened?  Where's Sandy? \nROBY Dead. \nFAUST Dead! \nROBY It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared. \nFAUST It's still in the ship? \nSTANDARD We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. (throws a switch; circuitry lights up) \nHUNTER At least it can't get up here now. \nROBY Two down, four to go. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK \nFAUST (whispering) It's in the main air lock.  Blow the lock. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nStandard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH. \nINTERIOR - AIR LOCK \nWith a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK \nThe creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK- HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR. \nFAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST, crushing him to a thickness of about three inches. \nOn the wall, a green light goes on: \n\"INNER DOOR CLOSED\" \nINTERIOR - AIR LOCK \nDespite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN. IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE \nIn dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nINSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is sucked out toward the lock. \nA SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES: \n\"CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION\" \nAfter a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control room. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nLoose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE \nA huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nWhipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance, HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR. \nIgnoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK \nRoby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a DEAFENING WHISTLE. \nInstantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT. \nDone in, he collapses to the floor. \nThen he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD -- THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nClutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed. \nThey try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks. \nStandard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others follow him. \nINTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM \nThe door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks. \nStandard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully. \nFinally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up. \nROBY How much oxygen did we lose? \nStandard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges. \nSTANDARD We've got six hours left. \nHUNTER (groans) Oh my God. \nSTANDARD Does anybody know what happened? \nROBY Hello?  Standard?  Hunter? \nHe waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his expression that he expects none. \nHe drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has managed to summon a certain amount of resolve. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP \nRoby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He picks it up, substituting it for the pistol. \nThen he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps into the maintenance level. \nINTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL \nRoby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate. \nGetting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate, revealing a black opening with a ladder going down. \nSubstituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder. \nINTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM \nShining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal ladder to the floor. \nTHE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH, PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES. \nSomething moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it. \nHANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating. \nFlamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF STANDARD IS INSIDE IT. \nUnexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps violently. \nSTANDARD (a feeble whisper) Kill me... \nROBY (sickened) What did it do to you? \nSTANDARD (moves his head slightly) Look... \nRoby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE THE SPORES IN THE TOMB. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (whispering) That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... \nROBY (looking around for a tool) I'll get you out of there. \nSTANDARD No... don't... \nROBY But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc! \nSTANDARD No good... it's eaten too much of me... \nROBY (in horror) What can I do? \nSTANDARD Kill me... \nRoby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and scrambles back up the ladder. \nINTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL \nRoby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up. At length, he regains control of himself. \nEXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED \nThe SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters rolling past in the infinite distance. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nRoby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a little oxygen tank on it. \nROBY Kitty go bye-bye. \nHe seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in front.  It YOWLS. \nHe picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge. \nINTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY \nCarrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal cannisters. \nROBY (reading from labels) What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of it.  This'll buy us an island on some nice planet. \nPutting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries back up the steps. \nINTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM \nCatbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine room, containing the massive stardrive engines. \nHe puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one by one. \nHe comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the seat than he hits the \"LAUNCH\" button. \nEXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE \nThe retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE \"SNARK.\" \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nRoby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship. \nEXTERIOR - SPACE \nThe tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly circumstances. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nRoby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches his head down over it. \nEXTERIOR - SPACE \nThe SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light. \nTHEN IT BLOWS UP. \nAN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nThe shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling everything inside.  Then all is quiet. \nRoby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed in orange light. \nEXTERIOR - SPACE \nWhat he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nRoby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of his ship and friends. \nBEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG. \nThe cat SCREECHES. \nRoby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm. \nIt begins to eat the arm, watching Roby. \nHis first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit, with the door standing open. \nHe begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes. \nIt throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut. \nINTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER \nThere is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity. \nThen the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nThe creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER. \nIt picks up the catbox in its tentacles. \nINTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER \nTrying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE GLASS. \nBut the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the glass, startling the hell out of Roby. \nGetting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the catbox. \nRoby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull it on. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nThe creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS. \nINTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER \nRoby is halfway into the pressure suit. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nThe creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it into a crevice in the wall. \nWith one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics. \n", "test1_input": "They all peer up the hole into darkness. \nSTANDARD Climbing gear. \nStandard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it. He aims it up into the hole and fires. \nThe graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles. \nBROUSSARD I'll go first. \nSTANDARD No, you'll follow me. \nStandard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the hole, using his feet for leverage where he can. \nBroussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP \nThis chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the hole. \nStandard stands with his flashlight/camera (\"datastick\") tracing a beam through the hanging dust. \nBroussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole. \nTHEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes. \nBroussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it. \nIt is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings. Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is empty. \nSuddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON, SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR. \nThey approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM. \nMELKONIS Holy Christ... \nStandard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel. \nSTANDARD Look at this... \nThey approach. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Something has been scratched here... into the veneer.  See? \nTraced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a sharp instrument, is a small triangle: \nHearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES. \nMelkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol. \nMELKONIS LOOK OUT, IT MOVED! \nStandard knocks his hand down. \nSTANDARD Keep away from that gun! \nStandard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he begins to move toward the far side of the room. \nThey approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it. There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Just machinery. \nBROUSSARD But functioning. \nMelkonis looks down at his direction finder. \nMELKONIS That's where the transmission is coming from. \nHe throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones. \nBROUSSARD A recording.  A damned automatic recording. \nEXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET \nSINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly combatting the darkness and the storm. \nINTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM \nThe entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken by their \"datasticks\" (flashlight/cameras). \nStandard is commenting on the changing slides. \nSTANDARD ... This is the control room... \nTwo or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) ... Some details of the control room... \nThe SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters. \n", "test1_true": "The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) ... This is a closeup of the triangle we found scrawled on the console in front of the skeleton... \nStandard changes the slide.  The screen goes white. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) ... And that's it. \nHe turns off the projector and brings the lights up. \nHUNTER Phenomenal.  Staggering. \nBROUSSARD We've got to go back and take a lot more pictures, holograph everything. \nMELKONIS And bring back as much physical evidence as possible, too.  The rest of the skeleton.  Some of the machinery.  Written records, if there are any. \nRoby is slumped in his chair.  He has said nothing. \nSTANDARD Martin? \nROBY I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history. \nSTANDARD But? \nROBY What killed it? \nBROUSSARD Hell, that thing's been dead for years.  Maybe hundreds of years.  The whole planet's dead. \nFAUST The way I figure it, they landed here for repairs or something, then they couldn't take off again.  Maybe the dust ruined their engines.  They set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody came.  So they died. \nROBY He died. \nFAUST What? \nROBY Not they... he... \nThey all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod.  CAMERA MOVES OVER TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SKULL SITTING ON A TABLE. \nROBY (CONT'D) ... There was only one skeleton. \nThere is a moment of silence. \nSTANDARD Jay... how's it coming on the repairs? \nFAUST Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out... \nSTANDARD And when will you be ready to do that? \nFAUST Oh -- I'm not near ready yet. \nSTANDARD Then why the hell are you sitting around here? \nFAUST Right. \nThe men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in thought, staring at the skull.  Melkonis lingers in the room with him. \nMELKONIS And there sits man's first contact with intelligent life in the universe. \nEXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT \nANGLE ON THE SHIP, its spotlights cutting into the gloom. \nINTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM \nA room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of releasing unimaginable energies. \nFaust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the engines, with spotlights on it.  He is wearing goggles and thin gloves. \nFAUST You ready up there? \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT \nBroussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with Faust while they watch their instruments. \nBROUSSARD Sure, we're ready. \nINTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM \nFAUST Okay.  I'm going to start the extraction procedure now. \nHe pauses to wipe his brow. \nINTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM \nRoby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the photographic slides on the screen.  He is clicking slowly through them. He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it. \nThe alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him.  He picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it. \n", "test1_id": 2667, "test2_input": "STANDARD (CONT'D) (over, filtered) You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door. \nROBY Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected. \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) We can't leave him out here, open the door. \nROBY (urgently) Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left. \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Martin, this is an order!  Open the door! \nHating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT \nA RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK. \nHUNTER Outer door's open. \nAfter a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off. \nThe inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through, carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust follows them out of the lock. \nSTANDARD (pulling off his mask) You men stay clear, there's a parasite on him. \nHunter and Faust RECOIL. \nHUNTER Oh -- God -- oh -- \nFAUST Is it alive? \nSTANDARD I don't know but don't touch it. Give us a hand here, let's get him up to the Autodoc. \nHunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden. \nINTERIOR - INFIRMARY \nOne of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the medical room, carrying Broussard. \nRevealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed, which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall. \nSTANDARD Help me, come on, let's get him up here. \nThey slide the man onto the bunk. \nHUNTER That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him? \nSTANDARD It wouldn't come. \nStandard yanks off his gloves. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Medical gloves. \nThey pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull them on. \nGingerly, they approach Broussard. \nStandard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) It's really on there tight. \nFAUST Here, let me try. \nFaust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his weight. \nSTANDARD (grabbing Faust's hands) Stop it, you're tearing his face. \nA trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek. \nMELKONIS It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too. \nSTANDARD Let's let the machine work on him. \nEfficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard is sucked into the slot in the wall. \nHe is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light. \nA bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter. \nROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY. \nStandard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE FACE. \nThe others are shocked. \nHUNTER Hey now, what is this? \nSTANDARD Ask him. \nROBY (slowly puts his hand to his cheek) I understand why you did that. \n", "test2_true": "MELKONIS He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there. \nHUNTER Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe you deserve to get slapped. \nFAUST (embarrassed) Excuse me, I've got work to do. \nFaust exits. \nHUNTER I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting. \nROBY (to Standard) I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled. \nAfter a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery. \nROBY (CONT'D) (slowly) Would somebody fill me in? \nSTANDARD He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him. \nHUNTER Where did it come from? \nMELKONIS He's the only one that knows that. \nHUNTER How does he breathe? \nThey study the monitors. \nMELKONIS Blood's thoroughly oxygenated. \nHUNTER Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked. \nSTANDARD Let's look inside his head. \nStandard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER TORSO. \nThe parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach. \nROBY Look at that. \nHUNTER What is it -- I can't tell anything -- \nROBY It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat. \nHUNTER (turning sick) Oh... God... \nHunter bends over and RETCHES. \nROBY I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him. \nHUNTER It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive. \nMELKONIS We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here. \nHUNTER Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him. \nMELKONIS We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive. \nHUNTER How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face. \nSTANDARD You're right... we can't stand here and do nothing. \nStandard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head. Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch and Broussard slides back out of the booth. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (muffled in his mask) Somebody give me a scalpel. \nMelkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to Standard. \nClumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum. \nStandard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously. Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side. \nStandard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of Broussard's head. \nEffortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue. Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (muffled) I've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound... \nThe noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (muffled) Hold it, this stuff's smoking! \nThe others REACT nervously. \nBy now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises. \nThe men start to COUGH. \nMELKONIS God, that smoke's poisonous! \n", "test2_id": 2668, "test3_input": "HUNTER Which explosive should we use? \nSTANDARD I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're portable, and they can be radio detonated. \nHunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like broomhandles, with tiny printing on them. \nMeanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches one of them. \nROBY You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it. \nSTANDARD Here, carry these. \nHunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles. \nROBY (grabbing at him) Hey watch it! \nSTANDARD (grinning) It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it. \nThey begin to carry the explosives up the steps. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR \nThe three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS. \nHUNTER Hold it! \nThey all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and points the tracker around. \nHUNTER (CONT'D) (nodding up some steps) Up there. \nThey all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks up the flamethrower. \nROBY So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now? \nSTANDARD Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space. \nStandard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps. \nINTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL \nStandard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps. Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes. \nThen he continues up. \nEXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE \nThe view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again. \nStandard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically. \nSTANDARD (shouts) You can come up!  It's safe! \nThe others come up the steps. \nROBY (spying the corpse) Oh -- Jesus -- \nBroussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in. \nSTANDARD The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back. \nHUNTER (horrified) Should we go outside and bring him in? \nSTANDARD No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing. \nGlancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes. \nINTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP \nThe floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat. \nThe three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat. \nINTERIOR - LIFEBOAT \nThe passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more. \nSTANDARD (pointing) Along the base of the walls there. \nThey begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly. \nHUNTER This should do it. \nROBY I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it. \nSTANDARD It will be. \nHUNTER (surveys the craft uneasily) What we really need is some red meat in here for bait. \nROBY Well, if we had some, I'd eat it. I'm starting to get hungry. \n", "test3_true": "INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP \nSTANDARD Well... now we have to herd that thing up here. \nHUNTER (nervously) Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... (searches for a word) \nROBY Isn't \"bait\" the word you used? \nHUNTER Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat! \nSTANDARD Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured. \nROBY Who gets the privilege? \nINSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up. \nANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see it.  It has a big X on it. \nANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device like a transistor radio. \nHUNTER Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all. \nROBY Is it armed? \nHUNTER If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off. \nROBY Thanks for the thought. (puts detonator in his breast pocket) \nSTANDARD All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator. \nROBY And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way... \nSTANDARD And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and -- \nROBY Kablooey. \nHunter's face twitches nervously at this. \nSTANDARD Come on; we haven't much time, air is a factor. \nThey leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower, Hunter the tracker. \nRoby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly. \nHe presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to \"READY.\" \nThen STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator: \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) We've got something on the tracker... got to be it, it's too big for the cat. \nThis is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR. \nHUNTER (over, filtered) It's coming from down there. \nRoby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings, breathing, etc. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP \nStandard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at the tracker. \nHUNTER It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything. \nSTANDARD Let me go first; you stay behind me. \nCarefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP. \nHUNTER SCREAMS. \nStandard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him. \nStandard doesn't know what to do. \nHUNTER The flamethrower! \nSTANDARD I can't, the acid will pour out! \nAt that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY. \nStandard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME. \nStandard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of flame, held out at arm's length by the monster. \nINTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP \nRoby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the shrieks and crashing noises. \nThen the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static. \n", "test3_id": 2669}

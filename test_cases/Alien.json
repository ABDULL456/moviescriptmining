{"test1_input": "STANDARD (CONT'D) (over, filtered) You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door. \nROBY Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected. \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) We can't leave him out here, open the door. \nROBY (urgently) Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left. \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Martin, this is an order!  Open the door! \nHating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT \nA RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK. \nHUNTER Outer door's open. \nAfter a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off. \nThe inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through, carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust follows them out of the lock. \nSTANDARD (pulling off his mask) You men stay clear, there's a parasite on him. \nHunter and Faust RECOIL. \nHUNTER Oh -- God -- oh -- \nFAUST Is it alive? \nSTANDARD I don't know but don't touch it. Give us a hand here, let's get him up to the Autodoc. \nHunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden. \nINTERIOR - INFIRMARY \nOne of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the medical room, carrying Broussard. \nRevealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed, which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall. \nSTANDARD Help me, come on, let's get him up here. \nThey slide the man onto the bunk. \nHUNTER That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him? \nSTANDARD It wouldn't come. \nStandard yanks off his gloves. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Medical gloves. \nThey pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull them on. \nGingerly, they approach Broussard. \nStandard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) It's really on there tight. \nFAUST Here, let me try. \nFaust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his weight. \nSTANDARD (grabbing Faust's hands) Stop it, you're tearing his face. \nA trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek. \nMELKONIS It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too. \nSTANDARD Let's let the machine work on him. \nEfficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard is sucked into the slot in the wall. \nHe is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light. \nA bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter. \nROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY. \nStandard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE FACE. \nThe others are shocked. \nHUNTER Hey now, what is this? \nSTANDARD Ask him. \nROBY (slowly puts his hand to his cheek) I understand why you did that. \n", "test1_true": "MELKONIS He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there. \nHUNTER Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe you deserve to get slapped. \nFAUST (embarrassed) Excuse me, I've got work to do. \nFaust exits. \nHUNTER I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting. \nROBY (to Standard) I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled. \nAfter a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery. \nROBY (CONT'D) (slowly) Would somebody fill me in? \nSTANDARD He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him. \nHUNTER Where did it come from? \nMELKONIS He's the only one that knows that. \nHUNTER How does he breathe? \nThey study the monitors. \nMELKONIS Blood's thoroughly oxygenated. \nHUNTER Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked. \nSTANDARD Let's look inside his head. \nStandard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER TORSO. \nThe parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach. \nROBY Look at that. \nHUNTER What is it -- I can't tell anything -- \nROBY It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat. \nHUNTER (turning sick) Oh... God... \nHunter bends over and RETCHES. \nROBY I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him. \nHUNTER It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive. \nMELKONIS We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here. \nHUNTER Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him. \nMELKONIS We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive. \nHUNTER How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face. \nSTANDARD You're right... we can't stand here and do nothing. \nStandard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head. Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch and Broussard slides back out of the booth. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (muffled in his mask) Somebody give me a scalpel. \nMelkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to Standard. \nClumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum. \nStandard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously. Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side. \nStandard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of Broussard's head. \nEffortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue. Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (muffled) I've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound... \nThe noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) (muffled) Hold it, this stuff's smoking! \nThe others REACT nervously. \nBy now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises. \nThe men start to COUGH. \nMELKONIS God, that smoke's poisonous! \n", "test1_id": 2667, "test2_input": "Standard takes the device and studies it. \nSTANDARD These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear? \nROBY Even simple. \nStandard shoots him a vicious look, then continues: \nSTANDARD For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe. \nFaust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room. \nFAUST It's clear. \nSTANDARD All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team. \nThey start doling out the equipment. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) We'll all carry communicators.  We want to keep in constant touch. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP \nMelkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it, carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to side. \nFAUST Nothing yet... nothing... we can move pretty fast as long as there's nothing on the tracker. \nINTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS \nStandard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nRoby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when: \nFAUST Hold it. \nFaust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes. \nFAUST (CONT'D) I've got something. \nImmediately, they grow very tense and start looking around. \nROBY Where's it coming from? \nFAUST (peers closely at tracker and frowns) Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial. \nMELKONIS Is it malfunctioning? \nFaust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes. \nFAUST No, just confused.  It's coming from below us. \nThey all look down at their feet. \nINTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL \nRoby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship. \nThe corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining. \nThey stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading the net across the corridor. \nROBY Okay. \nFAUST (looking at tracker and nodding down the passageway) That way. \nThey begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring.  It is extremely dark. \nROBY What happened to the lights? \nFAUST Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em. \nThey switch on the helmet lights. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN: \nFAUST (CONT'D) Hold it. \nThey all stop quickly, almost stumbling. \nFAUST (CONT'D) (whispering) It's within 4 meters. \nRoby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal. \nHe moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker. \nThe tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall. \nBehind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside. \n", "test2_true": "Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but: \nROBY (very annoyed) Oh, hold it! \nThey open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and spitting, it scampers away. \nMELKONIS We're making fools of ourselves! \nRoby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS. \nROBY (into communicator) Yes! \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast! \nROBY Where are you? \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Food-storage room! \nROBY We're coming! \nThey dash for the stairs. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP \nRoby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive at: \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM \nStandard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics. \nHUNTER We saw it inside and slammed the door on it!  It's in there now! \nOn the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard. \nROBY What's it doing, having a seizure? \nSTANDARD It started crashing around right after we locked it in. \nROBY Now what? \nSTANDARD I guess we open the door and net it. \nHUNTER I hate to open that door. \nAgain the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE. \nSTANDARD It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles. \nFAUST Well we better do something. \nHUNTER Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth. \nSTANDARD (snaps) Don't be an idiot. \nFAUST I know what we can do.  We can pump poison gas into the room and kill it.  Through those ventilator slots there. \nHe indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door. \nROBY Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them! \nSTANDARD Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all. \nROBY You win. \nFAUST Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the stuff. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel- shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door. This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large metal tank with pressure gauges. \nSTANDARD Get those masks on. \nThey pull on gas masks. \nROBY This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing. \nSTANDARD Go ahead, Jay. \nFaust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas through the hose and into the room. \nImmediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING. \nThen the sounds stop altogether. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Shut it off. \nFaust shuts off the pump. \n", "test2_id": 2668, "test3_input": "Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the flamethrower. \nHUNTER (whispers) Hey, you guys. \nINTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM \nSTANDARD (into communicator) Yes! \nINTERIOR - AIR SHAFT \nHUNTER (whispering) I don't think this shaft goes on too much farther... anyway it's getting pretty hot in here... \nINTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM \nSTANDARD (into communicator) Okay, our screens show you as being near to the opening.  We'll open it up, then we'll cue you and you can start blasting.  That'll drive it right out.  You don't have to go any farther. \nINTERIOR - AIR SHAFT \nHUNTER Good. \nHe readies the flamethrower. \nINTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM \nSTANDARD Okay, get ready. \nHe and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric prod. \nSTANDARD (CONT'D) Open the vent, Sandy. \nMelkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops down, opening up the shaft. \nA SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES. \nMelkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN, THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK. \nCLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT. \nStandard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter climbs out of the shaft. \nHUNTER What happened?  Where is it? \nThey break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into darkness. \nSTANDARD (awed) How did it get so big? \nROBY By eating our food supplies. \nHUNTER Where's Melkonis? \nINTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM \nFaust is still waiting. \nFAUST (into his communicator) Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on? \nSTANDARD (over, filtered) Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's huge now. \nFAUST Right. \nFaust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks the door behind him. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDORS \nStandard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge. \nHUNTER You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him? \nROBY It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nStandard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows shortly.  They all look blank, stunned. \nFAUST What happened?  Where's Sandy? \nROBY Dead. \nFAUST Dead! \nROBY It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared. \nFAUST It's still in the ship? \nSTANDARD We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. (throws a switch; circuitry lights up) \nHUNTER At least it can't get up here now. \nROBY Two down, four to go. \n", "test3_true": "ROBY Nothing. \nHUNTER Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower. \nSTANDARD That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock. \nHUNTER Thing is, I'm about out of fuel. \nFAUST There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge. (rises) I'll go get it. \nSTANDARD No, I don't want us separated. \nFAUST You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section. \nROBY Don't count on it. \nHUNTER We sure need this flamethrower. \nSTANDARD All right... but do not go below decks. \nFAUST Right. (heads for the door) \nSTANDARD And be right back. \nFaust exits. \nROBY I think it's time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs. \nRoby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics appear on some of the screens. \nROBY (CONT'D) Can you make out any pattern in all that? \nSTANDARD (baffled) Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me. \nROBY I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms. \nHUNTER Recognizable!  In that? \nROBY In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with. \nHUNTER Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean? \nROBY And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings. \nSTANDARD That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker. \nROBY So the next step should be -- \nHUNTER -- The big one.  And there it is. \nOut of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle. \nROBY This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle. \nSTANDARD Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals... \nHUNTER ... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle. \nROBY You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats. \nSTANDARD Which presumably means... \nROBY ... More spores coming. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK \nFaust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES. \nHe hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN. \nFaust hesitates and peers into the lock. \nINTERIOR - AIR LOCK \nThe creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust. \nINTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK \nStealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall intercom and speaks into it. \nFAUST (whispering) It's in the lock -- blow the main lock. \nINTERIOR - BRIDGE \nStandard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence. \nSTANDARD (into intercom) What? \n", "test3_id": 2669}

JACK Say my name. 
MARLA What... ? 
JACK Say my name!  What's my name!? 
MARLA Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there... 
JACK Marla, no, wait... 
As Marla HANGS UP.  Jack stares at the receiver, dazed... 
TYLER'S VOICE We've got six fight clubs in Chicago now... 
Jack spins, dropping the phone -- TYLER sits beside him. 
TYLER Four in Milwaukee. 
JACK What's this all about, Tyler? 
TYLER And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South. 
JACK Why do people think I'm you? 
TYLER You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me. 
JACK Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? 
TYLER Why did you do that? 
JACK Answer me, Tyler. 
TYLER Why do people think anything? 
JACK I don't know!  Tell me! 
Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated. 
TYLER People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body. 
JACK What... ? 
TYLER Is this really news to you? 
JACK What are you talking about... ? 
TYLER Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me... 
FLASHBACK - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Commissioner Jacobs checks his tie in a mirror, goes to open the door of the MEN'S BATHROOM -- face to face with JACK. 
FLASHBACK - LOU'S BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT 
JACK stands surrounded by eager fight club MEMBERS, under the bare bulb, talking and behaving like Tyler... 
JACK The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
TYLER And, sometimes you control it... 
FLASHBACK - EXT. PAPER STREET HOUSE - DAY 
Jack stands in the yard, VODKA in hand, yells at Marla. 
JACK He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away! 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
TYLER You can see me and hear me, but no one else can... 
FLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT 
JACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway. He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there. 
JACK Anyone? (thinks) My boss, probably. (pause) Who would you fight? 
Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him. 
JACK Oh, yeah. (nodding) I didn't really know my Dad... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
TYLER But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you... 
FLASHBACK - TYLER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
JACK is on top of Marla, sweating, making violent love... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
TYLER I go places without you.  Get things done... 
FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Parker Morris Building. 
JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor, mannerisms, speech... 
JACK (shouting) You are not your job.  You are not how much money you have in the bank. 
TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell: 
BRUISED MAN #1 I am not my job! 
BRUISED MAN #2 I am not how much money I have in the bank! 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands. 
TYLER There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done! 
JACK This isn't possible... 
TYLER We're going to have to do something about Marla...

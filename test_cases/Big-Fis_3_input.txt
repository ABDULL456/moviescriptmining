KARL You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here. 
EDWARD What's your name, Giant? 
KARL Karl. 
EDWARD Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. (closer) You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer. 
KARL You don't like it? 
EDWARD I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this. (beat) So what do you say? Join me? 
Karl thinks a moment. Then -- 
KARL Okay. 
EDWARD Okay. 
They shake on it. 
EDWARD Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city. 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt. 
EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY 
Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl. 
There's a few tears amid the familiar faces. 
MAYOR (loudly, for the crowd) Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it's with a heavy heart we see you go. But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you. 
Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go. 
Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he could crush Edward. 
Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand. 
EDWARD (V.O.) That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice. 
VARIOUS TOWNFOLK Find yourself a nice girl! Don't trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your pride, Edward Bloom! 
EDWARD (V.O.) But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others. 
As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with 
THE OLD WOMAN. 
The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice. 
EDWARD (V.O.) She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught. 
The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward. 
EDWARD (to the Old Woman) Okay. Thanks. 
Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded. 
KARL What did she say? 
EDWARD Beats me. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions. 
EDWARD (V.O.) There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't. People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted. 
Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger. 
EDWARD (V.O.) Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road. 
Karl looks at the dirt road, wary. 
KARL You know anyone's who's taken it? 
EDWARD That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again. (beat) Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side. 
A little paranoid... 
KARL You're not trying to run away? 
EDWARD Just to be sure, you can take my pack. 
Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY 
The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

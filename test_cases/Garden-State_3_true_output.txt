LARGE What are we doing in the mall. I don't wanna be in the fucking mall. 
MARK We're making some money for your present. Just don't look so guilty. 
LARGE What do you mean, how do I look guilty? 
VOICE (0.S.) Andrew Largeman? They turn. KARL BENSON, greasy hair wearing a wrinkled, red "Nandi--World" vest and dirty pants stands holding a small box. 
MARK Oh, no. Benson. 
LARGE Oh, no. 
SAM Who's that? 
MARK Don't give him your number. Karl approaches. 
KARL Hey, what's up, man. 
LARGE Hey. 
KARL Holy shit, I haven't seen you since like junior year. 
LARGE I know. 
KARL I thought you killed yourself. 
LARGE What? 
KARL I thought you killed yourself, that wasn't you? 
LARGE 
(BEAT) No. That wasn't me? 
KARL Who killed themselves? 
MARK Just that Gleason kid. Oh, and Tina. 
LARGE Tina who? 
MARK You remember Tina. She was like anorexic. She did gymnastics... Sam is horrified by this conversation. 
LARGE oh yeah, gymnastics Tina. How'd she do it? 
MARK I don't know. She wasn't Jewish, I didn't bury her. 
KARL I think sleeping pills. or that car in the garage thing. I forgot. Sam is yanking on her ear for Large to see, but he doesn't notice. 
LARGE This is Sam. Sam this is Karl. 
SAM Hey.

LARGE Yeah. Yeah I was. Just this thing. So you're like what, working here? 
KARL

LARGE Yeah, definitely.

KARL Oh, washers. I'm s'posed to count'em. 
LARGE Washers?

JIM (demonic) We can. Right now. Just one more step... 
PAM No Jim. I want to LIVE with you. I want to LIVE with you. 
The two lovers huddled together on the ledge. He slips his head down on her lap, looking up into her eyes with the strangest tears in his eyes. 
JIM (a poem) There was preserved in her the fresh miracle of surprise... clothed in sunlight restless in wanting dying of fever married to doubt how it has changed you how slowly estranged you solely arranged you beg for your mercy -- OR -- ...but all will pass lie down in green grass and smile and muse and gaze upon her smooth resemblance to the mating-Queen who it seems is in love with the horseman Tomorrow we enter the tomb of my birth I want to be ready. 
On her face -- moved. Pause. LA WOMAN floods in on his smile, an upbeat surge. 
Upstairs, the ONLOOKERS relax. HOTEL MANAGEMENT and COPS are now rushing up in background. 
JIM & DOORS Mr. Mojo Rising Mr. Mojo Risin' (X2) 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DOORS OFFICE - SANTA MONICA BL. - L.A. - DAY (1970) 
There's music rocking from the inside. Cables and baffles run from the second story down to the rehearsal room on the first. 
JIM & DOORS Keep on risin' Got to keep on risin' Risin' Risin' (X8) 
INT. DOORS OFFICE - DAY 
The SECRETARIES and STAFF dance to the SOUND rocking thru the floor. 
JIM & DOORS Well I just got into town about an hour ago Took a look around, see which way the wind blow 
Camera moving thru the offices, past the OFFICE BOY, past SIDDONS, past the PUBLICIST, etc -- a farewell to the band. 
INT. BASEMENT - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY 
We see RAY, ROBBIE, JOHN, BOTNICK, a BASS and 2nd RHYTHM GUITARIST, WIVES, GIRLFRIENDS but no Jim. They're really driving, the music soars. PAMELA'S hair shaking as she swings to the beat. 
JIM & DOORS With a little girl in a Hollywood bungalow Are you a lucky lady in the City of Light? Or just another lost angel -- City of Night? 
INT. TOILET - RECORDING STUDIO - SAME DAY 
Wires run into a tiny toilet revealing JIM with headphones to his ears barking into a dangling mike, one leg propped on a toilet seat, in a groove. A new, strange, unparalleled beauty in his voice, hoarser but wiser, haunted by experience yet joyful as youth, Jim is ironically, at his best. 
JIM & DOORS LA Woman (X2) LA Woman / Sunday Afternoon (X3) Drive thru your suburbs Into your blues (X2) Into your blue-blue blues 
EXT. LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY 
MONTAGE: Moving, moving, moving -- all the POVS from fast- moving CARS travelling with the pace of L.A. Song of freedom, of escape -- the STRIP, the cars, the freeway, the BILLBOARDS... farewell L.A. 
INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Camera creeping towards ANNE O'RIORDAN as she waits, alone on a white table for the doctor to arrive. Jim never showed up after all. But on we go. 
JIM & DOORS I see your hair is burning Hills are filled with fire If they say I never lov'd you You know they are a liar (etc) Never saw a woman So alone (X2) So alone lone lone So alone 
EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE - DAY 
JIM drives up in his beaten GTO MUSTANG, top down, bags all over the place, hops out. Carrying his bulk with grace, knocks and rings. RIDERS ON THE STORM starting to play over. 
INT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY 
DOROTHY opens the door. Jim a stack of presents under his arm. 
JIM Eek Dorothy! You cut your hair! 
DOROTHY We're trying to have another baby. 
JIM (moving past her) What -- was your hair getting in the way? (she smacks him lightly) Where are the kids? 
EXT. RAY YARD - DAY 
He spots them, crossing to the YARD where a CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY is in progress -- TWO DOZEN KIDS, a CLOWN acting out for them. A few parents and friends -- ROBBIE and LYNNE, their kid, JOHN and his RECENT LADY, their kid... 
When the KIDS spot JIM they light up. 
JIM Hey -- am I late or is this the cool remnant of a dream? 
KIDS (rushing to him) Eee! Jim! It's Uncle Jim... Come on... what did you bring me Jim... 
JIM (picks up Robin) How's my girl! And how's my boy! 
They stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head. A bearded Santa Claus now engulfed with kids, though puffy, body gone, a literal physical wreck, yet a gentle pathos about him and still a charisma that the children react to without thinking. He gives out the presents all over. 
JIM (ad libs) For you... Pancho gets this one... Melanie -- yours... Hey Dorothy don't grab now... open that one, that's yours... keep your paws off that now... 
As RAY and ROBBIE and JOHN and the others circle him. 
JIM (to Robin, a 5 year old) ...and to you, princess, from your Royal servant, James Douglas Morrison (bows) 
As ROBIN, the cutest of them all, a bow in her hair, takes the package, opens it. 
RAY You wanna hear the new mixes on "LA WOMAN?"... 
JIM No, I gotta plane to catch. 
JOHN Won't take long man, it's the best one since "Days". 
ROBBIE We added rain to "Riders", come on. 
Jim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner room, his eyes on ROBIN opening the gift -- a beautiful, ANTIQUE DOLL of an 19th century poet -- rock star, stuffed, velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be Byron or it could be Jim Morrison -- in fact the hair is perfectly weaved to resemble Jim in his young lion phase -- an ironic gift, meant from the heart. It stops everybody -- they all look. A haunted quality to the doll. 
KID Ugh! What's that!

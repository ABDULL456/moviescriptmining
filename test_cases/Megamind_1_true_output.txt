Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away. 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY 
The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass tube not much wider than himself. 
MASTER MIND Plato, the radioactive spider, please. 
Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto Stenwick's arm. 
Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him. 
STENWICK Ow! 
He brushes the spider off. 
MASTER MIND Anything, Stenwick? 
STENWICK (shaken) No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this was about spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia. 
Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato. 
MASTER MIND We're gonna need more venom. 
Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) How `bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? 
INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY 
Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in the background. 
MASTER MIND This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want? 
He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. 
Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's attention. 
EINSTEIN Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman. 
Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand. 
MASTER MIND That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? 
The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what they're hearing. 
EINSTEIN I was just kidding, sir. In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive. 
MASTER MIND Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! 
MINUTES LATER 
Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small table. 
Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center. 
As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE GLOW emanating from inside. 
MASTER MIND Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. 
EINSTEIN Where the hell did you get that? 
MASTER MIND Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that. 
PLATO I believe he defeated you before you could, master. 
MASTER MIND ...Right. Man, he was good! 
DA VINCI You want another volunteer, sir? 
MASTER MIND Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. 
Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: "Hal Stewart - Metro City's Newest Hero?" 
NEWS REPORTER ...who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child. 
HAL Please, please, you're embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more? 
A smile creeps across the evil one's face. 
MASTER MIND (CONT'D) Somebody like him! 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone. 
PLATO Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's.

They are following me. \nLAURA (O.S.) Who is? \nMANFRED PICARD They may be listening to us too. Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham. (CONTINUED) \nPicard's car approaches a tunnel. \nLAURA (O.S.) What? \nMANFRED The art you collected, it's not in the Alps. \nThe Peugeot enters a tunnel. \nLAURA (O.S.)

ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nJACKSON AND LILLY (singing along to the RADIO) `We all live in a Yellow Submarine...' \nThey're driving through the glorious landscape of Yellowstone National Park. Noah sits in the back with headphones on playing Space-Busters 2. \nAs they pass over a ridge, the music station is overpowered by a talk show filtering through. We hear a raspy and excitable voice. \nRADIO HOST ... After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, I told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows... \nLilly reaches for the dial of the radio. \nLILLY What happened to the music? \nJACKSON Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment... \nJackson corrects the dial to get better reception. \nRADIO HOST ... There's been government people flying in and out all morning. And trust me, they did not look happy... (CONTINUED) \nA huge black helicopter brushes over the limo. \nRADIO HOST (CONT'D) ...

OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nLaura bursts in and heads straight for the TV. The President looks up from his desk. \nLAURA You have to see this. \nSally the President's Secretary enters, flustered. \nPRESIDENT WILSON It's alright Sally. \nSally closes the door as Laura turns up the TV. \nCNN ANCHOR ... Mr. Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years. As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997. \nThe President comes around his desk. Laura looks at him distraught. \nLAURA I just talked to him, Dad. He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham. Is that true? \nThe President shoots an anxious look across the room. Laura turns and suddenly realizes that Adrian is standing in the corner. \nLAURA (CONT'D) You knew too? You sleep with me and you didn't say anything? \nAdrian looks ashamed. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I can't even look at you.

It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love. (winking to Noah) Remember the book I gave you? \nNOAH I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. I'm not ready for that, Jackson. \nJACKSON I'm your dad, Noah. \nLILLY (O.S.) Daddy! \nJackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence with a `keep out' sign posted. \nJACKSON This wasn't here before. \nJackson starts to climb the fence. \nNOAH Don't you see the signs? \nJACKSON It's fine guys. \n", "test1_true": "Jackson and his kids crest a ridge.

EMPTY LAKE BED/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nA puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched THROUGH BINOCULARS. \nJackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to have a closer look. \nElsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS in the ground. \nNOAH (O.S.) Jackson! \nWhen he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming towards them from all sides. \nJACKSON It's okay, Noh'. \nThrough the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested and led over a ridge. \nWith this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling tower. \nEXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nAdrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby, being interrogated by an OFFICER. \nADRIAN I'll be with you in a second, Professor. \nAdrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with defiance. \nOFFICER ... And then you climbed over a posted fence? Just like that? \nNOAH I told you. \n(CONTINUED) \nJACKSON Isn't this supposed to be a National Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway? \nADRIAN (O.S.) We're geologists... \nJackson turns and sees Adrian standing there. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) I'll handle this officer. Thank you. \nThe officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license. \nJACKSON So, where did the lake go? \nADRIAN That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr... \nHe throws a look at Jackson's drivers license. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) ... Curtis. \nHe looks up at Jackson with renewed interest. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'? \nJACKSON (SURPRISED) Yeah, that's me. \nJackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles. \nADRIAN What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space. \nJACKSON You're one of lucky 422 who bought it. \nADRIAN Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me. \n(CONTINUED) \nJACKSON Oh, I see. \nProf. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs. Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license. \nADRIAN Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please. (to Jackson) Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis. \nJackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away. \nLILLY He was very nice. \nJACKSON Yes he was, Lil'bee. \nEXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER \nJackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with binoculars around his neck, stands in their way. \nCHARLIE FROST What did the government guys tell you? \nJackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly. \nJACKSON They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable. \nCharlie bursts out laughing. \nCHARLIE FROST Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable! That's funny... \nWith this he turns around and leaves. \nEXT. TENT/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK \nJackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent. He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture of Yellowstone on Google earth. \nIn the background we see the kids are in the tent. \n(CONTINUED) \nNOAH There are mosquitos in here.

BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nThe officers try to regain some control. \nNAVAL OFFICER Moving at 34 knots, sir. \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS What is our position? \nNAVIGATION OFFICER Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir. \nThe Captain's face drops. \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS You must be kidding! \nINT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nThe water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound for the first time. \nKATE We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die. \nA split second later Noah holds out his belt. \nNOAH Mum, will this do? \nSuddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker. \nADRIAN (Over a speaker) Mr. Curtis...

Jackson takes a breath and disappears underwater. \nINT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nBack on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him. \nANHEUSER Captain, what's happening? \nThe Captain looks at him annoyed. \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS What's happening?... (PAUSES) We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser. \nAnheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the distance. \nINT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nJackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge. \nINT.

HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nJackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs with air and thinks hard. \nAs he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He dives under again. \nINT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nLin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents. \nKate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls it tight. Lin screams. \nNoah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed, to go and help his father. \nINT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nBack under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet. \nJackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work. \nINT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nAnheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face of Mount Everest is almost upon them. \nINT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nKate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin. \nAfter a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified to see that Noah is nowhere to be found. \nKATE Noah! \nINT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nJackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift the drill. \nTo his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping. \nWorking as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free. \nAdrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop. \nHe dives back down for it. \nINT.

And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. (PAUSE) The end. \nAdrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence. \nLAURA How many copies did you say that sold? \n(CONTINUED) \nADRIAN Less than 500. (with a smile) It's what you might call a cult classic. \nLaura looks at him grinning. \nLAURA It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley? \nADRIAN (PLAYFUL) Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements. \nLAURA Actually my diary's pretty open. \nThe intimate moment is cut short. \nOFFICER (O.S.)

BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nAdrian and Laura enter the bridge. \nADRIAN You called for me, sir? \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley. \nThe Captain directs him to a monitor. \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) Looks like your scientific projections are way off again. \nThe Captain grins at Prof. West. \nPROF. WEST The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian... \nA monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip is enlarged. \nLAURA What's that? \n", "test3_true": "PROF. WEST It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded. \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS Our European colleagues have already set course for it. \nCaptain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio. \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) Here, somebody wants to talk to you. \nAdrian curious, grabs the mic. \nADRIAN This is Helmsley. \nWe hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers. \nINT.

COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nAdrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura and kisses her on the lips. She squeals. \nANHEUSER (O.S.) Put that woman down Helmsley. \nAdrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world... \nAdrian and Laura exchange a look. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours. \nAdrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) Mr. Helmsley, one more thing. \nAdrian turns back. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) There was no one. \nADRIAN Pardon me? \nANHEUSER There was no white kid better than you.

PANG (in Chinese) I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars? \nMR.PANG Do not fear. Some things will never change. \nThe old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah. \nJACKSON I thought you might want this. \nHe takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to him. \nNOAH Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad? \nJackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them. \nADRIAN I finally finished your book Jackson. \nKATE Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end. \nJackson looks at her, smiling playfully. \nJACKSON Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think? \nAdrian smiles. \nADRIAN I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole. \nSuddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd. \nEveryone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to roll back and light streams in. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser looks hopeful.

{"train": "Written by \nRoland Emmerich & Harald Kloser \nSecond Draft February 19th, 2008 \nOVER BLACK \nWe listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in A. \nFADE UP \nEXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEM \nSpace, infinite and empty. \nBut then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align. \nThe last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun. \nJust as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP \nEXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET \nMozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66, listens to the music. \nAn Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle. \nThe Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy. \nPROF. WEST Watch out! \nBut it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship. \nIn the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance. \nThe sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics - University of New Delhi'. \nINT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET \nAn endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32. \nPROF. WEST How deep are we? \nSATNAM 8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir. \nAs Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab. \nPROF. WEST Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions. \nSATNAM Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me... \nThey enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier. \nSATNAM (CONT'D) There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe. \nPROF. WEST How can that be? \nSATNAM We don't know, Professor, sir. \nSatnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch on the floor and hot steam rises. \nSATNAM (CONT'D) The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves. \nProf. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING \nA major fund raising party is under way. The setting is spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and the Capitol Building. \nADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL AIDES. He is the only African-American among them. \nOne of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief of Staff, working the crowd. \nPOLITICAL AID #1 Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he was President. Did you hear, he wants us to sign in and out like school boys? \nADRIAN I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House. \nPOLITICAL AID #2 Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress. \nADRIAN Shame he's such a pompous ass. \nANHEUSER (O.S.) Somebody mention my name? \nAdrian turns to see Anheuser smiling. \nADRIAN (SHOCKED) Yes sir... No, sir. \nANHEUSER Which one is it? \nADRIAN We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir. \nANHEUSER It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that. \nAnheuser walks away with a dangerous smile. \nPOLITICAL AID #2 That guy scares the shit out of me. \nAt that moment Adrian's cell phone rings. (CONTINUED) \nADRIAN (into the phone) Professor West? \nPROF. WEST (O.S.) I've been trying to reach you! \nINT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nProf. West is on the phone. In the background we make out Satnam's family around the dining room table. \nEager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes. \nCOLONEL (CONT'D) Who can weld? \nLin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns. \nIn the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock everywhere. \nFADE TO BLACK \n(CONTINUED) \nFADE UP \nINT. DORCHESTER HOTEL/LONDON - DAY \nA MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the Dorchester looking like your typical MI-6 agent. The decor is plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who frisk him. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/DORCHESTER HOTEL - DAY \nHeavily ringed fingers flip through a folder. \nMI-6 OFFICER (O.S.) Has his Highness had the opportunity to study the dossier? \nA SAUDI PRINCE looks up and nods without expression. \nSAUDI PRINCE You must understand I have a very big family. Mister... \nMI-6 OFFICER Isaacs. \nSAUDI PRINCE Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a lot of money. \nMI-6 OFFICER I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your Highness. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOUVRE/PARIS - NIGHT \nA group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa. \nMANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums, stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late 20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the famous painting. \nA whoosh of air as the vacuum seal breaks. \nMANFRED PICARD Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in your people. (CONTINUED) \nLaura answers in almost perfect French. \nLAURA There are too many crazy people who could hurt her, Manfred. The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world. \nIn the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy. He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight case. \nMANFRED PICARD And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in the Swiss Alps? \nLAURA Perfectly safe. \nPicard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her mysterious smile. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP \nFUZZY TV IMAGES: \nLifeless bodies encircle a huge fire pit. They resemble the rays of the sun. In the background we see the famous step pyramids of Tikal. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) ... The mass suicide was discovered by a BBC documentary crew in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal... \nMany of the dead are women and children looking peaceful and are surrounded by colorful flowers. \nNEWSCASTER (CONT'D) ... the victims were said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche Calender which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st of December this year, due to the sun's destructive forces... \nThe CAMERA slowly pulls out and we are in-- \nINT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING \nA shabby apartment in Silverlake. The TV is on. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) ... Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history... \nA small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell asleep at his laptop last night. \nJACKSON Oh no. Not again. \nOne look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30... \nJackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) Damn it! (into the phone) Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake... \nFrustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on their back covers. \nEXT. JACKSON'S GARAGE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING \nThe phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door, struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment. \nJACKSON They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun? \nHe tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead. Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel. \nEXT. JACKSON'S STREET/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING \nJackson runs across the street with his camping equipment, throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the curb. \nJACKSON ... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way. \nHe notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an elderly couple, stand there and stare at it. \nNEIGHBOR Merrill, we should move back to Wisconsin. \nJackson gets into the limo and speeds off. \nMANFRED PICARD (O.S.) Laura? They lied to us. \nLAURA Manfred is that you? \nEXT. STREETS/PARIS - NIGHT \nPicard is speeding in his Peugeot, anxiously checking his rear view mirror. \nMANFRED PICARD I had my suspicions. I should have said something. They are following me. \nLAURA (O.S.) Who is? \nMANFRED PICARD They may be listening to us too. Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham. (CONTINUED) \nPicard's car approaches a tunnel. \nLAURA (O.S.) What? \nMANFRED The art you collected, it's not in the Alps. \nThe Peugeot enters a tunnel. \nLAURA (O.S.) Then where is it? \nA huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nJACKSON AND LILLY (singing along to the RADIO) `We all live in a Yellow Submarine...' \nThey're driving through the glorious landscape of Yellowstone National Park. Noah sits in the back with headphones on playing Space-Busters 2. \nAs they pass over a ridge, the music station is overpowered by a talk show filtering through. We hear a raspy and excitable voice. \nRADIO HOST ... After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, I told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows... \nLilly reaches for the dial of the radio. \nLILLY What happened to the music? \nJACKSON Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment... \nJackson corrects the dial to get better reception. \nRADIO HOST ... There's been government people flying in and out all morning. And trust me, they did not look happy... (CONTINUED) \nA huge black helicopter brushes over the limo. \nRADIO HOST (CONT'D) ... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie. \nThey watch in awe as the chopper disappears behind a ridge. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nLaura bursts in and heads straight for the TV. The President looks up from his desk. \nLAURA You have to see this. \nSally the President's Secretary enters, flustered. \nPRESIDENT WILSON It's alright Sally. \nSally closes the door as Laura turns up the TV. \nCNN ANCHOR ... Mr. Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years. As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997. \nThe President comes around his desk. Laura looks at him distraught. \nLAURA I just talked to him, Dad. He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham. Is that true? \nThe President shoots an anxious look across the room. Laura turns and suddenly realizes that Adrian is standing in the corner. \nLAURA (CONT'D) You knew too? You sleep with me and you didn't say anything? \nAdrian looks ashamed. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I can't even look at you. Either of you! \n(CONTINUED) \nPRESIDENT WILSON Honey, calm down. \nLAURA A man was killed! I want the truth Dad. Right now. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nA dense forest trail. We hear Lilly before we see her. \nLILLY (O.S.) Daddy, where are we going? \nJACKSON To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love. (winking to Noah) Remember the book I gave you? \nNOAH I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. I'm not ready for that, Jackson. \nJACKSON I'm your dad, Noah. \nLILLY (O.S.) Daddy! \nJackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence with a `keep out' sign posted. \nJACKSON This wasn't here before. \nJackson starts to climb the fence. \nNOAH Don't you see the signs? \nJACKSON It's fine guys. \nJackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray. \nJACKSON We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie. \nLILLY Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book. \nJACKSON I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups? \nLilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah typing a text on his cell phone. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) Did mommy buy you that? \nNOAH No... Gordon gave it to me for my birthday. \nJackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands. \nJACKSON Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family. \nNOAH (BITTER) What family? \nJackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone. \nJACKSON Go to sleep guys. \nEXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK \nCommotion. The base packs up. Adrian and Prof. West duck low as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone. \nADRIAN ... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected. (MORE)                    (CONTINUED) \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm... \nWe hear Anheuser, yelling. \nANHEUSER (O.S.) ... But you guys said... \nADRIAN We were wrong! By five or six months... \nA second later the chopper lifts off. \nINT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK \nJackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on writing after what Noah has said. \nA chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck. \nThrough the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a microphone. \nCurious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial. \nON THE RADIO (Charlie's voice) ... We have a listener calling in. Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show. (Bill's voice) I wanted to know, where will this all start? \nJackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down. \nON THE RADIO (CONT'D) (Charlie's voice) Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But seriously, they've got the earth cracking under their asses already, Bill. \nJackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He can still hear the radio. \nON THE RADIO (CONT'D) (Bill's voice) Our family believes in the gospel of our Lord Jesus. (MORE)                   (CONTINUED) \nON THE RADIO (CONT'D) We have nothing to fear, Charlie. (Charlie's voice) Good for you Bill, good for you! \nINT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK \nCharlie hits a switch. Music starts playing. The Doors, `The End'. \nCHARLIE FROST ... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano. \nCharlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in. \nJACKSON Hi. Mind if I join you? \nCHARLIE FROST I only got a few minutes. \nCharlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at all the equipment. \nJACKSON I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood? \nCHARLIE FROST (CHEWING) Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast... \nJACKSON What are you talking about? \nCHARLIE FROST The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of... \nCharlie looks at his watch. \nCHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) I got to eat... Just check my blog. You can download it for free. \nCharlie clicks on his laptop. \nCHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) ... However, we do take donations. (CONTINUED) \nA crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on screen in an overly dramatic fashion. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange... \nCharlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift. \nOn screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin moves freely around it. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'... \nA faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen. \nCHARLIE FROST ... and Albert Einstein endorsed it... \nThe infamous photo of Einstein, sticking out his tongue. \nCHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) The forces of mother nature will be so devastating it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice 12-21-12. \nThe film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with water. \nJACKSON What? \nThe woman looks at Lilly and Noah with their red lumps. \nCASHIER I'd get before and after. \nShe slams two mosquito products on the counter. \nLILLY (POINTING) Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on TV! \nOn the store's TV: A heavy-set blonde WOMAN, 45, speaking to a reporter in front of Gelson's. \nNOAH That's our supermarket. \nThe gap in the ground is enormous now, at least half a mile long and 200 feet wide. \nJACKSON (WORRIED) Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nPresident Wilson and Anheuser walk towards the Situation Room. \n(CONTINUED) \nANHEUSER Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Is this even possible? What's our information from China? \nANHEUSER They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch. \nThe President is shocked by this news. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Only four? \nANHEUSER If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development. \nPRESIDENT WILSON I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting. \nAnheuser fumes as they enter the situation room. \nINT. SITUATION ROOM/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nFlat screens line the walls. A video conference is under way with each of the G8 members represented. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon. \nHe looks over to Adrian. \nPRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) I would like to pass this over to my science advisor, Adrian Helmsley. \nAdrian steps up and gathers himself. Anheuser watches. \nADRIAN I'll make this brief... \nPointing to a set of charts. \n(CONTINUED) \nADRIAN (CONT'D) ... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated... \nAll the heads of state are glued to his words. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) ... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours. \nThe German Chancellor, a woman, interrupts. \nGERMAN CHANCELLOR How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley? \nAdrian glances to Professor West, standing in the back. \nADRIAN Two, maybe three days if we're lucky. \nThe Prime Minister of Italy breaks in, upset. \nITALIAN PRIME MINISTER How can you speak about luck in such a situation? \nANHEUSER Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job. \nPresident Wilson steps up. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision. \nWe hear CHEERING and APPLAUSE. \nBOXING ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Introducing the 320 pound muscle machine from the Ukraine... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOXING ARENA OF MGM GRAND/LAS VEGAS - NIGHT \nThe arena is filled to its max. The crowd is on its feet. \n(CONTINUED) \nBOXING ANNOUNCER ... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. Here he is... Mister Zultan Balashin! \nThe crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter. \nThe CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair. He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe. YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch. \nHe approaches the ringside corner and whistles. \nYURI Zultan! \nThe nervous boxer turns. \nZULTAN (in Russian) Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would not see you. \nYuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach steps in. \nCOACH He needs to concentrate now, Mister Karpov. \nJACKSON Are you guys blind? I can't run people over. \nOLEG Why not? They're idiots anyway. \nJackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look. \nEXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nJackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's Russian pilot is expecting them. \nSASHA Hey Jackson. Took you a while... \nJackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage, dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose. \nALEC Ouch! Be more careful! \nThe other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into his face. \nOLEG Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are going on a big ship. (PAUSE) We will live... and you will die. \nOleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The Gulfstream taxis onto the runway. \nAs Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a ton of bricks: \nTHE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT! \nFrantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him. \nJACKSON Where can I rent a plane? \nThe man points to a shabby office building. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nKate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon watches the Governor on the news. \nGOVERNOR (with Austrian ACCENT) ... just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare... (CONTINUED) \nThe phone rings. Kate picks up. \nEXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nJackson drives like crazy. \nJACKSON ... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five. \nKATE The kids have plans today... \nJACKSON Are you kidding me! \nKATE No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate. \nGordon rolls his eyes and mutters. \nGORDON Not that we'd expect him to remember. \nJACKSON (SCREAMING) California is going down! Pack up the kids! \nKATE You're crazy! The Governor just said we're fine now. \nJACKSON The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on. \nINT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nKate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating. \nLILLY Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy? \nLAURA Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling. \nOn the TV, the interview comes to an end. \n(CONTINUED) \nGOVERNOR ... it looks to me, like the worst is over. \nThat moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles. \nEverybody dives under the table. \nON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few seconds later the signal cuts out. \nGordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes violently for 20 seconds. \nEXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nJackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house. \nINT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nWhen he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor. \nJACKSON We have to leave! Noah, let's go! \nKATE I think we're safer here! \nJACKSON Noah, now! Kate please... \nThe whole house rides up and down like on a wave. \nGORDON I think he's right. \nFinally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices. \nEXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING \nAs they storm out of their front door the house crumbles behind them. \nJACKSON Get in the car! \nThe whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses are shaken and smashed like toys. \nThe waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause. \nHARRY (CONT'D) (into the microphone) Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for the one and only Tony Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop. \nApplause. Harry rushes off stage. \nADRIAN (O.S.) Dad... what I have to tell you is very serious... \nINT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nAdrian is standing in a dark corner.

GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY \nHarry bites his lip. \nHARRY Love you too, son. \nINT. BAR/CRUISE SHIP - DAY \nBack in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail. Harry walks up and hollers at the barkeeper. \nHARRY Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the rocks. \n(CONTINUED) \nTONY After twenty-five years on the wagon? \nHARRY Why not? Who cares how long we do certain things? How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people... Or how long we don't talk to people. \nHarry grabs Tony by his shirt. \nTONY Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with you? Let's go. We're back on. \nHarry pulls him even closer. \nHARRY Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.

ADRIAN'S OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nAdrian enters his office. The TV is on. \nNEWS ANCHOR ... There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of the Western seaboard was hit... \nAssistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of them are crying. Prof. West appears at the door. \nADRIAN (pointing at the TV) Have you seen this? (CONTINUED) \nProf. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall- sized high def monitor. \nPROF. WEST We have satellite images. Here's the sequence we've got so far. \nOn the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the monstrous quake unfolds, leaving California sliding into the sea. \nADRIAN Any news from Yellowstone? \nPROF. WEST Anytime now. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nThe base is abandoned but for a few structures and the enormous drilling tower. \nGordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump. \nCharlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body. The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind. \nCHARLIE FROST (into his mic) ... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV... \nHe notices Jackson and muffles the microphone. \nCHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) How did you make it up here? Thought you were toast. \nJACKSON The spaceships Charlie, where are they? \nCHARLIE FROST You can't make it there. \n(CONTINUED) \nJACKSON We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie! \nAll around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super- volcano. \nCHARLIE FROST You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid? \nJackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at Charlie with her big brown eyes. \nJackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground. \nJACKSON Where is that god damn map! \nCHARLIE FROST Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper. \nA low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF BIRDS tear into flight. \nCHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) Wow! Look at that!... (into his mic) Fly birdies fly! This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow... \nThe mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing molten lava underneath. \nCHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) ... the last of mankind. Soon they'll see us from a million miles away, out there in the milky way... \nJackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the mountain. \nEXT. BELOW MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nJackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with Charlie's broadcast still playing. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE ... The ash cloud will travel everywhere. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St. Louis and then Washington DC... \nJackson's cell phone rings and he picks up. \nJACKSON We're on our way. \nEXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nKATE Jackson, things are really looking bad here! \nIn that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked from the landscape into a vacuum. \nTHE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in the last 640,000 years. \nTo them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the eruption has not reached them yet. \nThey are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nThe explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom. \nCHARLIE FROST ... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful! \nThe sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nThe RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around the disappearing landscape. \nLILLY (SCREAMING) It's following us! \nLilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them. \nJACKSON Just don't look back, Lil'bee! \nThe THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice of Charlie is getting shrill. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Majestic!... Oh yeah! \nEXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nCharlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the cloud of dust and fire towering above him. \nFlaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they detonate like fire bombs. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Oh baby! It's coming! \nEXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nRocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state, Charlie begins to sing... \nCHARLIE'S VOICE `This is the end, my friend'... \nYellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the bombardment of fire and rock. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nHuge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs. \nCHARLIE FROST ... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie. \nA second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY \nThe radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them. \nJACKSON LILLY! DOWN! \nKate gives Gordon a look. \nGORDON (EMBARRASSED) She's a patient, honey. \nJACKSON (SARCASTICALLY) Nice work. \nBut when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly changes. He gets in Yuri's face. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) You bastard. You knew it all along! (at the twins) You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours... \nSasha comes running in and cuts through this. \nSASHA I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them. \nYURI Can you still fly that thing? \nSASHA Sure... But I need a copilot. \nLilly chimes in. \nLILLY Gordon is a pilot. \n(CONTINUED) \nBefore Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly. \nJACKSON Let's go! \nThey burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm. Emergency personnel yell after them. \nRESCUE WORKER Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back! \nBut they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way. \nEXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK \nThey race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them, a Russian freight plane of enormous size-- \nThe ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world. \nNOAH Wow, that is a big plane. \nYURI (PROUDLY) It's Russian. \nSasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees: \nA MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport. \nSASHA Guys, follow me! \nThey all run after him up the stairs. \nINT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK \nSasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while readying the plane for takeoff. \nSASHA (into the mic) You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold... \nINT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK \nSASHA (O.S.) ... Sit down and buckle up! \nThey all scramble to get into their seats. (CONTINUED) \nNOAH Wow! Look at those! \nThey discover the cargo they are carrying-- \nSports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'. \nYURI We had VIP tickets for that. \nThe six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life. \nINT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK \nThe plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in the copilot's seat. \nSASHA You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks. \nGORDON Uh... What? \nSasha reaches over and does it himself. \nSASHA Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay? \nGordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus. \nINT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK \nPeople start SCREAMING, when they discover the menacing WALL OF ASH racing towards them. \nRESCUE WORKER Move back, people... down on the floor! \nEXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK \nThe nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash. \nINT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK \nGordon is panicking. \nGORDON We have to get going! (CONTINUED) \nSasha hits the throttle. \nSASHA (CALM) We're going, we're going. \nA deafening THUNDER emanates from the engines. \nINT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK \nEverybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft builds. \nThe young monk jumps out, quickly bowing. \nNENG Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on. \nMrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat. \nMRS. PANG I thought Lin is working on the dam? \nNENG The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood. \nThe chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand. \nMRS. PANG Not here in the mountains... Let's eat first. \nThe hen panics as she puts its head back on the block, raising the hatchet again. (CONTINUED) \nNENG No mother! We must pack up right away. \nNENG'S MOTHER We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way. \nThe door opens and Mr. Pang appears. \nMR. PANG Neng, I did not know you were coming for dinner. \nAt that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANTONOV/OVER THE PACIFIC - NIGHT \nThe majestic Antonov is flying high in the Pacific skies. \nOLEG (O.S.) Look, the new Bentley. \nINT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT \nThe boys are exploring the huge freight deck. Caesar, the little dog, is traipsing along. \nAlec, Oleg and Noah marvel at a stylish mixture of luxury and performance cars. \nALEC Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year. \nOLEG But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships. \nNoah points to a 2012 Aston Martin parked further back. \nNOAH If I was rich, I'd get one of those. \nOLEG We have one. How many cars does your family have? \nNOAH My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4. \n(CONTINUED) \nALEC Our parents are divorced too. \nThe boys share a moment of understanding. \nNOAH Nothing we can do about that. \nNoah reaches for the door of the Bentley. To his surprise, it opens. \nNOAH (CONT'D) Wow... look at this. \nNoah jumps into the car. \nKATE (O.S.) Be careful, Noh'! \nKate and Lilly are still belted in next to Tamara. Jackson and Yuri sit on the other side of the Antonov. \nTAMARA How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he? \nKATE I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids... \nKate looks at Tamara. \nKATE (CONT'D) Did your husband ask you to get your's done? \nTAMARA We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them. \nKATE I bet he did. \nThey laugh. \nLILLY What did the man pay for mommy? \nKATE Nothing, Lil'bee. \nKate looks over at Jackson who's trying to make sense of Charlie's map. Tamara catches her looking. \n(CONTINUED) \nTAMARA What's your situation? \nKate lets out a sigh. \nKATE Way too complicated... \nOn the other side of the plane, Yuri has been watching the two women talk. \nYURI They seem to like each other. \nJACKSON I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay? \nYURI One billion euro, per seat. \nJACKSON That's disgusting. \nYURI You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach... (SMILING) ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'. \nYuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder. \nYURI (CONT'D) What would you have done, if you rich like me? Just look at your gorgeous kids. And call me Yuri... \nADRIAN (CONT'D) What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane? \nLAURA Zero. What's your point? \nAdrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her. \nADRIAN It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now. \nLaura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the moment. \nINTERCOM (O.S.) Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your presence immediately. \nAdrian takes a breath, but before he leaves - \nADRIAN What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me... \nLaura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope. \nLAURA I need to know that too, Adrian. \nAdrian moves for the door. He stops. \nADRIAN One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too. \nAs Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nThe cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten inch layer of ash lies on the ground. \nThe gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts. \nINT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter. He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can. \nAn old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl. President Wilson kneels down to her. \nOLD LADY She can't find her mother. \nPRESIDENT Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do. \nThe child nods. The President gets up. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross... \nAs he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles. \nOLD LADY No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley. \nSALLY I know, she was amazing. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Who can help me with missing persons? \nWithout looking up, the young guy responds. \nRED CROSS VOLUNTEER Sorry man, I'm busy right now. \nHe then recognizes who he's talking to. \nRED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D) I mean, of course sir. I didn't realize... What can I do for you, Mr. President? \nThe President pats him on the shoulder. (CONTINUED) \nPRESIDENT WILSON Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son... \nA deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place. \nAs it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow wide... \nThe National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington Monument breaks into pieces. \nAn even more deafening sound makes him turn-- \nThe Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up by earth's incredible force. \nAs the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown to the ground. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY \nAll the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that show satellite images from all over the globe. Adrian and Prof. West stare in disbelief. \nSCIENCE OFFICER The capitol was hit by a 9.4. \nLaura enters the command center unnoticed. \nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER We lost communication with the White House, sir. \nShe stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a phone. \nLIEUTENANT #2 President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space. \nAnheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers. \nANHEUSER That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command. \nAdrian and Laura look to each other baffled. \n(CONTINUED) \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) ... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN \nSCIENCE OFFICER #2 We've recorded two quakes averaging \nShe grabs Adrian's hand. Anheuser sees this and his suspicions about them are confirmed. A cold little smile appears on his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALON/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT \nTony is watching TV with a group of passengers. Harry has just entered and stands near the back of the room. \nA TEENAGE BOY with bad acne searches for an available channel that is still broadcasting. He finds a news program with lousy reception. \nNEWSCASTER ... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water... \nThe signal gets weaker. \nHarry watches Tony slowly stand up. As he turns to his friend, his knees begin to buckle. His face is pale. \nTONY I called... But I never got through. \n(CONTINUED) \nHARRY I'm so sorry. \nTony only stares back at him. \nBehind them, the TV rolls to the side, as the whole room begins to tilt. \nHarry grabs on to the door frame, as the passengers along with Tony fall like dominoes. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Tony!! \nAs the ship rolls to the side, Harry finds himself hanging from the door frame now 20 feet off the ground. He's barely able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck. \nEXT. MIDDLE DECK/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT \nOn his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the moon shifting across the sky. \nAn eerie sound fills the air. A gigantic swell has formed off to his right. It's a mountain of water. \nHarry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHIBAM/YEMEN - DAY \nThe old walled city of Shibam is in ruins. The 2,000-year-old towers lie on the desert ground. Hundreds of believers have gathered to pray towards Mecca. \nAs they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow their motion and the chanting dissipates. \nThey stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is reality or only a mirage. \nA monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering towards them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT \nPresident Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound of the collapsed Red Cross tents. (CONTINUED) \nAs President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees-- \nA tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay. \nThe President looks ahead, calm and peaceful. \nPRESIDENT WILSON I'm coming home Dorothy... \nThe CAMERA follows the aircraft carrier `USS John F. Kennedy' as it slams broadside into the White House. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY \nHushed voices. Anheuser, Adrian and Prof. West stand amongst a group of officers and analysts. \nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #1 All global ground communication has ceased sir. \nCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #2 The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming. \nANHEUSER At least some good news. \nAnheuser turns to Adrian. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment? \nADRIAN We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. \nHe nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of commands. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) ... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation. \n(CONTINUED) \nEverybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet Earth. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... (POINTING) ... These are their new positions. \nAnheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian. \nANHEUSER So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin? \nSilence. Adrian clears his throat. \nADRIAN It's the south pole, sir. \nAn ALARM SIGNAL goes off-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN \nA red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel. \nTAMARA Yuri bear, what are we doing? \nYURI We're taking the Bentley! \nINT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN \nSasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering snow field comes flying towards them. \n(CONTINUED) \nSASHA CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast! \nSasha pulls the Antonov back up. \nSASHA (CONT'D) Now! Open it! \nGordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE. \nINT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN \nThe cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface. \nJackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens. Everyone screams in panic. \nYURI SHUT UP EVERY ONE! \nThey all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly. \nYURI (CONT'D) Engine... start... \nThe motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson. \nYURI (CONT'D) Voice control... Sold me on it. \nINT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN \nSasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon. \nSASHA Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down! \nGORDON What about you?! \nSASHA I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! \nGordon hesitates. \nSASHA (CONT'D) What are you waiting for! (CONTINUED) \nSasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out. \nINT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN \nThe cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice everywhere. The Bentley roars. \nYURI (O.S.) Push it Curtis! \nJACKSON We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. \nNoah turns and sees Gordon. \nNOAH Tamara! Open the door! \nGordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation. \nTAMARA Where's Sasha? \nGORDON He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down. \nYuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing. \nLILLY Daaadddy! \nThe Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. \nThe Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. \nThe plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. \nSasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep. \nThe plane crashes and explodes. \nEXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN \nAs the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow. \nThe Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking. \nJACKSON (O.S.) Everybody okay back there? \nKATE (O.S.) We're all fine. \nThe door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES. \nOne by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- \nSeveral Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass. \nGIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from these flying machines. \nOne of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley. \nArmed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone. \nCHINESE COMMANDER Welcome to the People's Republic of China. \nJackson nods to them. \nJACKSON Thank you... (to Lilly and Noah) Say thank you, kids. \nThe others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello... \nCHINESE COMMANDER What color are your passes? \nKate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind. She's still very upset. \nTAMARA I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. \nGORDON Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments? \nTAMARA Cheap bastard. \nGORDON You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? \nTamara nods silently. \nTAMARA Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri. \nSuddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine. \nJACKSON You guys hear that? \nIn the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN \nNeng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of dust just as Jackson reaches the road. \nJACKSON (out of breath) Hey! Help! Wait for us! \nBut Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson, pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road. \nJACKSON (CONT'D) Shit! Shit! \nJust then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck, turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of the cabin. \nNeng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't believe his luck. (CONTINUED) \nThe others show up and they all run towards the truck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INSIDE MOUNTAIN/CHO MING - DAWN \nAnheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe-- \nDeep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the ship, readying it for launch. \nLaura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family. \nLaura points down at the workers. \nLAURA Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people? \nThe Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns. \nANHEUSER Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest. \nLaura hates him in that moment. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) Captain? Where is the Bridge? \nAnheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains. \nCHINESE STEWARD (O.S.) Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way. \nLaura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE \nThousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance. \n(CONTINUED) \nAmongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's family trails behind. \nDistant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from the cities below. \nPeople start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a number on its speed dial. \nINT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE \nAdrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings. \nADRIAN Satnam? (CONFUSED) Where are you? \nSATNAM (O.S.) On the Nampan Plateau... \nAdrian's face goes pale. \nADRIAN What?! \nSATNAM There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge! \nADRIAN Satnam, what happened? \nSATNAM (O.S.) We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came! \nAdrian closes his eyes. \nEXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE \nSatnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley. \nSATNAM I have to go! \nA wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him. A tidal wave of gigantic height. \nEverybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance. (CONTINUED) \nHe picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child. \nINT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE \nAdrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable to do anything. \nEXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY \nAbove Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship. \nYuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up. \nYURI (in Russian) Pull yourself up! \nOleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate. \n(CONTINUED) \nInside the ship, officers yell. \nDECK OFFICER (O.S.) To the lower decks people! \nThe gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close. Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach. \nYuri strains with all his effort before deciding. \nYURI Oleg! Catch your brother! \nYuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms. \nOleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath. \nOleg pulls his brother from above. \nINT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nA SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate. \nDECK OFFICER Boys, you gotta move. \nALEC We wait for our father! He's still down there! \nThe loading officer attempts to comfort them. \nDECK OFFICER There's no one down there. (GENTLE) Come on boys, come... \nThe Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt. \nThe gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap. \nINT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors. \nANHEUSER Why is the stern gate not closing? \n(CONTINUED) \nCAPTAIN MICHAELS Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. \nADRIAN (O.S.) Captain, over here. \nThey race over. Adrian points to a monitor. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) I think we found the problem. \nOn the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) How did they get in there? \nSURVEILLANCE OFFICER They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There... \nBobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin. \nLAURA That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong. \nANHEUSER You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean... \nAdrian tries to ignore this. \nADRIAN Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber. \nAnheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura. \nANHEUSER You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter? \nWithout thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face. He drops to the floor, out cold. \nEveryone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian looks around. \n(CONTINUED) \nADRIAN What are you all waiting for? \nThey speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY \nFurther down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force. \nEXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY \nThe massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However, the props of the American ship don't move. \nIn the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them. \nINT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nAn IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the officers explains. \nTECHNICAL OFFICER If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start. \nADRIAN There's no way to override it? \nTECHNICAL OFFICER No sir, it has to be done manually. \nINT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nEXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY \nThe vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge. \nINT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nAlec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the whole ship capsizes. \nEXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY \nThe giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed around by the debris and raging waters. \nBut then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up and seems to steady itself. \nHowever, the strong currents continue to force it through the mountain ranges of the Himalayas. \nINT.

ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nThe water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound for the first time. \nKATE We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die. \nA split second later Noah holds out his belt. \nNOAH Mum, will this do? \nSuddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker. \nADRIAN (Over a speaker) Mr. Curtis...

The Pangs smile to one another. \nJackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nJACKSON If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me. \nKate embraces him tightly. \nKATE Whatever you do...

And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. (PAUSE) The end. \nAdrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence. \nLAURA How many copies did you say that sold? \n(CONTINUED) \nADRIAN Less than 500. (with a smile) It's what you might call a cult classic. \nLaura looks at him grinning. \nLAURA It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley? \nADRIAN (PLAYFUL) Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements. \nLAURA Actually my diary's pretty open. \nThe intimate moment is cut short. \nOFFICER (O.S.)

The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing. \nANHEUSER Where is the President, Sally? \nSally looks up stone faced. \nSALLY He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone. I think he's over at the chapel. \nANHEUSER The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church! \nAdrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser. \nADRIAN He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea. \nANHEUSER Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley? \nAnheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look. \nSALLY I really don't like that man. \nINT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET \nAdrian finds the President standing near the front of the chapel. \nADRIAN Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately. (CONTINUED) \nPresident Wilson stays with his head bowed. \nPRESIDENT WILSON Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk. (PAUSE) Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made. \nADRIAN That's not your fault sir. \nHe turns to face Adrian. \nPRESIDENT WILSON You sound like Anheuser. \nThis quietly affects Adrian. \nPRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady? \nADRIAN A little. \nPRESIDENT WILSON You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital? (PAUSE) `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done. \nADRIAN There would have been chaos, sir. \nPresident Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes. \nPRESIDENT WILSON You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself. \nAdrian takes this in. \nPRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser. (CONTINUED) \nAdrian stares at the President in disbelief. \nADRIAN But sir? \nPRESIDENT WILSON Go. That's an order Helmsley. \nA tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him. \nPRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her. \nWe hold on President Wilson's face. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

The US National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas. \nTamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand. They share an intimate look, no one else sees. \nVOICE (CONT'D) We strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately... \nThe tow truck driver panics and runs inside. \nWe move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless. \nIn the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked crowd heading towards the terminal building.

COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DUSK \nAdrian enters. Anheuser immediately senses something is amiss. \nADRIAN The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to. \nEveryone in the room looks up, speechless. \nANHEUSER So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship? (PAUSE) Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta. \nAdrian is shocked. \nADRIAN What about the Speaker of the House? \nANHEUSER In this chaos... I have no idea! \nADRIAN But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think - \nAnheuser moves in dangerously close. \nANHEUSER I don't care what you think, Helmsley. \nLaura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and Adrian stare each other down. \n(CONTINUED) \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady... and because of all that affirmative action bullshit. \nAnheuser takes it even further. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) There was a white kid, much more qualified than you. Just so you know. \nAdrian's face is ashen. \nLAURA (O.S.) Where is my father? \nEveryone turns to Laura. Silence. \nADRIAN He wanted to stay with his people. \nSuddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over. Laura panics. \nLAURA We have to go back! \nAdrian tries to hold her close to him. Anheuser sees this intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look. A second later Laura pushes Adrian away. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the Captain. \nANHEUSER There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter. \nAnheuser turns to an officer. \nANHEUSER (CONT'D) Tell the Captain, to take off immediately. \nLaura looks at him incredulously. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING \nWe finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains. \nNine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other. Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature. \nBut only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding. \nSuddenly SIRENS goes off! \nThe boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract.

Idiot! They are leaving you behind too! \nThe soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates.

COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING \nWe cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command posts. \nEXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING \nA hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the first to climb out. \nRight before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made behemoth. \nLin hastily pulls the others up. \nLIN (in Chinese) Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand. \nIt's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group. \nLilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship. (CONTINUED) \nJACKSON Move Lil'bee! \nJackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform. \nAs the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both see this, but Jackson is closer-- \nHe grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death. \nFor the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod. \nEXT.

TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING \nLin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform. \nThe sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming masses have arrived at the access platform.

She yells! \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Caesar! \nEXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING \nThe little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms, leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the platform with the launching towers. \nAlec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs them by their necks. \nYURI Let that stupid dog go! \n(CONTINUED) \nHe's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the drop off at the edge of the platform. \nEXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING \nThe ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch lines up directly in front of Lin and his group. \nLIN (in Chinese) Okay. Now! \nOne by one they all climb into the hatch.

ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING \nThe mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either side tumble off the platform. \nYuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder leading down. \nYURI (in Russian) Down there! Oleg, you go first! \nAs they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running towards Tamara. \nOLEG Daddy look, Tamara! \nYuri cannot believe his eyes. \nEXT.

As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives Yuri the finger. \nINT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING \nLin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the hydraulics for the tail gate are located. \nHe opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power drill, almost too big to be carried by one person. \nLin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson. \nLIN I need your help. \nINT. TECHNICAL COMMAND CENTER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nLaura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command Center.

I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization... \nINT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY \nAnheuser looks on stoney faced. \nADRIAN ... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? \nLaura watches him proudly. (CONTINUED) \nADRIAN (CONT'D) A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive.

Can you handle that, Adrian?! \nSilence. \nAdrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now. \n(CONTINUED) \nADRIAN There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives. \nAll eyes are glued to Adrian. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why? \nAdrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) He died because we forgot to pick him up.

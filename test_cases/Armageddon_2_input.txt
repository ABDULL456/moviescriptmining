INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 
Chick (to Harry) Thirteen months, seven days. (beat) What the hell has he been  doing all by himself? 
INT. RUSSIAN MIR STATION 
Life inside, like the cluttered glove-box of an old car. George Michael's  "Freedom" plays on a piped-in sound system. COSMONAUT LEV ANDROPOV dances and  sings. 
Lev FREEDOM! FREEDOM! GOT TO GIVE WHAT IT TAKES....Hello Yankees! I love you  America. (reading from English book) Would you prefer an appetiser or aperitif?

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 
Sharp addresses the crews of both shuttles over the radio -- 
Sharp Listen up -- the MIR will be spinning to give us gravity so we can work  faster. You might feel queasy or dizzy. We'll dock, transfer the fuel, then  detach from the MIR.  Fast and safe. This stuff is very volatile. 
INT. RUSSIAN MIR SPACE STATION - DOCKING PORT 
Lev is working feverishly, running highly insulated liquid oxygen and hydrogen  PROPELLANT TRANSFER HOSES from the MIR's several LABORATORY and LIVING MODULES  to the MIR's twin docking ports. 
A BLUE INDICATOR LIGHT FLASHES. Lev looks out of the MIR's portside window. His  eyes light up. He smiles. 
EXT. SPACE - LOW EARTH ORBIT - MIR DOCKING PORTS

On a wall, A COMPUTER BOARD that monitors the fuel transfer is filled with GREEN  LIGHTS. 
INT. CENTRAL ROOM - CENTER HUB OF MIR 
Harry, Bennie, and Lev are talking in the combination kitchen/ rec room of the  MIR -- a little bigger than a walk-in closet. Lev grabs a VIDEO CAMERA and  starts video-taping Harry and Bennie. 
Lev I hear rumour on radio. My country broke. No steaks in freezer. They plan  to sell me and the MIR (moving in closer, conspiratorial) Can you confirm this? 
Bennie We wouldn't know. What's the camera? 
Lev Oh, I also di-rec-tor. Russian cinema. MIR movies. Each has title. 
Lev grabs remote control. On a large TELEVISION screen VARIOUS IMAGES OF LEV  appear. 
Lev "Lev loves cargo." "Lev sleeps." "Lev prepares for Americans." "Lev gets  bored so he gets drunk." Funny but...too long. 
Bennie Looks like you have a lot of free time on your hands. 
Lev Yeah. I alone by myself. 
Watts comes into the room. The first woman Lev has seen in a very, very long  time. Lev moves the camera all over her. 
Lev Hello, fellow space colleague.

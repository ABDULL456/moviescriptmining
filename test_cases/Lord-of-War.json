{"train": "LORD OF WAR \nWritten by \nAndrew Niccol \nFADE UP \nCLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV. \nLate-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie. \nBlack smoke wafts in front of his face.  He speaks matter-of-factly, directly into camera. \nYURI There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation.  That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.  The only question is... (taking a draft and stubbing out the cigarette) ...how do we arm the other eleven? \nThe camera zooms away from his face, revealing: \nYuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood. \nThe faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on the wind. \nCUT TO: \nA TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET. \n- Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on top. A BULLET is born.  A perfect 39mm. \n- The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome. \n- The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER, is tossed into a crate. \n- The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest.  He seems to stare directly at our BULLET. \nUKRAINIAN OFFICER (to his SUBORDINATE carrying a manifest, in Ukrainian) Call it \"agricultural machinery\". \n- The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN. \n- The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in the cold grey Odessa harbor.  A container door closes, plunging the bullet into darkness. \n- The door re-opens.  The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea. \n- The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast.  The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship. \n- BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a mud-clogged road in lush rainforest. \n- The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone - immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier. \n- The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted into an AK-47 machine gun. \n- The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.  Suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire. \n- The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired. \n- Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action? \n- Smack.  The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel. \n- Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into bright sunshine.  It is flying down the main street in Freetown. \n- The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of it.  They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild- eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47 almost as tall as he is. \n- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks. \n- Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly relieved. \n- The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness - the bullet's final resting place. \nCUT TO BLACK \nEXT.  ODESSA - MAIN STREET.  DAY. \n\"Towards A Brighter Socialist Future\", reads a billboard in the main street. \nOdessa, U.S.S.R - 1980 \nFifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame.  He spies a long line snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store. \nYURI (V.O.) I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of Odessa in a country that no longer exists. You might have heard of it - a little place called the Soviet Union. \nA YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat, poring over a Communist text.  Yuri approaches, pretends to be interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book. \nYURI (in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over the idealist's shoulder) All property is theft. \nThe Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit.  Yuri pats his comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's red neckerchief and Lenin pin. \nINT.  GROCERY STORE.  DAY. \nNow wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the store. \nYURI (V.O.) Where I grew up, everyone was equal.  Some were just more equal than others. \nIn the distance, a roller coaster in Coney Island, silhouetted against the afternoon sky. \n\"Little Odessa\", New York - 1984 \nThe camera travels off the coaster to a restaurant, apartment above it. \nYURI (V.O.) We congregated in New York's Brighton Beach because of its similarity to the Crimean Sea.  I've always thought it's appropriate we moved next door to the circus. \nINT.  \"CRIMEAN RESTAURANT\" - LITTLE ODESSA.  DAY. \nA typical Jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia - menorah on the mantle, etc.  The family sits in a small dining room attached to the restaurant.  ANATOLY reads the Torah as he waits for dinner with YURI and VITALY. \nYURI (V.O.) I had no idea my father would take his assumed identity so much to heart.  I guess he just stayed in character. \nYURI, older, as we now know him, studies school work.  Long-haired VITALY watches \"Band Aid\" on TV. \nIRINA puts a plate of mussels in front of Anatoly. \nANATOLY (glaring at the plate, incredulous) How many times--I can't eat shellfish.  It's \"treyf\". \nIRINA You're not Jewish. \nANATOLY I like it. (picking up his felt fedora) I like the hat - to remind us there's something above us.  I like that. \nAnatoly dons his hat. \nANATOLY (cont'd) I'm going to temple. \nIRINA You're not going to temple.  You go to temple more than the rabbi! \nVitaly begins eating his father's plate of mussels.  Yuri watches his father exit. \nYURI (V.O.) I was suffering an identity crisis of my own. \nWe focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair.  Yuri shuffles between the eagle of the CIA and the dove of the U.N. \nYURI (V.O.) My gift for languages made me highly sought after.  The C.I.A. and U.N. were both heavily recruiting Russian immigrants. \nYuri settles on the dove. \nEXT.  UNITED NATIONS.  DAY. \nThe idealistic YURI, ill-fitting suit, full of optimism, approaches the United Nations Building. \nYURI (V.O.) Naturally, I went with the U.N.  They were paying more. \nHe strides past Luxembourg's gift to the U.N. - a sculpture of a gun with its barrel tied in a knot.  Never gives it a look. \nHe is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female U.N. Official, VIVIAN CARLISLE.  She likes what she sees. \nINT.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER.  DAY. \nThe blue helmeted YURI is seated in a white U.N. armored personnel carrier, the background behind him morphs from one Third World location to another: Third World desert to Third World rainforest to Third World slum. \nYURI (V.O.) The fastest way to find out you can't change the world is to actually go there. \nEXT.  NRFL REBEL HEADQUARTERS - NORTHERN LIBERIA.  DAY. \nPoolside at a recently-captured Southern-style colonial mansion, a long way from Georgia. \nGbamga, Liberia - 1985 \nYURI (V.O.) West Africa's Liberia, or \"land of the free\", was originally established in the 1800's as a homeland for freed American negroes.  It's been enslaved by one dictator or another ever since.  They even copied their masters' Southern architecture. \nA tatty pile of weapons - some from World War II - sits in front of a long negotiating table. \nYURI, blue beret, observes the CHIEF U.N. ENVOY at the table opposite warlord ANDRE BAPTISTE, leader of the National Revolutionary Front of Liberia (NRFL). \nBaptiste, 40's, is an imposing figure.  In full uniform despite the heat, he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit his extra few pounds.  His THIRD WIFE stands next to him, wiping the sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper. \nYURI (V.O.) It was my first meeting with the American- educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste.  While the warning signs were all there, no one had any idea what a monster he would eventually become.  I certainly didn't think he would become my friend. \nBaptiste has a U.N. document in front of him, awaiting his signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun. \nU.N. ENVOY (referring to the meager pile of weapons) --With all due respect, Mr. Baptiste, you don't seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire arsenal. \nBaptiste shrugs. \nU.N. ENVOY (cont'd) This is making a nonsense of the embargo ratified by all five permanent members of the Security Council.  The escalation in the build up of arms jeopardizes not only order in the region but ultimately world order. \nBaptiste smiles. \nBAPTISTE (playing to the gallery) --World order?  You say we jeopardize world order? \nBaptiste's Third Wife wipes his brow. \nBAPTISTE (cant'd) Your idea of world order is when you're giving the orders to the world. \nThe Envoy has no response. \nBaptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting there. \nYURI remains at the verandah, exchanges a smile with a YOUNG PROSTITUTE, at least two years from legal. \nHe's tempted.  He knocks back his drink.  He approaches the girl - presses a few bills into her hand.  She picks up her purse, makes to leave with him but he motions her to stay. \nMONROVIAN GIRL (referring to the money) What's this? \nYURI (explaining the tip) For the smile. \nYuri exits alone.  The Liberian Man, across the street, follows. \nEXT.  DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET.  NIGHT. \nYURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet.  He feels something in his back - stops abruptly.  His hand reflexively goes to his holster. Empty. \nHe turns.  The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own gun. \nYURI (mixing English and French) Fuck, no, no, no, no--fuck, no.  Money?  You want money? (going through his pockets, he starts pulling out loose bills) Fuck, no.  Don't shoot.  Don't shoot me. Fuck.  U.S. dollars. (referring to the face on a five dollar bill) President Lincoln. \nThe Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri. \nThe Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up. \nLIBERIAN MAN (in flawless English) Glock .45. \nThe Liberian produces a crisp U.S. twenty dollar bill of his own, offers it to Yuri. \nLIBERIAN MAN (cont'd) (referring to the face on a twenty dollar bill) Jackson. \nYURI What? \nYuri stares at the money, bewildered. \nLIBERIAN MAN President Jackson. \nHe shakes his head. \nYURI No. \nLIBERIAN MAN (misinterpreting him) You are driving a hard bargain. \nHe hands Yuri a second twenty. \nYURI (flabbergasted) No, keep it.  Keep the money.  Keep the gun. \nLIBERIAN MAN (offended) What do you take me for - a thief? \nThe Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered Yuri. \nLIBERIAN MAN Demand and supply. (referring to the gun) There is more I am thinking where this comes from. \nYURI (incredulous) You want more Glocks? \nLIBERIAN MAN And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle. \nYURI What makes you think I'll do that? \nLIBERIAN MAN (quizzical) I will come back and shoot you with the Glock. (checking the magazine, referring to the bullets) By the way, do you have the hollow point cartridges? \nYuri stares at the man. \nYURI (facetious, nodding to the gun) You got any color preference for that? \nLIBERIAN MAN (missing the sarcasm, regarding the gun) Kelly green. (meeting Yuri's eye) I will find you. \nThe Liberian walks away, still admiring his new weapon.  Yuri stares after him. \nYURI (V.O.) He'd come to the right place - peacekeepers are armed to the teeth.  And nothing but premium product.  The U.N. mostly buys from Switzerland - where else? \nINT.  CAPTAIN CARLISLE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS.  NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other. \nYURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting of a bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of their respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands everywhere. \nEven in the heat of the moment, VIVIAN is unable to completely let go of her work. \nVIVIAN (between heavy breaths) What are we doing here, Yuri? \nYURI (kissing her nipple) Whatever you want. \nVIVIAN You know what I mean.  Here, in this country.  Are we doing any good? \nYURI (finally telling her what she wants to hear) Would nothing be better? \nSatisfied with the answer, she completely gives in to the throes of passion - pulls him to her. \nLATER \nVIVIAN, satiated, dozes amongst the rumpled sheets, backside exposed. \nYURI uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key attached to her belt. \nCLOSE ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF A TWA 747, TAKING OFF FROM JFK. \nINT.  CONVENTION CENTER - PARIS.  DAY. \nA platoon of attractive YOUNG WOMEN in camouflage mini-dresses show off the latest sniper rifles and grenade launchers. \nAn ASIAN BUSINESSMAN pitches hardware to YURI.  VITALY is more interested in the girls. \nASIAN BUSINESSMAN (brochure in hand) --I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles.  The older Chinese model.  Not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial airliner.  I'm giving them away at eight-fifty. \nYuri notices that his vendor's attention has wandered to a suave older gentleman, SIMEON ZAHAROFF, surrounded by eager VENDORS of all nationalities.  The Asian man joins the enthusiastic throng. \nYURI (V.O.) It was the eighties and the Cold War was far from thawed.  Most of the deals were government-to-government.  There were some go- betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly private club with a lifetime club president. \nYuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls. \nYURI That's him.  The guy Eli told me about.  Simeon Zaharoff.  Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war - both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the Falklands.  Hets a fucking legend.  I've got to talk to him. \nYuri pushes past Zaharoff's entourage. \nYURI Simeon!  Simeon! \nA BODYGUARD tries to step between Yuri and Zaharoff. \nVITALY (stepping between the bodyguard and Yuri) They're talking. \nZaharoff, irritated, nonetheless humors Yuri. \nSIMEON May I help you? \nYURI A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton Beach Import-Export said to contact you.  I have a business proposal.  Perhaps we can discuss it - over a drink. \nSimeon looks him up and down. \nSIMEON You're in the wrong place my young friend. This is no place for amateurs. \nSimeon walks away without another word.  Vitaly shrugs.  Yuri fumes. \nYURI (under his breath in Ukrainian) Yob tvayu mat.  (Subtitled - Motherfucker.) \nYuri watches Simeon go, surrounded by flunkies. \nYURI (V.O.) Curious how you always revert to your native tongue in moments of extreme anger... \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - PARIS.  NIGHT \nCamouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor - a contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier. \nYURI (V.O.) ...and ecstacy. \nYURI and VITALY are getting it on with two SALES GIRLS. \nWe pan from one couple in the living room, Vitaly, to the one in the bedroom, Yuri. \nWe focus on Yuri, in the midst of the act - hears his brother's moans in Ukrainian. \nVITALY (O.C.) Boh...Boh.  Oh, Boh! (Subtitle:  God...God. Oh, God!) \nYuri smiles at Vitaly's cries.  Something catches Yuri's eye on TV. \nCLOSE UP OF A TV SCREEN \nshowing images of the aftermath of the suicide bombing at the U.S. barracks in Lebanon. \nYURI (V.O.) Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the- counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under sanctions. \nEXT.  STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.  DAY. \nA street lined with shelled buildings. \nBeirut, Lebanon - 1986 \nThrough one of the shell holes, we glimpse YURI and VITALY with a LEBANESE CUSTOMER. \nYURI (V.O.) The job wasn't so different trom the U.N.  I was just as neutral working for the ununited nations.  An equal opportunity \"merchant of death\", I supplied every army but the Salvation Army. \nWe track with them, only getting occasional glimpses through the holes as they make their way through the war-torn streets of Lebanon. \nYURI (V.O.) We got our start in Lebanon after the suicide bombing. \nThey enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a Coke sign - \"Taste Life.\"  The model drinking the Coke is Ava Cordova. \nINT.  BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.  DAY. \nInside the warehouse is a ten foot high, unruly pile of junked weapons. \nYURI (V.O.) When the United States leaves a war zone, they generally don't take their munitions. It costs more to bring it back than buy new stock. \nYURI and VITALY usher the CUSTOMER over to an industrial scale loaded with assorted weapons. \nYURI I sell by the kilo. \nThe town is deserted.  YURI and VITALY are confused as they prepare to unload an arms consignment from a truck. \nYURI (V.O.) We had our set-backs.  It's not called gunrunning for nothing. \nUp the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons, confetti, dancing. \nFinally, a Congolese man, JOHN \"CANNIBAL\" NGAWE, appears at the warehouse. \nThe conversation is in French. \nYURI (from the boat) Cannibal, what's going on? \nCANNIBAL Cease fire, man.  Cease fire.  It's over. \nYURI What?!  What do you mean it's over? \nCANNIBAL Truce.  We're friends, man. \nYURI (looking to his unopened crates, more and more agitated) Friends?!  You can't be fucking friends. Last week I spoke to you on the phone.  You said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead.  You called them vermin. You said would piss in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches.  Just last week, you said this! \nCANNIBAL (shrug) That was last week, man. \nCannibal starts to walk away. \nYURI Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from me! \nCannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign. \nCANNIBAL Peace, man! \nYURI Fuck you, Cannibal!! \nYuri looks to Vitaly. \nVITALY (referring to the truck) Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans. \nYURI (nodding in agreement) At least when they say they're going to have a war, they keep their word. \nEXT.  NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN.  DAY. \nYURI and VITALY stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains.  Guns and ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTERS.  An AFGHANI OFFICIAL inspects the cargo. \nYURI (V.O.) I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when they were still fighting fellow Russians. But I never sold to Osama bin Laden.  Not for any moral grounds.  Back then he was always bouncing checks. \nAFGHANI OFFICIAL I hope you're not thinking of selling these, Mr. Orlov. \nYURI (shakes his head) Personal use. \nAFGHANI OFFICIAL There's a hundred thousand bullets here. \nYURI I'm kind of trigger happy. \nVitaly hands the Official his documentation - clipped to it, a thick wad of bills. \nThe Afghani Official smiles.  He returns to his mud-brick border station beside the confiscated merchandise. \nYuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall - Miss May is AVA CORDOVA. \nYURI (V.O.) And everywhere I went, Ava Cordova kept following me around.  We were as international as each other. \nEXT.  FREIGHTER SHIP.  DAY. \nWe tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a freighter, ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia. \nNorth of Barranquilla, Colombia - 1989 \nYURI (V.O.) Operations like mine provided the only way for certain regimes to conduct a respectable war. \nVITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not helped by standing downwind from Yuri's cigarette smoke. \nYURI (V.O.) The freighter I was standing on carried 113 tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest nations in Latin America in direct contravention of half a dozen international arms embargoes. \nYuri makes a call on his cell phone. \nYURI (V.O.) To keep authorities in the dark, I often spoke in code.  Rocket launchers were \"mothers\", the rockets \"children\".  Assault rifles were \"apples\".  The AK-47 was \"the Angel King\". \nYURI (into phone) The Angel King will arrive tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too. \nYuri hangs up.  His phone rings with an incoming call. \nYURI (cont'd) (into phone) Yes?...Slow the fuck down--what do you mean, tipped off?  They know where we are?!  Where are they?! \nYuri grabs a pair of binoculars.  On the horizon, a fast-approaching speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racer's deck. \nYURI (cont'd) (hanging up) Forget it. \nVITALY and the CAPTAIN, also spying the Customs Boat, join Yuri at the railing. \nCAPTAIN Do we run? \nVITALY We have to get out of here. \nEXT.  DECK - FREIGHTER.  DAY. \nYuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word \"KRISTOL\".  He flips it around as Valentine and the other agents board. \nValentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to open it.  The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of grain - grain spilling onto the deck. \nValentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile phone rings. \nA CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat. \nAGENT (referring to the phone) Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north. \nValentine hesitates, returns to the ladder. \nAs the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there. \nEXT.  RAILING - FREIGHTER.  DAY. \nYuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away. \nOn the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri - a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg. \nYuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back. \nYURI Nice job. \nCLOSE ON the word, \"KONO\".  From the \"O\", a paint drop runs down the stern. \nEXT.  BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, COLOMBIA.  DAY. \nYURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the dockside. \nThey are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the outskirts of the docks. \nA Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them. \nA military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the Guerrillas several hundred yards behind. \nThe Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter. The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition. \nYURI (in Spanish) Hey, pay before you play. \nNARC LEADER (in Spanish) You're late. \nThe Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling everywhere. \nVITALY Hey, fuck you! \nNARC LEADER (jamming his handgun in Vitaly's eye socket) Fuck you! \nYuri tries to play peacemaker. \nYURI (reasoning with the Narc Leader) No, you don't fuck him-- \nThe Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side. \nYuri shudders with the impact.  The enraged Vitaly lunges towards the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back. \nYURI (cont'd) No, Vit.  No. (to the Leader, referring to the bullets) Help yourselves.  Free sample. \nVitaly nurses Yuri to the ground. \nThe GUERRILLAS ignore them, frantically re-load just in time, immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle. \nThe government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over. \nThe Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government troops. \nYuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his own blood. \nYURI (V.O.) The first and most important rule of gunrunning is never get shot with your own merchandise. \nINT.  WAREHOUSE - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.  DAY. \nYURI, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and VITALY keep a watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns and other ammunition. \nYURI (V.O.) The second rule is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid.  Credit card, check, cash.  Preferably in advance, ideally to an off-shore account.  It's why I choose my customers so carefully.  Say what you like about warlords and dictators, they tend to have a highly developed sense of order. They always pay their bills on time. \nThe Narc Leader nods his approval. \nNARC LEADER (referring to Yuri's wound) I apologize for earlier. \nYURI (slight wince) I understand. \nWORKERS start loading the crates into a truck.  The Narc Leader hands Yuri the suitcase. \nNARC LEADER It's all there. \nYuri snaps open the suitcase - inside six kilos of cocaine. \nYURI What is this? \nVitaly doesn't budge. \nYURI (cont'd) I promised our parents. \nVITALY (desperate eyes) Please. \nYURI Vitaly, you're going to have a good time. This is a top place.  Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute weather girl's been here since July. \nVITALY Please. \nYuri relents, pours a gram onto the dashboard.  Vitaly snorts it off the dash. \nVITALY (as he wipes his nose) You're a good brother. \nVitaly kisses Yuri. \nTwo ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away. \nYuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror - shepherded up the path. \nYURI (V.O.) I never understood what separated the recreational drug user from the habitual, the functional addict from the dysfunctional.  But for the grace of God, it could have been me snorting lines as long as the Belt Parkway. \nINT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY. \nIRINA lights a candle in front of the Virgin Mary. \nYURI (V.O.) Vitaly never got completely clean despite the prayers of my mother... \nINT.  SYNAGOGUE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY. \nANATOLY prays in front of the menorah. \nYURI (V.O.) ...and father.  In fact, my younger brother was the only reason my father ever had to question his new religion. \nINT.  AIR MAROC JETLINER.  DAY. \nAn EXECUTIVE sits in his Business Class seat.  On the tray table in front of him, calculator and spreadsheets. \nYURI (V.O.) After Colombia I became a one-man-operation. A sole proprietor as you say on your tax return - that is if you're foolish enough to fill one out. \nHe exchanges a collegial smile with YURI who has similar entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him. \nYURI (V.O.) By then I'd mastered my craft.  Selling arms is not so different to selling vacuum cleaners.  You advertise, pound the pavement, take orders. \nThe businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the brochure lying next to Yuri's \"Day-Runner\" - glossy photos of GRENADE LAUNCHERS. \nA MONTAGE OF SCENES - ILLUSTRATING THE ANATOMY OF AN ARMS DEAL. \nIt takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa. \nYURI (V.O.) Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be a political scientist.  I go by a seven-step approach. \nYURI gets off a plane. \nYURI (V.O.) One: identity a government and an opposition where the opposition is ignored. \nYURI immediately picks up a newspaper, eager for the latest news. \nYURI (V.O.) Two: Wait for a radical group to break away from the opposition. \nYURI is buoyed by the front page news, over-tips the NEWSPAPER SELLER. \nYURI (V.O.) Three: Immediately approach the radical group and offer them arms. \nYURI meets a group of REVOLUTIONARIES in a backstreet bar, shows them an arms catalogue. \nYURI (V.O.) Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the government that the radical group approached you and offer the government arms. \nYURI meets a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in the parliament buildings, shows him the same catalogue. \nYURI (V.O.) Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach the radical group and offer them more arms but now at a higher price.  Increasing tension is a means of generating demand and the ideal situation is to sell to both sides. \nYURI meets the REVOLUTIONARIES a second time in the same bar - this time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out. \nYURI (V.O.) Six: If they start shooting at each other, the escalation is underway. \nYURI, now accompanied by bodyguards, is escorted into the government buildings, where he's given a fat envelope. \nBack at the bar, YURI is given an even fatter envelope. \nYURI (V.O.) They are consuming small arms and ammunition and the cash register is well and truly ringing. \nYURI stands at his hotel window, sneaking a look through grimy venetian blinds.  A street battle is taking place. \nHowever, in Yuri's mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually replaced by the sound ot a cash register.  Each time a gun is fired, the register rings. \nYuri shuts the window. \nYURI (V.O.) Seven: Don't forget that the success of a radical group in one country can inspire a radical group in a neighboring country. \nYuri boards a plane, taking off for a new conflict zone. \nANATOLY Major General.  He got promoted.  Two of his rivals were also there that day.  I told you - he's the luckiest man alive. \nYURI He may be luckier than you think. \nYuri goes to pour himself a drink.  Anatoly grabs his son's hand the way he did many years earlier. \nANATOLY (lowering his voice) We're not fools, Yuri.  What's between you and your wife is your own business but I don't think you're going to Odessa to open a McDonald's. (meeting his son's eye) Is this how you want to be remembered? \nYURI (shrug) You're only remembered when you're dead. \nYuri knocks back his vodka, tries to lighten the mood. \nYURI (cont'd) I'll bring you back some caviar. \nANATOLY It's not kosher. \nA crash.  VITALY and a call-girl, ANGEL, dressed in a low-cut fairy dress, stumble through the front door - both the worse for drink and drugs. \nVITALY Merry fucking Christmas! \nAngel laughs.  The family gazes at Vitaly and his friend, appalled. \nANATOLY (paternal) Vitaly, who is this? \nANGEL Angel. \nVITALY Her name really is Angel.  She's a fairy. (hoisting Angel) Let's stick her on top of the Christmas tree. \nVitaly and Angel laugh.  No one else does. \nVitaly collapses on the floor.  Nicolai cries. \nVITALY (cont' d) (at a loss for anything better) I love you all. \nYuri firmly escorts Angel to the door and pays her off. \nEXT.  ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC - UPSTATE NEW YORK.  DAY. \nYURI drops VITALY back at the exclusive rehab center. \nBy now Yuri knows the routine.  He pours a gram onto the dashboard. \nYURI I'm going back to Ukraine. \nVitaly snorts it off the dash. \nVITALY (maudlin) I miss Odessa.  I miss you. \nYURI I miss you too. \nVitaly kisses Yuri. \nVITALY (cont'd) (meeting his brother's eye) Be careful, Yuri.  Those things you sell, kill... (tapping Yuri's chest where his heart should be) ...inside. \nTwo ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.  Yuri stares after Vitaly. \nINT.  UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT.  DAY. \nAVA and NICKI kiss YURI goodbye. \nEXT./INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY - MANHATTAN.  MORNING. \nYURI enters a public storage facility, opens a locker with a combination lock. \nYURI (V.O.) There's no problem leading a double life. It's the triple and quadruple lives that get you in the end. \nHe produces several passports from the locker, shuffles the passports like playing cards. \nYURI (V.O.) Back then I carried a French, British, Israeli and Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the U.S., but that's another story. \nThe locker also contains five identical briefcases - presumably he can tell them apart. \nYURI (V.O.) I also packed five different briefcases depending on the region of the world I was visiting. \nEXT.  BORDER CHECKPOINT - IZMAYIL, UKRAINE.  DAY. \nLight snow falls.  YURI, driving a brand new Mercedes, waits in a long line of cars at the border. \nIzmayil, Ukraine - January, 1992 \nYURI (V.O.) The end of the Cold War was the beginning of the hottest time in arms dealing.  The Wall had fallen.  The arms bazaar was open. Those forty-five years had generated the highest weapons build-up in history.  The Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no enemy. \nA Border Guard approaches Yuri's car window. \nBORDER GUARD (in English, checking Yuri's passport) Visa? \nYuri hands the Guard his passport.  Inside, a credit card emblazoned, \"VISA\". \nThe guard smiles. \nBORDER GUARD (cont'd) Cash or check only. \nEXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE.  DUSK. \nSIMEON, flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS, is in the face of a YOUNG OFFICER. \nThe Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS, Kalashnikovs resting on their hips. \nSIMEON Do you know who the fuck I am? \nOFFICER (thick Ukrainian accent) Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are? \nSIMEON I demand to see your commanding officer. \nOFFICER You don't demand shit. \nSimeon reconsiders his position. \nSIMEON Just give me back my papers. \nOFFICER (papers clearly visible in his hand) What papers? \nThe Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with the passport, starts watching TV.  The Bodyguards make to follow but the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path. \nSimeon fumes. \nYURI (O.C.) You're late, Simeon. \nYURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity.  He enters the guard station as if he owns it. \nFrom beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the situation with the Young Officer.  After a moment Yuri slips the Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport. \nYuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the veteran gunrunner. \nYURI (cont'd) I invited you for a drink once before. Perhaps now you will accept my invitation. \nINT.  ODESSA HOTEL BAR.  NIGHT. \nYURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar.  Yuri flirts with the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer. \nBARMAID (to Yuri, impressed) You sell guns? \nYURI Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see my bazooka. \nThe Barmaid giggles and exits. \nSimeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music.  His BODYGUARDS sit at the table behind. \nYURI You look a little lost, Simeon.  Is the world changing too fast? \nSIMEON I am here, aren't I? \nYURI Not all of you, I think. \nSimeon's look begs explanation. \nYURI (cont'd) You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA, you can't get that ideology completely out of your head.  The empire was evil for too long. \nSimeon shrugs. \nSIMEON I can't deny, it takes some getting used to. Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together. \nYURI There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon.  I sell to leftists, rightists.  I'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers. \nYuri leans forward. \nYURI (cont'd) Of course, you're not a true internationalist until you've supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen. \nSimeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours himself another drink. \nSIMEON I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.  Instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together.  What do you think? \nYuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking. \nYURI I think you are the amateur now.  I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy.  I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct. \nSimeon is confused. \nYURI (cont'd) I am the same man who was not good enough for you before.  I am not good enough for you now. \nSimeon blanches.  Yuri gets up. \nSimeon holds his rival's arm. \nSIMEON The problem with gunrunners going to war is there's no shortage of ammunition. \nYuri departs. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - ODESSA HOTEL.  NIGHT. \nYURI and the BARMAID never make it to the bed.  Still clothed, they bang each other against the door of his hotel room. \nYURI (V.O.) Back then, it was all for sale... \nYURI (hesitates, he's actually forgotten) The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of them repeatable in polite company. \nValentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of its weapons.  An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint. \nYURI (cont'd) (noting to the gun in his ribs) The new MP-5.  Do you need a silencer for that? \nValentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation. \nVALENTINE The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso.  Nice.  Did you type it yourself? \nYURI It's for humanitarian missions. \nVALENTINE You're a humanitarian? \nYuri shrugs - why not? \nVALENTINE (cont'd) (not buying it for a second) This is a killing machine. \nYURI Not any more. \nDMITRI (in broken English) Listen to the nephew. \nIt's true.  Yuri has had the armaments detached. \nYURI Didn't you get the memo?  The war's over. What can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use? \nDMITRI What, yes? \nYURI (trying to lighten the mood) The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you. \nValentine's face hardens at the flippant remark. \nStill at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in the convoy.  Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy. \nVALENTINE (referring to the missiles) Also going to Burkina Faso? \nYURI (pointing to the document) But to a different client at a different address. \nValentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself. \nVALENTINE What do you take me for?  A complete fucking fool? \nYURI (eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to his throat) Not complete, Sir.  And while I hesitate to tell you your job, I must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices. \nVALENTINE (incredulous) You expect me to believe this is a coincidence? \nYURI I can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime. \nValentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than he imagined. \nValentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the line.  He finally holsters his gun. \nVALENTINE (tosses the documents on the road) Yuri Orlov.  You and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other. \nYURI I can hardly wait. \nVALENTINE (climbing into his Jeep) Watch out for the time you don't see me. \nYuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away. \nBOY (perfect American accent) What an asshole. \nYuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making. \nEXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY. \nYURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter.  Checking the empty trucks, he is just in time to see SIMEON and his HENCHMEN climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away. \nAs he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact. \nYuri looks for DMITRI, exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his hip flask as usual, the worse for drink. \nYURI (referring to the departing Simeon) What was he doing here? \nDMITRI (zipping his pants) Trying to beat your offer.  I sent him on his way.  He doesn't understand the concept of loyalty. \nDmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks. \nDMITRI (cont'd) Speaking of loyalty, too many people know. I have to make pay-offs. \nYURI Don't worry.  There're more VCR's.  I left them in your new car. \nDmitri's face lights up.  Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL. \nDMITRI Even your enemy was admiring that car.  I am the luckiest man alive. \nDmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri.  Yuri watches Dmitri walk to the car and climb in for a test drive. \nA look of realization on Yuri's face. \nYURI (screaming to Dmitri) Dmit--!!! \nA bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase.  Yuri is barely in the car before it screeches away. \nAs the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear Yuri's thoughts. \nYURI (V.O.) But if I thought I was scared of Andre Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior. Like father, like son.  The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree.  He was a heavy- drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast American automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets of the capital.  Oh yes, he was also a cannibal.  They say Andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength.  I could've told him he'd get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli. \nAndre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a burst of gunfire.  The city, a violent clash of cultures.  Goats and Gucci. \nYURI (V.O.) Monrovia itself was like being on another planet.  Planet Monrovia.  From the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun.  I rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the \"Little Kremlin\".  And I never left town alone.  Outside town, was the edge of hell. I didn't want to even gaze into it. \nThe car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel.  A DEAD BODY on the ground attracts no attention whatsoever. \nANDRE JNR. This is your hotel. (proudly) Two stars. \nA PORTER, carrying Yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body. \nANDRE JNR. (cont'd) (to Yuri) Can you bring me the gun of Rambo? \nYURI Part One, Two or Three? \nANDRE JNR. (confused) I have only seen Part One. \nYURI (nodding) The M60.  You want the attachable grenade launcher? \nANDRE JNR. Please.  And the armor piercing bullets. (revving the car) I will be back to get you in an hour...or two.  It's Liberia. (mischievous smile) We left a welcoming present in your room. \nYuri nods, uncertainly. \nINT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY. \nYURI enters the hotel. \nAt the reception desk, two HOTEL PORTERS watch a small, portable TV - CNN coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial - gruesome evidence photos. \nHOTEL PORTER #1 (never averting his eyes from the screen) My God, he nearly cut off her head. \nHOTEL PORTER #2 When I get to America, I will not live in Brentwood. \nThe CONCIERGE hands Yuri a key. \nINT.  HALLWAY / HOTEL ROOM.  DAY. \nYURI goes to open his hotel room door - hears music from inside, enters. \nTwo stunning LIBERIAN GIRLS sit naked on the bed bopping to Madonna's lILike A Prayer\". \nYURI (V.O.) In the most AIDS infested region of the globe, where one in four is infected, Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and no condom within a hundred miles. \nGLORIA Hello, Mr. Yuri. \nFAITH We'd be happy to make you happy. \nThe two goddesses drape themselves around him. \nGLORIA Don't worry, we don't have anything. \nYURI How do you know? \nFAITH Do we look like it? \nYURI (fending them off but with little commitment) What if I have AIDS?  Don't you worry? \nGloria's lips gently touch his. \nGLORIA You worry too much. \nFaith begins to unbutton his shirt. \nFAITH (sultry) Why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today? \nGloria's hands go to his belt buckle, start to unfasten it. \nGLORIA How can we make you happy? \nWith great reluctance Yuri reaches behind him and opens the door. \nYURI By leaving. \nEXT.  HOTEL - CORRIDOR.  DAY. \nFAITH and GLORIA, still buck-naked, are tossed into the hallway, their clothes flung after them, door slammed shut. \nINT.  BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE - MONROVIA.  DAY. \nA Glock .45, Heckler & Koch .40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia, ANDRE BAPTISTE - a few pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform.  ANDRE JNR. watches over his shoulder. \nAndre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically. \nIn front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings.  Half a dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch.  Several HOSTESSES tend to a refreshments table.  On a nearby sofa, a LIEUTENANT flirts with one of the hostesses. \nBaptiste glances over to the Lieutenant, irritated. \nAVA, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him. VITALY, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another dubious- looking GIRLFRIEND, is examining another of Ava's paintings. \nAVA Yuri, I just got off the phone with the dealer.  I sold my first painting. \nYuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod. \nYURI (feigning surprise) Fantastic.  Who bought it? \nAVA Someone important.  They want to remain anonymous. (asking in a way that does not expect an answer) How was your trip? \nYURI You know.  Same old, same old. (quickly changing the subject) Where's Nicki, in bed? \nAVA I'm sorry.  Poor darling.  He tried to stay up. \nYURI I'll kiss him goodnight. \nVITALY (opening champagne) This calls for a drink. \nYURI What doesn't? \nAVA (still giddy at the news) My first painting.  I'm officially an artist! \nHe watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and the latest girlfriend. \nYURI (V.O.) I figured I was a patron of the arts and of everything else Ava had tried and failed at after modelling.  Acting, her own cosmetics line.  I didn't sabotage her careers but I can't deny it was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile.  She was a beautiful bird in a gilded cage. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT. \nYURI kisses his sleeping son, NICOLAI, now three years old. \nHe places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking microscope. \nAt the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy gun. \nINT.  KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT. \nYURI tosses the toy gun in the trash. \nVITALY, still in the kitchen, catches him - pretends he didn't see. \nYURI How are you, brother? \nVITALY (shrug) You know, still the resident family fuck-up. \nYURI Someone has to do it. \nThey watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitaly's girlfriend. \nVITALY She knows, right? \nYURI We don't talk about it. \nVitaly looks askance. \nYURI (cont'd) (shrug) How many car salesmen talk about their work, how many executives at cigarette companies? And both of their products kill more people every year than mine.  At least mine has a safety switch.  If those guys can leave their work at the office, why can't I? \nVITALY Shit, you're good.  You almost had me convinced. (to his girlfriend, knocking back his drink) We're going, baby. \nLATER \nYuri and Ava are alone at the window, overlooking Central Park.  He hands her a fresh glass of champagne. \nYURI (raising his glass for a toast) To Manet, Monet...and Ava Cordova. \nAva grins, goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings laying at the bottom of the glass. \nAVA (gasp) Yuri! \nYURI (shrug) The trip went better than expected. \nAVA (fishing out the damp baubles) Yuri, they're beautiful. (flirtacious grin) But what am I going to wear them with? \nYURI (flirting back) I know just the outfit. \nThey kiss. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT. \nCLOSE UP on the diamonds dangling from AVA's ears.  She wears the earrings and nothing else as she and YURI make love. \nYURI (V.O.) I didn't know how much she knew and how much she ignored.  I was a good provider and as far as she was concerned - loyal.  Despite the other women, I always made love to Ava as if she was the only one. \nINT.  HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.  MORNING. \nFrom an unmarked helicopter, JACK VALENTINE and his INTERPOL AGENTS shadow a Mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic. \nINT.  SEDAN.  MORNING. \nYURI rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs sections of several newspapers. \nA thought interrupts his homework. \nPILOT (to Yuri, anxious) I'm putting us down. \nYURI (incredulous) You land and we're all going away!  I don't have paperwork! \nPILOT (incredulous) We're in a flying fucking bomb!  They're firing bullets at our bullets!  Forget about going away!  They shoot again, we're going away for good!  I'm putting us down. \nYURI (knowing he's right) Okay!  Okay!--Fuck!! \nThe pilot responds on the radio. \nPILOT (into radio) This is Charlie Echo India.  Descending on heading zero two nine. \nThe Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport.  Yuri surveys the terrain below, getting his head back in the game. \nYURI (pointing out a narrow highway) Not the airport.  There.  The highway.  It's our only fucking hope. \nPILOT (concerned) A pothole could set us off. \nYURI Don't underestimate yourself.  You're the best, Tony. \nThe pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway. \nINT.  INTERPOL JET.  DAY. \nFrom his own wingseat, VALENTINE observes the Ilyushin's detour, landing on the highway. \nINTERPOL PILOT I can't land there. \nVALENTINE (to the pilot) He can't get far.  I want a truck waiting on the tarmac. \nEXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY. \nA heavily-trafficked highway.  WOMEN carrying water jars on their heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling dry meat, CHILDREN playing war games. \nThe pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its final approach - they scatter. \nThe Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole. \nINSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down. \nFinally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines shutting down.  YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window. \nCurious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side of the road. \nYURI (to the pilots, sizing up the locals) We're going to be okay. \nThe PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing supplies as they go. \nYURI (cont'd) (calling out from the window) Where are you going? \nPILOT As far from the evidence as I can. \nThe pilots start running down the highway. \nYURI Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be any evidence!  Stay with the plane! \nThe pilots ignore him - run for their lives. \nYURI is left alone.  He turns a lever marked, \"CARGO BAY\". \nEXT.  CARGO BAY.  DAY. \nThe rear cargo bay opens.  YURI stands beside his incriminating merchandise. \nYURI (to the gathering locals) Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge. \nOne LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.  Yuri hands him an AK-47 and a box of shells. \nMore SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road, seemingly out of thin air. \nYuri hands out more guns. \nYURI (cont'd) (to other locals) Take the whole crate. \nTwo men oblige, ferrying the crate away. \nThe other locals become bolder, then brazen. \nSoon it's a free-far-all.  Men, women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted down - also a lot that is. \nYuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush. \nEXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY. \nYURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of grenades. \nHe sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos. \nYuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses. \nYURI (muttering under his breath, shutting off the calculator in disgust) What a fucking disaster. \nPROSTITUTE (in French, as she counts Yuri's money) It's not what I would call a fuck. \nThe prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him.  Yuri ignores the money, staggers after her. \nYURI Are you sick? \nShe ignores him. \nYURI (cont'd) (screaming) Are you sick?! \nYuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field. \nA DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA \nTwo dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers from a crowd.  The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and string doubling as a soccer ball.  The game is between two indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift dirt field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together. \nYURI wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking.  The players humor him by letting him have the ball. \nYuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses completely, clattering to the ground. \nThe crowd and players laugh.  The game goes on.  Yuri, also laughing but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders away. \nA LIBERIAN BAR CALLED \"ZANZI-BAR\" \nYURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from rusted corrugated iron. \nRinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of two little GIRLS arguing. \nGIRL #1 (O.C.) They will! \nGIRL #2 (O.C.) They won't! \nGIRL #1 (O.C.) They will! \nGIRL #2 (O.C.) They won't! \nGIRL #1 They will! \nGIRL #2 Ask the foreigner.  The foreigner will know. \nThe GIRLS approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses, hands politely behind their backs. \nYURI Hello. \nGIRL #1 Sir, will my fingers grow back? \nOne of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should be. \nYuri runs away. \nA MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA \nYURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells. \nSuddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON.  The gunshot wound in his forehead still evident.  Yuri gasps. \nYURI Simeon. \nSimeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the back of his head. \nYURI (cont'd) Simeon!! \nYuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished.  Yuri turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops, shorts, Gap T-shirts and AK-47's. \nThrough Yuri's eyes the two men look like four.  The two/four men go through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes. \nYuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten the watch. \nOne of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head. His colleague stops him. \nMAN #1 Don't.  He's Andre's. \nMAN #2 (keeping his gun raised) Fuck Andre. \nYURI (seemingly beyond caring) Yeah, fuck Andre. \nThe man fires at Yuri.  The gun jams.  Yuri looks almost disappointed.  The man tries again.  Again the gun jams. \nYURI (referring to the gun) I'm sorry.  They don't usually do that.  Let me have a look.  Maybe I can fix it. \nMAN #1 (disgusted) Fuck off! \nThe man whips the gun across Yuri's face. \nA PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA \nYURI, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through the brush outside Monrovia. \nA HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared, frenzied eyes. \nYuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry.  Tears roll down his cheeks. \nINT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. \nYURI enters, sits in an armchair.  AVA and NICOLAI are cuddled on the sofa - Ava reading him a fairytale. \nAVA (looking up from the book) Was that about the oil or the timber? \nYURI Both.  Everything. \nAva smiles, carries on reading. \nYuri looks to his hand - we rack focus to the uncut diamond.  Yuri gets up. \nINT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - GARBAGE ROOM.  NIGHT. \nYURI, still in his suit, stands in a dumpster, searching. \nYURI (V.O.) At four and a half months a human fetus has a reptile's tail - a remnant of our evolution. \nAmongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing the BULLET. \nYURI (V.O.) You can fight a lot of enemies and survive but if you fight your biology you always lose. \nYuri places the bullet around his neck. \nINT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  MORNING. \nAVA is fastening eight-year-old NICOLAI's coat, readying to go out. YURI, half-dressed, appears in the hallway. \nYURI Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye?  I'm leaving in ten minutes. \nAVA Sorry, Nicki has swim practice. \nNicolai kisses his father. \nNICOLAI Bye, Papa. \nYURI (hugging him) See you, big guy. \nAva kisses Yuri. \nAVA (teasing him) Personally, I'm glad you're going.  You've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves. \nYURI (taking the teasing good- naturedly) This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday.  I'll be back for the weekend. We'll go somewhere - the sea. \nAVA That would be fun. \nA thought occurs to Yuri. \nYURI You trust me, right? \nYuri's turn to interrogate her eyes.  Ava smiles. \nYURI (V.O.) She looked me directly in the eye the way I've looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials, government bureaucrats and footsoldiers from every law enforcement agency in the world - and she lied without flinching. \nAVA Yes, I trust you. \nYURI (V.O.) She'd learned from the best. \nAva gives Yuri a final kiss, hurries Nicolai out the door. \nINT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  DAY. \nFrom the rear seat of a Mercedes sedan we observe YURI exiting the apartment building and entering a waiting Mercedes sedan of his own. \nAVA (O.C.) (to the DRIVER) That's him. \nWe reveal AVA and NICOLAI in the car.  Yuri's car pulls away and Ava's car follows. \nNICOLAI (confused) Where are we going, Mama? \nAVA It's a game. \nNICOLAI Like hide and seek? \nAVA Yes. \nEXT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  DAY. \nYURI locks his storage locker, observable from the street, and exits the facility carrying a passport and briefcase. \nYURI (V.O.) I can always sense when I'm being tailed.  I know what to look for.  But then I'd never been tailed by the woman I love. \nReturning to his car, Yuri fails to notice that AVA has witnessed his routine from her own car. \nInstead of following the car, Ava exits with Nicolai. \nINT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  DAY. \nAVA, NICOLAI in tow, approaches Yuri's locker. \nShe tries a combination - fails.  Tries another - fails.  A third - same result. \nVITALY Jesus. \nVitaly comes to a horrific realization. \nHe hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader. \nVITALY Yuri, I need to talk to you. \nYURI Not now. \nVITALY (insistent) Now. \nYURI (to the Rebel Leader) Excuse me. \nVitaly draws Yuri out of earshot. \nYURI (irritated by the interruption) What? \nVITALY (anxious whisper) We can't do this deal. \nYURI (incredulous) The fuck we can't. \nVITALY (referring to the camp) Look over there.  As soon as we leave, they're going to die. \nYURI (averting his eyes from the camp) It's not our business. \nVITALY (protesting) They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki. \nYuri flinches. \nThe suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr. approach the two brothers. \nREBEL LEADER What's the hold up? \nYURI (trying to keep his poise) There is no hold up.  I'll be right there. \nYuri draws Vitaly further away. \nYURI (cont'd) Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't control what they do. \nVITALY Today we can.  They're right there - close enough to touch. \nYURI (angry, impatient) What do you think they'll do if we back out - they'll kill us. \nVITALY And if we go ahead - they'll kill them. \nThe Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving. \nREBEL LEADER What is he saying? \nYURI Nothing. \nVitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down. \nVITALY (resigned) Nothing.  You're right, Yuri.  You're right. (getting his head back in the game) Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades?  I thought it was 1,200 grenades.  I'd better check. \nYuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table. Vitaly heads for the trucks. \nFor once we follow Vitaly.  Andre Jnr. regards Vitaly warily. \nINT.  TRUCK.  DAY. \nThe prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades.  VITALY is prying open the lid. \nAndre Jnr. appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip. \nANDRE JNR. What are you doing? \nVITALY Something for Yuri. \nANDRE JNR. Step away - slowly. \nVitaly closes the lid - a ruse.  He picks up the hammer and in one sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing his jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll. \nVitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and bowls it into the truck. \nHe runs. \nThe truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre Jnr. \nYuri's head whips around.  The Rebel Leader's head whips around. \nYURI Vit!! \nVitaly dashes for the second truck. \nThe REBEL LEADER opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire - still trying to run with legs torn to shreds. \nYURI (cont'd) No!! \nA second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing.  Vitaly's legs betray him.  He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust. \nANATOLY \"Crimean Restaurant\". \nYURI (O.C.) Papa? \nAnatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without another word he passes the phone to IRINA.  ANATOLY walks away. \nIRINA (into phone) Both my sons are dead. \nINT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY. \nCLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by VALENTINE.  The Agent can scarcely contain his excitement. \nYURI sits at the small table, stares at the slug. \nVALENTINE One of yours? \nYuri doesn't take the bait. \nTwo other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the interrogation. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) (referring to a document) Curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure. \nYURI (shrug) Maybe he did. (referring to the slug) If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have heart failure. \nThe flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his temper in check. \nVALENTINE We performed the autopsy and released your brother's body to your family.  You tried to do something decent, Yuri.  You went against your nature.  And now it's cost you. (unable to resist) Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral. \nYURI Falsifying a death certificate?  That's not going to hold me. \nVALENTINE You're right, as usual. \nYuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) (putting a copy of the New York Times in front of Yuri) Have you seen today's paper? \nA front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuri's documents including his five BRIEFCASES.  The headline reads, \"MERCHANT OF DEATH IN CUSTODY\". Caption - \"Catalogue of carnage.\" \nVALENTINE (cont'd) (pacing, lauding it over Yuri) Fake end-user certificates, cut-out companies, all meticulously catalogued. There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot anywhere in the world you aren't on first name terms with. (producing another evidence bag containing Ava's diamond earrings and an engagement ring) Your trophy wife gave us the prize.  She also provided us with these - which we suspect are conflict diamonds. \nYuri takes all this in. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) She has agreed to testify against you. \nYuri nods - picks up the newspaper.  But instead of reading about his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World Affairs - various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium. \nYuri reads, takes his time.  Valentine cannot believe his audacity. \nFinally Yuri reacts.  A broad smile - his killer smile. \nYURI Enjoy it. \nVALENTINE (confused) What? \nYURI This.  Tell me that I am everything you despise, that I am the personification of evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that I am a one man genocide.  Say everything you want to say to me now - because you don't have long. \nValentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor. \nVALENTINE Are you not paying attention or are you delusional?  You've broken every arms embargo written.  There's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences.  You'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time. \nYuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned.  His attitude further angers Valentine. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) You don't seem to fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation! \nYURI (snapping back - his emotion finally showing) My family has disowned me.  My wife and son have left me.  My brother is dead.  Trust me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.  But I promise you I won't spend a single second in a courtroom. \nValentine laughs derisively. \nVALENTINE You are delusional. \nYuri is still unfazed.  He leans forward to close the deal. \nYURI I like you, Jack.  Well, maybe not.  But I understand you.  You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded.  But you haven't counted on the people who gave you that badge. \nValentine's turn to hesitate. \nYURI (cont'd) (meeting Valentine's gaze) Let me tell you what's going to happen so you can prepare yourself. \nYuri nods to the interview room door. \nYURI (cont'd) Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you're going to be called outside. \nA montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by his commentary. \nINT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY. \nA knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE. \nYURI (O.C.) In the hall there will be a man who outranks you. \nINT.  HALLWAY - JAIL.  DAY. \n", "test1_input": "YURI (V.O.) Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes. \nINT.  LEAR JET.  DAY. \nYURI and AVA sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the customized cabin drinking Cristal champagne. \nYuri glances through Vogue magazine - a photo spread on Ava.  Ava takes in the plane's sumptuous appointments. \nYURI (pretending to be impressed with the photos) I had no idea. \nHe hands her back the magazine. \nYURI (cant'd) I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.  You must think me very rude. \nAVA Don't apologize.  I put on clothes for a living. \nYURI (wry grin) At least you aren't taking them off. \nAVA (smiling at his irreverence) I would be if half the photographers had their way. (shrug) But I can't complain.  I'm paid to say, \"Cheese\". (meeting his gaze) What about you? \nYURI Nothing so glamorous.  I'm in transport - international air freight mostly. \nAVA What, like UPS or something? \nYURI Something like that. \nAVA (glance to her champagne flute) Business is good. \nYURI Like you, I can't complain. \nThey both drink.  A thought occurs to Ava. \nAVA But if you did? \nYURI Well...I don't know. (reluctant admission) It's just that I travel all around the world but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm going nowhere. \nAva regards him closely.  He's echoed her thoughts.  Yuri pours Ava another drink. \nYURI (cont'd) Here's to... (raising his glass) ...a hurricane. \nThey toast. \nYURI (cont'd) Without it, I'd never have met you. \nShe meets his eye. \nAVA This is no accident, is it, Yuri? \nYuri freezes - doesn't answer. \nAVA (cont'd) It feels like fate. \nYURI (never averting his eyes) I don't believe in fate. \nAVA What do you believe in? \nYuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss. Ava does not pull away. \nINT.  LEAR JET - BEDROOM.  DAY. \nCLOUDS rush by the faces of YURI and AVA, heads close to the plane's oval windows. \nThey make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the jet. \nThe camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows, and the clouds begin to rain. \nEXT.  ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY. \nConfetti.  YURI and AVA run through the paper shower as they descend the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach. \nYURI (V.O.) We married in a synagogue to make my father happy.  In the eyes of my Catholic mother, it was worse than living in sin. \nYuri and Ava kiss his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA. \nAs the happy couple reaches the limousine, VITALY - out of rehab and out of his mind - fires an AK-47 into the air as a salute. \nThe GUESTS drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are Yuri and Vitaly. \nYuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet. \nYURI (explaining to the guests) It's traditional. \nVITALY (meekly echoing the remark -joke badly misfired) Traditional. \nThe guests nod, uncertain. \nYURI (cant'd) One more time, Vitaly. \nVitaly lets go another burst. \nYURI (cont'd) (reassuring word as he whisks Ava into the car) I'm sorry.  I should have said something. \n", "test1_true": "YURI carries AVA over the threshold of their new home to cheers of the assembled GUESTS. \nANATOLY and IRINA gape in amazement at the grand house.  They draw their son aside. \nANATOLY (touching his yarmulke) Always remember, son, there's something above you. \nYURI (looking up, gently joking) Sure, Dad.  A forty-thousand dollar crystal chandelier. \nAnatoly forces a smile.  Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand. \nYURI (cont'd) Mom, we don't need anything. \nIRINA You need this. \nIrina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away. \nYuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY. \nA newborn baby boy, NICOLAI, plays in the wrapping paper of opened gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree. \nNew York - December 25, 1991 \nYURI (V.O.) I was still living way beyond my means, mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to payoff another.  Anything to keep Ava in the style to which she had, thanks largely to me, become accustomed.  Then suddenly all my Christmases came at once. \nA family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts.  Baby Nicolai wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel. \nANATOLY (to Irina, regarding a nativity scene on a Christmas card) Jesus was Jewish.  You're worshipping a Jew. \nIrina ignores him.  She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from Tiffany's. \nIRINA Ava, this is too much. \nAVA Yuri likes to spoil you. \nNicolai crawls an inch.  AVA beams proudly. \nAVA Nicki!  You did it.  Good boy! \nANATOLY That's my grandson. \nAva looks around for Yuri. \nAVA (calling out) Yuri.  Don't you want to see what your son is doing? \nNo reply.  Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head. \nA loud shout from the other room. \nYURI (O.C.) Tak!  Tak!  Tak-fucking-tak!  (subtitle: Yes!) \nAva scoops up the baby.  With Anatoly and Irina, they go to investigate. \nOn the television, MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, is making his famous speech, officially ending the Cold War. \nYuri kneels in front of the TV as if it is an altar. \nANATOLY What the hell's the matter? \nYURI It's over!  It's over! \nAVA What's over? \nYURI The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire.  Mikhail's saying \"no mas\".  He's throwing in the towel.  It's over. \nYuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the TV. \nAVA That's nice. (referring to Nicolai) Your son is crawling. \nYuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark. \nHe gazes at the TV, revelling in the plan taking shape in his head. \nLATER \nIn the living room, AVA and IRINA play with NICOLAI.  YURI and ANATOLY drink Johnnie Walker Black label. \nANATOLY (contemplating the day's events) At least there'll be religious freedom. \nYURI I think I'll go back for a visit. (trying to sound casual) Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri? \nANATOLY (face lighting up) Dmitri Volkoff?  Now and then. \nYURI How is he? \nANATOLY The luckiest man alive.  You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl.  Off-duty, at his daughter's wedding, he was roaring drunk.  He was the only one who survived. Later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation. \nYURI He's still a General in the army? \n", "test1_id": 2367, "test2_input": "Yuri looks away, knows where this is going. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) You may ask, why do I bother to do that?  I can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your company.  And you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive.  No. The reason I delay you for every second of the permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims.  I don't think of it as taking a day from you but giving a day to them.  Some innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free. \nValentine looks to his watch. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five minutes. \nValentine walks away.  Yuri is left to ponder the notion. \nWe see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs, eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals.  Finally the time lapse slows back into real time. \nValentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents. \nVALENTINE You'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co-operative than you. \nValentine opens the back of the Jeep.  Lying in the back, the bodies of the two PILOTS shot and stripped. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) The locals got to them before we could. \nYuri turns away from the sight.  His handcuffs are removed. \nReturning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and NICKI in the wallet. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) Handsome family. \nValentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away. \nEXT.  HIGHWAY.  DUSK. \nYURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo plane is now just another carcass in the jungle. \nA CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color: U.N. white.  The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to a stop.  A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE. \nVIVIAN (pleasantly surprised) Yuri!  Yuri Orlov! \nYURI (giving her an embarrassed hug) Vivian... \nVIVIAN What are you doing here? \nYURI (approaching the window) You know.  Fighting the good fight. \nVIVIAN An aid program? \nYURI Uh, yes.  In fact, I've just had some transport problems.  You couldn't give me a ride to Monrovia, could you? \nVIVIAN Sure.  Climb in. \nYuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar. \nVIVIAN (cant' d) We're pulling out.  It's too dangerous. It's a shame.  We were really doing some good things. \nYuri nods in understanding. \nINT.  HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM.  NIGHT. \nA weary YURI enters his room.  Sitting on the green sofa - bound and gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood - SIMEON. \nYURI Jesus!  Simeon! \nANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the door, laughing at his shocked reaction. \nYURI (cont'd) Andre!  What in heaven is he doing here? \nANDRE JNR. A gift for you. \nYuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes. \nANDRE JNR. (cont'd) You got here just in time.  I was afraid he would die before you got a chance to kill him. \nHe offers Yuri a Beretta. \nYURI Me?! \nANDRE JNR. Who do you think informed on you - cost you your plane?  He came to meet my father, hoping to take your place. \nYuri spits on Simeon. \nYURI You stupid old fuck! \nANDRE JNR. (knowing smile) He killed your man when he tried to kill you. \nAndre again offers Yuri the Beretta. \nYURI No. \nANDRE JNR. (confused) You want us to let him go? \nYURI No.  No.  I... \nAndre offers him the gun a third time.  Yuri refuses it. \n", "test2_true": "Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his own hand over Yuri's. \nANDRE JNR. We'll do it together.  A bonding experience. \nAndre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the terrified Simeon - eyes pleading. \nYuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong. \nANDRE JNR. You can stop if you want - but you do.  Just say the word. \nAndre stares at Yuri not Simeon. \nANDRE JNR. (cont'd) Say, \"stop\". \nYuri opens his mouth but no word comes.  Andre presses Yuri's finger onto the trigger. \nThe gun goes off.  A splash of blood across the sofa's green upholstery. \nThe gunshot echoes around the room.  Simeon is very dead. \nYURI (quietly) Stop. \nAndre smiles. \nANDRE JNR. (surveying the blood-spattered room) I'll get you another room with a nicer view. \nINT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY. \nYURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately pours a line of cocaine in full view. \nYURI hoovers it up. \nYURI (V.O.) I started doing a lot of cocaine in West Africa.  I wasn't medicating myself.  I was simply playing catch-up.  I was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals. It's just a matter of etiquette.  It's rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics. \nThe Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER - no more than eighteen years old. \nBARMAN He bought you \"brown-brown\", Mr. Yuri. \nYURI (wiping his nose) What? \nBARMAN \"Brown-brown\". \nYURI What is it? \nBARMAN (laughs) A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder. \nYURI What does the gunpowder do? \nBARMAN It's magic.  They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything. \nYURI Some other time. \nBARMAN You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri. \nThe Barman starts chopping another line. \nYURI Why? \nBARMAN (laughing) Because it's your gunpowder. \nSure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm shells into the cocaine. \nThe SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder, intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down.  Yuri has no option, does a line. \nHe washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass to the fighter. \nThe Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song.  Yuri picks out one of the PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing. \nHe drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS. \nTo Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes. \nThe music stops.  Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room. \nYURI (to no one in particular, whipping his vodka bottle off the bar) I'm going for a walk. \nEXT.  MONROVIA.  NIGHT. \nA MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE.  [A MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-OF- SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES] \nYURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his bottle. \nA ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA \nYURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of him, moving back and forth.  The gyrating stops. \nYuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on his back, a prostitute on top of him.  She gets to her feet, adjusting her dress. \nYuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself. \nYURI (a mixture of French and English) I didn't fuck you, did I?  Did I fuck you? \n", "test2_id": 2368, "test3_input": "YURI, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway.  He drops the case. \nYURI Ava, what's wrong?  Where's Nicki? \nAVA (still with her back to us) He's with your parents. \nYuri senses something very wrong. \nYURI Why aren't you dressed?  I thought we were going out. \nHe finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her.  She pulls it off her shoulders. \nAVA (turning back to look at him) I can't wear the clothes.  I can't wear the jewelry.  I can't drive the car.  I can't live in this house.  Everything1s got blood on it. \nYuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window. \nYURI Don't be so melodramatic. \nAva pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window. \nAVA Of course I'm melodramatic.  I'm a failed actress, remember?  We need to talk about it. \nYURI Why?  We never have before. \nAVA Now we do. \nYuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table. \nYURI These people - you can't trust them-- \nAVA --I've talked to your parents.  Why do you think they don't want your money?  They know where it comes from.  We all know. \nYuri sighs, resigned. \nYURI I sell people a means to defend themselves, Ava.  That's all.  I don't hold a gun to any one's head and make them shoot-- \nAVA --Yuri, I see the news.  Sierra Leone-- \nYURI --I don't sell machetes. \nAVA --What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes?  I see the pictures.  Yuri, the guns are bigger than the boys. \nYURI (angered) There's nothing illegal about what I do. \nAVA I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong. \nAva meets his eye. \nAVA (cont' d) I can accept the drugs.  I can even accept the other women.  I can't accept this. \nYuri looks away. \nAVA Please stop. \nYURI (looks back) It makes no difference if I stop.  Someone will take my place the next day. \nAVA Let them.  We have enough.  You're not that little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread-- \nYURI --It's not about the money. \nAVA What is it? \nHe doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one.  Ava looks out of the window at their expensive view. \nAVA (cont'd) I feel like all I've done my whole life is be pretty.  All I've done is be born.  I'm not just a failed actress.  I'm also a failed writer, failed artist, failed businesswoman.  I'm not much good as a mother.  Come to think of it, I'm not even that pretty any more.  I've failed at everything, Yuri. (turning back to him) But I won't fail as a human being.  I'm leaving. \nThe words finally register with Yuri. \nYURI You can't leave.  I'll stop. (as if trying to convince himself) I'll stop. \nAva is skeptical.  He holds her, reassures her. \nYURI (cont'd) I've been thinking about it for a while.  A lot, lately. (as if trying to convince himself) I'm making more from the oil and timber anyhow. (further reassurance) I'll stop. \nShe interrogates his eyes for the truth. \nAVA (pleading eyes) You will?  You promise? \nYURI (deadly serious) Yes. (changing the subject a millisecond too fast) Now get dressed.  We'll go out. \nAva picks up the dress off the bed. \nYuri gazes at her. \nYURI (cont'd) By the way, you're wrong about not being pretty any more. \nShe turns back and smiles. \nEXT.  FIFTH AVENUE AT CENTRAL PARK EAST.  DAY. \nA YOUNG INTERPOL AGENT, carrying a tray of coffee, approaches a plain panel van parked outside Yuri's apartment building. \n", "test3_true": "The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS, wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device.  The agents read porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine. \nYURI (V.O.) No wonder Valentine was confused. \nINT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DUSK. \nYURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone. \nFor once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber. \nYURI (V.O.) Thank God there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries. \nWith the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen.  He tosses the pendant down a trash chute. \nBack in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone call. \nYURI (V.O.) But the only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make.  The margins are too low.  Too many people are doing it. \nFinally we are privy to the conversation. \nYURI (into phone) --Impossible.  Two and a quarter?  I can't make a profit at two and a quarter.  Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you? \nYuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window. \nValentine's panel truck drives away. \nLATER \nNight has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace of lights.  Yuri continues to stare out of the window. \nHe is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of his building. \nBefore he can make sense of it, the house phone rings. \nAVA enters. \nAVA (confused) Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the lobby. \nYuri, stunned for a millisecond, recovers with a smile. \nYURI (glance to his watch) He's early. \nINT.  LOBBY - UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY. \nANDRE BAPTISTE is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror. \nANDRE JNR. is flirting with two TEENAGE GIRLS - residents of the building.  The perplexed DOORMAN stares at the motorcade outside his door - flashing lights on the police escort. \nANDRE JNR. (to the girls) --You should come to Liberia with me tomorrow.  It is beautiful this time of year. \nTEENAGE GIRL Liberia.  Is that on Long Island? \nYURI, ashen-faced, hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate lobby - strides up to Andre Snr. \nANDRE JNR. Yuri! \nYURI (nervous as hell) What the fuck are you doing here, Andre? \nANDRE BAPTISTE (hugging Yuri) We're here for the peace talks at the U.N. \nYURI (pulling him out of earshot of the curious Doorman, anxious whisper) So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?! \nANDRE BAPTISTE Is that what you still are?  You're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden. \nYURI I-- \nANDRE BAPTISTE --But now you mention it, we are doing a little shopping while we're here - that is if you open for business. \nYURI (anxious look past Andre to the motorcade on the street) They've got to be watching. \nANDRE BAPTISTE (disdainful shrug) Of course they blame me.  They always blame me.  They are on a-- \nYURI (unable to resist) --hunt for a witch? \nANDRE BAPTISTE (a smile, for once correcting Yuri) \"Witch-hunt\".  But I have been granted diplomatic immunity due to the escalation in hostilities. (conspiratorial) That is why I need you.  They are making life difficult to re-supply.

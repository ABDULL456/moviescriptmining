{"test1_input": "LORD OF WAR \nWritten by \nAndrew Niccol \nFADE UP \nCLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV. \nLate-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie. \nBlack smoke wafts in front of his face.  He speaks matter-of-factly, directly into camera. \nYURI There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation.  That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.  The only question is... (taking a draft and stubbing out the cigarette) ...how do we arm the other eleven? \nThe camera zooms away from his face, revealing: \nYuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood. \nThe faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on the wind. \nCUT TO: \nA TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET. \n- Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on top. A BULLET is born.  A perfect 39mm. \n- The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome. \n- The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER, is tossed into a crate. \n- The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest.  He seems to stare directly at our BULLET. \nUKRAINIAN OFFICER (to his SUBORDINATE carrying a manifest, in Ukrainian) Call it \"agricultural machinery\". \n- The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN. \n- The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in the cold grey Odessa harbor.  A container door closes, plunging the bullet into darkness. \n- The door re-opens.  The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea. \n- The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast.  The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship. \n- BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a mud-clogged road in lush rainforest. \n- The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone - immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier. \n- The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted into an AK-47 machine gun. \n- The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.  Suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire. \n- The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired. \n- Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action? \n- Smack.  The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel. \n- Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into bright sunshine.  It is flying down the main street in Freetown. \n- The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of it.  They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild- eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47 almost as tall as he is. \n- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks. \n- Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly relieved. \n- The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness - the bullet's final resting place. \nCUT TO BLACK \nEXT.  ODESSA - MAIN STREET.  DAY. \n\"Towards A Brighter Socialist Future\", reads a billboard in the main street. \nOdessa, U.S.S.R - 1980 \nFifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame.  He spies a long line snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store. \nYURI (V.O.) I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of Odessa in a country that no longer exists. You might have heard of it - a little place called the Soviet Union. \nA YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat, poring over a Communist text.  Yuri approaches, pretends to be interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book. \nYURI (in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over the idealist's shoulder) All property is theft. \nThe Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit.  Yuri pats his comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's red neckerchief and Lenin pin. \nINT.  GROCERY STORE.  DAY. \nNow wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the store. \nYURI (V.O.) Where I grew up, everyone was equal.  Some were just more equal than others. \n", "test1_true": "Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under the counter.  In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves, the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi. \nINT.  APARTMENT - ODESSA.  DAY. \nA Soviet-style apartment building.  Front door opens - YURI enters, shopping bag in hand. \nHis mother, IRINA, pokes her head out of the kitchen.  Yuri holds up a banana. \nYURI (in subtitled Ukrainian) Shortages?  What shortages? \nIrina shakes her head in amazement. \nINT.  APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.  DAY. \nWhile a parade of weapons in Red Square plays silently on the state- controlled TV, father ANATOLY and Military Cadet older brother VITALY, shoulder bandaged, sit at a tiny table, drinking cheap vodka and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio - coat hanger for antenna. \nYURI (V.O.) My father was a wounded hero of World War Two, my younger brother was wounded in Afghanistan - a war without heroes.  I'd gotten out of military service due to a heart problem - it wasn't completely a lie. \nYURI joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast. \nHe goes to pour himself a glass of vodka.  Without looking away from the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip, preventing him from lifting the bottle. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (impossibly upper-crust British accent) --Finally, in response to human rights protests and in an effort to encourage the United States to sell grain to the Soviet Union after two successive crop failures, it is reported that the politburo has consented to permit a limited number of Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel. (beat) And that concludes this edition of news from the BBC World Service. \nAnatoly, deep in thought, switches off the radio.  IRINA enters, puts Yuri's \"feast\" on the table. \nThey speak Ukrainian, subtitled. \nANATOLY (incredulous) Trading Jews for grain. \nVITALY (reaching for a banana) It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics. \nIRINA (shrugs) Good for the Jews. \nYURI And us. \nAll eyes to Yuri, family confused. \nYURI (cont'd) (matter-of-fact) We're Jewish. \nVITALY (scoffing) We're not Jewish. \nYURI (shrug) We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish. \nThe stunned family stares at him - out of the mouths of babes.  Anatoly finally breaks the silence, pours Yuri a drink. \nANATOLY Mazeltov. \nYuri and the family drink to their new identity. \nEXT.  CEMETERY, ODESSA.  DAY. \nA sea of Jewish gravestones. \nYURI and ANATOLY bribe the cemetery CUSTODIAN. \nYURI (V.O.) There have been few occasions in the twentieth century when it's been an advantage to be a Jew. \nUnder his father's watchful gaze, Yuri takes a rubbing from one of the headstones - \"ORLOV\". \nINT.  UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICE.  DAY. \nANATOLY, with YURI at his side, presents the rubbing along with other crudely forged paperwork confirming their Jewish ancestry to a CLERK.  \"ORLOVITCH\" now \"ORLOV\". \nYURI (V.O.) The rubbing from the Jewish headstone was my first forged document.  Little about my life has been kosher ever since. \nThe Clerk gives Anatoly and Yuri the once-over, then stamps an emigration visa. \nINT.  APARTMENT, BEDROOM.  NIGHT. \nSuitcase in hand, YURI surveys his bedroom for the last time. \nA car horn.  He glances through the window to the communist-style plaza below.  ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri.  VITALY and IRINA load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI. \nYuri stares at himself in the mirror.  He replaces his stolen Soviet pin for a necklace - a Star of David. \nINT.  BEN GURION AIRPORT - TEL AVIV.  DAY. \nCLOSE UP on a heavily-retouched photograph of GOLDA MEIR.  She's still not pretty. \nYURI stares up at it. \nYURI (V.O.) We Russian Jews were supposed to be headed for Israel but I didn't see much of the country on that first trip. \nWe reveal he is standing in a jam-packed, standing-roam-only \"TRANSIT\" lounge. \nYURI (V.O.) Real Jews or fake Jews, eighty-five percent of us ended up in that other \"promised land\". \nThe Pan American destination board reads: \"PA 447 to NEW YORK\". \nEXT.  BRIGHTON BEACH - \"LITTLE ODESSA\".  DUSK. \n", "test1_id": 2367, "test2_input": "YURI (V.O.) Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes. \nINT.  LEAR JET.  DAY. \nYURI and AVA sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the customized cabin drinking Cristal champagne. \nYuri glances through Vogue magazine - a photo spread on Ava.  Ava takes in the plane's sumptuous appointments. \nYURI (pretending to be impressed with the photos) I had no idea. \nHe hands her back the magazine. \nYURI (cant'd) I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.  You must think me very rude. \nAVA Don't apologize.  I put on clothes for a living. \nYURI (wry grin) At least you aren't taking them off. \nAVA (smiling at his irreverence) I would be if half the photographers had their way. (shrug) But I can't complain.  I'm paid to say, \"Cheese\". (meeting his gaze) What about you? \nYURI Nothing so glamorous.  I'm in transport - international air freight mostly. \nAVA What, like UPS or something? \nYURI Something like that. \nAVA (glance to her champagne flute) Business is good. \nYURI Like you, I can't complain. \nThey both drink.  A thought occurs to Ava. \nAVA But if you did? \nYURI Well...I don't know. (reluctant admission) It's just that I travel all around the world but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm going nowhere. \nAva regards him closely.  He's echoed her thoughts.  Yuri pours Ava another drink. \nYURI (cont'd) Here's to... (raising his glass) ...a hurricane. \nThey toast. \nYURI (cont'd) Without it, I'd never have met you. \nShe meets his eye. \nAVA This is no accident, is it, Yuri? \nYuri freezes - doesn't answer. \nAVA (cont'd) It feels like fate. \nYURI (never averting his eyes) I don't believe in fate. \nAVA What do you believe in? \nYuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss. Ava does not pull away. \nINT.  LEAR JET - BEDROOM.  DAY. \nCLOUDS rush by the faces of YURI and AVA, heads close to the plane's oval windows. \nThey make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the jet. \nThe camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows, and the clouds begin to rain. \nEXT.  ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY. \nConfetti.  YURI and AVA run through the paper shower as they descend the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach. \nYURI (V.O.) We married in a synagogue to make my father happy.  In the eyes of my Catholic mother, it was worse than living in sin. \nYuri and Ava kiss his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA. \nAs the happy couple reaches the limousine, VITALY - out of rehab and out of his mind - fires an AK-47 into the air as a salute. \nThe GUESTS drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are Yuri and Vitaly. \nYuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet. \nYURI (explaining to the guests) It's traditional. \nVITALY (meekly echoing the remark -joke badly misfired) Traditional. \nThe guests nod, uncertain. \nYURI (cant'd) One more time, Vitaly. \nVitaly lets go another burst. \nYURI (cont'd) (reassuring word as he whisks Ava into the car) I'm sorry.  I should have said something. \n", "test2_true": "YURI carries AVA over the threshold of their new home to cheers of the assembled GUESTS. \nANATOLY and IRINA gape in amazement at the grand house.  They draw their son aside. \nANATOLY (touching his yarmulke) Always remember, son, there's something above you. \nYURI (looking up, gently joking) Sure, Dad.  A forty-thousand dollar crystal chandelier. \nAnatoly forces a smile.  Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand. \nYURI (cont'd) Mom, we don't need anything. \nIRINA You need this. \nIrina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away. \nYuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY. \nA newborn baby boy, NICOLAI, plays in the wrapping paper of opened gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree. \nNew York - December 25, 1991 \nYURI (V.O.) I was still living way beyond my means, mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to payoff another.  Anything to keep Ava in the style to which she had, thanks largely to me, become accustomed.  Then suddenly all my Christmases came at once. \nA family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts.  Baby Nicolai wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel. \nANATOLY (to Irina, regarding a nativity scene on a Christmas card) Jesus was Jewish.  You're worshipping a Jew. \nIrina ignores him.  She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from Tiffany's. \nIRINA Ava, this is too much. \nAVA Yuri likes to spoil you. \nNicolai crawls an inch.  AVA beams proudly. \nAVA Nicki!  You did it.  Good boy! \nANATOLY That's my grandson. \nAva looks around for Yuri. \nAVA (calling out) Yuri.  Don't you want to see what your son is doing? \nNo reply.  Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head. \nA loud shout from the other room. \nYURI (O.C.) Tak!  Tak!  Tak-fucking-tak!  (subtitle: Yes!) \nAva scoops up the baby.  With Anatoly and Irina, they go to investigate. \nOn the television, MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, is making his famous speech, officially ending the Cold War. \nYuri kneels in front of the TV as if it is an altar. \nANATOLY What the hell's the matter? \nYURI It's over!  It's over! \nAVA What's over? \nYURI The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire.  Mikhail's saying \"no mas\".  He's throwing in the towel.  It's over. \nYuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the TV. \nAVA That's nice. (referring to Nicolai) Your son is crawling. \nYuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark. \nHe gazes at the TV, revelling in the plan taking shape in his head. \nLATER \nIn the living room, AVA and IRINA play with NICOLAI.  YURI and ANATOLY drink Johnnie Walker Black label. \nANATOLY (contemplating the day's events) At least there'll be religious freedom. \nYURI I think I'll go back for a visit. (trying to sound casual) Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri? \nANATOLY (face lighting up) Dmitri Volkoff?  Now and then. \nYURI How is he? \nANATOLY The luckiest man alive.  You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl.  Off-duty, at his daughter's wedding, he was roaring drunk.  He was the only one who survived. Later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation. \nYURI He's still a General in the army? \n", "test2_id": 2368, "test3_input": "YURI (hesitates, he's actually forgotten) The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of them repeatable in polite company. \nValentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of its weapons.  An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint. \nYURI (cont'd) (noting to the gun in his ribs) The new MP-5.  Do you need a silencer for that? \nValentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation. \nVALENTINE The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso.  Nice.  Did you type it yourself? \nYURI It's for humanitarian missions. \nVALENTINE You're a humanitarian? \nYuri shrugs - why not? \nVALENTINE (cont'd) (not buying it for a second) This is a killing machine. \nYURI Not any more. \nDMITRI (in broken English) Listen to the nephew. \nIt's true.  Yuri has had the armaments detached. \nYURI Didn't you get the memo?  The war's over. What can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use? \nDMITRI What, yes? \nYURI (trying to lighten the mood) The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you. \nValentine's face hardens at the flippant remark. \nStill at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in the convoy.  Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy. \nVALENTINE (referring to the missiles) Also going to Burkina Faso? \nYURI (pointing to the document) But to a different client at a different address. \nValentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself. \nVALENTINE What do you take me for?  A complete fucking fool? \nYURI (eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to his throat) Not complete, Sir.  And while I hesitate to tell you your job, I must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices. \nVALENTINE (incredulous) You expect me to believe this is a coincidence? \nYURI I can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime. \nValentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than he imagined. \nValentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the line.  He finally holsters his gun. \nVALENTINE (tosses the documents on the road) Yuri Orlov.  You and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other. \nYURI I can hardly wait. \nVALENTINE (climbing into his Jeep) Watch out for the time you don't see me. \nYuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away. \nBOY (perfect American accent) What an asshole. \nYuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making. \nEXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY. \nYURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter.  Checking the empty trucks, he is just in time to see SIMEON and his HENCHMEN climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away. \nAs he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact. \nYuri looks for DMITRI, exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his hip flask as usual, the worse for drink. \nYURI (referring to the departing Simeon) What was he doing here? \nDMITRI (zipping his pants) Trying to beat your offer.  I sent him on his way.  He doesn't understand the concept of loyalty. \nDmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks. \nDMITRI (cont'd) Speaking of loyalty, too many people know. I have to make pay-offs. \nYURI Don't worry.  There're more VCR's.  I left them in your new car. \nDmitri's face lights up.  Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL. \nDMITRI Even your enemy was admiring that car.  I am the luckiest man alive. \nDmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri.  Yuri watches Dmitri walk to the car and climb in for a test drive. \nA look of realization on Yuri's face. \nYURI (screaming to Dmitri) Dmit--!!! \n", "test3_true": "Recovered from the blast, Yuri runs up to the burning car but is beaten back by the flames. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  DOCKS.  NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON a bent Mercedes medallion, now worn around the BOY's neck. He regards it forlornly. \nYURI, numb, still carrying Dmitri's hip flask, makes a call from a payphone. \nINT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - MANHATTAN.  DAY. \nA darkened bedroom.  AVA is fast asleep in her bed, curled up with NICOLAI. \nThe phone rings.  Half-asleep, Ava reaches for it. \nAVA (still groggy) Yes, I'll accept the charges. \nWe cut between the two sides of the conversation. \nYURI Ava-- \nAVA Hey, baby. (glancing to a clock - 3am) You forgotten what time it is? \nYURI Sorry.  I, er... (talking about anything other than what's on his mind) How was your audition? \nAVA (resigned smile) They're going in another direction.  The direction of someone who can act. \nYURI Don't say that.  You're good. \nAVA And you're biased. \nAva grabs her robe - goes to the balcony so as not to disturb Nicolai. \nAVA (sensing something amiss) Where are you?  Is everything okay? \nYURI Rough day at the office. \nAVA Come home.  We miss you. \nYURI Soon. (more desperate than he intended) How's Nicki? \nAVA Asleep in our bed.  It's lonely without you. \nFrom a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire - MOBSTERS firing at other MOBSTERS escaping in a car. \nYuri tries to cover the phone but Ava overhears. \nAVA (cont'd) Yuri, what's that? \nYURI A party. \nAVA It's always a party where you are. \nMore gunfire interrupts. \nYURI I'd better go.  I just wanted to call--hear your voice.  Kiss Nicki for me. \nAVA I love you. \nBut Yuri has gone. \nEXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY. \nThe freighter slips out of the harbor. \nYURI (V.O.) In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of arms have been stolen and re-sold.  One of the greatest heists of the 20th Century. \nEXT.  DOCKSIDE - MONROVIA.  DAY. \nCrates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting trucks under YURI's supervision. \nYURI (V.O.) The primary market was Africa.  Eleven major conflicts involving 32 countries in the past decade - a gunrunner's wet dream. \nYuri sizes up the MILITIAMEN loading the arms. \nYURI (V.O.) My best customer was self-declared president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste.  Even though we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet him again.  He'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him.  His seven-year civil war has been described as \"a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man's capacity to visit the abyss.\"  That kind of sums up Andy for me. \nAs the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock. \nThe car slides to a stop beside Yuri.  It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an earring and a facial tattoo.  Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy cheerleader uniforms. \nANDRE JNR. Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior.  My father would like to meet you. \nYURI Thank him but I have other business.  A busy schedule. \nANDRE JNR. It is not optional.  My father is easily offended. \nYuri ponders for a moment.  The machete in the Bodyguard's hand makes up his mind. \nYURI What do you know?  My schedule just freed up. \n", "test3_id": 2369}

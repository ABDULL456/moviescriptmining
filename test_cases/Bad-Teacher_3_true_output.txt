SANDY Speech! Speech! 
AMY Although leaving was a difficult choice... Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to continue. 
AMY (CONT'D) When the superintendent personally asks you to work at one of the worst schools in the state, you say yes. I'm looking forward to bringing my brand of zany energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for learning to the underprivileged students at Malcolm X High. I welcome the challenge. The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic. Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches. 
ELIZABETH Here, I got you this. Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it. Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her. 
SCOTT Hey, Stranger. (then, whispers) Listen, now that Amy's transferring, maybe the two of us could go grab a drink. 
ELIZABETH 
SCOTT 
Elizabeth walks out. 
CUT TO: 
CHYRON: THREE MONTHS LATER 
EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY 
Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot. And as her bare leg steps out of the car, we 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 
The hallway is empty. We FOLLOW Elizabeth from behind, and as she reaches for the door to her class, we 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE on each desk, just as Amy did earlier. Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face, from the year before. The bell RINGS. Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE 
BREASTS. Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the students as they reconnect with friends and share stories about summer camp. She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders. bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn. 
EIGHTH GRADE BOY Do me! Do me! Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles. Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees Elizabeth and runs over. 
ELIZABETH You and Chase, huh? She likes the poetry? 
GARRETT She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity. But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around here! 
ELIZABETH Easy. 
GARRETT Well, I should get going. See you around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice... He points at her breasts. 
ELIZABETH 
(TOUCHED) Thanks! You're the first student to notice. Garrett smiles and walks off. Lynn walks by. She's cleaning another big stain from her shirt. 
LYNN Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer? 
ELIZABETH It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic surgeon, actually. He's amazing. 
LYNN He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him? The internet? 
ELIZABETH No, in recovery. And I looked like ass, so I know it's real. 
LYNN Sounds like a fairy tale. 
ELIZABETH It is. Storybook. Well, not total storybook. It's a little messy because his wife filed for divorce last week, but we're gonna get through that. 
(THEN) So you want to grab lunch later? 
LYNN Sure! My treat. 
ELIZABETH No, you got it last time. We'll split it.

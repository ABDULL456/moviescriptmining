DAVID This is a transcript of the proceedings at Nuremberg. A Swedish businessman, Birger Dahlerus, testified in cross- examination that he had several meetings with Hermann Goering. 'I first saw Goering,' Dahlerus testified, 'embroiled in a stormy interview with Wilhelm Furtwängler, the famous conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, who was vainly seeking permission to keep his Jewish concert master. 
Holds up his package of letters and dumps them on Emmi's desk. 
DAVID Emmi, pick one of these, any one, read it out loud. 
Emmi is uncertain. Steve shrugs indifferently. 
She picks an envelope and takes out the letter. 
EMMI (reading) 'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.' 
DAVID And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them. 
STEVE (smiling) How many times have I got to tell you I was in insurance? You think I can't smell a phoney policy when it's shoved under my nose? Sure, he helped Jews, but that was just insurance, his cover, because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed, (turning on Furtwängler) See, Wilhelm, I think you're their boy, their creature. You were like an advertising slogan for them: this is what we produce, the greatest conductor in the world. And you went along with it. The truth of the matter is, Wilhelm, you didn't need to be a member of the Party. I made a mistake when I asked you for your Party number. I should've asked you for your non- Party number. Just like some other well-known artists. (suddenly, to Emmi) Emmi, put that record on. 
Emmi puts on the record of the Adagio from Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. After a moment: 
STEVE Do you know what that is? 
FURTWÄNGLER Of course I know what that is. 
STEVE Okay, so what is it? 
FURTWÄNGLER Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio. 
STEVE Who's conducting? 
FURTWANGLBR I am. 
STEVE You know the last time it was played on these air waves? 
FURTWÄNGLER How can I know such a thing? 
STEVE I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them. 
The music plays. 
FURTWÄNGLER (near to breakdown but struggling for control) I have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely. In staying here, I believed I walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows. You seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged. 
David takes the record off. 
FURTWÄNGLER I didn't directly oppose the Party because I told myself, that was not my job. If I had taken any active part in politics I could not have remained here. But as a musician, I am more than a citizen. I am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies. I know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of Buchenwald and Auschwitz than words. 
An uncontrollable surge of anger wells up in Steve, causing him to pace alarmingly. He grabs the baton from his desk, stands trembling before Furtwängler, and snaps it in half.

Overcome with rage, Nick PUNCHES Kurt in the arm then rushes to the door. Dale and Kurt hurry after him. 
125 ANGLE ON HARKEN 125 
seeing them go. With a grim look, he calmly heads to the garage. 
126 INT. KURT'S CAR - MINUTES LATER 126 
Nick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives. Dan fiddles with the tape recorder in the back. 
KURT Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak, weak man. I admit it. 
From the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder: 
KURT (V.O.) In here? But all those people are right outside. 
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) I know. That makes it even hotter. 
We hear unbuckling and unzipping. 
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Your balls are so smooth. 
KURT (V.O.) I wax them. 
DALE Is there anything you don't wax? 
Kurt shrugs. We hear some WET, SMACKING SOUNDS. 
(CONTINUED) 126 CONTINUED: 126 
NICK Ugh. Turn it off, Dale! 
KURT (V.O.) Oh yeah... oh shit! 
MRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Whoops. That was fast... 
KURT (QUICKLY) Yeah, Dale, turn that off! 
127 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 127 
A short distance behind a car is following Kurt's. As it comes closer we see it's a Porsche. And it's driven by a determined-looking Harken. 
128 EXT. KURT'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER 128 
Kurt's car turns the corner and stops short. 
129 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 129 
From the guys' POV we see an unmarked car and a police squad car parked outside of Kurt's place. Hagan and Samson stand with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS. 
KURT (O.S.) Holy shit! They must have found my DNA. 
NICK (O.S.) Turn around! Get us out of here! 
130 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 130 
Kurt quickly does a U-turn and ZOOMS off in the direction they came, inadvertently SPEEDING through a red light. We see a traffic camera FLASH. 
131 INSERT - A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH 131 
clearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted with panic. 
132 INT. KURT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 132 
KURT Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again. Probably ever. 
DALE What?! 
KURT I'm sure they have cops at all our places. I think our best bet is to get out of the country. 
NICK Where are we going to go? 
KURT Mexico? 
DALE Everyone flees to Mexico. That's the first place they'll look. 
KURT You're right. What about Asia? We could become kick boxers. 
NICK What the fuck are you talking about? 
KURT What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment? What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers? 
NICK What if I was destined to smack you right in the face? 
KURT That seems like a lesser destiny.

These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect and burns away from us. 
INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY 
The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple. 
THE OPERATIVE (into a com) Forget the pulse beacon, there has to be another way to track the ship -- get a read on the nav sat. It's a registered transport, you must be able to locate -- 
ENSIGN (O.S.) Sir? 
THE OPERATIVE Have you found a nav sat trajectory? 
ENSIGN (O.S.) Sir... we've found seven. The Operative looks more unhappy than angry. 
THE OPERATIVE (to himself) Does he think this is a game? 
EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle- holes in her head -- makes her way through them. Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes in to one system, one planet... She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see: 
INT. LAB - CONTINUING 
Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in formal dress. They stare at her, impassive. We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face -- 
INT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY 
And River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her eyes narrow with intent. 
INARA (V.0.) We have every reason to be afraid. 
INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING 
JAYNE Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal? That ain't so hard -- 
MAL He didn't beat me up -- 
INARA Because he's a believer. 
INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP, A DARK CABIN 
As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs. Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters. 
INARA (V.0.) He's intelligent, methodical and devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do. 
INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING 
INARA I honestly think the only reason we haven't been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her. 
SIMON Needs to see her why? 
INARA I'm uncertain. I would say to be sure of the kill, but... I just know he'll kill us all to get to her. 
JAYNE So no hope of a reward, huh? 
ZOE Did he mention a deal of any kind? 
IWO 
MAL (looking at Simon) Give the two of them up. Go my way. 
JAYNE Which you was all ready to do not a day ago. What went sour? 
MAL Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over. 
JAYNE That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm about to become is having trouble telling the difference. 
SIMON (to Inara) Did he say anything about a "Miranda"? 
INARA What is that? 
MAL Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind. Conjure it might be the reason he's after her. 
INARA You think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the Alliance?

DAVID I can't do it. 
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT 
Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at another. 
Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He observes David impassively. The sawing stops again. 
DAVID Finished. 
ALEX But not quite. 
DAVID Is that going to be deep enough? 
Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards David. 
ALEX Don't you worry about that. 
DAVID Is this necessary? 
ALEX Yes. Now come on, all or nothing. 
Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who gestures as if to say, "On you go.' With revulsion on his face, he raises the hammer above his head. 
INT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY 
David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his pillow. 
He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling. There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in. 
JULIET Are you all right? 
DAVID (without looking at Juliet) Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine. 
JULIET Would you like to talk about it? 
DAVID No. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
Alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer. Newspapers lie scattered at his feet. 
INT. LOFT. DAY 
The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, letting in a pool of light. 
INT. HALL. DAY 
David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it on up to David. 
JULIET Be careful. 
ALEX Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me? 
JULIET Stop nagging.

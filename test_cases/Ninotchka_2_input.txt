LEON (helpfully) But I can throw it out of the window. 
NINOTCHKA (philosophically) It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street. (she pushes back the lid) There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels.... 
LEON ...but big. 
NINOTCHKA ...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone? 
LEON Who cried that one? 
NINOTCHKA Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market. 
LEON Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!" 
From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds it in front of her. 
NINOTCHKA (the economist now) First ten thousand serfs... now just Gaston. It is very encouraging. 
Leon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe. 
LEON Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look. 
NINOTCHKA They belong to the people. 
LEON (in a ceremonial voice) I give them back to the people... (as formal and steady as possible under the conditions he puts the diadem on her head) I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People! 
Ninotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary coronation. 
NINOTCHKA Is this the wish of the masses? 
LEON It is their wish. 
NINOTCHKA Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses. (in a low voice) Can I make a speech now? 
LEON Please. 
Ninotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage. 
NINOTCHKA Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry? (mixing reality with fantasy) Let us be happy... give us our moment.... (turning to Leon) We are happy, aren't we, Leon? 
LEON (fondly) Yes, sweetheart. (he holds her in his arms) 
NINOTCHKA (her voice getting dimmer and dimmer) So happy and so tired. 
She falls asleep in his arms. Leon gathers her up and carries her into the bedroom, the diadem still on her head. 
BEDROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE 
Leon carries Ninotchka to the bed, puts her down on it. She is now sleeping soundly. He kisses her once more and then turns, the CAMERA PANNING with him, and starts toward the door to the corridor and exits. As he closes the door with an uncertain hand, it slams. 
CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she lies on the bed 
On the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern- faced Lenin. The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka for a moment. Completely content and happy, she turns around and sees the disapproving face of the photograph. 
NINOTCHKA (charmingly) Smile, little father, smile. 
INSERT OF PHOTOGRAPH OF LENIN 
The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we... 
FADE OUT: 
AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS -- DAY 
FADE IN ON: 
IN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to twelve. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM OF THE ROYAL SUITE 
It is taken from an ANGLE which includes the door. The lights are still on, the curtains drawn, the empty champagne bottle and glasses litter the room. We hear the buzzer of the corridor door ring several times without an answer. 
CAMERA moves through the door into the bedroom, never disclosing the bed. The lights in the bedroom are still lighted also and the curtains drawn. CAMERA stops on the door from the bedroom to the corridor. The buzzer rings. Apparently the caller has moved from the living-room door to the bedroom door. 
CLOSE SHOT OF THE BED 
Ninotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress. The diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis is laid on that detail in the camera angle. We hear the sound of the buzzer ringing again and again. Ninotchka half wakens and calls out something which sounds like "come in" without being fully aware of what she is doing. 
BEDROOM -- AT THE DOOR 
The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit. Swana looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room. She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not enough awake to face reality. Swana is delighted to have surprised Ninotchka in this condition. 
SWANA (ironically) Good morning. 
NINOTCHKA (awakening gradually) What? 
SWANA It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana. 
By now Ninotchka is awake. She gets up and realizes to her acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found her.

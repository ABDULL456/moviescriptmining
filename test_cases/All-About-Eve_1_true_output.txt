ADDISON Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts. (his glance is attracted by Eve coming downstairs) Ah... Eve. 
EVE (deferentially) Good evening, Mr. deWitt. 
MARGO I had no idea you knew each other. 
ADDISON This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing... 
MISS CASWELL That's how you met me. In passing. 
MARGO (smiles) Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington... (the two girls say hello) Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time- 
ADDISON (murmurs) It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it... 
MARGO You've heard of her great interest in the Theater- 
ADDISON We have that in common. 
MARGO Then you two must have a long talk- 
EVE I'm afraid Mr. deWitt would find me boring before too long. 
MISS CASWELL You won't bore him, honey. You won't even get to talk. 
ADDISON (icily) Claudia dear, come closer. (she does, and he points) This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good. 
MISS CASWELL (sighs) Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits? 
ADDISON Because that is what they are. Go make him happy. 
Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for Max. Addison puts Eve's arm in his. 
ADDISON (to Margo) You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands. 
MARGO Amen. 
Eve smiles uncertainly at Margo as he leads her away. Margo looks after them. She downs her drink... 
INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
It's many Martinis later. Most of the guests have gone. The party has reached that static state - everyone's assumed more or less permanent places. 
Birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee. CAMERA FOLLOWS her to the piano where Margo sits on the bench beside the pianist. He is just finishing "Liebestraum" and she stares moodily into a Martini. Birdie halts beside her with the coffee. Margo looks up. Birdie holds out the coffee. Margo takes the onion out of the Martini, drops it into the coffee and waves Birdie away. Birdie goes. "Liebestraum" comes to an end. The pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated rhythm. Margo stops him. 
MARGO (quietly) "Liebestraum." 
PIANIST I just played it. 
MARGO Play it again. 
PIANIST But that was the fourth straight time. 
MARGO Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count. 
PIANIST No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum." 
MARGO "Liebestraum." 
PIANIST Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine... 
MARGO My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum." 
Unhappily, he plays "Liebestraum." Margo sips her Martini, stares down into it again. Bill tiptoes up. 
BILL (whispers) Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out? 
MARGO (somberly) It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up. 
BILL (trying to kid her out of it) Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow? 
MARGO You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural. 
BILL Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side? 
MARGO If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home. 
Bill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up. 
MAX Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house? 
MARGO (sympathetic) Poor Max. Heartburn? (Max nods) It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn. 
BILL No heart to burn. 
MARGO Everybody has a heart - except some people. (she finishes her drink, stands up) Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you. 
MAX (touched) Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends. 
MARGO I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry. 
She takes off. Max waits to set Bill straight. 
MAX She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded. 
He starts off after Margo. As the CAMERA PANS with Bill we see Margo going into the pantry with Max following her. Bill joins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs.

ANTHONY I knew it. 
MARK And so I left this building and I just started walking. And I walked all the way out of town. And then I walked into the desert and I fell asleep under a tree. 
ANTHONY I don't do well with other people's life changing events. 
MARK And when I woke up I found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground. So I started digging. And I unearthed a very old and ancient box. Probably, oh... about... seven hundred years old. And inside the box... (holding up manuscript) ... was this. 
Mark places his muddy, dirty, manuscript down on Anthony's desk. Anthony is scared to touch it. 
ANTHONY What is it? 
MARK It's a never-before-heard historical event from the past. 
ANTHONY When does it take place? 
MARK The 1300's. 
The excitement drains from Anthony's face. 
ANTHONY I told you we're not interested in Black Plague movies here, Mark. 
MARK This one isn't about the black plague. Well it isn't just about the black plague. Let me read you some of this. 
Anthony rolls his eyes. 
MARK Anthony, get excited about this. This is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before. It's a great human discovery. 
ANTHONY Yeah, but is there a movie there? 
MARK The greatest movie Lecture Films has ever made. 
Anthony's eyes widen. 
ANTHONY Start reading. 
Mark picks up the manuscript and opens the first page. 
MARK (READING) On the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred. It began as a day much like any other. The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry. But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon. 
Anthony's mouth drops to the ground. 
ANTHONY What?! 
Mark smiles. Anthony picks up his phone and presses "intercom". 
ANTHONY (ON PHONE) I want everyone in here now! We've got a BIG ONE. 
Anthony hangs up. 
ANTHONY Please, Mark. Continue. 
MARK (READING) As the smoke cleared, the door to the spaceship opened and inside, were hundreds of beautiful, half naked alien women. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The room is filled with people now, all of them hanging on every word Mark reads from his manuscript. Even Rob and Shelly lean against the back wall, their minds blown by the story Mark is telling. 
MARK (READING) And then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian Alien Women all in one sweeping motion. The earth was saved. Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry by alien king Xardon. It was to be the First Human-Nude Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared. All of Babylon and Mars were invited to join in the celebrations. 
People around the room wipe tears from their eyes. 
MARK (READING) The wedding was held on a brisk summers day on Mars, with all of the survivors of the Great Ninja War and the Black Plague present. They feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion. (MORE) 
MARK (cont'd) The moment the bride and groom kissed, King Xardon performed a mind-wipe on all of the humans, thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds, and sent them back to Babylon. For seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day, a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison, would stumble upon them in the desert, after being fired by his shit boss Anthony and mocked by Rob and Shelly, two huge douche bags. Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success, and Mark would become very wealthy and famous from it. The End. 
The entire room bursts into applause. Not just normal applause, but massive, epic applause. 
Everyone crowds around Mark, hugging him, touching him, blown away by the magnanimity of the moment. 
ANTHONY Mark, tell us what it's called. 
Mark thinks it over for a moment and looks right at Rob. 
MARK (to Rob) The Black Plague. 
Rob sneers. Everyone "aahs" and claps again.

WALTER I'm not here very often. I live in Connecticut. 
ARAB WOMAN Is Tarek here? 
WALTER No. He's...uh...he's not here. But please come in. 
Mouna hesitates. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Please. 
ARAB WOMAN Thank you. 
Mouna walks into the apartment. She stands by the door. 
WALTER I'm Walter. Walter Vale. 
ARAB WOMAN I'm Mouna Khalil. I'm sorry to show up unannounced but my son calls me everyday. He has not called me now for five days. I have tried his cell phone but he does not answer. 
WALTER Would you like to sit down? 
MOUNA Thank you. 
Mouna sits. 
WALTER Would you like something to drink? Coffee or water? 
MOUNA No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale? 
WALTER Tarek was arrested. He's being held in a detention center in Queens. They are trying to deport him. 
MOUNA Where is Queens? 
WALTER It's not far from here. Twenty minutes. 
MOUNA You have been there? 
WALTER Yes. I saw him yesterday. He's OK. 
MOUNA How did this happen? 
WALTER He was stopped in the subway station. He didn't do anything wrong. 
MOUNA I would like to go there. To Queens. 
WALTER OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer mentioned that...I don't think that you can... 
MOUNA I know I can't visit Tarek, Mr. Vale. I just want to see where they are holding him. 
WALTER OK. I can take you if you'd like. 
MOUNA Thank you. 
WALTER Let me get my coat. 
Mouna nods. Walter leaves. Mouna breathes deeply in an attempt to control her emotions. She looks around the apartment and spots Tarek's drum. The sight of it is almost enough to push her over the edge.

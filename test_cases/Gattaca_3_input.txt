EUGENE Where are we going? 
JEROME (slightly guilty) I'm sorry.  I've got plans. 
EUGENE (feigning hurt) Again? 
JEROME (referring to his bandage) She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong. 
EUGENE I'm sure you'll be very convincing. 
Jerome ignores the remark. 
EUGENE Where are you taking her? 
JEROME Michael's. 
Eugene looks at him askance. 
JEROME Everybody goes there. 
EUGENE (incredulous, glancing around the room) You may as well invite her here. 
JEROME (afterthought as he picks up his jacket) Will you be okay? 
EUGENE Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself. 
JEROME (seeing through the bravado) We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer. 
EUGENE How long? 
JEROME By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?" 
EUGENE I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer. 
INT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT. 
IRENE and JEROME step off the dance floor of the smoky, decadent dinner club and take a seat at their table.  Irene is agog at the strange assortment of PATRONS, the cigars, the laden dessert trolleys.  It is all slightly off from the pristine world she is accustomed to. 
IRENE What is this place? 
JEROME (wry smile, enjoying her fascination) You've never been here? (a dessert trolley is wheeled up) Let me order for you. 
Jerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley.  Jerome savors a spoonful.  Irene is tempted but then remembers herself. 
IRENE I'd better not. 
She reaches for her elegant pill box.  Jerome takes another spoonful. 
JEROME So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even know what it tastes like, Irene? 
Irene goes to deny it but cannot. 
MICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow. Irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table immediately hoovered.  Michael whispers in Jerome's ear. 
MICHAEL Take the side door. 
Jerome looks up in time to see DETECTIVE HUGO coming through the front entrance with several other DETECTIVES. 
DETECTIVE (to his colleagues) Check for lenses, hairpieces-- 
A Detective shines a flashlight in the eyes of a MALE PATRON. A SECOND DETECTIVE tugs the hair of a SECOND PATRON.  Jerome takes Irene by the hand and escorts her out of the side exit. Several other COUPLES make for the parking lot. 
IRENE Why are we leaving? 
JEROME (attempting to explain the hasty exit) Those checks take forever. 
EXT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB - SIDE ALLEY.  NIGHT.

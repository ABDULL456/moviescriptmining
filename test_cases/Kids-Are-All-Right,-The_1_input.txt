JONI Yeah...totally...thank you. 
Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug. 
PAUL Really nice to meet you, Laser. 
LASER Yeah. 
Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up by the meeting. 
INT. JONI'S CAR - DAY 
Joni and Laser head back home. 
JONI I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?... LASER I guess... 
JONI You guess? 
LASER Yeah... JONI God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad! 
LASER I know. 
JONI Well what did you think of him? LASER I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house. 
JULES Hey bug, come here. We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda." LASER I saw it.    It was gnarly. NIC Where are you going? 
LASER Clay's. 
Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look. 
NIC Don't be back late, okay? 
LASER I know. JULES Can I have a hug before you go? 
LASER Mom... JULES Just a quick one.   Please! 
LASER Hug her.    That's what she's there for. 
Laser leaves.   Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules. NIC Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already. 
JULES What?    "Are you and Clay fucking?" 
NIC "Exploring" is the word I'd use... 
JULES And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care?

Pitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand. 
JACK 
JACK Ahhhhhh!!!!! 
A gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of ice and snow. 
PITCH AAAHH!!!! 
EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT 
Jack free falls back to Earth, unconscious. 
NORTH Jack! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 76. 
Tooth quickly rescues him and sets him back down in the sleigh. 
TOOTH Jack, how did you do that? 
JACK (REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS) I, I didn't know I could. 
EXT. BURGESS FOREST - NIGHT 
Pitch pulls himself laboriously from the mud and weeds amongst the trees where he's crash-landed, oddly, he seems delighted. 
He looks up to see a BRIGHT GLOW -- North's SNOWGLOBE PORTAL. The sleigh zooms into it and it WINKS OUT. 
Pitch shakes the FROST from his arms as scores of Nightmares swarm behind Pitch, regrouping after the blast. Pitch, at the center, seems as pleased as can be. 
PITCH Finally! Someone who knows how to have a little FUN!

SEQ. 1700 - GUARDIANS REGROUP 
INT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY 
We're in the midst of a somber ceremony, marking the passing of Sandy. Burning candles line the perimeter of Sandy's stone emblem. 
Tooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with North and Bunny. The three hold hands in solace. 
The ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout the chamber, as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge. 
INT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack, facing a window, FROSTS OVER THE GLASS with his finger to form a symbol of Sandy. North slowly walks up behind him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 77. 
NORTH Are you alright? 
Jack remains still, his eyes fixed on the image of Sandy. 
JACK I just, I wish I could've done something. 
NORTH Done something? Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us. 
JACK But Sandy wo-- 
NORTH (putting his hand on JACK'S SHOULDER) Would be proud of what you did. 
Jack pulls back his hoodie and stands up. 
NORTH (CONT'D) I don't know who you were in your past life, but in this life you are Guardian. 
JACK But how can I know who I am, until I find out who I was? 
NORTH You will. I feel it, in my belly. 
Jack and North approach the globe which is losing lights at an alarming rate. 
TOOTH Look how fast they're going out. 
JACK (GETTING IT) It's fear. He's tipped the balance. 
Jack drifts up closer the globe. He looks at the lights going out, then back to the Guardians. There's a nervous tension in the room. 
BUNNYMUND (twirling his boomerang) Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks. Come on! We can still turn this around! (MORE) Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 78. BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) Easter is tomorrow and I need your help. I say we pull out all the stops and we get those little lights flickering again! 
CUT TO: 
INT. NORTH POLE - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 
A massive wooden door swings open; North leads Jack and the Guardians through the doorway, into an elevator, and through his factory. 
NORTH Bunny is right. (TO BUNNY) As much as it pains me to say old friend, this time Easter is more important than Christmas! 
BUNNYMUND Hey! Did everyone hear that?! 
NORTH We must hurry to the Warren. Everyone, to the sleigh! 
BUNNY Ohh no, mate. My warren my rules. Buckle up. 
Bunny directs the groups attention to the ground. He taps his foot and a rabbit hole opens up under their feet. 
NORTH Shostakovich!

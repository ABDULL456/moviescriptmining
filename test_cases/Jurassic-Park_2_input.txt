HAMMOND Dinosaurs. (superbly proud) I've been cloning dinosaurs! 
CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face. 
Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale model of the entire resort. 
HAMMOND Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not a resort, not a scien tific conservatory, just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting. 
Hammond grins with delight. 
GENNARO At least every rich child. 
Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in. 
CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river. 
HAMMOND Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! 238 fabulous creatures so far! 
TIMMY Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want to just kill each other? 
Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up. 
HAMMOND Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. There are monitors every hundred feet whatever we could plant them on the island.  A computer to tabulate it all. 
ELLIE You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the right to do that? 
HAMMOND I didn't create them.  I found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber. 
GRANT We don't have the science.  There's no source of dinosaur DNA. 
Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly. 
HAMMOND Yes ... there is. 
INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY 
Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them. 
They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up with an x-ray-like image of his hand and each door HISSES open. 
CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath: 
HAMMOND Glitches. 
Hammond tries again. 
INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room. In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow. 
Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him, typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN. 
Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the ringmaster. 
HAMMOND And this is the right side of my brain. The entire park is safely controlled from here.  John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m aster control operator. (with genuine concern) John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me. 
ARNOLD Oh, you'd survive just fine without me. 
Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at Hammond, who ignores him. 
HAMMOND Everything's controlled from here. Remote everything. Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this.  We run this place with twenty workers.  This computer does it all.  And it polices each and every single animal out there. 
ELLIE (whispers to Grant) Who polices the computer? 
Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large video screen faces this chair. 
HAMMOND That's where I will watch the astonished watchers.  Okay, let's go. 
They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again. 
NEDRY Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond. 
ARNOLD Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible. 
NEDRY Right. 
BACK ON HALLWAY - 
Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked: CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm. 
TIMMY That stuff turns you into a mutant! 
He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in Lex pulls on his pocket. 
HAMMOND Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal precautions. 
Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in. 
HAMMOND My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and Timmy's someday. 
INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION 
Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares. 
Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged and numbered.

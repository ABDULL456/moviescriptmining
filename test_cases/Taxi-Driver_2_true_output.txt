CREDITS 
CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The snow has melted, it is spring. 
A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre district. 
Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the poor and common is also falling on them. 
The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and green lights reflects off the pavements and autos. 
"When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" - so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please. 
Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so glittering.  The rain also falls on the street bums and aged poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners, hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service them too. 
All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner. The listener is at a safe but privileged distance. 
After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife, CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is assumed that this taxi is being driven by TRAVIS BICKLE.

CUT TO: 
Travis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service". 
We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain has not let up. 
An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her umbrella.  Travis waits a moment, then pulls away from the curb with a start. 
Later, we see Travis' taxi speeding down the rain-slicked avenue. The action is periodically accompanied by Travis' narration. He is reading from a haphazard personal diary. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) (monotone) April 10, 1972. Thank God for the rain which has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks. 
TRAVIS' POV of sleazy midtown side street: Bums, hookers, junkies. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) I'm working a single now, which means stretch-shifts, six to six, sometimes six to eight in the a.m., six days a week. 
A MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT hails Travis to the curb.

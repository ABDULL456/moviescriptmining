INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY 
Duncan is curled up in the corner of a bare cell with padded walls. He is in a strait-jacket. His head is shaved. We can't tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A ROOM - NIGHT 
This is the children's bedroom in Dr. Mandrakis' house of six years ago. It is dark. Two small beds occupy one corner of the room. We can see two small lumps on the beds, but no more. 
Duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap. He is dialing a number. The phone rings three times before it is answered -- or rather, picked up, because there is no voice on the other end. After several seconds the phone is hung up. 
Duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment. He picks up the phone and dials again. This time he gets a busy signal. He hangs up, stands and goes to the door. He opens it slowly, peers out. Jill's voice can be heard faintly talking to the operator, asking for the police. 
Duncan closes the door and comes back into the room, mumbling. He goes to the window, looks out. Then he goes to the children's beds. 
CLOSEUP - DUNCAN 
As he raises the covers and stares down into the CAMERA. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DECK OF A SHIP - MORNING 
A freighter, broad and low, arduously cuts through the water. Early morning mist hangs over the deck which is empty but for a lone FIGURE standing on the prow. 
MIDDLE SHOT - LONE FIGURE 
It is Curt Duncan. He is looking out over the front of the ship. Another SEAMAN comes up behind him and claps him on the shoulder. 
SEAMAN So this will be your first time? (laughs) An old salt like you? 
Duncan moves away, wanting to be left alone. 
SEAMAN (still laughing; slightly punchy) You'll love it here. It's where they make the bombs. It's where they make the planes that carry the bombs; the planes we saw over Singapore and Manila. 
He walks away laughing. 
SEAMAN There she is. That's America. 
DUNCAN'S POV 
The coast of Southern California emerges through the mist. A foghorn blows somewhere in the distance. 
CLOSE-UP - DUNCAN 
As he peers ahead with inscrutable interest. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT 
Dark. A little BOY is lying in bed, apparently asleep. This is Curt Duncan as a child. 
Some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom. They are gruff, with heavy English accents, but subdued; a MAN and a WOMAN, well into middle-age. 
The boy's eyes open as he listens: 
MAN (O.S.) What's the matter? 
WOMAN (O.S.) Save it for later. Let's go out and get some food. 
MAN (O.S.) What about the lad? You can't leave him. 
WOMAN (O.S.) Curt's asleep. He'll never know we're gone. 
From outside, a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and turns. The bolt slips and the door is securely shut. 
The boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. In TIGHT SHOTS of the floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another. They make "chit-chit" noises as they begin to explore. One of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the bedpost. Then we see two more rats appear. 
We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed. The "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's apprehension turns to fear, then to terror. The boy starts to whimper.

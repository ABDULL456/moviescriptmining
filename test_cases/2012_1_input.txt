Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the ships. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson... 
INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY 
The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the European Ship. 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann? 
Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization... 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Anheuser looks on stoney faced. 
ADRIAN ... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? 
Laura watches him proudly. (CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. (PAUSE) Or at least I don't want to be part of it. 
Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm. 
ANHEUSER We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off. 
The Communications Officer looks at Adrian. 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) That's an order soldier. 
ADRIAN Don't do it! 
INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY 
The Russian President, together with the heads of state from China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Anheuser has had enough. 
ANHEUSER Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow. 
He's almost screaming now. 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?! 
Silence. 
Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now. 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives. 
All eyes are glued to Adrian. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why? 
Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) He died because we forgot to pick him up. (PAUSE) I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children? 
Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian. 
LAURA If my father were here, he would open the gates. 
Adrian and Laura share a look. 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.) The people of Russia along with... 
INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY 
His Asian colleagues nod in approval. 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ... China and Japan agree to open the gates. 
INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY 
The German Chancellor speaks up. 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister... 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR (O.S.) ... We vote to open the gates. 
Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat. Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian turns to the Captain. 
ADRIAN Captain Michaels, you heard them. 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY 
One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open. 
The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly! 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with Kate in a large bay on the other side. 
LILLY Phew... It stinks in here. 
Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in DISBELIEF-- 
A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks at her. 
TAMARA Sssh...Caesar. 
A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They are in the zoological bay.

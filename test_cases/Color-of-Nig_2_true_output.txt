Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He finishes the preceding reply. BILL Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from Hell. And then the red started to fade away. 
The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and then they become grey. 
LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY 
It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy. A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater. Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch. 
LARRY Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you. 
Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : «Patient's family sues Manhattan shrink» 
BILL Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I don't care to see the color of my patients' blood. 
LARRY I'm a little surprised that this happened to you. 
BILL Starts to stand up. Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a bitch. 
LARRY Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here. Bill laughs. Do you really believe that you're responsible for her illness. You were a small recent part of her life. 
BILL Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that easily. 
LARRY Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with anyone else ? 
Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey cat who is lying on the table. 
BILL No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of them want to love me LARRY Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage once. 
BILL She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody else to death. 
LARRY Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to deny emotion. 
BILL Oh yeah ! 
LARRY As you know, that could be very dangerous. 
Bill stands up. 
BILL Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get fixed. 
He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on. 
LARRY You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man like you to forgive himself. 
BILL I see you when I get back from Los Angeles. 
During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door. 
LARRY Don't run away because of one treatment failure. 
BILL I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up here, isn't it... He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it. Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me. 
ABOVE L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY 
Shot of L.A. seen from the sky, then shot of an airplane landing. On these two short shots, we hear : 
STEWARDESS Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain seated until the aircraft comes... 
The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed with the sound of a radio set in a car. 
VOICE IN THE RADIO Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender on 405, slowing thing down. 
TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY 
The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver. He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo shirt, jeans and sunglasses. 
TAXI DRIVER Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an accident !... Short shot of the accident. ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ? Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head. What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole ! 
BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY Bob's office is located in a big modern building in downtown L.A. A wide sitting room, called «Group Room» is reserved for group therapy sessions. Furniture is modern and functional, but with a little personal touch. Close-up of a woman's hand, who steals a lighter on a table. Then we see Sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse. She is dressed in a very elegant way, and wears expensive jewels. Richie, a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt, a sleeveless denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice counting the books on a shelf.

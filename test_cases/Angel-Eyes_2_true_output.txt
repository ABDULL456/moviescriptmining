She turns back to her father. 
SHARON How about you, Dad. Do you want me to leave? 
FATHER Up to you. 
SHARON Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome here? 
FATHER Jesus -- you're here, aren't you? What d'you want? 
SHARON I want to know! (then, quieting) Do you want me here? Do you love me, Dad? I want to know. 
The question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and the silence that follows breaks her heart. She nods toward his hearing aid. Her voice is close to a whisper, thick with tears. 
SHARON Do you... need to... check that again? 
FATHER I feel like... 
He can't finish it. 
SHARON What, Dad?   You feel like what? 
FATHER I feel like I don't have a daughter anymore. 
She takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes show the depth of the pain. She speaks quietly, softly. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON Well... you do. It's a shame you're going to miss knowing her. You're going to miss all that. 
And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking   back tears. The party goes on around her, oblivious.    She stops on her way to the door because she sees the   video crew moving, hunting the next guest -- and she   makes a decision and walks toward them, stops in   the light, faces the camera. 
SHARON I'm next. 
As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch.       Sharon speaks over a torrent of emotions. 
SHARON (to camera) Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations. 
We see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking into this, surprised, stopping still. 
SHARON Y'know... being in this house reminds me of something.  I was about ten, I guess, and Larry and I were playing aliens -- remember, Lar? We're making a lot  of noise, and Dad comes home from work tired and pissed off... CUT TO: 
HER FATHER 
watching this. Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring hard, Kathy wondering. INTERCUT their reactions during... 
SHARON 
SHARON We're yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into the room and says, what the hell are you doing? And I'm scared. I'm really scared. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON (CONT'D) And I say, we're playing alien invasion, Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, I'll show you a damn invasion, and he picks me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch. I hit that couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch, and then... then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we came to earth to kick ass, and I run at him and jump on him and he tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we're laughing so hard I almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and it was... it was great. It was great, and I'm never going to forget that. Never. And I miss that. I miss it. So I just... I wanted to tell you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks. That's all. (pause) Bye. 
She hands the microphone back and walks away as the surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother, Larry and Kathy follow her. She walks to the front door and leaves. 
EXT. POGUE HOUSE - DAY 
Sharon exits    and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr. look up from    his play. He smiles at her. She returns the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and so pleased. 
HER POV 
Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now. 
BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT 
as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him -- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her, until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on tight, eyes closed. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each other's eyes. 
CATCH Sorry, Shar.   For what I said. 
SHARON Me, too. 
In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house. 
CATCH Was it bad? 
SHARON They don't like me in there. 
CATCH Then they don't deserve you in there. 
She stares a moment more, still together. 
SHARON That's a nice thing to say. 
CATCH It's not a thing to say.   It's the truth. 
She can only look away, not wanting to cry. 
CATCH Why do you try so hard not to cry?

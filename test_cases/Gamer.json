Peace at last. \nBY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE. \nSIMON (cont'd) D'oh. \nThe instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless, GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo- fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE CAM: \nTwo men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun... \nSIMON (cont'd) What the fuh...? \n... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD. Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats. \nWhen the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN. \nIt's KABLE. \nA MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time - we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video prank earlier: \nwant to talk to him? \nThen, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wall: \nWALKIETALKIE.exe SIMON (cont'd) Um. \nCUT TO: \n54   EXT.

The GUARD stops moving. \nThe PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain. \nA group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners. They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive. \nIn a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes. \nThis takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider. \nPFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she draws out a little blood. \nKABLE yanks his hand back out. \nWOMAN (O.S.)

The ROOM is DARK - lit by the AMBIENT GLOW of a VIDEO SCREEN. \nGORGE Hi. \n57   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                               57 \nANGIE echoes, practically overlapping. \nANGIE Hi. \nWe will continue to CUT between the two locations. \nGUY So what's your damage? \nHe WINKS. \nANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE - then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY. \nGORGE/ANGIE You know, just hanging out. (beat) Looking to meet people. \nGUY Lucky you... \nCUT TO: \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 \n58   INT. DALE'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS                                   58 \nA CLOSE-UP of LIPS to match GORGE'S, but facing the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

Across the street a WOMAN has hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the sidewalk. \nGORGE/ANGIE I'm Nika. \nDALE/GUY I'm Dale. (looks her up and down) I like your fur. \nGORGE/ANGIE Do you want to go somewhere? \nShe strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time. \nDALE/GUY We are somewhere. \nHe WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the other. \nHe turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her; SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders... \nHACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least. \nKABLE Freak. \nFREEK is there. \nFREEK Tillmans. \nKABLE Who the hell is that? \nFREEK New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people... \n(CONTINUED) \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 62   CONTINUED: (2)                                                62 \nNow HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD gestures him to follow. \nHISPANIC GUARD (O.C.) Hey Kable. \nKABLE turns to look. \nHISPANIC GUARD (cont'd) Let's go. Upgrades. \nCUT TO: \n63   EXT. PRISON, TRAINING RANGE    - NIGHT                        63 \nKABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot. \nKABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET... \nWe see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES. \nHISPANIC GUARD Who aims? \nKABLE (caught off guard) What? \nHISPANIC GUARD Who aims... the slayer? Or the player? \nKABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN. \nKABLE Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye. \nHISPANIC GUARD That's tripped. \n(CONTINUED) \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 63   CONTINUED:                                                       63 \nKABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being grateful for the human interaction. \nKABLE Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. (beat) But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way. \nHISPANIC GUARD Why? \nKABLE There's a delay... \nHISPANIC GUARD Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping... \nKABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN. \nKABLE Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls - \nHe pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK. \nKABLE (cont'd) It's just me. \n64   INT. PRISON LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT                                   64 \nKABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP SLAYER. \nWe see now   the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in dark, ugly   BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has absorbed -   including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE AND YELLOW   from the most recent session. \nFrom down the row of lockers, a WHISPER: \nHACKMAN Hey. Kable. \n(CONTINUED) \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 64   CONTINUED:                                                       64 \nKABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away. \nKABLE Not interested. \nHACKMAN No. Wait. Look. \nHe brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD. \nHACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) I just deleted someone. \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 65   CONTINUED: (2)                                                     65 \nCASTLE Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con... \nCASTLE 2 Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect? \nCASTLE 3 (musing) His instincts give him an edge. \nCASTLE 2 And in the hands of a talented player... \nCASTLE 3 Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him. \nCASTLE 2 Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... (makes a throat slashing motion) You know, off camera? \nCASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2. \nCASTLE YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down. \nCASTLE 3 One thing I know is what makes people tick. \nSuddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He stares into the void, calm and utterly in control. \nThe CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 \n66   INT.

Kable, dude. It's me. \nKABLE shakes his head, thinking he's HEARING THINGS. \nKABLE Who? \nSIMON (O.S.) Simon. (beat) I'm playing you, dummy. \nKABLE knifes through the tunnel EXIT... \n68   EXT.

BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                            72 \nKABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy. \nA SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and scrambles for better cover. \nKABLE No. Pay attention to the game. \nThey spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN. \nTwo more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING. \nKABLE Are you kidding me? \nSIMON Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different. \n77   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/NEAR RESTRICTED AREA - MOMENTS      77 LATER \nKABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat. Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED. \nKABLE We should go that way. \nSIMON (O.S.) There's nothing there. \nKABLE Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple. \nSIMON (O.S.) (sarcastic) Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried. \nKABLE just grunts; his eyes steal a last look down the block. They head the other way... \nTHOOM. \nCLOSE RANGE: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL PASSES IN FRONT OF KABLE'S FACE... \nTime STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from the displaced air... \n(CONTINUED) \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 77   CONTINUED:                                                           77 \nthen, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building. \nKABLE is running. \n78   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3 - CRUSHED RIOT VAN                              78 \nSIMON (O.S.) ... shit shit shit! \nHe rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact still raining down... and then: \nFrom behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN. \nHACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S hand; it skitters across the concrete. \nSIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every move pings a step late... \nKABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control. \nHACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty, high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points the barrel at his    FACE. \nHACKMAN (friendly) Bye Kable. \nHe SQUEEZES the TRIGGER... \nThe SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP. \nThe LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down- cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD. \nHACKMAN (cont'd) What happened? \nCUT TO: \n79   EXT.

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/CRUSHED RIOT VAN - SIMULTANEOUS 80 \nKABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMAN'S BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel and throws him off. \nKABLE (to himself) Kid's gonna get me killed. \nSIMON (O.S.) (offended) Hey. \nKABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the mortar... session complete. \nKABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and speaks directly into SIMON'S ear: \nKABLE Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me. \nSIMON What the hell...? \nThis is unthinkable, dangerous talk. \nKABLE Turn me loose, kid.        You want to win, turn me loose. \nKABLE'S TRUCK HICCUPS - FUEL is on EMPTY, but still charging ahead. \n105   INT/EXT.

KABLE just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation. \nGORGE/ANGIE (cont'd) I'll do anything. \nKABLE Don't say that. \nGORGE holds out his hands; ANGIE'S fingers caress KABLE'S chest and move toward his crotch... \nKABLE (cont'd) Stop. \nHe pushes her hands away, gently. \nKABLE (cont'd) This isn't you. \nANGIE'S eyes WELL UP with TEARS. \nKABLE (cont'd) (trying to contain his RAGE) God damn it...

ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away. \nDon't you know, little fool, you never can win? Use your mentality, wake up to reality... But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP - before I give in Cause I've got you, under my skin... \nKABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to open up on the SLAYERS...

CRATERS and LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH rising majestically in the dark heavens. \nKEN CASTLE (cont'd) Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else... but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention...

It's dark, moody - only one bank of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on. \nAt the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in a FLEX BRACE. \nThe GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS. \nKEN CASTLE But mine's different. (taps his FOREHEAD) Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... (taps KABLE'S forehead ) your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it. \nCASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him... HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK. \nKEN CASTLE (cont'd) We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters... \nCASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over, picks up the ball and resumes shooting. \nKABLE (sarcastic) Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you. \n(CONTINUED) \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 159   CONTINUED:                                                       159 \nCASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER. \nKEN CASTLE You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me. \nHe sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY FROM HIS FACE. \nKEN CASTLE (cont'd) See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates... (KABLE coughs) Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser. \nBehind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently TURNS TOWARD US. \nKEN CASTLE (cont'd) A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do. \nHACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE KNIFE... \nKEN CASTLE(cont'd) For instance. \nKABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style. KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it - but leaving his face UNPROTECTED... \nHACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face, connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with a sickening POP. \nKABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT. \nANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at            * her and she FREEZES, paralyzed.

He claps a hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short... \nKEN CASTLE (cont'd) (freaked) What the hell was that? \nThe GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning. Not even KABLE understands this. \nPONYTAIL GEEK There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address. \nGEEK LEADER Someone on the outside is sending him commands... \nCUT TO: \n162   INT.

KABLE hammers on the pedal again, knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!! \nHe SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT. \nHACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points 50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up - \nBOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars. \nHACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the garage, disintegrating a concrete column. \nHACKMAN Fuuuuck!!!! \nHe slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving it in. \n94   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) - MOMENTS LATER      94 \nKABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and TAKES OFF... \nHe is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA. \n95   INT/EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING)                  95 \nThe FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture - now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA forward, next to the driver's window... \nThe CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head. \nSIMON (O.S.) Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!! \nKABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way, barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the window of a building. Bye, FLY. \nCUT TO: \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 \n96    INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  96 \nSIMON'S screen is filled with a GLITCHED OUT view of NOTHING, under a pile of glass and concrete. \nSIMON Um. \n97    EXT. SLAYERS RESTRICTED AREA - CONTINUOUS                       97 \nThe SUBMARINE ALARM is sounding across the BATTLEGROUND. KABLE is heading deep into RESTRICTED TERRITORY, slamming through and swerving around obstacles. \n98    INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                         98 \nWITHOUT WARNING: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of nowhere going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps going. \nKABLE (relieved) Ughh, that was the one. \n99    INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                99 \nSIMON is switching from CAMERA to CAMERA, trying to pick up a view of KABLE... finally he comes across a RUMBLING CHASE CAM, coming up on KABLE'S truck from behind... \n100   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING) - SIMULTANEOUS              100 \nThe CAMERA is mounted on a SNOWPLOW, one of a pair gaining on KABLE, slamming through rubble and debris. \n101   INT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                             101 \nKABLE spots them in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. \nHe SLAMS HIS HEAD against the steering wheel to clear it - despite the purge he's still pretty FUCKED UP. \nKABLE pops the driver's door and leans out, GETTING A BEAD on the nearest PLOW... \n102   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  102 \nFrom the SNOWPLOW'S POV we see KABLE leaning out, POINTING THE WEAPON AT US. Then big ass MUZZLE FLASHES: THOOM! THOOM! \n(CONTINUED) \nWHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 102   CONTINUED:                                                              102 \nSIMON Shit, shit, SHIT! \nA shell comes RIGHT AT US - the screen GLITCHES, FREEZES - and goes BLACK. \nSIMON (cont'd) I'm dead. \n103   EXT.

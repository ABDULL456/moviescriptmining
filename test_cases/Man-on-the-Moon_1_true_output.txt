INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Andy is packing up his things.  He very methodically folds each item of clothing, then checks the creases. 
George strolls up. 
GEORGE Hey, I really enjoyed your set. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Tank you veddy much. 
GEORGE So I understand you're from Lithuania? 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) No.  Caspiar. 
George is puzzled. 
GEORGE Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea. (beat) It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry. (beat) Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk. 
George hands him a BUSINESS CARD.  Andy reads it -- then his eyes pop.  He DROPS the accent. 
ANDY Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!! 
George realizes it's all been an act.  He laughs heartily. 
GEORGE Caspiar, huh?! 
CUT TO: 
INT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie waitresses in sandals.  Andy and George sit together, trying to get a sense of each other. 
ANDY You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world. 
George is surprised at this hubris. 
GEORGE People love... comedians. 
ANDY I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent. (he shrugs) I'm a song-and-dance man. 
George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril. 
George cringes.  He doesn't know what to say. 
A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD -- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy beams. 
ANDY (cont'd) Mmm!  I particularly recommend the Lotus root. 
Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands. Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles. 
George peers at the bizarre food behavior. GEORGE You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself? 
ANDY (bright) I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall. 
George is unsure if that's a joke. 
GEORGE Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny. 
Andy dips his silverware in the water glass.  Two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin. 
George stares, perplexed.  He looks back up -- and Andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils. 
Huh? 
ANDY See, I don't want easy laughs. 
Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent prayer.  George raises an eyebrow.  Andy snaps his head back up. 
ANDY (cont'd) I want gut reactions!  I want that audience to go through an experience.  They love me!  They hate me!  They walk out -- it's all GREAT! 
Andy triumphantly eats a bean.  George peers, unable to take the booger anymore.  He hands Andy a napkin and points to his nose.  Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box. 
ANDY (cont'd) After I'm famous, I can sell these as "Worn by Andy Kaufman." 
And at that... George is won over.  He smiles broadly. 
GEORGE You're insane. (then sincere) But -- you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy... let's do it. 
George warmly extends his hand. 
Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.  The men shake.  A moment of supreme importance. EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY 
The glitz strip of Los Angeles.  Money.  Beauty. 
INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY 
Real working showbiz offices.  No glamour at all.  It looks more like an insurance agency. 
George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone. 
GEORGE Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.  You'll be on the road... get some exposure... 
O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) Tony Clifton on the phone! 
GEORGE Who?

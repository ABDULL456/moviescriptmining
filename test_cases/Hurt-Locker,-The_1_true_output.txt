SOLDIER 1 --bodies. 
James turns to Cambridge. 
JAMES Why don't you wait here? We'll bring out anything of interest. 
INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING     LATE MORNING 
James, Sanborn and Eldridge enter a landing. The floor is very wet. They cross it, and come to a room that has been severely damaged by a bomb, with rubble everywhere and exposed electrical wires dangling from the ceiling, and busted pipes gushing water. 
A tea pot sits on a STOVE, steaming hot, and a plate on the table has bread on it. 
James bends the gushing pipe, stemming the flow of water to a trickle. Now the spitting wire hanging above the water pipe looks less ominous. But not by much. 
CORRIDOR 
They continue down a narrow corridor, light diminishing. They switch on the lights on their M4s. The corridor ends at a door. 
SANBORN This would be a great place to put a pressure activator. 
JAMES Yeah, with like twenty pounds of high explosives on it so you get anyone in the room when you open the door. 
ELDRIDGE Rope trick? 
Eldridge uncoils rope from his pack and hands it to James, who makes a lasso and tosses it over the doorknob. 
EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING 
James yanks the rope -- we follow the rope inside through the kitchen to the doorknob, watching it turn. No bomb. 
They head back in. 
INT DOOR/STAIRS BOMBED OUT BUILDING 
Ascending a staircase. James unstraps a flash grenade from his vest and heaves it onto the floor above. They stick their fingers in their ears... 
Blinding FLASH and DEAFENING sound. Then silence.   No movement. 
JAMES Guess no one's home. 
SOLDIER O.S. (WALKIE-TALKIE) Blaster One, what was that? 
JAMES (INTO WALKIE) Sorry, one of ours, just a flash grenade. 
They come to a landing that opens up to the second floor. 
SECOND FLOOR 
A large cavernous space filled with what looks like Santa's bomb making factory: A pile of motherboards. Batteries. Boom boxes. Electronics in various states of disassembly. In another corner, stacks of artillery shells. Blocks of C4 plastic explosives. 
In the back half of the room, there is a   work table, and on the table is a DEAD BODY of a young man,   wearing pants but no shirt. A JACKET draped is over its torso   and face. Even for these hardened EOD experts, the sight is   unnerving, and the copper smell of spilt blood and death is   staggering, sickening. 
James, Sanborn and Eldridge approach the body cautiously. 
James pulls a retractable aluminum pole from his pack and telescopes it to its maximum length, about 10 feet, and uses the pole to lift the jacket. Gently. The FACE appears. 
All that we can determine about this face is that it is young. The distinguishing lines of the nose and cheeks are so covered by bruises and blood and further obscured by the shadows and dappled light, that it could be the face of almost any young man. 
The violence done to the face exerts an odd pull on James. 
JAMES The kid at camp. 
SANBORN What? 
JAMES He sells DVDs. 
SANBORN No, that's not him. 
JAMES You see him every day. He sells DVDs by the mess tent. His name is Pele. 
SANBORN Different kid. 
ELDRIDGE This is sick. 
The dead young man's chest has been cut open. An artillery shell is shoved inside the cavity where the heart used to beat. Wires protrude from the shell. It's meant to be a booby trap, to be placed on a street and elicit as much damage as possible. 
SANBORN You seen a body bomb before? 
James shakes his head no. 
Sanborn moves closer to the body and inspects the wiring in the chest. 
JAMES Don't touch it. Let's blow it. 
JAMES 
Positioning three blocks of C4 on the body, then plugs blasting caps into the explosives. James nods to Sanborn and Eldridge, and they leave him alone with the body. 
James walks backwards out of the room, unspooling a roll of detonation cord as he goes. But before he gets to the door... 
SOLDIER O.S. (OVER WALKIE) Blaster, we've got a hold. I'm not getting airspace clearance. 
JAMES (INTO WALKIE) Copy that, How long? 
SOLDIER (O.S.) (WALKIE-TALKIE) Roger. Could be anything. At least 15 minutes is what they're saying. 
JAMES (INTO WALKIE) Can you -- you need to explain to them that we don't have 15 minutes.

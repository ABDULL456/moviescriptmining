KELVIN It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice. 
RHEYA It was obvious from the way he first looked at me. 
A beat.  He holds her. 
RHEYA Do I really feel like... I am...? 
KELVIN Yes.  Yes. 
RHEYA I'm glad. 
A beat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SOLARIS 
Turning, slowly. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed. 
KELVIN Everything you pursue, you end up becoming disinterested in.  The fact that you're good at everything you try makes it worse.  You have a degree in animal science, you could be a terrific vet. You drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist. Then it was politics, which seemed best of all, you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to achieve your goal.  And they didn't even know they were being arranged.  But you got bored with it, like you do with everything. 
She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a common observation and she's past being defensive about it. 
KELVIN I don't know what it's really like, to not know what you want to do. To not have anything that you love to do more than anything else. 
A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her cigarette at the moment. 
RHEYA (sarcastic) Imagine my frustration. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep. 
She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious, something we haven't seen before. 
Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression: 
KELVIN What's wrong. 
RHEYA You don't love me. 
KELVIN Stop. 
A beat.  She looks down. 
RHEYA I have to talk to you... I... I don't know where I came from. (up at him) Do you know? 
He doesn't respond. 
RHEYA If you know but can't tell me now... will you ever be able to?

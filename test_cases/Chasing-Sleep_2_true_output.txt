Yes.  Thank you. 
STEWART 
Usually, they come back. 
ED 
Yes.  Thank you.  I feel much better now.  Thank you for coming. 
STEWART 
No problem.  You have a good night.  Or morning, I guess. 
ED 
Yes.  You too. 
Ed shuts the door. He's a little wired so he sits at his desk and picks up a pile of his students' papers. He reads the one on top, marking it with a red pen as he does. 
He hears a gurgling noise coming quietly from the bathroom.  He gets up and walks into the- 
INT. BATHROOM 
He looks around the bathroom, tracing the sound to the bathtub drain. It gets louder as he approaches it, but before he can investigate, there is a knock on the front door. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
When Ed comes out to answer the door, it is now bright daylight outside. 
The sun is streaming in through the windows. Through the washed-out sunlight outside his window, Ed can see a police car parked in front of his house. 
Someone knocks again and Ed answers the door. As he does, he picks up the mail that has been dropped through the slot in the door. 
DETECTIVE DERM, 46, stands outside in plain clothes. Derm is, above all, a nice man. Experience has given him a knowing stare, but he is affable, not suspicious. He is consistently professional and genuinely concerned. 
ED 
Hello. 
DERM 
Mr Saxon? 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
Sorry to wake you up. 
ED 
I wasn't asleep. 
DERM 
Oh.  I called a few times and when there wasn't any answer I thought I better come over. 
ED 
What time is it? 
DERM 
About 3:30. 
ED 
3:30?  Maybe I did fall asleep.  Damn. 
DERM 
I'm Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department.  You called last night about your wife. 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
We found her car this morning.  On Capitol Hill.  Actually, somebody called it in.  It was running. 
ED 
Running? 
DERM 
Did your wife come home last night? 
ED 
No. 
DERM 
Did she go to work today? 
ED 
I don't know.  I haven't called. 
DERM 
Do you have a number for her there? 
ED 
Sure. 
Ed picks up the phone and dials from memory. 
DERM 
Why don't you let me? 
He hands Derm the phone. 
DERM

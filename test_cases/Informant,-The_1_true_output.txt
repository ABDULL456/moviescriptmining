GINGER You're not better than somebody else because you have more cars or a bigger salary. Or some stables across the road. You used to know that, you used to know what mattered. You need to find that out again-- you need to turn to God. Whitacre stares at the leaf, trying to move it with his will. 
WHITACRE (softly so God won't hear) I don't need God. 
83 INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE- DAY 83 Whitacre flags down KIRK SCHMIDT, 40, a co-worker and a friend who is passing by.

SCHMIDT Remind me, ABP deal? 
WHITACRE Threonine microbe, they've made some substantial improvements and we need to get it into the market. I got the invoice somewhere... He fishes it out of a pile of papers and slides it across the desk. 
SCHMIDT We can overnight it. 
WHITACRE Nah, I'm gonna see this Thorstensson guy. I'll just hand it to him. 
SCHMIDT Then I'll get it over. Lysine's going great guns Mark, price is up to one-twenty. Out the window of the office Andreas looks at the tote board and smiles broadly-- he gives Whitacre a big thumbs up. Whitacre smiles and flashes a thumbs up back.

WHITACRE (V.0.) ADM: Supermarket to the world.. .We'll have to change that. When it all comes out-- maybe the board'11 want to change the name of the company altogether.

He approaches A 
UNIFORMED PORTER. 
WHITACRE Guten Morgen, Ich mochte Herr Brief finden, bitte? The porter points toward a desk.

WHITACRE (V.0.) The state bird of Hawaii is the Nay Nay-- it's a kind of land based goose and the state motto is va mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono-- the customer is the enemy and the competitor is your friend.

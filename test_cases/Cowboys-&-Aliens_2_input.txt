CREEK JOHNSON They're not going anywhere with you. Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE: 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) You got some balls on you -- walkin' outta here a week ago sayin' what you said and doin' what you did and then ridin' back in here and givin orders. Just who the hell do you think you are? The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT. 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) So. Are you her? 
ELLA Am I who? 
CREEK JOHNSON The whore Jake quit this gang for. OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare: 
JAKE Watch your mouth, Creek. 
CREEK JOHNSON Or what? These boys are with = now. jID in charge. You may be fast, but you are goddamned outgunned. ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men -- 
JAKE That a fact, Boys? But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond: 
CREEK JOHNSON Put your guns on the whore. He so much as twitches, blow her brains out her ear. AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING: 
JAKE Call her a whore again, that'll be the last word you ever say. 
CREEK JOHNSON You ain't in no position to make threats, asshole. Hunt: take his gun. Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls the PISTOL from Jake's holster: 
HUNT Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal. Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN. 
CREEK JOHNSON Put him down, Bull. And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD -- Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him: 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Where the hell's our gold. Jake? "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant: 
JAKE Don't remember. Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA -- at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too. 
CREEK JOHNSON Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was leavin' us high and dry because you were in love... You just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold? -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET: 
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D) Man can't run away from who he ja, Lonergan... you really think you could go straight just cause you were fool enough to fall in love with some woman? WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we: MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE 
BEDROOM SOMEWHERE: 
ALICE You sure you wanna give it all up? ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE. 
JAKE What about you? Once we're gone, you ain't ever comin' back. She touches his face so gently. And whispers: 
ALICE You're the first person ever believed I was better than this place... so I gotta believe in y=. (and she KISSES him) You're a good man, Jake Lonergan. PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_ ]1â1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist: 
CREEK JOHNSON You figgered you could steal from us? All that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life? Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried: 
ALICE Your boys'ii come after you. 
JAKE (dark, determined) Let 'em come. BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP: 
JAKE (CONT'D) Okay... okay, I remember now... ("fuck you" grin) Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when you get to hell, you can ask for it back. 
CREEK JOHNSON 
(TSK'S) Okay then. That's the way you wanna do this... 
(TURNS) Kill the whore. ON THE GANG. As they all cock their guns -- Aimed at Ella -- This is IT -- JAKE -- slowly lifts his head, suddenly RAGE-FILLED as -- 
HIS WRIST BRACELET ACTIVATES! BLAMMMM11! A SEARING PULSE BLAST 
FIRES, VAPORIZING CREEK JUST BEFORE HE PULLS THE TRIGGER! EVERYONE'S FACES. Holy shit. Jake spits on the around between the SMOKING BOOTS that formerly belonged to Creek: 
JAKE Told you not to call her that. ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of the (awestruck) gang -- through BLOODY TEETH: 
JAKE (CONT'D) You're all riding with me. Any one of you decides otherwise? So help me God, I'll kill you where you stand. 
(AND THEN) I'm j2acj& and I'M in goddamne.d The gang quickly flips: "Absolutely, Jake/ Whatever you say, Boss..." Jake turns to the speechless Bull McCade and KICKS HIM IN THE BALLS as hard as he can, doubling him over. Now he meets eyes with ELLA. She can't help SMIRKING, grateful. DOC. Is the only one NOT looking at Jake. His attention drawn toward a SOUND coming from the distant DUNES --

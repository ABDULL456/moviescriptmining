Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle. 
GEORGE Well, let's have some of that. Get some glasses, Cousin Tilly. (to Uncle Billy) We're a couple of financial wizards. 
UNCLE BILLY Those Rockefellers! 
GEORGE Get a tray for these great big important simoleons. 
UNCLE BILLY We'll save them for seed. A toast! They raise their glasses. 
GEORGE A toast! A toast to Papa Dollar and to Mama Dollar, and if you want the old Building and Loan to stay in business, you better have a family real quick. 
COUSIN TILLY I wish they were rabbits. 
GEORGE I wish they were too. Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens. 
The four of them parade through the office; George puts the two dollars in the safe. 
CLOSE SHOT  GROUP AROUND THE SAFE DOOR 
As George comes out: 
COUSIN EUSTACE (handing out cigars) Wedding cigars! 
GEORGE (startled) Oh-oh... wedding! Holy mackerel, I'm married! Where's Mary? Mary... (he runs around looking for her) Poor Mary. Look, I've got a train to catch. (looks at his watch) Well, the train's gone. I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab? 
George rushes into his office to look out the window. 
COUSIN TILLY (on telephone) George, there's a call for you. 
GEORGE Look, will you get my wife on the phone?  She's probably over at her mother's. 
COUSIN TILLY Mrs. Bailey is on the phone. 
INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE 
MEDIUM CLOSEUP  GEORGE IS THOROUGHLY RATTLED 
GEORGE I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.  Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife! Here, I'll take it in here. (picks up phone) Mary? Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry...  What? Come home? What home? Three-twenty Sycamore? Well, what... whose home is that? The Waldorf Hotel, huh? 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. OLD GRANVILLE HOUSE  NIGHT 
MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by the weather. It once had class but has not been lived in for years.  This is the house that George and Mary will live in from now on.  The rain is pouring down. A faint glow of light shines out from bottom windows. George hurries into scene. He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps. 
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Bert and man working in rain, sorting through travel posters. 
MAN Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this. 
BERT How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you? 
MAN Sure I have, but I got rid of it. 
BERT (reading poster) Liver pills! Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon? What? They want romantic places, beautiful places...  places George wants to go. 
A sharp whistle is heard. 
CLOSE SHOT  WINDOW OF HOUSE 
Ernie is leaning from the window. 
ERNIE Hey, Bert, here he comes. 
CLOSE SHOT  BERT AND MAN 
BERT Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming. 
MAN Who? 
BERT The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder. 
MAN (disgustedly) What are they  ducks? 
CLOSE SHOT  SIDE PORCH OF HOUSE 
Bert and the man are putting up travel posters to cover up the broken windows. 
BERT Get that ladder up here. 
MAN All right  all right. 
BERT Hurry up... hurry up... hurry up. 
MAN I'm hurrying. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
George is approaching the front door of the house, on which a sign is hanging: "Bridal Suite." Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door. 
ERNIE Hiya... Good evening, sir. 
Ernie opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler. This has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat. George enters. 
ERNIE Entray, monsieur, entray. 
INT. GRANVILLE HOUSE  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE ENTERS 
The house is carpetless, empty  the rain and wind cause funny noises upstairs. A huge fire is burning in the fireplace. Near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered with a checkered oil cloth. It is set for two. A bucket with ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a bowl of caviar. Two small chickens are impaled on a spit over the fire. A phonograph is playing on a box, and a string from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit. The phonograph is playing "Song of the Islands." Mary is standing near the fireplace looking as pretty as any bride ever looked. She is smiling at George, who has been slowly taking in the whole set-up. Through a door he sees the end of a cheap bed, over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie. Ernie exits and closes the door. 
MARY (tears in her eyes) Welcome home, Mr. Bailey. 
GEORGE (overcome) Well, I'll be... Mary, Mary, where did you... 
They rush into each other's arms and hold each other in ecstasy. 
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT 
Bert and Ernie, standing in the pouring rain, start singing "I Love You Truly." 
INT. HOUSE  NIGHT 
CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE AND MARY 
They remain embraced. 
GEORGE Oh, Mary...

CLAIRE The planchette? 
JODY This. 
Jody indicates the wooden pointing device.  Each woman grasps an edge. 
JODY (in a low voice) We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. (to Claire) What's her first name? 
CLAIRE I don't know. 
Jody closes her eyes.  Claire follows suit. 
JODY I call forth the entity that is haunting this house. 
They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved. 
JODY Mrs. Feur? 
There's still no movement. 
CLAIRE Nothing's happening. 
JODY Shhh. 
Jody focuses intently. JODY Reveal yourself to us. 
A long moment passes.  It's starting to seem like a bust. Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.  Even Jody seems startled. 
JODY (to the spirit) Who...who are you? 
At first, nothing happens.  Then, slowly, the planchette starts to move across the board. 
CLAIRE Are you doing that? 
Jody shakes her head. 
CLAIRE I'm not doing that. 
The planchette comes to rest on the letter "M."  Moments later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on "E." 
CLAIRE Oh... 
JODY M-E... 
It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space between "E" and "F."  The planchette stops on "F."  Jody removes her fingers from the device. 
JODY Mef?  What's Mef? 
CLAIRE It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her. 
Suddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F... 
JODY Shit... 
Jody stumbles backwards, gasping. 
JODY Did you see that? 
Claire leans in. 
CLAIRE (to ghost) What happened to you? 
The CANDLE GOES OUT. 
JODY Oh God... 
Jody bolts.  Claire follows. 
EXT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the work room.  She holds onto her arm. 
JODY I have to go. 
CLAIRE Jody, wait. 
Cooper's growling in the work room.  They look in. 
JODY Claire, this is...this is... 
Claire, transfixed, walks in. 
INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT 
She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with letters at an amazing speed. 
MEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF...

CHARLIE Was that before Atlantic City, or after? 
HARRIET Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers. 
He keeps driving. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Charlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office, holding the National Enquirer in his hand. 
DESK SERGEANT Hey Charlie! 
CHARLIE Is Tony back there? 
The Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
CAPTAIN O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673 form completed yet, that street vendor incident on Powell Street? 
TONY (really bummed) Yes, Captain. 
CAPTAIN Tony, do you mind my saying that you seem a little down? 
TONY Captain. It's about my work. About being a policeman. 
CAPTAIN Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm here to listen. 
TONY I know. And that's what's irritating, you're too nice. 
CAPTAIN Too nice!? 
TONY Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner. 
CAPTAIN Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't report to a commissioner. I report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis. A quorum -- 
TONY Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb. 
CAPTAIN Well Tony, I've never seen it that way. For me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public. 
TONY (exasperated) Captain! When I joined the police force, I thought I was going to be Serpico and unfortunately I ended up being Toma. I would have settled for Beretta. 
CAPTAIN That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned. 
Charlie enters. 
CHARLIE Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you. 
CAPTAIN Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the way here. You guys probably have something you want to talk about, and Tony, if you've still got stuff you want to sort out, please, you know where the suggestion box is. 
The Captain exits. 
CHARLIE Nice guy. Hey, what's up? 
TONY I'm having doubts about being a cop again. It's not like how it is on cop shows. All I do is fill out papers and reports. 
CHARLIE Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you? 
TONY No! He's never once said to me that he was going to "throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday." Anyways what's up? 
Charlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X, the Honeymoon Killer). 
CHARLIE Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again. 
TONY I never heard of it. So what? 
CHARLIE Curious, that's all. I read about it, and... (after a pause) I think I'm dating Mrs. X. 
TONY (after a pause) Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness. 
CHARLIE Everything's adding up, Tony. One of the victims was a martial arts expert. Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad.

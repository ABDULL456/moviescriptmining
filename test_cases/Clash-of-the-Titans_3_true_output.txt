TENDERLY -- 
VIDALIA You shouldn't have risked your life for me. It is a waste to save me when I'll be gone so soon. She strokes his hair and kisses his forehead. 
VIDALIA Thank you for your reckless disregard. Thank you, Perseus... Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a quick incantation. A small shoot APPEARS and SPROUTS FAT PODS. Vidalia squeezes the salve from a pod and covers Perseus' wound. The wound bulges, then squirms deeper into Perseus. Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest. Vidalia gently lays him down. Perseus gags. A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its stomach. 
VIDALIA The poison is gone now. 
PERSEUS Where... Where are we? The 
DJINN --

VIDALIA In the Djinn caravan. They're escorting us to the Skolothian border. 
PERSEUS But I thought the Djinn... 
VIDALIA . We all did. But their leader, Shaikh Suleiman, has some special interest in you. (off his confusion) Just sleep. She waves her palm over his face, and he does sleep. 
EXT. CLEON LEGION BIVOUAC - DAY 
Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature, spooked, sniffs the air. All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over, surveying the battlefield. 
EXT. VILLAGES IN SKOLOTHIA - DAY 
The Expedition rides through a war-ravaged village of stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they pass, UNSEEN INHABITANTS skitter about. 
SUPERIMPOSE: FRONTIER OF SKOLOTHIA... 15   DAYS REMAINING 
DRACO The Skolothians have suffered more than their share in this war. The Legions of the Gods have battered them. 
SPYROS It's no wonder they shy away from all strangers. Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest. 
PERSEUS                                                    L Why does this Djinn priest stay with us? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AMOUN Because of you. You're the reason they saved us. 
PERSEUS Me? I don't understand. 
AMOUN Why don't you ask him? 
PERSEUS I thought they didn't speak. 
AMOUN They have no mouths. That doesn't mean they do not speak.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 
The Expedition climbs through rugged country. At a turn, Amoun looks up. Dead ahead, wreathed in fog -- sheer granite pinnacles, one towering above the others. 
AMOUN The Pillar of Moirai. Lair of the Norn Sisters. 
PERSEUS Tell me of them. 
AMOUN They're witches in the form of Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a Strix. They have powerful magic and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters, among other things. (off Perseus' shock) But they owe me a favor. When the war broke out, they lent their power to men against the Gods in exchange for infant sacrifice. Tiamat struck them blind for their treachery. When they came for help, I fashioned them an artificial eye, for their Second Sight. 
PERSEUS You made only one eye?

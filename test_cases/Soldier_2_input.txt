Tiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along a cable, headed away from the junk mountain. 
At ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of its great bulk. 
Peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of "his" mountain.  The cable is twenty yards away in a "canyon" of junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed to the wind in order to get to it. 
He starts out from behind the transformer... 
WHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet, his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable, struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights the wind, struggles toward the cable. 
Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time as it whistles close to his head. 
TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl "under the wind," toward the taut cable, and we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  "STEEL HENGE" - DUSK - LATER 
Seen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing in the distance and the dusk. 
Following them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him, vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must have crashed long ago. 
The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long way, it's almost dark, he's weak. 
He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort. 
He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire. 
He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right. 
Steel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery. 
Just then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze. 
Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire and get weakly to his feet.  For a moment he looks like he might collapse, but he doesn't, and we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 
At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights. 
TODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind, struggling along the wire, shivering. 
Every stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing something ahead. 
In the distance a faint light glows. 
TODD considers it as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 
The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded in a low mound of "earth" like a skylight.  Whatever is making the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only inches above the ground. 
TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind. 
TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten yards to the window and pears through it. 
TODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the wind. 
(What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old. Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.) 
ANGLE ON TODD, prone on the "roof," mystified.  He's never seen anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the wind. 
The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first arrived has diminished to a strong breeze. 
TODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He looks around. 
The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on the other window/skylight that glows from this strange "roof" and on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze... a MUSICAL sound. 
Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music played on an accordion. 
TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window. 
TODD'S POV through the second "window," another mysterious vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is just as puzzled. 
What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor, moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In the corner, another person is making a strange movement that seems to initiate the music... 
ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the pillow fights. 
Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he freezes...listening! 
A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere... 
TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows. There's nothing visible... 
The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything. 
Suddenly TODD understands, but he's too late... 
ROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more powerful than ever! 
TODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind, struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed violently, somersaulted helplessly... 
EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH 
WHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons that aren't clear. 
Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up. 
In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him from the wind howling overhead. 
TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and injured even to crawl. 
Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly sees something.

Ida brings the mug to her lips again, pours some in Sheryl's mouth. She swallows a big gulp. 
IDA That's better. Good girl. (Changing topics) I almost forgot to ask... How does it feel being married? 
SHERYL Why are you doing this? 
IDA I thought you'd be happy about that. All I ever wanted out of life was two things... to be married and to have a baby. The Lord blessed me with Clyde and I thank Him every day for that. 
Ida pours some more tea into Sheryl. 
IDA But having a baby's been... complicated. 
76   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                          76 
Clyde walks over to the fetus jars.    Stares at them.   A sadness in his eyes. 
CLYDE She can conceive fine... just... can't seem to make it all the way through. Timothy was the toughest... Made it to month eight. 
ANGLE ON - The "Timothy" Fetus jar.    The most developed of them all. 
CLYDE City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo words for the condition. (Beat; turns to Mike) Breaks my heart every time. That woman was born to be a mother. It's her calling in life. Just like you and Sheryl have a calling. 
MIKE What exactly do you want from us? 
The IRON DOOR FLIES OPEN, Deacon emerges, stands over Mike. 
77   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                77 
Sheryl sways back and forth.     Her EYELIDS heavy.   The primrose "kicking in." 
Ida places her hand on Sheryl's cheek. 
IDA You're young, strong... It's gonna be easy for you. Not like me. 
SHERYL (Barely conscious) Wh-what...? 
IDA You're gonna have a baby, Sheryl. (Beat) My baby. 
78   INT.   HALLWAY - CABIN BASEMENT - NIGHT                       78 
Deacon drags Mike down the hall.    Clyde follows. 
79   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                79 
The door to the room FLIES OPEN.    Deacon drags Mike inside, Clyde right behind them. 
To Mike's horror... 
MIKE Oh my God... 
Sheryl lies unconscious on top of the table, Ida by her side. 
ANGLE ON SHERYL - Each of her limbs tied down with heavy rope. Her legs are spread apart. 
MIKE What have you done to her? 
IDA She'll be out for hours, but she's fine. 
CLYDE Ida'll come back in a little bit, check to see that the deed has been done. If it hasn't...the next time you see your little lady...a piece of her will be missing. (MORE) 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          67. 
CLYDE (cont'd) (Cold) Don't test us on that one. 
IDA Now, we know conception's not automatic. So don't feel like all the pressure's on right now. We're prepared to do this however long it takes. You give us the effort each time, eventually the magic will happen. 
MIKE You're out of your fucking minds. 
Clyde grabs Mike's wrist, turns over his palm.    Clyde takes a knife from his belt, SLICES MIKE'S PALM. 
MIKE SCREAMS.   BLOOD POURS FROM THE WOUND. 
CLYDE What did I tell you about the language? 
Ida grabs a fresh rag, wraps Mike's hand in it. 
CLYDE Deacon will be right outside that door. The only door. This room has no windows and is buried twenty feet below ground. Cutting to the chase... there's no way out and you can scream yourself hoarse, no one will hear you. 
IDA We'll let you have your privacy now. (Remembers) Oh, almost forgot. 
Ida goes to the corner where the phonograph sits.    She cranks the handle, places the needle on the record. 
The record crackles, Pachelbel's "Canon" fills the room. 
Deacon, Clyde and Ida exit.   They SHUT and LOCK the door behind them.

DR. PAYSON Let him finish. 
MALCOLM Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one. 
BROTHER BENJAMIN Tell it. 
MALCOLM --there's another one. The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't even let you near the plant. 
159F	INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bembry turns off the TV set and he commences to plant the seeds of "betrayal." 
CLOSE - BEMBRY 
BEMBRY Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press. The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness. 
CLOSE - ELIJAH 
ELIJAH Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the Nation. 
CLOSER - BEMBRY 
BEMBRY Great benefit for himself. 
159G	BRIEF MONTAGE. THE RISE OF MALCOLM X 
EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY 
Malcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for office. He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a CROWD follows him. Malcolm sees a WINO. 
MALCOLM Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that poison away from your lips. That's what the devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your natural mind. I know, I've been there. 
The wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine. 
159H	--Malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of TV REPORTERS armed with microphones. He walks; they follow. 
159I	--Malcolm walking in Harlem, urging people to lift themselves up, come to the meetings, etc. 
159J 	INT. TEMPLE #7 
Malcolm sits with Benjamin. 
MALCOLM It's time you received your X. But first you must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to you; down to the dotted "i's," crossed "t's," everything. And you must go on a fast, just water and juices, that's it. 
CLOSE - BENJAMIN 
He takes the letter from Malcolm and looks at it. 
BENJAMIN I'll have it tomorrow. 
MALCOLM Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact. 
--Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter, he's so anxious. 
--Benjamin hands Malcolm his letter, Malcolm shakes his head and hands it back, it's not exact. 
159K	EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY 
Malcolm is talking to a group of PEOPLE who are having a rent strike. 
MALCOLM When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools. 
159L 	CUTAWAY TO MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN 
Malcolm hands him back his letter again. The fast is getting to Benjamin. 
MALCOLM (contd) When you have poor schools you have poor teachers. When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education. 
159M	CUTAWAYS TO THE DESPAIR OF HARLEM - SLUMS, TENEMENTS, GARBAGE, RATS 
MALCOLM (contd) Poor education, you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood. 
159N	CUTAWAY TO BLACK FACES 
MALCOLM (contd) So it's a very vicious cycle. We've got to break it.

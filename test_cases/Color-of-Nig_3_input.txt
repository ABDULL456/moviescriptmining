BUCK Yelling louder. Richie ! 
He signals him to take off his earphones. Richie takes them off. 
RICHIE What ! 
BOB Would you like to tell Bill a little something about yourself ? 
RICHIE No ! 
CLARK OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group. 
BUCK Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that. 
CLARK Oh, Saint Christopher rattles his chain. 
BUCK Saint Michael, sir. CLARK This is not about you. 
BUCK You're right... 
BOB You know what I am saying ?... He talks to Richie. 
RICHIE One feels he has elocution problems. He stutters and looks for his words. I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens... except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I blush too. 
CASEY Imitating him. Y-You c... can say that again... 
Richie jumps on Casey. Sondra stands up to stop him, but she is toot late. Richie falls on Casey and knocks his armchair down. 
RICHIE Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off ! You fuckin' cocksucker ! 
BUCK Get up! 
They fight on the floor. Buck tries to take them apart. He succeeds in tearing Richie away by holding him with both arms, and carrying him away. 
RICHIE Get the fuck off me ! 
BOB Buck. 
Richie gets free and walks rapidly out of the room. Sondra tries to follow him. Bob stops her. 
SONDRA Richie ! 
BOB It's all right... He'll come back... 
BUCK Voice over. What do you think, Doctor Clark ?... 
Bob straightens up the armchair and Casey stands up sneering. 
CASEY Was it something I said ? SONDRA You are an asshole ! 
BOB You know, guys... A little humanity... 
BUCK Talking to Bill. Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out of you, aren't we ? 
SONDRA Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone. 
BUCK Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra. 
SONDRA She seems a bit shocked. Oh ! That's very nice ! 
BOB Buck ? 
BUCK I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to pass... All right ? 
BILL Very sorry. How did they die ? 
BUCK They say... He starts crying. ... I... I can't talk about it... 
Sondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark wipes his eyes. 
BOB Casey ?

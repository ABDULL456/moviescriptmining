Vanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it up for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long- forgotten invocation in the vampire tongue. 
FROST (grinning, to himself) "And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?" 
Frost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
Blade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist -- 
BLADE Get out of here -- 
KAREN I'm not leaving without you. 
BLADE You don't understand. The Thirst -- 
He clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain. 
BLADE (gasping) -- tearing me -- apart. 
KAREN I know. Take some of my blood. 
BLADE No -- 
KAREN It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't. 
Blade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her takes every ounce of his resolve. 
BLADE I can't -- I won't be able to stop -- 
KAREN Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is. 
Karen matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's terrified. 
Blade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is offering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT 
Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force seizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white, flinging the chalice aside. 
And as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the stone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder -- as if some force within were trying to break free -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
Karen turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself to Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his head -- 
-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth puncture her skin and we -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT 
Frost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange HUMMING. 
Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes outward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body. 
Then ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a torrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about like a scarecrow in a cyclone. 
Mercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive, humbled by what they're witnessing. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
Blade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her eyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. 
She shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous rhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing downward, tearing into him -- 
She's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte, spinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery, racing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the deafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of existence and we're -- 
CUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW 
between Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing stronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of expanding energy until --

JOHN (V.O.) 
Heaven and Hell are right here, behind every wall, every face -- the world behind the world. It's crossing over that's the real trick. That's why most demons can only whisper in our ears. But even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare. 
INT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT 
HENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'. 
MAITRE D' 
Sir, you need a reservation! But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's everywhere. He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish, pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes. In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly eating his meal. Balthazar. Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside gets thinner. He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her husband pulls her away. Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand. A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto Hennessey. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
But the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here -- the ones that are half-human so they blend in... Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and starts toward the back EXIT. 
(CONTINUED)

JOHN (V.O.) 
... just like those with the angel's touch living alongside of us. The half-breeds. That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that instant we get a brief glimpse of -- 
ALTERNATE LOS ANGELES 
An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light. 
BACK TO SCENE 
BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies. Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He leaves out the back exit. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
They call it 'the Balance.' I call it hypocritical bullshit. 
INT. DINER 
JOHN 
So when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul -- I deport their scaly ass right back to Hell. (takes a sip of tea) I don't get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement. 
ANGELA 
Sounds like you're trying to buy your way into Heaven. 
JOHN 
Well, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you? Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him. 
ANGELA 
Why you? I mean many go to Hell, why were you able to escape? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
(sips tea) I don't know. 
ANGELA 
God has a plan for all of us. 
JOHN 
Not for me. John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at him -- finally -- 
ANGELA 
Isabel saw things too. John looks up. Moment is lost when her CELLULAR RINGS. The cop in her reacts, flips it open. 
ANGELA 
Detective Dodson here. 
EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER 
The morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that chased Hennessey is just outside. 
WEISS (O.S.) 
Security Guard spotted him near the body, chased him out. We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is a complete shambles of fine dining -- 
WEISS 
He comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow -- deflates like a fricken Macy's day balloon. -- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore is familiar now. John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be. John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he himself removed from his friend. That's even more crushing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
Shit... (sympathetic) Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch... John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the fork wound. The blood is already drying over it. John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and grabs a melting ice cube. He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random stabbings. This is a shape. John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses. Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin. It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist. John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important. 
JOHN 
(to Hennessey) Rest in peace, Father.

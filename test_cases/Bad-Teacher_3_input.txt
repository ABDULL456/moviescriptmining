KIRK And she has touched the lives of those around her -- until last night. Elizabeth pulls Kirk into a lawyer/client huddle. 
ELIZABETH 
(WHISPERS) You kind of sound like a pro. 
KIRK 
(WHISPERS) Do you think they're going to find out that I didn't pass the bar? 
ELIZABETH 
(WHISPERS) You're doing great. They break from their huddle. 
KIRK Your administration jumped to conclusions, set off a media fire-storm and has humiliated one of its own. As Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that it's certainly within her province to sue the district. 
SUPERINTENDENT How do we make this go away? 
KIRK Ms. Halsey is not a litigious woman. She wants this whole matter to go away as quickly and painlessly as possible. Kirk slides a piece of paper across the desk. 
KIRK (CONT'D) This is a list of our demands. The Superintendent and Principal Snur scan the list. 
SUPERINTENDENT You're kidding me. 
ELIZABETH Don't answer right now. Let it marinate. Oh, and I should mention that if this goes to trial, I can cry on cue. Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast. And as quickly she started, she stops. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be heading to fifth period. I hate to be tardy. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY 
Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium, the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be heard. Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song. She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options. 
AMY Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave us quite a scare, you did. Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking toward Amy, only feet away now. 
AMY (CONT'D) (attempting some levity) Somebody's being a grumple-- BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood. 
AMY (CONT'D) Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) Well, it's been another great year at 
JAMS... 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYM - DAY 
QUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym, kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks. Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to sign it. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) Who can forget the exciting addition of a climbing wall to the small gym... 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 
QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS. And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) .Or the student/teacher spelling bee. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 
Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s. Polite laughter. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) But seriously... With summer around the corner, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to one of our own. Elizabeth smiles. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) Amy Squirrel. Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a pursed smile. 
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) After six short years of outstanding, tireless work here, Amy is transferring out of the district.

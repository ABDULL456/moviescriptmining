KATE When did he leave? 
CHARLIE I don't know. An hour ago? He said he wanted to take a walk. 
KATE And you let him?? He's not allowed to go outside! 
CHARLIE Is he being punished? 
KATE We've got to find him! You stay here in case he finds his way back. And while you wait you'd better pray he's all right. If anything happens to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING we've worked for will have been destroyed. 
She heads out the door. Charlie follows. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING 
CHARLIE Kate, calm down. 
KATE And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand? (she grabs her coat and purse) 
CHARLIE What's the big deal? Who is this guy? 
Kate takes a LONG pause. 
KATE Leopold... is not really from Canada. 
EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 
Peaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills. Suddenly: 
CHARLIE (V.O.) OH MY GOD!!! 
The pigeons take flight. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING 
Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified, caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed. A motorist pulls along side of him. 
WOMAN MOTORIST You stupid fucking son of a bitch. Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron. 
Leopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears. 
INT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT 
Kate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with mounting anger. 
CABBY What're ya waiting for lady? An invitation? 
KATE I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 
She continues searching, trying hard to remain calm. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT 
Huge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles. Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He enters a deli. 
INT. DELI - NIGHT 
Leopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has none. 
LEOPOLD (to the counter man) $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct? 
COUNTER MAN You gotta problem with that? 
LEOPOLD It seems rather pricey to me. 
COUNTER MAN So don't buy one. 
LEOPOLD I shan't. 
COUNTER MAN So shan't! 
He moves on. 
LEOPOLD Yes, I... I would be happy to sample one however I'm afraid I haven't the finance with me just now. If I could establish a credit with you, I will have someone come round with the funds tomorrow. 
COUNTER MAN You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today, is that it? 
LEOPOLD (a little confused) I believe so. Yes. 
COUNTER MAN Get the fuck outta here. 
LEOPOLD I beg your pardon? 
COUNTER MAN Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.

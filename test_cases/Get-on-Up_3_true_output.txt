JAMES You the man, Teddy Brown? 
TEDDY I'm the man, Mr. Brown. 
James notices the band sitting idle on the other side of the glass. 
JAMES Gertie. The band ready? 
GERTRUDE They're ready Mr. Brown. 
JAMES BROWN Don't look like it. 
James grabs Teddy. 
JAMES BROWN (CONT'D) Come watch how Poppa don't take no mess. 
He and Teddy walk straight into the- 
135A                                                            135A INT. JAMES BROWN PRODUCTIONS. STUDIO. DAY. 
The band is there. 
JAMES BROWN Y'all act like y'all don't know what time it is. What you doin'? 
Nothing happens. James looks Maceo in the eye. Maceo approaches. 
MACEO I've been elected spokesman to speak on behalf of the band. 
JAMES Spokesman? Elected? 
MACEO We asked to get paid on time. We haven't been paid in weeks. We asked for scheduled days off. Every day off we get you make us rehearse.. We asked to get paid for recording but you included it in our salary. 
James turns to Teddy.   The two stare at each other. 
JAMES BROWN Teddy, go on and wait outside. 
TEDDY Yes, Sir. 
Teddy exits. 
JAMES Fellas. I hear ya. I really do. And I appreciate the honesty. That can't be easy. No Sir. You got grievances. You got your own selves to think about. Hell, you're men. I dig it. 
PEE WEE I don't think you understand. 
James looks to Bobby. 
MACEO We know you owe the government back taxes. Your restaurant, radio stations, recording studios, labels, all different businesses, Unaccounted cash passing between them. (MORE) 
MACEO (CONT'D) It's a mess, Mr. Brown and if you want us to be a part of it, we gonna need our cash too. Right now. 
James looks at them all for a very long time hiding his shame. 
MACEO (CONT'D) And most of all none of us ever want to be fined for anything ever again. 
James nods.   Studying them. 
JAMES BROWN I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna think about it. That's all. 
They look at each other and file out. Waymon, Pee Wee, Maceo, Kush and Jimmy Nolen file out. Leaving Bobby and James alone. 
SILENCE. 
He looks at the empty room. Smiling. Unable to show any pain. 
JAMES (He shakes his head.) It's like I always say Bobby. You gotta know who you are. You got to know where you are in this world. Five minutes ago, those boys were the best band on the planet. Now they nothing. Now they a bunch of sidemen with their hearts beatin' fast. Maceo comin' in here talking about my taxes. All I've done for this country and they comin' after James Brown? How you gone keep everybody happy? Huh? And stay on top? You along for the ride while everything is groovy and now they gone kick me when I'm down? People either on the bus or they off it. 
James crosses to the door and opens it for Bobby to exit 
JAMES BROWN (He turns to Bobby.) Well go on. Get out of here. Y'might catch `em they gone need a singer. 
Bobby rises and walks past James into the foyer. He turns. 
BOBBY Negro, what makes you think I'm leaving? I been here all the time, Mr. Brown. I'm still here. 
James looks at Bobby. 
JAMES See that's the thing about the funk. The funk don't quit. 
BOBBY Last time I checked. 
JAMES Cause if the funk gone up'n'quit that's it. 
BOBBY That's why the funk don't quit. 
JAMES Are we done here Mr. Byrd? 
BOBBY I'm afraid we ain't Mr. Brown. 
JAMES Are we done? 
BOBBY I think we got more funk in the trunk. 
James laughs. 
JAMES That's right. Two Musketeers. 
Bobby looks at James. Remembers. Beams. James beams back. Then, James is all business.

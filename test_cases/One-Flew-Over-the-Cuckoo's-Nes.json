{"train": "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest \nEXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL \nAll we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains, rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight. \nA long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn elsewhere and he looks down. \nREVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV \nFar below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look up at McMurphy. \nMcMURPHY \nAs he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him. \nMAN (V.O.) (through bullhorn) McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle, from the infirmary. Can you hear me? \nMcMurphy doesn't respond. \nSHANKLE (V.O.) (through bullhorn) Can you hear me, McMurphy? \nMcMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN. \nSECOND VOICE (through bullhorn) Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ sake, he ain't gonna come down... you... \nThe BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against the coming night when... \nSHANKLE (V.O.) (through bullhorn) McMurphy! I have the warden's promise. If you come down, nobody will hurt you! You'll be in my custody! I promise! \nAn imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face. \nINT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN \nStrange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls. The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc. \nAcross the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off duty. \nThe CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns, another twists, a third lies as if dead. \nCAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open, very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing. \nA beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake. \nAhead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and disappear into a side room. \nBromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in, passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses' station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room. \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nas Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy preparing the day's medication. \nBromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden freezes. Terrified. \nMILLER Where you goin', Chief? \nWARREN You goin' t'see the Big White Fathuh? \nWASHINGTON He goin' t'see the Big White Muthuh... \nThey cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic spreading across his face. \nWASHINGTON (CONT'D) Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat apples off my head an' he mine me like a baby... \nA KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns, along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE enters the ward. \nTHREE ATTENDANTS (simultaneously, as Big Nurse passes) Mornin', Miss Ratched... \nBIG NURSE Good morning, boys. \nShe sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the wall, mop in hand. \nINT. NURSES' STATION \nas Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears an enormous cross between her breasts. \nMISS PILBOW Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? \nBIG NURSE Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean old Monday... (she flips on the intercom) Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. \nINT. MEN'S DORM - DAY \nas Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of bed. \nBIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Time to get up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up! \nThe Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes, who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room, rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the patients toward the washroom. \nMiller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up his mattress. \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nas the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse. \nBIG NURSE Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Billy, I spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love... Good morning, Mister Harding... Good morning, Mister Cheswick. Mister Scanlon... \nBromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) Oh, Mister Bromden... (calling out) Mister Washington! \nThe two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who takes a deep breath of fresh air. \nMCMURPHY (CONT'D) Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day... \nMISS PILBOW This way, Mister McMurphy. \nMCMURPHY Yes, ma'am... \nMcMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow into the hallway as the door closes behind them. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nOther STAFF MEMBERS are administrative personnel are SEEN as McMurphy walks alongside Nurse Pilbow, who is noticeably nervous by his close proximity. Washington and Warren casually bringing up the rear. \nMCMURPHY (as he peels the Band-Aid off, revealing a scar) I tell ya, these goons showered me at the courthouse this morning, last night at the jail, and I swear they'd have swabbed my ears out on the way over if they could've found the facilities... \nA young Japanese nurse, named ITSU, passes by. \nMCMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Nurse Itsu) Hey, how ya doin', cutie? \nNURSE ITSU Okay. How you doing? \nMCMURPHY Just great! (calling after her) See ya around! \nNurse Itsu laughs and disappears around the corner. \nMCMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Nurse Pilbow) Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here. \nMISS PILBOW I'm sure you will. \nMCMURPHY (to Nurse Pilbow) Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before. \nMISS PILBOW Oh... \nThey arrive at the ward door. Nurse Pilbow unlocks the door and opens it as... \nMCMURPHY Yeah, I'm here on a ninety-day observation period. Short-timer, like they say... \nSoft nostalgic MUSIC is HEARD OVER. \nMISS PILBOW Of course. (indicating door) Mister McMurphy. \nMCMURPHY After you, ma'am. \nMISS PILBOW Thank you. \nNurse Pilbow enters the ward and McMurphy watches her cross the visitors' area to a heavy-gauge steel screen wall, with security gate which she opens. \nMCMURPHY (to Washington and Warren as they step into ward) Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here. \nSPIVEY (calling) Hold it! \nMcMurphy turns to see DOCTOR SPIVEY approaching. \nSPIVEY (CONT'D) Good morning, boys. \nWASHINGTON AND WARREN (simultaneously as Spivey passes into the ward) Mornin', Doctor Spivey. \nSPIVEY Great day for fishing. \nWASHINGTON AND WARREN (simultaneously) Yes, sir! \nThe door closes. CAMERA HOLDS on sign that READS: \nSMILE AT THE NEXT FACE YOU SEE. IT MAY SAVE HIS LIFE. \nMCMURPHY (O.S.) Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing, Doc... \nCUT TO: \nINT. WARD - DAY \nas McMurphy, Spivey, Washington and Warren cross the visitors' area towards Nurse Pilbow, who stands holding the security gate open. At the far end of the hallway, which opens into the day room, patients can be seen. \nSPIVEY (to McMurphy) Oh, what's that? \nMCMURPHY Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute. \nSPIVEY Oh, do you do much fishing? \nAs they pass through the security gate: \nMCMURPHY Fish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a nickel for every fish I landed between Point Conception and the Alaska coast... \nWashington and Warren continue down the hallway, passing SEFELT, who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful distance. \nSPIVEY (to McMurphy) Is that so? \nMCMURPHY Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight. \nSPIVEY My, my... Ah, who are you? \nMCMURPHY McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy. \nThey shake hands. \nNURSE PILBOW Mister McMurphy is a new admission. \nMCMURPHY Sure... \nMARTINI Me too! Me too! \nAs McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop in hand. \nMCMURPHY Hey, how's it look up there, big boy? \nSCANLON He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian! \nMCMURPHY That right? \nHARDING (O.S.) Martini, it's your turn! \nMartini is staring off into space. \nHARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D) Martini! \nMCMURPHY (to Martini) Your buddy is callin' ya. \nMartini crosses back to the card game as Taber returns. \nMCMURPHY What's troubling ya, buddy? \nTABER I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me. \nMCMURPHY You look pretty healthy to me. \nTABER (CONT'D) I'm the next one. \nMCMURPHY How do ya know that? \nTABER (CONT'D) Because I quit breathing. \nMCMURPHY You're breathin' right now. \nTaber walks away. \nMcMurphy watches him go. \nNearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks. \nMCMURPHY (crossing to him) What's that, Pop? \nThe old man squeaks again. \nMCMURPHY (leaning in close) Can't hear ya, old-timer. \nOLD VEGETABLE Ain't this a pisser? \nMCMURPHY Hell, compared to where I just come from, this is a country club. \nMcMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the game. \nMCMURPHY Whatcha boys playin'? \nBILLY H-H-Hearts. \nMCMURPHY Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand. \nBilly holds his hand close to his chest. \nMCMURPHY What's your name, buddy? \nBILLY B-B-Billy. \nMCMURPHY Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy. \nThey shake hands. \nMCMURPHY What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here? \nBILLY (CONT'D) Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council? \nMCMURPHY Yeah, that'll do for openers! \nBILLY (CONT'D) (to Harding) H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr... \nHARDING Does he have an appointment? \nCHESWICK Yeah, do you have an appointment? \nMCMURPHY What for? \nCHESWICK (to Harding) What for? \nHARDING I'm a busy man! \nCHESWICK (to McMurphy) He's a busy man! \nA beat; then: \nMCMURPHY I can wait... \nMcMurphy picks up a chair and sits down right next to Harding and looks at him. Another beat; then: \nHARDING (to McMurphy) What are you doing? \nMCMURPHY I'm seeing what a busy man does. \nThey cross out of the men's dorm. \nBig Nurse watches them go. \nSPIVEY (V.O.) What other work have you done? \nINT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nDoctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate: JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers. \nMcMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue clothes, sits facing him. \nMCMURPHY Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was. \nSPIVEY Oh, what was that? \nMCMURPHY Poker! \nSPIVEY I see. \nMCMURPHY Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man. \nSPIVEY (CONT'D) In what way? \nMCMURPHY They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal. \nSPIVEY I see... \nMCMURPHY To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure... \nSPIVEY Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here? \nMCMURPHY Well, ya know, Doc... (indicating his papers) Doesn't it say so there? \nSPIVEY (looking over papers) Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' (looking up at McMurphy) What do you think of that report? \nMCMURPHY I don't, Doc... \nSPIVEY (goes back to papers) Arrested on an assault charge five times... \nMCMURPHY That's correct, Doc ... \nSPIVEY (reading from folder) The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that? \nMCMURPHY Doc, what can I tell ya? \nSPIVEY Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy? \nMCMURPHY No, this is my first trip, Doc. \nSPIVEY (closes folder and sits back) Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation! \nMCMURPHY You bet, Doc! \nSPIVEY Good. Good. \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nCAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair, doing a deep breathing exercise. \nThe patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and forth. \nBANCINI I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm awful tired... \nBIG NURSE (busy with her papers) Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the meeting. \nBilly does... gently laying a hand on Bancini. \nBILLY T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P Pete... \nBANCINI Awful tired... \nBilly gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside him, patting his skinny knee. \nBIG NURSE At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... (reading from logbook) Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding? \nHARDING Yes, that's perfectly correct. \nBIG NURSE (reading) He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' (she closes book) So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further? \nBig Nurse waits. A long beat. \nHarding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost wanting someone to begin. \nThe patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions. \nMcMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse or the Aides have noticed. \nIf they have, no one pays any attention. \nMcMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis, unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet. \nThe other patients are aghast at this move, look at each other quizzically. \nBig Nurse merely watches. \nMcMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting! \nHARDING (CONT'D) (his voice rising as he goes on) ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence... \nTABER You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose! \nFREDRICKSON Yeah, wise up, Harding. \nSEFELT Yeah, turn her loose! \nACUTES (start pouring it on) Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... He thinks he's God Almighty... He's a snob... He's a schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep... Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of him... Ship him upstairs... \nRUCKLY (chiming in) Ffffffuck da wife... \nBANCINI (wagging his head) Tired... Awful tired... \nACUTES (not letting up) Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off... He doesn't have any... Fag... Pervert. \nBANCINI (in a strong angry voice) I'm tired! \nEveryone hushes. \nBIG NURSE Somebody see to Mister Bancini. \nTwo or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he isn't to be hushed. \nBANCINI Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired... \nBig Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable. \nBig Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses' station. \nWashington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away. \nWASHINGTON You a good boy, Mistah Bancini... \nNurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand. \nPete turns to his fellow inmates. \nBANCINI You see... it's a lotta baloney... It's all a lotta baloney... \nNURSE PILBOW Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm... \nBANCINI That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, can't... \nNURSE PILBOW (working her way around Bancini) Yes, I know, I know... \nShe gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back. \nBANCINI ... don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard... (starts going over, slowly; sighing and crying) Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired... \nMcMurphy looks around at the others. \nEach patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to Bancini's state. \nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY \nWIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court, which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves scattered everywhere. \nMartini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing. \nMARTINI (as he throws ball) Catch it! Catch it! \nThe ball rolls to the corner. \nWASHINGTON Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball! \nMARTINI No! \nMartini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after the ball, when Martini goes running after it. \nMARTINI (CONT'D) I get it! I get it! \nBut Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to the ball. \nMartini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon out. \nThe other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a prison yard. \nCheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding, who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up. \nMCMURPHY Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party? \nHARDING A pecking party? \nMCMURPHY That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck? \nHARDING AND CHESWICK Who? Who? \nMCMURPHY Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who... \nThe other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding. \nHARDING It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party. \nMCMURPHY I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you! \nHARDING Did to me? \nMCMURPHY Did to you and all the rest of you guys. \nMARTINI (holding up a cigarette) What's this? \nMCMURPHY That's a dime, Martini. \nMartini breaks a cigarette in half. \nMARTINI (CONT'D) Bet a nickel! \nMCMURPHY (to Cheswick) Whadaya bet, Cheswick? \nCHESWICK She won't give me any more cigarettes! \nMCMURPHY That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want? \nCHESWICK (CONT'D) Lend me twenty. \nMcMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who bets all twenty. \nThe Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is divided. \nMCMURPHY (checking the board) 'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em. \nHe deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the next one face up. \nMCMURPHY Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini? \nMARTINI Hit me. \nMCMURPHY (hits with a picture) That's twenty up, Martini. (turning to TV, he shouts across room) Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game? \nTaber calls back something but it's lost in the other sounds. \nMARTINI (CONT'D) Hit me! \nMCMURPHY Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing. (turning back to Taber) What? \nTABER (shouting back) Koufax against Ford! \nMISS PILBOW (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) Medication time! Medication time! Medication! \nMARTINI (simultaneously with Pilbow) Hit me! \nMcMurphy slams his cards down, stands up, crosses the day room, heading for the nurses' station. He passes Washington, who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice. \nINT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT \nas McMurphy enters. Nurse Pilbow is the only one there. \nMCMURPHY Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning... \nNURSE PILBOW (scared out of her wits) Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back! \nMCMURPHY All I'm askin' is... \nNurse Pilbow grabs at her cross, screams and shuts her eyes, holding the cross in front of her. \nNURSE PILBOW (CONT'D) Oh, stay back, I'm a Catholic! \nBig Nurse enters from the nurses' lounge. \nBIG NURSE Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here. \nMCMURPHY Sorry, ma'am. \nMcMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind him. \nINT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT \nas McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but doesn't take his pills. \nMCMURPHY (to Big Nurse) Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'? \nBIG NURSE (politely) Yes, Mister McMurphy? \nMCMURPHY How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think? \nBIG NURSE (pleasantly) That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy. \nMcMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window. \nMCMURPHY (confidentially) Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout! \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) (aware of his physical proximity) Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window. \nMcMurphy jerks his hand away. \nMCMURPHY Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that... \nMcMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his sleeve. \nMCMURPHY Sorry to have bothered you. \nBIG NURSE Not at all, Mister McMurphy... \nMcMurphy turns to walk away. \nNURSE PILBOW Your medicine, Mister McMurphy. \nMCMURPHY (turning back, he examines the contents of the cup) What's the horse pill for, honey? \nCAMERA HOLDS on McMurphy as he slowly pulls it together and sits on the edge of the bed. He's naked as he opens the drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette. \nMCMURPHY (looking in the drawer) What the... (looking around) Who the fuck stole my cigarettes! \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nas the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse. \nBIG NURSE Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are your teeth any better?... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good morning, Mister Harding; my, my, you've been biting your fingernails again... \nShe sees McMurphy approaching, wearing a towel around his waist and a scowl on his face. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels. \nMCMURPHY I wanna report a robbery! \nBIG NURSE On this ward? \nMCMURPHY Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes! \nBIG NURSE Oh, I had them removed. \nMCMURPHY What for? \nBIG NURSE Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day. \nBromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) (calling out) Mister Washington! \nWashington comes running. \nWASHINGTON Yes, Miss Ratched? \nBIG NURSE Please see to Mister Bromden. \nWASHINGTON (taking Bromden by the hand) Yes, Miss Ratched... \nWashington leads Bromden off. Big Nurse turns to Cheswick and several other Acutes, who have crowded around. \nBIG NURSE Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... (to McMurphy) You too, Mister McMurphy. \nMCMURPHY Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose? \nBIG NURSE After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast. \nMCMURPHY You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya! \nBIG NURSE Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly. \nWIDER ANGLE \nA beat, as the Acutes wait for McMurphy's next move, then: \nMCMURPHY 'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas... \nMcMurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom, singing at the top of his lungs. \nMCMURPHY Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his... Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your... Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies. \nBIG NURSE \nwatching McMurphy who removes his towel as he enters the washroom. \nINT. WASHROOM - DAY \nas McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on Bromaen's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE. \nINT. MESS HALL - DAY \nWe SEE the attendants spooning food into the sucking pink mouths of the vegetables, a shade too fast for swallowing. \nMCMURPHY (O.S.) What's wrong with you guys? \nWe SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down his guillet. The others are barely touching their food. \nMCMURPHY Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner... (holding up his orange juice) Look at this here, real orange juice! (slugging it down) Hooee, that's good. Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place! (slaps his belly) All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up... \nHe gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter. Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington. \nMCMURPHY Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'. \nWASHINGTON Nobody leaves here till seven thirty. \nMcMurphy turns Washington over in his mind, then he looks up at the clock above the door. \nThe time is 7:28.

(no response) You must try to talk about it, Billy. \nMCMURPHY Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business. \nBIG NURSE Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy. \nMCMURPHY Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also! \nBIG NURSE Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much? \nMCMURPHY What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it! \nCHESWICK Yeah, let's vote on it! \nBIG NURSE Will one more vote satisfy you? \nMCMURPHY Yeah, it'll satisfy me. \nBIG NURSE Very well.

In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here. \nSPIVEY Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward? \nMCMURPHY Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin. \nSPIVEY Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients. \nMCMURPHY Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all. \nSPIVEY Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case. \nThis is the kiss of death to McMurphy. \nMCMURPHY Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'. \nSPIVEY I'm afraid not. \nMCMURPHY Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she! \nSPIVEY No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton. \nMCMURPHY Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me. \nSPIVEY I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here. \nMCMURPHY When? \nSPIVEY We'll let you know. \nREACTION SHOT of McMurphy. \nEXT.

Now, why don't you boys place your fish on the gurney and we'll see to it that everyone enjoys a fresh fish dinner. \nThe men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All he gets for his troubles are a series of \"No,\" \"Get lost,\" \"I don't have any.\" \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington to the showers, supper is in half an hour. \nThe inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, \"We're not hungry,\" as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and crosses to him. \nBROMDEN Thank you. \nAnother beat. \nMCMURPHY Say...

You, too, Scanlon. (tosses ball to Harding) You take it out, Harding! \nHarding takes the ball and passes it in to McMurphy, who turns and dribbles down court exactly like Harding did. \nHARDING (running alongside McMurphy) Pass the ball! (no response) Pass it! (no response) Pass it! Pass it! I'm open, McMurphy, pass the ball! \nMcMurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at Harding.

(leaning in close) A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am... \nDown the hall, Rose sticks her head out the door, sees what's happening, and ducks back in as the Night Supervisor turns on her heel and starts back down the hallway, Turkle at her heels. \nNIGHT SUPERVISOR I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle! \nTURKLE Yes, ma'am... \nNIGHT SUPERVISOR And you haven't heard the last of this! \nTURKLE Yes, ma'am... \nShe opens the gate, slams it behind her, crosses to the main door, opers it and exits to: \nTURKLE (CONT'D) (calling after her) Night, night. \nTurkle turns and the smile leaves his face as he hurries down the hallway. \nO.S. the TOILET FLUSHES as Turkle stops at the seclusion room and sticks his head in. \nTURKLE (CONT'D) Be right back, honey... \nTurkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station, and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine. \nINT.

A long silence, then another NUMBER begins as McMurphy, who has nodded off, starts awake and looks around. \nMcMURPHY'S POV \nBromden sits by the window waiting. \nCheswick is asleep on the table. \nMartini and Scanlon are sitting in their wheelchairs filling their cups from through the enema tube. \nHarding sits, maintaining his aloofness, smoking a cigarette. \nSefelt is sitting on the floor, in a drunken stupor, while Fredrickson dances around him. \nCandy and Billy stand, locked in each other's arms, swaying to the MUSIC. \nMcMURPHY \nstruggles to his feet, steadies himself, crosses to the nurses' station. \nINT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT \nas McMurphy enters and goes to Turkle, who is dead asleep. McMurphy lifts Turkle's keys and leaves. \nINT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT \nas McMurphy crosses to Billy and Candy, and gently parting them, he puts his arms around them -- as much for support as affection. \nMCMURPHY Come on, you lovers, it's gettin' late... \nThey move toward the hallway. \nBromden and Harding are the only two who watch them go. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nas McMurphy passes several doors, reaches the door of his choice, fumbles with the keys, finds the right one, and opens the door to the seclusion room. \nMCMURPHY (standing aside) In ya go... \nBILLY (holding back) M-M-M-Mack? \nMCMURPHY It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay... \nCandy and Billy, hand in hand, enter the small room, which has a bed in it. \nMcMurphy closes the door, looks at the keys, and pockets them. CAMERA TRACKS with McMurphy, who is a very weary man, back into the day room. \nINT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT \nMUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER as McMurphy crashes heavily into his chair. He can hardly keep his eyes open as he looks around. \nHarding sits nearby. \nTaber is lying on a couch, his head in Rose's lap. \nCheswick is asleep on the table. \nEllis stands nailed to the wall. \nBromden sits by the window -- waiting.

DAY ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nas Washington jostles McMurphy awake. \nWASHINGTON Come on, get over there! \nMcMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are lined up. \nIt is morning and the day room is a mess: \nA few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles. Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked into sticky masses. \nRose sits by herself on the couch. \nBromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse waits. \nINT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING \nas Big Nurse, still on the phone, sees Miller go sprawling across the floor. She grabs the intercom. \nBIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Washington! Warren! To the day room, immediately! \nINT. DAY ROOM - MORNING \nMcMurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps Candy and Rose out as Washington and Warren converge on them. McMurphy and Bromden wheel around. \nWashington, Warren and Miller appear around the corner, take one look, and head straight for McMurphy. \nWASHINGTON (stopping just short) 'Kay, let's have the keys an' nobody get hurt! \nWashington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her). \nBig Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station and head down the hallway. \nMcMurphy is glued to the spot. \nCANDY (calling from outside) Come on, come on, let's go! \nMcMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the hallway. \nINT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING \nCAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients, who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients. The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is stricken by what he sees. \nMcMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE \nThe office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up, hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of Spivey's family, lies nearby. \nMCMURPHY Billy, oh, Billy boy... \nMcMurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside Billy's body. He gently lays his hand on Billy's face. \nBIG NURSE Get away from him! Don't you dare touch him! \nMcMurphy turns and leaps at Big Nurse, grabbing her throat; he drives her into the Acutes and Nurse Pilbow. \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nas McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse. \nNurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes as he passes out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nMUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to Martini, \nScanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson. \nTaber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of paper. \nRuckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands. \nBancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over, \"Tired... awful tired...\" Ellis stands against the wall, arms outstretched. \nHARDING (V.O.) (over last scene, in McMurphy's style) Okay, suckers, place your bets... \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nBromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the visitors' room, when a key hits the lock. Bromden looks up expectantly. \nBROMDEN'S POV \nas Sefelt and Miller enter the visitors' room, cross to the security gate and pass into the hallway. Bromden goes back to his mopping. \nINT. DAY ROOM - DAY \nas Sefelt jauntily enters the day room. \nBIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Did everything go well, Mister Sefelt? \nSefelt turns to the nurses' station where, inside, Big Nurse sits very erect, wearing a back brace that reaches up around her neck. Sefelt shows his teeth and gums to Big Nurse. \nBIG NURSE (V.O.) (CONT'D) (through loudspeaker) That's very nice. Now, doesn't that make you feel better, Mister Sefelt? \nSEFELT Yes, ma'am... \nBIG NURSE Good... \nShe turns back to her work. \nSefelt crosses to the card game, where he sits and catches Fredrickson's attention; showing him his teeth. Fredrickson smiles at Sefelt and blows him a kiss. \nHARDING (who has been dealing) Big Ace... a lovely lady... another ace... an' a little trey, hey, hey, whadaya say... hit or sit? \nSCANLON Hit! \nSEFELT (to Fredrickson) Ya know what, Fred? \nFREDRICKSON What? \nHARDING (dealing a card to Scanlon) Big king, too bad... \nSEFELT Just wait till you hear... \n", "test1_input": "Several Acutes look at them. \nScanlon and Martini's hands go down. \nMcMurphy can't believe his eyes. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) (politely) I count only two, including you, Mister McMurphy. Certainly not enough to change ward policy. \nMcMurphy's hand goes down. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy? \nMCMURPHY No way. \nCHESWICK No way. \nMcMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand pieces. \nBIG NURSE (checking her watch) Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to begin? \nShe looks around. \nMcMurphy is slouched in his chair. \nHarding puts his hands up. No one else does. \nBIG NURSE (CONT'D) Yes, Mister Harding? \nHARDING Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function... (he stops, chews his lip, then continues) Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect... \nHarding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his forehead and chew his nails. \nHARDING (CONT'D) To reflect... \nANGLE \nSilence as the CAMERA REFLECTS: the room, the patients, the staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees, the sky, ending on. \nMARTINI (V.O.) Hold it a minute. What's a man need to buy thum hotels? \nINT. TUB ROOM - NIGHT \nBromden is pressed against the wall, watching McMurphy, Martini, Scanlon and Cheswick play a game of monopoly. The others are playing cards or just hanging around, a little chagrined. Billy is most disturbed by this separation. \nMCMURPHY You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes. \nMARTINI Hold it a minute. \nThere's a flurry of money from Martini, red, green and yellow bills blowing in every direction. \nCHESWICK Let's go, for Christsakes... \nMCMURPHY It's your dirty roll, Cheswick. \nCheswick rolls the dice. \nMCMURPHY Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars. \nCheswick starts counting out the money. \nMARTINI What's thum other things? Hold it a minute. What's thum other things all over the board? \nCHESWICK (to Martini) How can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute... \nMCMURPHY You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon. \nSCANLON Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go... (throws the dice) Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini... \nMartini picks up a house... \nSCANLON (CONT'D) Not that one, you crazy bastard, that's my house... \nScanlon grabs Martini's hand and tries to get his piece back. Martini won't let go. \nMCMURPHY Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody. \nBILLY (from the next table) Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway... \nMcMurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the monopoly pieces flying. Martini is crestfallen. \nMCMURPHY What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote! \nHARDING A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend. \nMCMURPHY It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will! \nCHESWICK Right! \nFREDRICKSON Oh, yeah? \nMCMURPHY Yeah! \nSEFELT Big man! \nMCMURPHY Yeah, how much you wanna bet? \nSEFELT On what? \nMCMURPHY That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery! \n", "test1_true": "MCMURPHY That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do. \nMcMurphy sits and resumes his game of solitaire. Martini and Scanlon are putting the monopoly game back together again. \nBromden spots (or he thinks he spots) one of the attendants listening at the door. He wants to warn the others, but doesn't know how. \nSEFELT Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched his big thing an' she'll open the door for him. \nSefelt and Frederickson smile at each other. \nBromden slides along the wall toward the door. \nMCMURPHY Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt. \nSEFELT (CONT'D) Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy. \nFredrickson and Sefelt snicker in their hands. \nMCMURPHY You think it's funny, huh? \nTABER Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place! \nBromden reaches the door and looks out. No one is there. \nMCMURPHY Put your money where your mouth is, Taber. \nTABER (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy! \nBromden turns back to the room to see McMurphy slam his fist down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying. \nMCMURPHY (rising and turning on the others, who back off) You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how! \nTABER (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how! \nMCMURPHY All right! \nHe looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses to it and smacks it with his hand. \nMCMURPHY With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how! \nHARDING You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window? \nMCMURPHY You're fuckin' A-right, I am! \nHARDING (CONT'D) With your own two hands? \nMCMURPHY You heard me the first time! \nTABER I'll bet a buck you don't do it! \nMCMURPHY You're on! \nBILLY M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing! \nMCMURPHY Stand aside, son. Any more takers? \nSEFELT I'll bet a dollar. \nFREDRICKSON Me, too... \nMCMURPHY Right! \nMARTINI A nickel. \nSCANLON A dime. \nMCMURPHY Okay. Who else? \nHARDING Twenty-five dollars. \nMCMURPHY (knows he's taking a bad bet) Okay, Harding, you're on. \nHARDING Okay, sucker. \nMCMURPHY Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen! \nThe Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine. \nHe shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each side, and strains. \nBromden watches, in awe of McMurphy. \nMcMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for a better position. \nHARDING Giving up? \nMCMURPHY Just warmin' up. \nHe grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the strain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall. There's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath. He opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a pocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands are frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the floor and walks out. At the door, he turns back. \nMCMURPHY But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as hell did that much. Didn't I? \nMcMurphy exits. \nREACTION SHOT OF ACUTES \nSHOT OF BROMDEN \n", "test1_id": 1983, "test2_input": "MCMURPHY You can come back later! \nHARDING I don't trust you! \nMCMURPHY (looking for another victim) Scanlon out! \nSCANLON No! \nMCMURPHY Martini out! \nMARTINI No! \nMcMurphy looks at Billy. \nBILLY I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack... \nMCMURPHY Good boy, thank you, Billy. \nBilly goes off and sits by Big Nurse. Now, the lineup on the bench is Billy, Big Nurse, Candy and Rose. \nSpivey blows the whistle. \nUnder the Aides' basket, Harding passes the ball into McMurphy, who dribbles to half court, takes his mark, and lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the Aides right into Bromden's waiting hands. Bromden turns and slams the ball into the basket. \nThe crowd goes bananas.

McMurphy turns and gives them his ass to contend with, then manages to throw the ball under his legs and Washington's legs.

Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 6 \nBromden starts striding down court when the Aides make a fast break past him, but miss their shot. \nMcMurphy retrieves the ball as Bromden, not more than several feet from his own basket, does an about-face and returns to his basket where he turns to see McMurphy lob the ball full court to Bromden, who catches the ball on one bounce, turns and slams the ball in for another basket. \nScore: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 8 \nThe crowd goes bananas and Bromden turns and starts striding down the court when he sees McMurphy at the far end of the court yelling at him. \nMCMURPHY (yelling and gesturing) Run, Chief, run! \nBromden gets the idea and starts loping down court abreast of Washington, who is making another fast break towards his own basket. \nWashington and Bromden go up together and Bromden swats the ball to Scanlon. \nMCMURPHY (yelling and gesturing) Run, Chief, run! \nBromden starts running towards his own basket, Washington hot on his heels, when the ball is passed to him and he goes up, makes the point, but takes a bad spill, crashing head over heels to the floor. \nThe crowd gasps.

Down it goes. \nMcMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth, holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice. \nMcMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him. \nHARDING Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy? \nTABER Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too much for ya? \nMcMurphy holds the pill up and flicks it into Harding's forehead. \nMCMURPHY You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh? \nHARDING I don't see you scoring any points, buddy.

A beat when TURKLE, a fifty-year-old Negro night attendant, slightly drunk, lays a gentle hand on Bromden's shoulder. \nTURKLE Le's get back to bed, Mistah Bromden... \nBromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself. \nBromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees McMurphy looking at him. \nBromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in the eye. \nMCMURPHY (whispering) Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'. (sings) Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite?

SHAW Naturally. (he looks up) Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me? 
JIM (humorless) Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald? 
SHAW You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison. 
JIM Please answer the question. 
SHAW Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste. 
Jim shows Shaw a newspaper clipping. 
JIM Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities. 
SHAW I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper. 
JIM It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960. 
SHAW Nonsense.  What next? 
JIM ...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans... 
SHAW Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world. 
JIM Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency? 
Shaw glares at him.  Silence. 
SHAW (with powerful contempt) And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you? 
JIM No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops. 
SHAW (rising) May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost. 
JIM I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president. 
SHAW Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line! 
Susie and Bill quiet Jim down. 
BILL Come on, chief. (as he shows Shaw to the door) I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, it's getting late.  That's all the questions we have.  Thank you for your honesty and for coming in today. 
SHAW I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen, and you, Miss Cox.  It was most pleasant.  I wish to extend to each of you - and to each of your families - my best wishes for a happy Easter. (he exits.) 
JIM (beat, excited) "One may smile and smile and be a villain."  Goddammit!  We got one of 'em! 
GARRISON'S HOME THAT NIGHT (1967) 
Jim walks in, contrite.  Liz is shutting down the house. Some of the kids are still up. 
JASPER Daddy!  Where have you been? 
JIM (kisses Liz) Hi, Freckle Face. 
LIZ (seething) Hi. 
JIM Tough day. 
LIZ My sympathies. 
JIM Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected. 
LIZ We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim. 
JIM I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind. 
LIZ I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim! 
JIM I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis. 
LIZ That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day. 
JIM (angry, turns away) It's going to get worse, honey. 
GARRISON'S OFFICE HALLWAY - MORNING(1967) 
Jim, is coming down the corridor with Broussard, is confronted by some 20 local journalists and TV crew members.  We hear a hubbub of fierce questioning - ad libs but Jim, puzzled, brushes by, seeking refuge in his office.  Lou, Al, Numa and Susie are all waiting for him.  The regular staff - some 30 people - are looking, wondering.  Lou presents him with the front page of the New Orleans States-Item. 
LOU Congratulations, Boss - you're page one! 
We see a close-up of the headline: "D.A. LAUNCHES FULL J.F.K. DEATH PLOT PROBE - Mysterious Trips Cost Large Sums." 
INSIDE GARRISON'S OFFICE 
JIM (striding into his office reading the paper) Goddamn Sam! 
LOU And it ain't pretty (reading the copy) ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 
NUMA They went to the public records and got the vouchers we requested for withdrawals. 
SUSIE Shaw must've gotten them on our tail. 
AL Could be Ferrie, Martin, Andrews, any of 'em. 
BILL We didn't talk to Ruby 'cause of them and they're on our asses for a measly $8,000! 
Jim, at his desk, finishes reading the article.  A huge picture of him is on the front page.  He puts down the paper, reaching for a long, gold pen that is part of the desk set.

{"train": "A TRACKING POV SHOT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe battle's grim aftermath, an almost surreal vision of the ravages of war. Apes scavenge for weapons, stripping GUNS AND AMMUNITION off the bodies of fallen human soldiers... WE CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD A TRENCH, where APE BODIES are being lifted out and SCORES OF WOUNDED attended to... as we get closer, apes in the recess below look slowly up at us with reverence... We move DOWN INTO THE TRENCH, more and more apes reacting, nudging each other, alerting everyone to our arrival, even the injured raise their heads... \nREVEAL CAESAR \nas he strides through the trench; the POV was his. He looks older now, but even more imposing. His hardened expression reveals nothing... but in his eyes we see deep pain, as he takes in the terrible loss and suffering... \nHe's trailed by TWO GORILLAS, flanking him on either side: his grizzled lieutenant LUCA and a younger, smaller ALBINO (WINTER), who looks overwhelmed by the carnage around them... \nThe three of them finally arrive at an area UNDER earth cover, where they find A GROUP OF HUMAN SOLDIERS on their knees, helmets lowered, hands bound behind their backs. Spear and other ape warriors stand guard. Seeing Caesar, Spear supplicates deferentially. \nCaesar turns to the prisoners as they lift their frightened eyes to his. We see Preacher among them. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBut one soldier's helmet is still lowered. Spear reaches down and yanks the helmet off -- revealing Red. Red defiantly avoids Caesar's gaze. \nSpear tosses the helmet to Caesar. Caesar examines it, sees the hand-drawn \"A.\" He looks at the other soldiers, notices the same symbol crudely tattooed on one of the soldiers' arms, sees it scrawled on some of the uniforms. His eyes find it again on the front of Preacher's helmet. \nPREACHER (nervous, quiet) ...it's... Alpha Omega. \nCaesar just stares; then LANG, a lean female soldier, \"A\" tattooed on her neck, speaks, quiet defiance under her fear: \nLANG Means we're the beginning and end. Humanity's survival depends on us. \nJust then, the apes around Caesar turn, reacting to the arrival of -- \nMAURICE, the orangutan. Like Caesar, he's older; there's a weariness in his eyes that suggests the war has taken a toll on his gentle spirit. Caesar turns to his old friend. \nMAURICE (signs gravely) [Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.] \nCaesar glowers at the soldiers. We see Preacher still staring up at him... finally getting up the courage to utter: \nPREACHER You're him... You're Caesar. \nCaesar's eyes go to Preacher, caught off guard. \nPREACHER (CONT'D) We've been looking for you for so long. We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it. Some of us were starting to think you might be dead. But Colonel McCullough said no, you were out here somewhere... \nCaesar doesn't respond, just keeps glaring at the soldiers. Another soldier (TRAVIS) speaks up -- nerves frayed: \nTRAVIS Just kill us already... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nLANG Shut up, man -- \nTRAVIS What? They're animals, he's gonna slaughter us -- \nCaesar slowly steps toward him... Travis falls silent. \nAnd at last CAESAR SPEAKS, a dark edge in his voice: \nCAESAR I... did not start this war. \nThe humans all hold their breath, gaping up at him. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him. (then, harder) I only fight now... to protect apes. \nTRAVIS (steeling himself) Yeah? What about him? (glances at Red) And we got ten more just like him. \nCAESAR I know these apes. They followed Koba... (looks Red dead in the eye) They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive. \nRed glares up at Caesar -- and for the first time he unexpectedly SPEAKS in PRIMITIVE, BASTARDIZED LANGUAGE: \nRED I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything. \nHe looks over the apes, who seem chilled... his eyes boring into Winter's; the young gorilla is unnerved -- \nRED (CONT'D) He say: first Caesar die... then you all die. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nSpear ERUPTS, hurling Red to the ground -- when Caesar puts a hand up. Spear restrains himself, eyes still blazing. Caesar looks to Luca, then signs: \nCAESAR [Get him out of here.] \nLuca turns to Winter. Winter gathers himself, then drags a resisting Red away. The humans watch, fearful... then turn to Caesar, awaiting their fate... Luca signs, ominously: \nLUCA [What should we do with them?] \nCUT TO: \nBOUND HUMAN WRISTS, AS APE HANDS CINCH A KNOT TIGHT -- \nREVEAL PREACHER, LANG, TRAVIS, AND THE OTHER TWO SOLDIERS on a pair of horses, their hands now TIED to the reins. Apes on the ground surround them. Preacher looks at Caesar. \nPREACHER You're letting us live...? \nCAESAR Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die. \nThe soldiers look at him, fear and defiance in their eyes. Caesar nods to Luca -- who SWATS the horses' hindquarters, sending them on their way. The stunned humans peer back at the apes as the horses carry them off. \nINT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - COUNCIL ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER \nCAESAR'S SYMBOL carved into the stone floor; around the symbol sit Caesar and Cornelia, Blue Eyes, Lake, Rocket, Maurice, Luca, Winter and other COUNCIL MEMBERS. \nA MAP is laid out on the floor; Cornelius presses his face close, watching Blue Eyes' finger as it points to one spot in particular: \nBLUE EYES (passionately, to Caesar) [This is it, Father. We can start over. A new home.] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCornelia scoops Cornelius into her lap, gently pulling him away from the map -- she looks at Blue Eyes, intrigued, points: \nCORNELIA [What is beyond those mountains, son?] \nBlue Eyes picks up a pouch beside him and digs his hand in, removing a fistful of SAND; he spills it out dramatically -- \nBLUE EYES [A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.] \nCornelia smiles, nodding -- she and Caesar exchange a proud look -- when Winter cuts in anxiously: \nWINTER [We must leave tonight!] \nLAKE [Tonight?    That's impossible!] \nWINTER [How much longer can we wait?      Soldiers are getting closer!] \nBLUE EYES (touching Winter's arm) [Winter...] \nWinter shrugs him off -- Luca and the others all erupt angrily at Winter -- Caesar stands imposingly. Winter immediately lowers his head, afraid; then, to Caesar: \nWINTER [Your son's been gone, he doesn't know how hard it's been!] \nBLUE EYES [I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...] \nCAESAR Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely. \nEveryone looks at Caesar as he sits. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) There were two of you. But we are many. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nMAURICE (concurring) [The woods are filled with soldiers.] \nEveryone falls silent.   Blue Eyes meets Caesar's gaze: \nBLUE EYES Father... We must try. \nCaesar looks at his son, emotional: \nCAESAR I know, son. (he turns to the others) More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer. \nCaesar looks back down at the map, deep in thought; then feels the anxious stares of the apes around him. He looks at them, trying to reassure, though he is still uncertain himself: \nCAESAR (CONT'D) We will find a way out... \nHe raises his fists and brings them together, solemn: \nCAESAR (CONT'D) Apes together strong. \nThey return the gesture, nodding faithfully at their leader. \nINT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - CAESAR'S DWELLING - NIGHT \nA small cave in the upper levels of the fortress, enclosed on one side by the ROARING FALLS. Caesar sits up, awake, as his family sleeps around him. Troubled, he studies Blue Eyes' map in his lap -- when suddenly he feels something... \nCaesar looks down to see Cornelius instinctively hugging his leg as he rests, nuzzled beside his mother. Caesar gazes down protectively at his little one, strokes his head, then turns to look back at the map -- when he notices Blue Eyes staring up at him through heavy lidded eyes. \nBLUE EYES [Can't sleep?] \nCaesar shakes his head, his worried gaze returning to the map. Finally, Blue Eyes reaches out and touches his father's arm; Caesar turns. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBLUE EYES (CONT'D) [Trust me, father. This is a risk worth taking.] \nMoved, Caesar nods; he reaches out and gratefully caresses his son's face, then SIGNS, smiling: \nCAESAR [I am so proud of you.] (then) [I love you, son.] \n-- when suddenly a SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT washes briefly over both their faces... \nStartled, Caesar looks up at the falls to SEE -- \n-- THREE SHAPES distorted surreally in the water, each haloed in green light as they descend rapidly from view. \nUnnerved, Caesar sits up, unsure of what he's just seen. Blue Eyes watches as his father approaches the falls warily, moving in very close... when Caesar sees a STRANGE THIN LINE, whipping about in the current...? \nHe reaches toward THE LINE, mystified -- then plunges his arm deep in the water, grasping for it -- \n-- he pulls the line toward him... revealing a taut section of RED NYLON CLIMBING ROPE, straining against the current... \nAlarmed, Caesar immediately turns back to Blue Eyes and signs, urgent: \nTIGHT ON CAESAR as time seems to stop -- he's reeling, his entire world crashing in -- his eyes lift to the Colonel, a wave of rage rushing over him -- when -- \nTHE COLONEL quickly swings his gun off his shoulder -- \nCaesar DODGES FOR COVER behind the rocks -- as -- \nThe Colonel FIRES -- \nFrom the corridor we hear the furious ROAR OF INCOMING APES -- \nThe Colonel yells into his headset, backing toward the falls: \nTHE COLONEL Get me out! Now!! \nThen he turns -- and LEAPS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WATERFALL! \nCaesar raises his head just in time to see -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTHE COLONEL, barely discernible through the rushing water, clutching the swinging rope -- as HE'S PULLED UPWARD! \nApes spill into the cave as Caesar, desperate with rage, jumps to his feet, charging after the Colonel -- the apes watch in shock as -- CAESAR LUNGES INTO THE FALLS TOO -- ! \nEXT. WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS \nCaesar crashes through the water, hands flailing for -- \nTHE ROPE! He grabs at it -- IT CAREENS WILDLY!      Caesar holds on tight, looks up to see -- \nTHE COLONEL high above -- clinging to the suddenly jerking line -- he looks down to see \nCAESAR starting to climb up furiously after him... \nThe Colonel, unfazed, seizes a KNIFE from his boot as -- \nCaesar closes in, climbing, about to reach him -- when -- \nTHE COLONEL CUTS THE LINE -- and -- \nCaesar PLUMMETS -- down, down, down -- INTO THE RIVER BELOW! \nAn excruciating beat -- then Caesar SPRINGS UP from the water, gasping, enraged -- he peers up in agony to SEE -- \nTHE COLONEL disappearing over the TOP OF THE CLIFF! \nINT. CAESAR'S FAMILY DWELLING - LATER \nCLOSE ON Cornelia and Blue Eyes, as their lifeless bodies are lifted from the rock floor... \nREVEAL CAESAR watching silently, lost in his own world; still wet, he remains completely motionless, consumed with rage, pain. Beside him, Rocket, Luca and Maurice watch, shaken, as the bodies are carried away. \nJust then Spear pushes through, reporting to Luca: \nSPEAR [Luca! We can't find Winter.   He wasn't at his post.] \nLuca and Maurice suddenly exchange a worried look -- \nMAURICE [He was scared. Could he have turned against us?] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe looks to Rocket as well -- but Rocket's gaze is now fixed elsewhere. Maurice and the others all turn to see -- \nCAESAR has been following their conversation.     Finally, Luca signs, wracked with guilt: \nLUCA [Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us. I'm sorry. He was in my command.] \nCaesar remains silent; then: \nCAESAR My youngest son...   Have you found him yet? \nLUCA [We're still looking.] \nMaurice turns to the others: \nMAURICE [Let's help them search.] \nEveryone nods, following Maurice's lead as they shuffle out, giving Caesar some much-needed space... Finally -- \nCaesar is alone. \nHis eyes move to where he found Blue Eyes and Cornelia; there is blood on the floor. He steps closer, in a trance; sees -- \nTWO BRASS BULLET CASINGS on the ground. Caesar crouches, his expression intensifying as he reaches for the spent casings -- \n-- when he hears a NOISE behind him -- on a hair-trigger, Caesar seizes the spear, raising it furiously -- so gripped by animalistic rage that it takes a moment to realize -- it's his toddler son, peeking out from hiding in the rocks; Cornelius peers up in terror at his father, shrinking back. \nCaesar returns to his senses, lowers the spear... then, softening, he bends to the toddler and extends a hand... But Cornelius is still too frightened to approach, his eyes fixed on the spear in Caesar's grasp. \nAshamed, Caesar sets the spear on the ground, then holds both arms out to his son. \nCAESAR Cornelius... you're safe now, son. \nHANDHELD SHOT - PEEKING THROUGH THE TREES \nAs we move closer, we discover we are at the edge of -- \nA DESERTED R.V. PARK \nOld campers lined up, long-since abandoned. Smoke billows from a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of a rusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nREVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA \nspying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. They exchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp? They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when -- \nA LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest. \nHe's mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops in his tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then, very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood: \nMAN I'm just gonna... put this down -- \nHe drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to his shoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUST MISSES MAURICE, when -- \nBANG!   THE MAN DROPS DEAD.   Stunned, the apes turn to see -- \nCAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at the man he's just killed. The others regard Caesar's grim, steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack of remorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows something has broken within him. A line has been crossed. \nFinally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of their stares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man. \nThe others join him, looking down at the body. The tattered rags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn by the human soldiers. \"A\" is crudely tattooed on his arm. \nLUCA [Is he out here alone?] \nROCKET [Maybe he's a deserter?] \nCaesar doesn't respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTED CRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM... \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \nSuddenly a door is ripped open, and light spills in; we are -- \nINT. RUSTED-OUT AIRSTREAM - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe faces of the apes slowly appear, gazing warily in at us; Caesar and Rocket have their guns drawn. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThey stalk silently into the dim space, eyes roaming... It's long and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed and littered with improvised survivalist essentials. \nWe MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through the claustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place a human might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward... \nA CLOSED DOOR \nat the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tense looks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door! \nON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as he sees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL -- \nA LITTLE GIRL \ncowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lower bunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A little waif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildly matted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at -- \nCaesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing through his veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him, shocked at what they see. \nFinally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar's gun, gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but still shows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, to the others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them: \nCAESAR Look around. Take what we can use. \nCaesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasy look, then follow. \nBut Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with a mixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on the floor by the bed, starts to move toward it... \nTerrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawing as far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hoot as he reaches down to the floor and retrieves -- \nA CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates -- then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it. \nMaurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her. She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... as his finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll's head. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nShe blinks up, studying him, fear ebbing; she opens her mouth to speak, but no words come, just GENTLE, GASPING GRUNTS... \nCUT TO: \nA DUSTY COMPASS IN A BATTERED OLD LOCKBOX \nREVEAL LUCA picking it up, as he, Caesar and Rocket search the trailer. Luca sees a PAIR OF BINOCULARS in the box; he takes them too, along with some FLASHLIGHTS. \nImpatient, Caesar looks back, wondering where Maurice is -- when Maurice appears in the doorway, the Girl visible behind him, staring out curiously. Maurice signs to Caesar: \nMAURICE [Something wrong with her.   I don't think she can speak.] \nCaesar looks coldly at the Girl, then back to Maurice: \nBOYLE Shut up, Preacher -- what're you, a donkey lover now? I think you going soft coz that kong let you go. \nSome of the soldiers snicker. Preacher backs down, humiliated and angry. Boyle levels his gun at Winter again. \nBOYLE (CONT'D) Get me a new bowl. \nWinter looks nervously to Red.       Red nods soberly: do it. \nINT. DARKENED MOBILE KITCHEN TENT - MOMENTS LATER \nWinter digs under a supply table for a new bowl. Rising, he catches his reflection in a grimy mirror over a wash basin. He hesitates, maybe suffering a crisis of conscience -- when he sees A REFLECTED FACE lurking in the shadows behind him! \nHe spins to see CAESAR standing there, motionless, staring... \nPanicked, Winter turns for the exit -- but LUCA is there, blocking escape. Turns the other way -- and there's ROCKET. Winter's eyes widen as Caesar takes a slow step toward him... \nCAESAR Where is the Colonel? \nWinter swallows, trembling as he lifts his hands to sign: \nWINTER [He's gone.] \nCAESAR (dubious, stalking closer) ...Gone? \nWinter looks at the other apes, sees them closing in too... Turns back to Caesar, nervously explaining: \nWINTER [This morning. He took many soldiers with him.] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLuca and Rocket exchange troubled glances... but Caesar's eyes remain fixed on Winter as he continues his approach... \nWINTER (CONT'D) [Men are coming down here \u00ad- from their base in the north. The Colonel and his soldiers are going to meet them at the border.] \nCAESAR What border? Why? \nWINTER [I don't know. But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they'll all be coming back here... to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.] \nCaesar finally stops, right in front of him.    Winter pleads: \nWINTER (CONT'D) [Please... I know I betrayed you. But can't you see? We'll never beat them. I was just trying to survive. Red told me the humans promised to spare us if we helped. I beg you, forgive me...] \nBut Caesar is unmoved, barely stifling his rage... \nCAESAR My son... my wife... are dead. \nJust then -- we hear the LAUGHTER OF HUMANS outside; Winter turns, sees SHADOWS OF SOLDIERS passing on the side of the tent -- he opens his mouth to shriek to them -- but a HAND CLAMPS over his mouth, as Caesar wrestles him to the ground to silence him! The others rush in, holding Winter down as he struggles violently, desperately trying to shriek out -- \nThe SHADOWS OF THE SOLDIERS HALT, their laughter subsiding as their heads turn toward the muffled sounds in the tent -- \nSeeing this, Caesar furiously tightens his grip around Winter's neck -- but Winter won't stop, struggling even harder! Eyes fixed on the human shadows, Caesar grips fiercely... choking tighter and tighter... \n...until Winter finally relents. Caesar watches the shadows, tense... And at last, they move on. \nThe apes exhale relief. Luca and Rocket turn to Caesar -- but their eyes drift to Winter. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nCaesar follows their looks down to the young gorilla in his grasp... and discovers he has killed him. \nStunned, he stares at Winter's lifeless face... then, slowly, looks up again at Luca and Rocket, grappling with what he's done. They lower their eyes. \nEXT. DENSE WOODS - NIGHT \nTense silence. The apes and Girl sit by a fire, isolated in the trees; Maurice studies Caesar's face as he gazes into the flames, deeply unsettled. Then Maurice turns to the others, who look equally plagued. Finally, Rocket turns to Maurice: \nROCKET [Winter had it coming!] \nMaurice nods, uneasy; Luca looks up, convincing himself: \nLUCA [Caesar had no choice!] \nMAURICE [So what do we do now?] \nROCKET [Wait for the soldiers to leave.   Follow them to the Colonel.] \nMaurice turns again to Caesar, who is still in his own world, lifting a gourd canteen to his lips. He takes a drink... when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Girl beside him, staring at him guilelessly. \nHe looks at her askance for a moment, deadpan, then hands her the gourd, and she guzzles thirstily. Caesar watches -- \n-- when suddenly his eyes shift, startled to discover a DARK FIGURE on the other side of the fire... \nAlarmed and bewildered, Caesar peers through the flames... amazed to see it's AN APE sitting across from him, his head lowered ominously. Fire dances on Caesar's pupils as he stares at the figure, haunted... \n...when suddenly, the Ape lifts his face, grinning at Caesar through the distorting waves of heat -- Caesar looks haunted: \nCAESAR ...Koba? \nKOBA Ape... not kill ape... \nTIGHT ON CAESAR \nsnapping awake with a start -- we are -- \nBAD APE (nods) Listen to human... \nHis face abruptly contorts into an \"angry human\" expression -- he waves a chiding finger as he mimics: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) \"Bad ape!    Bad ape!\" \nThen, turning his head, he realizes the Girl has the shiny Chevy Nova emblem again -- he reaches for it, possessive: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) (gently admonishes) No... No touch. \nShe stares at it longingly as he sets it down. He looks back at the apes, smiles -- then rushes away for something else... \nThe apes all watch their excitable host, perplexed -- Maurice turns to Caesar, signs an aside: \nMAURICE [Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.] \nJust as Caesar begins to contemplate the mind-blowing thought, Bad Ape bounds back in, hurriedly passing out packages of vacuum-foiled food rations (M.R.E.'s). \nBAD APE Here! Eat, eat! (beaming) New friends. Special day. \nBad Ape tears the top off one, starts eating the dehydrated food, nodding encouragingly for them to do the same. \nCaesar looks slowly down at the ration in his hand -- notices an official military seal: \"U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER\" CUT TIGHTER on the word: BORDER. Caesar suddenly looks up: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nCAESAR Where did you get this? \nBad Ape turns to him, confused. Caesar holds up the package. Bad Ape looks uneasy... his voice lowering to a hush: \nBAD APE Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick. \nEngrossed, Caesar's eyes meet his... as Bad Ape continues: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad humans kill. Then get sick too. All dead now. All dead. \nCaesar and the others take this in, somehow haunted.   Then: \nCAESAR Bad humans...? Soldiers? \nBad Ape recognizes the word, nods gravely: \nBAD APE Soldiers. \nThe posse looks to each other with rising intensity... \nROCKET [An old, deserted military camp on the border...?] \nLUCA [Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?] \nCaesar nods: maybe.    He turns back to Bad Ape. \nCAESAR Is it far?     Can you take us? \nBAD APE (looks agog) Human zoo?! No... No go back there. Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here. Never go back! \nCaesar reaches out his hand, places it on Bad Ape's shoulder: \nCAESAR Please.     You must take us. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nBAD APE No!     Can not take!   Can not take! \nScared, he pushes Caesar's hand from his shoulder, a little too hard -- Rocket GRABS him, incensed \u00ad- but Caesar restrains Rocket, shakes his head no. Bad Ape shrinks in Rocket's grasp -- then sees something, and points desperately to the little windows along the wall -- \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay here. (to the others) Look, look! \nThey all look to the massive lobby window to see it is indeed snowing hard now. \nRocket finally releases Bad Ape.     He exhales, looks at them with renewed optimism. \nBAD APE (CONT'D) You stay here. Eat. Rest. (smiles hopefully) With me. \nCaesar considers, reluctantly nods to the others. Bad Ape is relieved -- when he sees the Girl staring longingly again at the Nova emblem; he grabs it, hands it to her ceremoniously: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Here.    You keep. \nHe looks around, smiling at the apes for approval; the Girl gazes happily at the emblem, as with a WHISTLING HOWL, we -- \nCUT TO: \nHIGH OVER THE CAVERNOUS LOBBY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT \nSnow whirling hard through the ice palace.        HOLD; CUT TO: \nNEAR THE HEARTH - SAME \nThe last embers of the fire dying out as everyone sleeps... \nCLOSE ON CAESAR \nThe only one still awake.    He sits up, eyes settling on -- \nThe group have left the trail, moving through dense forest. \nCaesar watches Bad Ape who peers anxiously ahead... to where SUNLIGHT spills in at the edge of the woods. Bad Ape turns to meet Caesar's eyes, fearful: \nBAD APE There... \nCaesar looks at the light, then turns to the others, raising his hand for them to stop. \nCUT TO: \nEDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER \nOn foot now, the group presses in close behind the trees at the forest's perimeter, squinting into the hard, low sun at -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAN ENORMOUS CANYON BELOW THEM \nSteep, snow-covered granite cliffs slope down in shelves, disappearing into an unseen expanse below. \nThe TOP OF A MASSIVE, PRISON-STYLE WARDEN'S TOWER pokes ominously up in the distance, from the center of the chasm. \nCaesar raises the binoculars, PEERING AT THE TOWER: sun flares off the cement and steel structure, stained with corrosion. Through the windows, it appears to be DESERTED. \nCaesar lowers the glasses, staring uncertainly -- when he notices something about the FADED CALIFORNIA STATE FLAG hanging from the tower -- he looks through the binoculars to examine it: the flag is hung upside-down... and a HUGE \"A\" has been painted in black across it. \nThen Caesar suddenly notices movement down below -- he shifts the glasses to find TINY SILHOUETTED FIGURES, just barely visible along the edge of the lowest visible shelf. \nCaesar turns, looks from face to face... then: \nCAESAR [Luca, let's take a closer look.] (to Rocket) [Stay here. Keep them safe.] \nRocket nods dutifully, and Caesar and Luca start off -- \nCUT TO: \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS - SUNSET \nThe HEAVILY SILHOUETTED FIGURES in the distance are still small, but from this closer vantage we can see now they're in the midst of placing a series of about twelve MYSTERIOUS, X- SHAPED STRUCTURES along the cliff's edge -- maybe this is some kind of defensive perimeter...? \nREVEAL CAESAR LOWERING HIS BINOCULARS; he looks confused as he turns to Luca, lying beside him on the edge of a ridge. \nLUCA [What are they doing?] \nCAESAR (shakes his head) I don't know... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCaesar turns back, looking through the binoculars again, trying to decipher this strange activity -- when Luca GRUNTS at him with quiet alarm. Caesar turns. \nLUCA (points) [What's that? A patrol?] \nCaesar looks -- \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS \nfinding a PAIR OF HORSES on a ledge right below. \nCAESAR (O.S.) Don't see riders... \nSuddenly AN OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE RISES directly in front of the binoculars -- Caesar drops the glasses to discover -- \nAN ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIER looming right above him, rifle raised! \nThe soldier pulls the trigger -- CLICK -- but the gun is jammed! Panicked, the soldier rears back, about to lunge forward with the rifle's BAYONET -- when -- \nLUCA DIVES PROTECTIVELY in front of Caesar -- \n-- taking the bayonet blade in his gut as he YANKS the man down, WRESTLING him to the ground! They roll violently, finally coming to a stop, Luca atop the motionless soldier -- \nCaesar's eyes land on the BLOOD-STAINED BAYONET, lying in the snow beside them -- he scrambles up, rushing to Luca -- \n-- when a SECOND SOLDIER steps out, startling Caesar -- about to shoot -- when -- \nWHAM! THE SECOND SOLDIER CRUMPLES, revealing Rocket behind him, having just clubbed him with the butt of a rifle. \nRocket looks to Caesar, signs regretfully, out of breath: \nROCKET [I saw them from up there... Coming for you...] \nThey both turn immediately to Luca... who is rolling painfully off the dead man; he looks at them helplessly, GASPING, clutching his gut... CUT TO: \nBACK UP IN THE WOODS - DUSK \nWaiting anxiously at the edge of the trees, Bad Ape, Maurice and the Girl stare as -- \nROCKET returns, climbing quickly up toward them, a grim expression on his face, clutching the bayoneted rifle in his hand... right behind him, CAESAR CARRIES LUCA across his back, like a Vietnam soldier shouldering a fallen brother. \nThey all retreat into the safety of the woods, the group converging around Caesar as he lowers Luca to the ground... \nEmotion in his eyes, Caesar looks down at his loyal friend. Fading fast, Luca smiles weakly. He manages to raise a hand, holding it out to Caesar; Caesar grasps it firmly. \nLUCA [At least this time... I was able to protect you...] \nCAESAR (CONT'D) Wait -- my little son -- is he here...? \nBut Spear just falls to the ground, Caesar watches aghast -- when an APE FOOT steps right beside him -- Caesar turns, startled -- looks up to see -- \nRED standing ominously right above him! The BUTT OF RED'S RIFLE comes SLAMMING DOWN into us -- and we SMASH TO -- \nBLACKNESS \nHOLD for a long moment. Hear the echoing sound of WATER SLOWLY DRIPPING. Then HARD CUT TO -- \nSUPER TIGHT ON CAESAR'S EYES \nas they wince open, disoriented, in pain, his face pressed to the ground... A SHAFT OF HARSH LIGHT blasts down from above. Water drops splatter around him. \nCaesar peers around, struggling to get his bearings, his POV drifting in and out of focus: he finds TRACKS embedded in the ground, a rusted-out TRAIN ENGINE in the shadows. The place was a depot of some kind. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe glances up at the cavernous, curved ceiling; sodium vapor security lamps shine in through a rip, which leaks melting snow. And then he notices -- \nAN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE LOOMING IN THE DARKNESS \na few feet away: it's PREACHER, tensely holding his crossbow, looking unsettled as he stands guard... when an unseen VOICE comes quietly from the shadows as WET FOOTSTEPS approach: \nTHE COLONEL (O.S.) Grant and Lee... Wellington and Napoleon... \nA SHAPE finally enters the light: it's THE COLONEL, who studies Caesar inscrutably: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Custer... and Sitting Bull. (then) You're probably not much of a reader. But this is... this is a big moment. This is... beyond... historic. \nCaesar glares up at him, rage welling... \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Where were you...? (then) We came upon your herd... we got lucky. But I was surprised. You weren't with them. \nThey stare at each other an intense beat... Caesar crawls menacingly toward him -- but is instantly YANKED BACK HARD. \nGASPING, Caesar reaches for his throat to discover his wrists are shackled and his neck is CHAINED by a NECK COLLAR... Writhing, he turns to see RED cruelly gripping the end of the chain. Preacher takes a step closer, levelling his crossbow threateningly; Caesar's eyes lock with his. The Colonel watches their stare-down: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life. He's quite a good shot. \nThe Colonel just watches Caesar a beat; beneath the chilling stillness of his eyes we sense something dangerous, damaged. \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Have you finally come to save your apes? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nCAESAR (still in pain, seething) I... didn't know they were here. (then) I came for you. \nThe Colonel searches Caesar's ferocious expression, surprised, something dawning on him for the first time: \nTHE COLONEL I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...? \nCaesar looks him right in the eye, unblinking... \nCAESAR My... family. \nThe Colonel stares down, some mysterious nerve jolted inside him. He comes closer, stands right above Caesar, looking at him for a long beat, something about this revelation churning in his mind; Red cautiously tightens his grip on the chain. \nTHE COLONEL I'm sorry.     I was there to kill you. \nCaesar just glares up at him, the Colonel so close... Struck, the Colonel inches even closer: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) My God, look at your eyes... they're almost human... (a long beat; then) How did you know I was here? \nCAESAR I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here. \nTHE COLONEL (a cryptic beat) Joining me...? \nCAESAR To finish us off... for good. \nTHE COLONEL (he smiles) Who told you that? \nBut Caesar won't answer. The Colonel just stares at him, then turns to Red and NODS: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Ok, let's go. \nRed quickly responds -- \nRED Ok -- ok, Kerna...! \nRed YANKS Caesar roughly to his feet; Caesar struggles, CHOKING -- as Preacher moves in too -- and we HARD CUT TO: \nEXT. PRISON CAMP - YARD - TRACKING SHOT - NIGHT \nMOVING with the Colonel, Red, and Preacher as they march Caesar into the frozen, desolate yard; Caesar steals a glance back at a CORRODED SIGN over the hangar: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER, PROCESSING DEPOT \nAs they walk along train tracks, Caesar turns forward, SEES SOLDIERS huddled around fires in front of temporary barracks, killing time -- they stare up at him menacingly -- up ahead -- \nA PAIR OF GUARD TOWERS LOOM \nMore HAND-PAINTED SLOGANS hang on signs, recalling the cult- like vibe of the base camp. Armed GUARDS stare down as they pass, straightening tensely at the sight of the Colonel -- \nCLOSE ON THE COLONEL \nwatching the brutality; he stops shaving a moment, calmly pulls a FLASK from his hip, and takes a slow drink; then he disappears into the tower again. \nCUT TO: \nCAESAR \nMARCHING gravely with hordes of apes across the snowy yard... ARMED SOLDIERS pace menacingly atop FUEL TANKER RAILCARS along the side of the camp, keeping watch over the prisoners. Caesar slows, suddenly struck by what's LOOMING up ahead -- \nTHE EXTREMELY HIGH BARRIER WALL \nthat seals in the front of the camp; it's unlike anything we've ever seen. Part of it is man-made, cracked slabs of weathered concrete erected side by side years ago; but a vast section, growing right out of the original wall, is ape-made. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMassive tree-trunks have been fastened in a primitive but elaborate framework, into which huge stones are being set, one by one. The apes have been rebuilding the crumbling wall. \nAs Caesar moves closer, his eyes are drawn to an old slab of cement, still standing in the midst of the ape construction. On it, \"A\" is painted in HUGE BLOOD RED GRAFFITI SCRAWL; next to this drip the words: \"HUMANITY'S LAST STAND\". Caesar stares at the words, chilled... as we CUT TO: \nEXT. THE WALL - DAY \nCaesar labors, just another slave in the sea of apes passing brutally heavy boulders to be laid into the growing wall, as Soldiers keep GUNS trained on them. Caesar squints out at even more apes perched dangerously on the rock shelf above the tanker cars, quarrying for the stones. \nBeside him, Lake heaves another boulder; Caesar peers past her at the apes around them; they look WEARY, GAUNT; on the framework above, EXHAUSTED apes -- Ape Elder among them -- battle to lift boulders on ropes. Lake sees the anguish on Caesar's face as he takes in the suffering, she signs: \nLAKE [We haven't had food or water since we got here...] \nStunned, anger fills his face; he glares up at the structure: \nCAESAR [Why do they need a wall...?] \nLake looks back at him, shaking her head: I don't know -- when Caesar sees -- \nTHE COLONEL arriving at the work site; his Soldiers nervously address him as his eyes roam the wall, surveying the progress -- then fix on Caesar -- when suddenly a SOLDIER CRIES OUT: \nBOYLE (O.S.) HEY!   HEY! \nThe Colonel turns to the commotion -- Caesar turns too -- to find Ape Elder struggling high up on the framework, dizzy with fatigue, losing grip on his rope as Soldiers and Turncoat Apes watch with alarm from below -- \n-- when he COLLAPSES, the rope ripping from his fingers -- the rock CRASHES into the framing, KNOCKING DOWN a big section of the stone wall in a violent chain reaction! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFurious, Boyle spins to one of the Turncoats -- Red. Caesar watches as he orders Red to punish Ape Elder; Red and the other turncoats pull the feeble ape from the rubble and drag him into the yard, in full sight of the Colonel, where Red dutifully begins to WHIP the old ape...! \nStartled, Caesar looks at the Colonel, who watches the beating, unmoved -- then back to the helpless old chimp -- \nON CAESAR \nas he steps slowly forward in horror, pained by the excruciating sight -- the apes in his line follow, affected too... Caesar pulls himself up onto one of the tree trunks in the framework, stepping into a CLOSE UP, his rage starting to boil... until finally, unable to bear it, he ERUPTS: \nCAESAR LEAVE HIM!!! \nHeads turn, everyone stopping dead in their tracks as CAESAR'S BOOMING VOICE ECHOES across the yard... Even Red goes still, turning with the others to SEE -- \nCAESAR UP ON THE FRAMEWORK \nGLARING back defiantly; then, he turns slowly to the Colonel, fury in his eyes, no concern for his own safety... \nFor a moment, the yard is suspended in TOTAL SILENCE as Caesar and the Colonel lock eyes -- when, one by one, the APES START TO CHANT... \nLow and guttural at first... then RISING INTO A DEAFENING CHORUS OF REBELLIOUS HOOTS AND SHRIEKS -- as they defiantly DROP THE STONES AND TOOLS to the ground! \nSurprised, Caesar turns... stunned by what he has started... he peers around at the apes, to find them all gazing at him in solidarity as they chant... \nCLOSE ON APE ELDER still on his knees, clutching his wounds, watching in awe as the protest reaches a fever pitch... \nThe Soldiers are at a loss as to how to restore order -- they turn to the Colonel who just stares ominously at Caesar... \nEyes fearfully on the Colonel, a SOLDIER FRANTICALLY GESTURES across the chaos to Red and the Turncoats: get him! \nCAESAR \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nturns as Turncoats and Soldiers approach (Preacher among them); unafraid, Caesar steps down to meet them -- his chain gang CHANTING protectively -- when the Turncoats GRAB Caesar! The Soldiers anxiously hold the others in check with their weapons -- as the roar of the crowd grows even LOUDER -- \nCaesar glares as Preacher nervously unclips his keys from his belt, tosses them to Red, who unshackles him... \nTHE COLONEL \nwatches as Caesar is marched into the yard, and thrust onto his knees beside Ape Elder. The Colonel considers Caesar; then, eyes still on him, gestures calmly to the Turncoats -- \nThe Turncoats tighten their grip on Caesar's arms -- and Red suddenly WHIPS Caesar's back with a VICIOUS SNAP! \nThe APES' CHANTING SUDDENLY FALTERS as -- \nCaesar WINCES -- but he refuses to break eye-contact with the Colonel, who stares back, a battle of wills... \nThe Colonel nods; and Red LASHES Caesar again! \nSpirits broken, the apes go SILENT; beside Caesar, Ape Elder drops his eyes. \nPREACHER (CONT'D) Look, I owe you one, so let me set you straight here, ok? I think he respects you, he does... that's why you're still alive. But believe me, he can do a lot worse than this. I've seen it. (haunted, almost a whisper) You do not want to agitate the man. Understand? So just... \nHe gestures with his hand: back off. Disturbed, Caesar holds his gaze; then watches as Preacher descends the platform... \nCUT TO: \nBEHIND CAESAR HANGING LIMPLY ON THE X - NIGHT \nWe're looking out past Caesar over the camp, as exhausted apes are herded away from the wall, the work day over... A diesel GENERATOR COUGHS to life, HARSH LIGHTS blinking on. \nCaesar squints into the glare, weary -- when the SOUND OF SOLDIERS makes him look below -- at a group approaching from the rear of the camp, rolling ominous-looking ARTILLERY; suddenly concerned, he watches them head toward the apes... \n...the fraught apes look alarmed as they see the weapons and Soldiers coming their way -- then Caesar discovers even more Soldiers with MASSIVE MACHINE GUNS by the wall. Unnerved, he sees them hoisting the guns up to the sentry towers... where others position them on tripods; but then Caesar NOTICES -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAll the weapons are POINTED OUTWARD, BEYOND THE CAMP... \nCaesar is relieved; he stares at the weapons, perplexed -- when he hears FOOTSTEPS; he turns to see -- \nRED climbing the platform toward him, gripping a long MACHETE with a look of cruel satisfaction... Startled, Caesar tenses; he peers around anxiously to FIND -- \nTHE COLONEL eerily watching from the warden tower window... \nChilled, Caesar turns back, bracing for the worst, as Red stops before him... He looks at the knife, then meets Red's cold gaze. Steeling himself, he hardens, his voice hoarse: \nCAESAR What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone? \nRed just stares, contempt in his eyes. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) No matter what you do... you'll never be one of them. (then) You let them call you \"donkey\"... You are ape. \nRed raises his knife, examining it in his hands; he runs his fingers along the edge... Then looks at Caesar, sneers: \nRED Koba right. You think you know better... than rest of apes. But look you now. (his expression darkens) You nothing. \nRed SUDDENLY LIFTS THE MACHETE -- Caesar's eyes widen as RED SWINGS DOWN AT HIM VICIOUSLY -- THWAP!!! THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE WOOD, AN INCH FROM CAESAR'S WRIST, HACKING THROUGH THE ROPE -- ! Caesar turns to Red in shock, as his arm is set free. \nRED (CONT'D) (menacing, quiet) Kerna... want see you. \nCaesar looks back up at the tower window where the Colonel remains staring a moment longer; then turns, and disappears. \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \nThen a DOOR IS OPENED, REVEALING -- we are -- \nINT. WARDEN'S TOWER - NIGHT \nThe Colonel stands with his back to us, leaning on a map- covered table in the former window-lined control center, smoke rises from sage and grass smudge burning in a tin bowl. \nCAESAR, PREACHER AND RED ENTER \napproaching the Colonel, who still doesn't acknowledge them; as searchlights outside sweep through, Caesar catches a brief glimpse of a room just off the control center -- it looks almost like a sanctum; light passes over APE SKULLS... the word \"HISTORY\" scrawled on a wall... then the room goes dark again. Caesar looks unsettled -- his gaze returning to the Colonel, and noticing for the first time painful looking BRAND SCARS on the back of his hands: one Alpha, one Omega. \nThe Colonel finally speaks, eyes still on the map: \nTHE COLONEL Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall. \nHe looks up coldly at Caesar, then nods at Preacher: that's all -- they start to lead Caesar out, but he won't go yet -- \nCAESAR Apes... need food... water. \nTHE COLONEL (eyes on the map) They'll get food and water when they finish the work. \nCAESAR Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish. \nThe Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar's audacity. \nTHE COLONEL You know you're very emotional. (then) What makes you think you're in a position to make demands? \nCaesar doesn't reply. The Colonel turns back to the map -- Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar's chain -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPREACHER C'mon -- \nBut Caesar stands firm, eyes fixed on the Colonel: \nCAESAR The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they? \nThe Colonel slowly looks up, smiles, suddenly intrigued -- as Red warily tightens his grip on Caesar's chain... \nCAESAR (CONT'D) I saw men outside by the wall... preparing for battle... \nThe Colonel studies him, surprised: \nTHE COLONEL I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive. \nHe stares at Caesar a moment; then finally: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) No.   They won't be joining me. \nPreacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturing closer to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety... \nPREACHER ...sir -- \nThe Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he stops right in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burns, tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage... \nTHE COLONEL What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me? \nCaesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar's angry stare as he starts slowly forward: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (6) \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Or is killing me more important...? \nThe Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns to Preacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we -- \nCUT TO: \nPREACHER AND RED MARCHING CAESAR OUT OF THE DEPOT - NIGHT \nThey head for the yard -- Preacher utters quietly, shaken: \nPREACHER Didn't I tell you not to agitate him? That was not smart, man... \nCaesar glances at Preacher, then at Red behind them; he turns forward, speaks softly to Preacher, a hint of sympathy: \nCAESAR If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can. \nPreacher turns to him; then abruptly stops: \nPREACHER Leave?     What are you talking about? \nCAESAR You are not like him. \nPreacher looks at Caesar, taken aback -- maybe even offended: \nPREACHER He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? (darkening) I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now. \nCaesar is stunned.    Preacher raises his crossbow: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPREACHER (CONT'D) C'mon, kong. \nHe glances back, nodding to Red O.S., and we -- \nCUT TO: \nHAND-HELD BINOCULAR POV AS RED SHOVES CAESAR FORWARD \nSnow drifts down around them as they march Caesar through the yard, past the soldiers' barracks, LIGHTS inside GOING OUT one by one... REVEAL -- \nON THE CLIFFS JUST ABOVE THE CAMP - NIGHT \nConcealed behind boulders, Rocket LOWERING THE BINOCULARS, gravely SCOPING OUT the camp -- as Maurice, the Girl on his back, and Bad Ape arrive next to him, climbing down rocks. \nMAURICE (worried) [How is he?] \nRocket shakes his head: not good. He rises, waves for them to follow him further down the mountain. They start to go... \nEXT. YARD - NEAR THE PENS - NIGHT \nCaesar waits grimly at the base of the platform, as Red unshackles his hands; Preacher stands guard, the X looming. \nCaesar looks up to discover APES gathered at the bars of their pen, unseen by Red and Preacher, whose backs are to them. Their starved faces are etched with worry for Caesar. He softens, eyes settling on Lake's gentle gaze as Red continues to unshackle him. Concern fills Lake's eyes: \nLAKE [You look weary.] \nCaesar looks back at her, then peers out at the MASS OF DISPIRITED APE FACES. Determination sets in; he steals a look at his captors, then signs discreetly to the apes: \nCAESAR [Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.] \nThe Apes return moved stares -- when Red hands Preacher back the key, and Preacher nods for Caesar to climb the platform. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLake and the others watch as Caesar, weakened, takes an exhausted step -- and suddenly STUMBLES, knocking into Preacher -- who shoves him back, startled -- \nPREACHER Get off! \nThe Apes look scared for Caesar as Red yanks him down. \nRecovering, Caesar lifts his head, glancing meaningfully back at Lake, then rises to his feet... \nConfused, Lake watches as Caesar continues up the steps -- when she notices CAESAR'S HAND slipping behind his back -- as the hand subtly opens, Lake suddenly SEES Caesar is carefully showing her something -- \nPreacher's shackle key is now concealed in Caesar's palm, its small key ring looped slyly around his middle finger. \nLake can't believe her eyes; with dawning hope she turns, points it out to the others -- their eyes widen, excitement spreading as they watch him ascend the platform... \nEXT. SNOWY CANYON FLOOR OUTSIDE THE PRISON WALL - LATE NIGHT \nRocket leads as the group sneaks along the base of the wall. They arrive at a spot where the wall has come down, steal a look around the edge, peering into the camp... \nRocket nods and as they start to explore deeper, we CUT TO -- \nANOTHER ANGLE FAR BEHIND THEM \nWe see the two apes and the light from their flashlight start to shrink from view -- REVEAL -- \nBAD APE \nwatching from the mouth of the tunnel in the hole they found last night. He gazes anxiously as they disappear -- when -- \nWe hear SHRILL, DISTANT WHISTLES blowing -- Bad Ape turns to see -- THE GIRL CLIMBING the rope ladder toward the sound -- \nBad Ape rushes to the ladder, calling up to her, alarmed -- \nBAD APE No no no -- no climb -- ! \nBut she continues, climbing out the top... Bad Ape clutches his head, torn about what to do; then reluctantly starts up -- \nAT THE TOP OF THE HOLE \nBad Ape pokes his head up... to find the Girl heading away -- \nON THE GIRL \nas she heads toward the edge of the rocks, drawn by something she sees in the distance -- \nBAD APE (O.S.) No, no!   Where you go?! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe appears, running after her.. He finds her SQUINTING out at something past the rocks... He follows her stare to ONE OF THE OPENINGS in the massive wall. He whispers to her: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) What?   What you see...? \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nMaurice and Rocket head down the tunnel -- \nROCKET [Must be under the camp by now!] \nThey stop in a cavernous concrete hub where the sewage tunnels converge -- \nMAURICE [Wonder how close we are... to where soldiers keep apes?] \nHe lifts his flashlight to the ceiling; they both look up -- \nCUT TO: \nA LOW ANGLE SHOT ALONG THE PRISON TRAIN TRACKS - DAY \nApes work on the wall in the distance, some HOISTING heavy BM- 12 ROCKET LAUNCHERS into place above -- when -- we HEAR a QUIET RUSTLING sound -- which continues as we PULL FOCUS to the train rail in front of us, and begin PUSHING TOWARD IT... \nAs we clear over the rail, we TIP DOWN to see the BALLAST GRAVEL under the tracks STARTING TO MOVE... The stones SHUDDER, and suddenly begin to FUNNEL DOWNWARD as we CUT TO -- \nTHE TUNNEL BELOW \nwhere a RUSH OF GRAVEL showers over Rocket, who stands on Maurice's back as Rocket claws through the earth above them. \nDAYLIGHT suddenly peeks in through a TINY HOLE in the surface. Rocket stops digging; he glances down at Maurice, then carefully presses his eye to the hole... \nROCKET'S POV UP THROUGH HOLE \nPeering up through the train tracks we can see A TALL METAL POLE looming against the winter sky. As we -- \nCUT WIDE TO THE CAMP ABOVE \nThe pole is revealed to be a TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH rising in an exposed area of the yard, Soldiers nearby on either side. \nCUT TO: \nCAESAR - SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS - DUSK \nHe is covered in frost and ice, shivering with hypothermia, very near death... \nBAD APE (O.S.) (quietly distraught) Ohhhh no, friend... \nREVEAL BAD APE - STILL AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING \nlowering the binoculars -- he turns to the girl to share the bad news -- \nBAD APE (CONT'D) He -- \nwhen he sees \nTHE GIRL \nalready starting to walk away toward the camp! \nBAD APE (urgent whisper) No! \nHe creeps out from behind the rocks after her    -- FRANTICALLY WHISPERING: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) No no no... no no no... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTANKER GUARD That's high enough, kong! \nCaesar submissively holds up his hands. The soldiers eye him a beat longer as Caesar returns to quarrying... then, coast clear, Caesar peers out at -- \nThe ROCK OUTCROPPING in the distance, outside the camp; he can just make out a DARK FORM behind the boulders -- CUT TO: \nHANDHELD BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR ON THE QUARRY LEDGE \nCaesar looking right at us, signing: \nCAESAR [37 steps to the adult cage...   55 to the children.] \nREVEAL MAURICE \nlowering the binoculars; he ducks down behind the rocks -- \n-- where the Girl and Bad Ape await his command. \nMaurice points to the Girl, then up at his eyes, looking around -- as if to say, \"You, keep a look out.\" The Girl nods back very seriously, his little soldier. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DUSTY COMPASS \nfrom the airstream trailer. The NEEDLE QUIVERS as the compass sits in a massive ape palm -- we are: \nINT. TUNNEL - AT THE CONCRETE-FILLED IMPASSE - DAY \nMaurice stares at the compass in his hand as Bad Ape watches, holding the flashlight... finally, Maurice lifts his head, and POINTS TO TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE TUNNEL WALL. \nBad Ape nods eagerly, moves to one of the spots, and STARTS TO DIG tentatively, looking to Maurice for approval; Maurice nods, goes to the other spot, STARTS DIGGING as well. \nEXT. HIGH OVER THE CAMP - NIGHT \nAt gunpoint, apes roll MASSIVE SOPHISTICATED ARTILLERY out of the depot at the base of the mountain, and along the train tracks toward the barrier wall... \nAT THE BARRIER WALL \nA cluster of POWERFUL GORILLAS struggle to hoist an imposing high-tech RAPIER MISSILE LAUNCHER up to the top of the wall -- \nREVEAL -- WIDE ON THE NOW COMPLETED WALL -- MORE RAPIER LAUNCHERS BEING POSITIONED BY APES AND SOLDIERS ALL ALONG THE EXPANSE. The display of sheer force is a formidable sight. \nON CAESAR -- WATCHING THE WALL FORTIFICATION \nas Red and Preacher march him across the yard amidst masses of weary apes being herded back to the pens; they arrive at -- \nCAESAR'S CAGE \nAs Preacher starts to unlock the door, Caesar's gaze shifts to Red, and then to the ANGRY WELT over Red's eye where Rocket head-butted him; Red glowers, self-conscious. \nPreacher opens the door, and Red shoves Caesar in. Then Red steps forward to remove the chain leash from Caesar's neck collar, pressing his face menacingly close to Caesar's: \nRED You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow... when wall is done. \nCaesar's eyes shift briefly to Preacher's, who looks away. Then he turns back to Red: \nCAESAR His wall is madness. It won't save him... any more than it will save you. \nRED I save myself. \nCAESAR Is there anything left... of you to save? \nA brief flash of uncertainty passes over Red as he meets Caesar's piercing eyes... then he musters a final hard stare at Caesar, and turns to go. \nCUT TO: \nBINOCULAR POV \nas the rest of the apes are prodded off the wall, the intimidating fortification now complete; REVEAL -- \nTHE GIRL \nWatching from behind the rocks. She lowers the binoculars, blinking out at the camp a beat... \nCUT TO: \nMOVING WITH THE GIRL THROUGH THE TUNNEL \nEyes wide, she searches for sign of Maurice or Bad Ape... She approaches the cement-filled impasse... finding TWO NEWLY DUG TUNNELS on either side of the blockage. She enters -- \nONE OF THE NEW TUNNELS \nShe heads toward the distant glow of a flashlight up ahead... Arriving behind Maurice, covered in dirt, still digging away. \nHe stops, noticing her. He looks at her quizzically -- points upward, makes a tentative thumbs up sign -- \"everything ok up there?\" She nods. He smiles: \nMAURICE [You are very brave.] \nShe looks at him, confused.     He gently repeats the sign: \nMAURICE (CONT'D) [Brave.] \nIT'S ROCKET. He stares down at Bad Ape, expressionless... and then a big smile spreads across his face. He turns excitedly to the look-out ape: \nROCKET [This is the ape I told you about.] \nThey all stare at him again, fascinated.       The look-out steps forward, and SIGNS to Bad Ape: \nLOOK-OUT [Thank you.] \nBut Bad Ape looks up insecurely, not understanding the sign; seeing this, the look-out slowly reaches down into the hole, OFFERING HIS HAND. \nBad Ape regards the hand uncertainly... then CLASPS it, beaming. He stares up at his new friend, then pats his chest with his other hand, bowing his head as he nods, quietly fumbling for a way to introduce himself: \nBAD APE ...Bad Ape. (shaking other apes' hands) Bad Ape... Bad Ape... \nMore and more apes jostle to get a look, greeting him warmly, Bad Ape overcome by the affection from this new family. \nDOWN BELOW \nMaurice peers up at Bad Ape above him, trying to get a look at what's going on -- when -- Nova tugs on his fur. He looks at her, and she points -- \nDOWN THE TUNNEL \nwhere a SMALL STREAM OF WATER is creeping toward them. \nMaurice looks at the ground beneath him as the water starts to pool around his feet; alarmed, he instinctively steps forward to investigate -- forgetting Bad Ape on his shoulders. Bad Ape tumbles to the wet floor, surprised. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMaurice spins, realizing; Bad Ape looks at the water around him, confused. As Maurice bends to help him, Bad Ape glances up, seeing something above -- Maurice follows his gaze to -- \nROCKET peering over the edge of the hole with concern.       His eyes lock on Maurice's, immediately sensing trouble -- \nROCKET [What's wrong?] \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAESAR'S CAGE - NIGHT \nCaesar waits alone, staring     tensely at the apes across the way, all huddled around the     hole, backs to us. Rocket suddenly breaks through the     crowd to report to Caesar, who has been anxiously awaiting     news. Rocket looks grave: \nROCKET [There's a problem.] \nAs worry creeps into Caesar's face, we CUT TO -- \nINT. TUNNEL - IMMEDIATELY \nMUD AND WATER GUSH IN through a WIDENING FISSURE in the wall where Maurice had been digging -- Maurice and Bad Ape try desperately to plug the opening with earth and rocks... \nEXT. YARD - THE PENS - NIGHT \nWe hear QUIET APE GRUNTING -- Caesar stands pressed to the bars of his cage looking across to a large group of apes gathered at the edge of their pen, all eyes fixed on Caesar. \nCLOSER ON THE PEN \nThe apes in mid-debate -- \nROCKET [We can't dig any further, it will flood the whole tunnel!] \nLAKE [If we don't dig further, we'll never get to the children! How are we going to get them out?] \nA sudden swell of APE GRUNTS echo the sentiment -- \nCaesar raises a hand to quiet the apes, peering around at the GUARDS PATROLLING THE CAMP to see if the noise alerted them -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nRocket and some of the others glance up at THE GUARD TOWER directly above Caesar's cage... where Boyle is leaning suspiciously over the ledge. Boyle listens for a moment -- then, hearing no more commotion, leans back. \nThe apes all pause warily for a beat; then Lake signs stealthily, worried: \nLAKE (CONT'D) [We have to keep looking down there, see if there's another way to reach the children...] \nBut Caesar shakes his head, gravely serious: \nCAESAR [We must leave tonight!] \nPained, Caesar turns behind him, glances at the children, all asleep in their pen -- he can see little Cornelius sleeping too -- he turns back to the other, decisive: \nCAESAR (CONT'D) [We'll have to get the children out above ground!] \nThe apes exchange tense looks; then all look back at Caesar: \nROCKET [How...?] \nEXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP - LATE NIGHT \nThe lights in the soldiers' barracks go out, one by one... \nUP BY THE GUARD TOWER OVER THE ADULT APE PEN \nBoyle steps slowly out onto the catwalk, quietly drinking from a steaming thermos, staring out into the distance -- \nWHEN SPLAT! He is SUDDENLY PELTED HARD in the back of his head with a handful of what looks like WET MUD from somewhere below. Stunned, he looks at himself, wiping the disgusting muck off: wtf?!

After a beat, the Colonel steps away from the window. Rocket looks anxiously at Caesar, raising the rifle: \nROCKET (CONT'D) [Now?] \nCAESAR (shakes his head) [Wait till he turns out his lights.] \nHOLD as they stare at the lighted window, waiting... waiting... SOUNDS OF FIERCELY GUSTING WIND rising... as we -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. YARD - WIDE ON THE TOWER AND PENS - LATER \nIT'S SNOWING HARD NOW, a fresh layer blanketing everything. And still, the Colonel's lights remain on.

His gaze shifts to Rocket, whose eyes are locked on Caesar -- \nROCKET [The sun will be up soon...] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTorn, Caesar steals a final look at the lighted window... then turns back to Rocket -- forced to make the call: \nCAESAR [We go now. Or die trying.] \nRocket nods -- he waits as the SEARCHLIGHT PASSES, then darts out of the pen, holding the stolen rifle -- crossing to Caesar's cage, as Caesar steps out -- they both streak -- \nTOWARD THE SOLDIERS' BARRACKS \nducking into an alley between the building and the children's pen -- they press against the barrack's wall, peering down the alley to see -- \nSOLDIERS PASSING BY THE CHILDREN'S PEN \nCaesar waits until the Soldiers cross out of sight -- then looks to Rocket, and they head for -- \nTHE CHILDREN'S PEN \nA small cluster of kids rush to the door as Caesar unlocks it; others stir from their sleep, scrambling over to see -- \nCaesar and Rocket enter. The little apes swarm around them, wide-eyed. Caesar gently pats their heads, shushing them -- when suddenly he sees HIS SON in the crowd. Cornelius breaks into a run, clambering up over the backs of the others... straight into Caesar's arms. Emotion floods Caesar's face as he tightly embraces his son... \nCAESAR (overcome, holding him tight) I love you, son... \nCUT TO: \nA POV THROUGH A DOORWAY AT A GUARD TOWER \nWe glimpse the side of the Guard's head as he stares down, eating -- \nREVEAL ROCKET, keeping lookout on the guard from the doorway; behind him the children are huddled with Caesar -- Caesar hustles the children toward a LIGHT POLE, quickly hoisting one after another up onto it -- \nCUT WIDER OVER THE CHILDREN'S PEN \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nwhere we see Caesar, Rocket and the children are on a second story landing, dangerously close to the Guard Tower -- the little apes scale the tall light pole, scrambling out onto -- \nTHE ELECTRICAL LINE \nsuspended high over the Guard Towers and camp -- \nAs SNOW SWIRLS HARD all around them, the children make their way back toward the adult pen -- directly over the heads of the unwitting Soldiers below! \nIN THE ADULT PEN \nThe children arrive on the wire above and begin dropping down silently, one by one -- into the waiting arms of Lake and other unchained apes -- the apes urgently hand the kids off to their anxious parents. \nAs the emotional reunions continue, Caesar (Cornelius clinging around his neck) and Rocket finally arrive overhead too, each dropping down into the grasp of the massive gorillas waiting below. \nCUT TO: \nMAURICE \nStaring up urgently from the hole in the adult pen... as Caesar and the apes converge above; Caesar and Rocket begin HANDING THE CHILDREN DOWN... \nIN THE HOLE \nMaurice lowers the kids to the tunnel floor; they look up to find Nova extending her hand... and they start off after her down the tunnel... \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) COLONEL! COLONEL!!! (turns to one of the men) OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR, SOLDIER! \nSOLDIER (O.S.) I CAN'T!     IT'S BLOCKED FROM INSIDE, SIR! \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) WHERE THE HELL IS HE?! \nSOLDIER (O.S.) I DON'T KNOW, SIR!

THEY'RE GONE!!! \nINT. WARDEN'S TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - PRE-DAWN \nCaesar silently climbs in the window; he looks around... and immediately spots an unnerving, incongruous sight -- \nTHE FRONT DOOR is BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE from the inside. \nConfused, Caesar looks around, sees the area in total disarray: a SMALL STOCKPILE OF MUNITIONS lie scattered chaotically across a table, alongside a tray of HALF-EATEN FOOD and the Colonel's SPILLED FLASK... \nSoaked in liquid from the flask is a PHOTO OF A LITTLE BOY; beside it OLD WAR MEDALS; Caesar peers around, wary: where's the Colonel...? \nEXTREME WIDE SHOT - IN FRONT OF THE CAMP \nA SERIES OF INTENSELY BRIGHT RAPIER MISSILES rip into the sky from atop the barrier wall, SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, illuminating the landscape below -- \nTOP OF THE HOLE \nBad Ape shudders, watching the missiles -- as they EXPLODE into the path of the armada -- TWO OF THE FRONT VEHICLES ERUPT! \nPanicked, he frantically urges the children -- \nBAD APE Hurry!   Go go go! \nWhen A SUDDEN ROAR AND BLINDING FLASH makes him turn to see -- \nARTILLERY SHELLS SOARING in return from the giant vehicles -- \nBad Ape LUNGES protectively over nearby children -- when -- \nBOOOOMM!!!    The SHELLS MAKE IMPACT 30 feet from the wall! \nDEBRIS HAILS DOWN on our group as they hug the ground! \nSMASH TO: \nTHE TUNNELS BELOW -- CROWDED WITH ESCAPING APES \nThey stop, look around in fear as the space RUMBLES VIOLENTLY around them -- alarmed, ROCKET begins pushing his way through the crush to get to the other end, gripping his rifle -- \nROCKET [Let me through!] \nSMASH TO: \nCAESAR IN THE WARDEN'S TOWER \nHe whips his head at the sound of continued shelling -- panicked, he rushes to the window to see INCOMING MISSILES FROM THE ARMADA beginning to make IMPACT INSIDE THE YARD -- ! \nWhen a QUIET CRASH comes from somewhere close behind him. Caesar turns, startled, gaze fixing apprehensively on a PARTIALLY OPENED DOORWAY; he steels himself, and slowly approaches the door. \nHe hesitates, wary... then carefully peers around the door frame, glimpsing a BROKEN COLEMAN LAMP at the foot of a small table; kerosine still pools from the lamp's base. \nBeyond the door, Caesar suddenly hears labored breathing... He pushes it open to REVEAL... \nTHE COLONEL'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN/INTO DAWN \nThe Colonel is splayed on his stomach across a military cot -- head lowered, his outstretched hand trembles mid-air as he struggles in a total daze, like a drunk, grasping helplessly for something out of reach on the table... HIS PISTOL. \nHeart racing, Caesar crosses silently to the table... eyes glued to the Colonel, he places his hand firmly on the gun before the Colonel can get to it. \nCaesar lifts the gun slowly, then trains it down at the Colonel beneath him, who is so out of it he continues listlessly groping for a gun that isn't there. \nCaesar glares down at the Colonel, pitiless... his expression hardening as he prepares to finish him, once and for all -- \n-- when the Colonel slowly lifts his head to peer up at Caesar... and for the first time, Caesar sees there is BLOOD smeared on his face from under his nose. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe Colonel's eyes look desperate, like a wounded animal's; he opens his mouth pleadingly, trying to speak -- but the only sounds that come are eerie, GASPING GRUNTS... \nCaesar stares back in utter shock -- when he notices something on the floor near the bed... \nMesmerized, Red watches motionless as Caesar charges fearlessly through the chaos toward the TANKER directly beneath gunners on the wall! \nCaesar continues through the smoke and debris -- finally grabbing one of the grenades from the bandolier -- eyes fixed on the tanker just 30 feet away -- rearing back, about to pull the pin -- WHEN SUDDENLY -- \nCAESAR DROPS, CLUTCHING HIS SIDE -- TUMBLING TO THE GROUND! \nShocked, Red watches as Caesar, in agony, touches his abdomen, discovering BLOOD; Caesar reaches behind him to find he's been shot in the back with a CROSSBOW ARROW... \nRed looks up to see -- PREACHER stalking through the haze and snow, out of the pen area, almost shocked himself at what he has just done -- he nervously loads another arrow, in turmoil as he moves toward Caesar. \nGasping in pain, Caesar SNAPS the arrow from his side, and turns, seeing Preacher too... \nRed stands frozen, gripped by the sight of Caesar lying there helpless -- \nGUNNER (O.S.) (CONT'D) GODAMMIT!!! \nRed turns, startled, to find the Gunner screaming at him, momentarily turned from the battle -- \nGUNNER (CONT'D) YOU STUPID DONKEY!!! WHERE'S MY LAUNCHER!?! \nRed suddenly looks at the weapon in his hands, remembering what he was ordered to do -- still returning to his senses, he nods to the Gunner -- who immediately turns back to the battle, FIRING RELENTLESSLY at the apes... \nCUT TO: \nCAESAR ON THE GROUND \nas he sees Preacher anxiously closing in... Caesar's eyes frantically dart for an avenue of escape, but there is none. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHis pained gaze returns to Preacher who comes to a stop just 25 feet away, hesitating, torn -- then, finally steeling himself, he raises the LOADED CROSSBOW -- when -- \nFSSSSSSST--KABLOOM! Preacher DISAPPEARS in a HUGE BLAST!!! AND EVERYTHING GOES INSTANTLY SILENT, THE SOUND REPLACED BY A QUIET RINGING -- \nStunned, disoriented, Caesar looks around him, deafened, finally peering up to discover -- \nRED ON THE WALL holding the SMOKING LAUNCHER, looking down stoically. \nCaesar can't believe it... He gazes up in shock at -- \nRED, who just gazes back, calmly holding the weapon, almost in a state of peace -- while BEHIND HIM -- \nTHE GUNNER turns, suddenly realizing what Red has just done, freaking out, his SCREAMING INAUDIBLE to Caesar's ringing ears -- the Gunner pulls out his PISTOL -- pointing it at Red, who doesn't even react -- we see just a split-second of his SILENT MUZZLE FLASH -- when we CUT -- \nCLOSE ON CAESAR \nas he takes in the grim sight, pained -- THEN -- \nTHE GUNNER turns and takes aim at CAESAR! \nCaesar scrambles, the sounds around him (and us) suddenly starting to return -- as -- he SNATCHES UP THE GRENADE from the ground beside him -- jumping to his feet -- \n-- narrowly dodging the Gunner's bullets tearing up earth around him -- as he PULLS THE PIN from the grenade, desperately LAUNCHING it straight for the tanker beneath the wall -- \nThe Gunner's alarmed eyes suddenly whip toward the tanker -- as Caesar takes off, sprinting in the opposite direction -- \n-- when the grenade EXPLODES and THE TANKER ERUPTS -- ENGULFING the WALL beside it, and consuming all the Gunners above in its INCREDIBLE BLAST!!! \nCaesar races into the adult pen -- as behind him, FLAMES CLIMB HIGH INTO THE SKY -- when SUDDENLY -- THE TRAIN CAR NEXT TO THE TANKER EXPLODES TOO! \nStill running, Caesar steals a startled look back -- as ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe DIVES down into the hole -- as -- \nWE CUT WIDE OVER THE CAMP -- AND THE CHAIN REACTION CONTINUES -- CARS ERUPTING ONE AFTER ANOTHER -- BLASTING THE CAMP APART -- HEADING BACK ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD THE DEPOT AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN -- A CATACLYSMIC DISPLAY OF DESTRUCTION SO LARGE, IT'S STAGGERING!!! \nSMASH TO: \nCAESAR RUNNING THROUGH THE TUNNELS BELOW \nAS THE SHOCKWAVES CONTINUE, THE TUNNELS GIVING WAY, BEGINNING TO COLLAPSE BEHIND HIM! \nCAESAR RACES FOR LIGHT AT THE TUNNEL'S END -- LEAPING FOR THE LADDER -- SCRAMBLING UP -- WHEN THE WHOOSH OF DEBRIS SUDDENLY SWEEPS AROUND HIM -- AND HE EMERGES -- TUMBLING OUT -- \nTHROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING \nAnd flat onto his stomach! \nFinally, he lifts his head to see the feet of apes all around, their backs to him -- as he rises, he finds them all staring out beyond the outcropping in awe... \nHe slowly presses his way through the crowd, climbing higher on the rocks... to discover their eyes all fixed on... \nTHE UTTERLY DECIMATED PRISON, engulfed in a massive conflagration as a STORM OF DEBRIS RAINS DOWN FROM THE SKY... \nNow seeing Caesar, Rocket and Bad Ape turn, stunned at the sight of him -- Caesar and Rocket begin to exchange emotional looks -- \n-- when MECHANICAL GROANS beside them make them all turn to see -- \nTHE REMAINING ARMADA as it finally arrives, braking to a stop just 20 yards away... SOLDIERS, FACES ALL OBSCURED in heavy parkas and BALACLAVAS, are packed onto troop carriers, trucks and humvees, gazing in shock at the fiery camp -- when ONE notices... the apes.

Yes sir, copy. Over. \nHe clicks off, quickly waves up more soldiers from the rear. They begin pulling weapons and ammo from heavy rucksacks that Red and TWO OTHER APE SOLDIERS carry on their backs.

I run. \nCAESAR You learn to speak...? \n", "test2_id": 346, "test3_input": "CUT BACK TO: \nCAESAR \ngazing nervously through the bars at the Girl, who stands at the Apes' pen, her back to us; she seems engaged in some transaction with them, the Apes all trying to get near her -- \nCaesar's eyes dart tensely around at GUARDS ON PATROL in the distance, unaware of her presence, but for how long...? \nFinally, the Girl turns and heads toward Caesar, CRADLING SOMETHING IN HER ARMS. Caesar watches curiously as she steps up to his cage. He glances at the APES IN THEIR PEN to find them all watching expectantly... \nCaesar turns back to the Girl; she leans forward carefully, as if about to spill the contents from her arms -- puzzled, Caesar reaches his hands out to catch whatever it is -- AND A LONG STREAM OF GRAIN RUSHES INTO HIS PALMS. \nSurprised, Caesar looks up at her... then out at the Apes in the pen, their eyes all still on him. One of them raises his hands, quietly pressing his fists together, SIGNING proudly: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAPE [Apes together strong.] \nA wave of emotion floods Caesar's face; and then he sees other Apes silently raising their fists too... Caesar is completely overcome as each and every one of them joins in. \nA smile slowly surfaces on Caesar's face; you can almost see his strength returning... \nThe Girl follows Caesar's gaze to the Apes and their up- stretched hands; then turns back to Caesar. She uncertainly raises her fists together too... smiling, proud of herself. \nMAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE \nwatch from behind the gate, affected by the sight -- when they spot something the apes and the Girl cannot yet see -- \nTHE COLONEL AND SOME OF THE OFFICERS IN THE DISTANCE \ndeep in conference, walking in the direction of the pens...! \nMAURICE AND ROCKET exchange terrified looks -- \nMAURICE [If humans see her, they will kill her...] \nCUT TO: \nON CAESAR AND THE GIRL \nas they SPIN, startled -- suddenly seeing the Colonel and troops stepping into view ten feet away -- when -- a sudden COMMOTION in the distance grabs their attention -- \nCaesar grunts urgently to the Girl, nodding for her to hide -- she presses quickly behind one of the guard tower legs -- just as the Colonel and troops stop in the path right before Caesar's cage, still gazing off at the disturbance... \nCaesar follows their looks to SEE -- \nA SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS, guns-drawn, amped up, shouting at AN UNSEEN INTRUDER... As they approach, prodding with their weapons, Caesar discovers the intruder is -- \nROCKET.   He marches slowly, chin-raised defiantly. \nCaesar watches in shock as Rocket is brought toward the waiting Colonel... who slowly turns and looks suspiciously at Caesar -- unaware of the Girl just behind the tower leg... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAs Rocket arrives at gunpoint, the Colonel gestures to Red. Red and Rocket exchange hard stares; Red moves to restrain Rocket's arms -- but ROCKET SUDDENLY RESISTS, thrashing into Red, HEAD-BUTTING HIM -- Red stumbles, clutching his head, stunned... then LAUNCHES furiously back at Rocket! \nThe two apes begin VICIOUSLY WRESTLING as the SOLDIERS WATCH, guns trained; a few LAUGH derisively, amused by the display -- TWO TURNCOATS nervously approach, unsure what to do -- \nCaesar seizes this momentary distraction -- gestures for the Girl to make a run for it -- SHE DARTS AWAY -- ducking behind the long barracks nearby, streaking toward the wall -- \nThe Colonel peers down annoyed at Red and Rocket; he calmly pulls out his sidearm, points down at them and FIRES -- ! \nCaesar's head whips around -- as Rocket and Red FREEZE, startled -- a CLOUD OF DIRT kicking up from where the bullet hit the ground beside them... \nRed immediately takes the opportunity to get the upper hand, forcing Rocket's face to the ground, pinning him. The Colonel walks closer to Rocket; stares at him a beat... \nTHE COLONEL How many are out there?   Are there others? \nRocket stays silent, refusing to show even a hint of fear. \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) (to Soldiers) Sweep the area. (turns to Red) Put him in the pen. \nAs the Colonel walks off, Red abruptly leaps to his feet, grabbing Rocket by the ankle -- Rocket FLAILS VIOLENTLY as Red drags him across the dirt and ice... \nCaesar watches in horror as the turncoats move in, BEATING ROCKET into submission as they HURL him into the pen. One roughly SHACKLES HIM -- as Red delivers a last, VICIOUS KICK, leaving Rocket in a crumpled heap as they exit. \nCaesar's stricken eyes remain fixed on Rocket as he struggles to his feet. His face bloodied and bruised, Rocket looks back at Caesar through the bars of their pens -- and to Caesar's surprise, Rocket smiles at him... He SIGNS: \nROCKET [Feeling better?] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nThrown, Caesar looks at him, then manages a slight smile; he nods. Rocket nods back, pleased: \nROCKET (CONT'D) [Good.   Then we can talk about escape.] \nHe brings his fists together: \"Apes together strong.\" Emotional, Caesar smiles, proud of his friend; as he brings his own fists together... \nPRE-LAP -- A LONE HUMAN VOICE SINGING OUT in gospel tones: \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left... \nAS WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: \n", "test3_true": "The SOLDIERS MARCH in formation toward the Warden's Tower... as the Apes peer anxiously through the bars of their pens... \nThe procession comes to a halt, all eyes lifting expectantly to the Colonel's balcony, waiting for him to appear... when the SOUND OF A METAL DOOR suddenly scrapes open -- everyone turns, surprised to see -- \nTHE COLONEL emerging at the base of   the tower, right before them. He's in FORMAL DRESS GREENS,    MEDALS on his chest, BERET on his head. He moves to the    top of the steps, looks out, studying their uncertain faces   a pregnant moment... \nON CAESAR, observing from his cage -- his eyes flit warily to Rocket's across the way -- then back to the Colonel... as he finally begins to address his assembled troops; there is something momentous, almost reflective in his tone: \nTHE COLONEL For two years we've fought relentlessly against these beasts, and when we are done with them, we will bring an end to their kind. But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I'll tell you. It's not the apes. It's not the men who are on their way here right now to altercate with us. The battle we've been waging all this time is against ourselves. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe watches them as the words sink in, then starts down the steps, walking among them as he continues -- his eyes dart momentarily across the yard, meeting Caesar's: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) They say we are inhumane. Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they'll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain. (beat, still walking through the ranks) We can not fail. We're the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We've seen it here. And it's already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there'll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent. Just another dumb animal, left to roam a godforsaken world. \nHe comes to a stop in the Soldier's midst -- Preacher close by, gazing intently -- the Colonel's tone growing intimate: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Most of you are still young men and women. And if we win, years from now, you may be sitting somewhere with your children, your grandchildren... and they'll ask you: what did you do in the greatest war...? And you can tell them, you fought... viciously... for a gentler world. \nPreacher looks almost emotional -- the others too -- as the Colonel NODS to the X.O. -- and as WHISTLES SHRIEK -- we: \nCUT TO: \nTHE APE PENS - MOMENTS LATER \nCRANE over the apes being forced out into the yard... FINDING the Colonel now wading through the chaos, Preacher and Red at his side... as they ARRIVE at CAESAR'S CAGE. \nThe Colonel pulls out his sidearm, nods to Preacher who unlocks the cage, opens the door... they all stare in at -- \nCAESAR, who returns a hard, weary look, making no motion to exit -- when CH-CHINK -- the Colonel cocks his gun. \nCaesar hesitates, then gathers the strength to stand, and slowly steps out of the cage. The Colonel stares at him, hard: \nTHE COLONEL Send him up to the quarry.    Alone. \nRed fastens shackles to Caesar's ankles and wrists, and looks at Preacher, who is searching through his key rings -- he can't find the shackle key; suddenly nervous, his eyes dart to the Colonel, as he continues searching in vain... \nImpatient, the Colonel calls out to Boyle who's passing by with the first groups of chained apes -- \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Boyle!   His cuffs. \nBoyle heads over, starts to lock Caesar up -- when the Colonel suddenly sees something... Caesar watches as the Colonel steps toward the cage, reaches in... and retrieves... THE GIRL'S DOLL. He stares at it, perplexed: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) (turning to Caesar) What is this...? \nBut Caesar is silent.   The Colonel turns to Preacher -- \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) How did this get in there? \nPreacher shakes his head, looking pale: \nPREACHER I really don't know, sir... \nThe Colonel looks back hard at Caesar; then, finally: \nTHE COLONEL Get him to work. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe Colonel's stare lingers on Caesar as Red shoves him forward; then the Colonel returns his attention to -- \nTHE RAG DOLL IN HIS HANDS... looking eerily up at him... \nEXT. PRISON CAMP - HIGH UP ON THE ROCK QUARRY SHELF - DAY \nCaesar labors alone on a dangerously narrow perch, quarrying for heavy stones high above the yard... He looks down as he works, secretly scanning the yard, to FIND -- \nROCKET \nwaiting to be brought out of the pen, chained to a group of other apes; he glances surreptitiously up at Caesar -- Rocket NODS -- as Rocket's group is ordered out -- \nCAESAR WATCHES for a moment as Rocket's group heads toward the wall -- then he turns quickly to FIND -- \nLAKE \nalso looking up at Caesar, waiting with her group by the CHILDREN'S PEN, picking up tools -- she NODS -- and suddenly her group moves out toward the wall too -- \nCAESAR \nturns quickly back to Rocket, whose eyes are fixed on his own feet, COUNTING EACH STEP as his group approaches... \n...THE TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH in the middle of the yard -- the spot where he and Maurice dug up from the tunnel below... As he passes it, Rocket looks up at Caesar -- stealthily signs: \nROCKET \nCaesar NODS. Then quickly turns back to Lake -- as she too passes the train switch -- she looks up from her feet -- signs to Caesar: \nLAKE \nCaesar NODS -- and immediately begins to climb, pulling himself up to a ledge above -- when -- PING!-PING! -- BULLETS kick off the stones around him! He freezes, looks down at -- \nSOLDIERS standing guard ATOP THE FUEL TANKER RAILCARS -- one of them lowers his rifle, yells out to Caesar -- \n", "test3_id": 347}

{"train": "WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES \nWritten by \nMark Bomback & Matt Reeves \nBased on Characters Created by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT NOVEMBER 30, 2015 \nBLACK SCREEN \nPRIMITIVE WAR DRUMS POUND OMINOUSLY... as a LEGEND BEGINS: \nFifteen years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong gave RISE to a species of intelligent apes... and destroyed most of humanity with a virus that became known as the Simian Flu. \nThe word \"RISE\" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES... \nWith the DAWN of a new ape civilization led by Caesar, the surviving humans struggled to coexist... but fighting finally broke out when a rebel ape, Koba, led a vengeful attack against the humans. \nThe word \"DAWN\" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES... \nThe humans sent a distress call to a military base in the North where all that remained of the U.S. Army was gathered. A ruthless Special Forces Colonel and his hardened battalion were dispatched to exterminate the apes. Evading capture for the last two years, Caesar is now rumored to be marshaling the fight from a hidden command base in the woods... as the WAR rages on... \nThe word \"WAR\" lingers, moving toward us... TURNING RED as the REST OF THE TITLE FADES UP and the DRUMS ABRUPTLY STOP: \nWAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES \nWe HEAR sounds of nature. Then the quiet SNAPPING OF TWIGS. BOOTS CRUNCHING stealthily through grass. HUSHED BREATHING. \nHARD CUT TO: \nTIGHT CREEPING STEADICAM BEHIND THE HELMETS OF HUMAN SOLDIERS \nScrawled on the helmet closest to us are the words \"MONKEY KILLER.\" Others pass through frame: \"BEDTIME FOR BONZO,\" \"ENDANGERED SPECIES\"... The SOLDIERS climb slowly up -- \nA STEEP, DENSELY WOODED HILL \nThe troops wear threadbare camo fatigues, dark camo paint on their faces; each bears the hand-drawn insignia \"A\" on their bodies: some on their uniforms, some tattooed on their arms. Many carry GUNS, others MILITARY-GRADE CROSSBOWS. \nOne of the men comes to a halt, quickly WHISPERS: \nSOLDIER Captain...! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe CAPTAIN holds up a hand, signalling the unit to stop. He joins the Soldier, who points up ahead. The Captain peers THROUGH HIS GUN SITE to see -- \nTHREE APES AND THEIR HORSES \nup on a ridge 100 yards away. Two of the APES stand guard furtively, one clutching a spear, the other an automatic rifle -- while the third waters the horses at a stream. \nThe Captain lines up his cross-hairs... when ANOTHER SOLDIER creeps right up behind him, reaching for him... but as the hand lifts into frame, we see -- it's an APE HAND... \nThe ape hand GRABS the Captain's shoulder; startled, he quickly turns -- and the ape soldier (RED) POINTS up to -- \nTHE CANOPY OF TREES OVERHEAD -- where another HELMETED APE crouches, hidden, looking down at them -- the ape in the tree POINTS toward the ridge... The Captain follows the gesture to a LONG, LOW TRENCH WALL of logs and stones, disguised behind leaves and branches. \nCaptain turns back to Red, nods; WHISPERS INTO HIS HEADSET: \nCAPTAIN Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we have eyes on three Kong in the north woods. A couple of our donkeys think there are others here too... Maybe this is it, maybe the base is near. (listens carefully) Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over. \nHe clicks off, quickly waves up more soldiers from the rear. They begin pulling weapons and ammo from heavy rucksacks that Red and TWO OTHER APE SOLDIERS carry on their backs. The apes seem subservient, treated as no more than pack-mules. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) You!   Over here! \nAn ape scurries over; the Captain pulls out a grenade launcher -- turns to the men: \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Preacher... \nPREACHER, a fresh-faced grunt still in his teens, crawls up nervously with his CROSSBOW; the Captain points at the three apes up on the ridge: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) The one with the gun... \nPreacher NODS as the Captain readies his own weapon, lining up on the partially-hidden trench wall. Beside them, soldiers are sliding BAYONET BLADES onto their rifles... \nAll eyes on the Captain as he counts down silently with his fingers. \"3... 2... 1\" -- \n-- and Preacher fires an arrow into the ape with the gun! \nThe other two apes are just starting to react -- when the Captain sends two grenades screaming across the woods... BLASTING OPEN the trench wall -- \n-- and suddenly SCORES OF STUNNED APES begin chaotically FALLING out from the trench behind it! They TUMBLE off- balance, dropping weapons (guns, spears, bows & arrows) as -- \nTHE HUMANS OPEN FIRE, picking them off in a hail of bullets, arrows, and grenades. The two apes by the stream jump on their horses, starting to flee, when a SNIPER takes one out! But the APE WITH THE SPEAR manages to escape, SCREECHING in warning as he disappears into the distance. \nThe Captain turns to Preacher and the other men, waving them on -- we can't even hear his voice over the DIN OF BATTLE: \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) (COME ON!!) \nThe humans charge up the hill, continuing their assault -- \nA TRACKING POV SHOT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe battle's grim aftermath, an almost surreal vision of the ravages of war. Apes scavenge for weapons, stripping GUNS AND AMMUNITION off the bodies of fallen human soldiers... WE CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD A TRENCH, where APE BODIES are being lifted out and SCORES OF WOUNDED attended to... as we get closer, apes in the recess below look slowly up at us with reverence... We move DOWN INTO THE TRENCH, more and more apes reacting, nudging each other, alerting everyone to our arrival, even the injured raise their heads... \nREVEAL CAESAR \nas he strides through the trench; the POV was his. He looks older now, but even more imposing. His hardened expression reveals nothing... but in his eyes we see deep pain, as he takes in the terrible loss and suffering... \nHe's trailed by TWO GORILLAS, flanking him on either side: his grizzled lieutenant LUCA and a younger, smaller ALBINO (WINTER), who looks overwhelmed by the carnage around them... \nThe three of them finally arrive at an area UNDER earth cover, where they find A GROUP OF HUMAN SOLDIERS on their knees, helmets lowered, hands bound behind their backs. Spear and other ape warriors stand guard. Seeing Caesar, Spear supplicates deferentially. \nCaesar turns to the prisoners as they lift their frightened eyes to his. We see Preacher among them. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBut one soldier's helmet is still lowered. Spear reaches down and yanks the helmet off -- revealing Red. Red defiantly avoids Caesar's gaze. \nSpear tosses the helmet to Caesar. Caesar examines it, sees the hand-drawn \"A.\" He looks at the other soldiers, notices the same symbol crudely tattooed on one of the soldiers' arms, sees it scrawled on some of the uniforms. His eyes find it again on the front of Preacher's helmet. \nPREACHER (nervous, quiet) ...it's... Alpha Omega. \nCaesar just stares; then LANG, a lean female soldier, \"A\" tattooed on her neck, speaks, quiet defiance under her fear: \nLANG Means we're the beginning and end. Humanity's survival depends on us. \nJust then, the apes around Caesar turn, reacting to the arrival of -- \nMAURICE, the orangutan. Like Caesar, he's older; there's a weariness in his eyes that suggests the war has taken a toll on his gentle spirit. Caesar turns to his old friend. \nMAURICE (signs gravely) [Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.] \nCaesar glowers at the soldiers. We see Preacher still staring up at him... finally getting up the courage to utter: \nPREACHER You're him... You're Caesar. \nCaesar's eyes go to Preacher, caught off guard. \nPREACHER (CONT'D) We've been looking for you for so long. We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it. Some of us were starting to think you might be dead. But Colonel McCullough said no, you were out here somewhere... \nCaesar doesn't respond, just keeps glaring at the soldiers. Another soldier (TRAVIS) speaks up -- nerves frayed: \nTRAVIS Just kill us already... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nLANG Shut up, man -- \nTRAVIS What? They're animals, he's gonna slaughter us -- \nCaesar slowly steps toward him... Travis falls silent. \nAnd at last CAESAR SPEAKS, a dark edge in his voice: \nCAESAR I... did not start this war. \nThe humans all hold their breath, gaping up at him. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him. (then, harder) I only fight now... to protect apes. \nTRAVIS (steeling himself) Yeah? What about him? (glances at Red) And we got ten more just like him. \nCAESAR I know these apes. They followed Koba... (looks Red dead in the eye) They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive. \nRed glares up at Caesar -- and for the first time he unexpectedly SPEAKS in PRIMITIVE, BASTARDIZED LANGUAGE: \nRED I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything. \nHe looks over the apes, who seem chilled... his eyes boring into Winter's; the young gorilla is unnerved -- \nRED (CONT'D) He say: first Caesar die... then you all die. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nSpear ERUPTS, hurling Red to the ground -- when Caesar puts a hand up. Spear restrains himself, eyes still blazing. Caesar looks to Luca, then signs: \nCAESAR [Get him out of here.] \nLuca turns to Winter. Winter gathers himself, then drags a resisting Red away. The humans watch, fearful... then turn to Caesar, awaiting their fate... Luca signs, ominously: \nLUCA [What should we do with them?] \nCUT TO: \nBOUND HUMAN WRISTS, AS APE HANDS CINCH A KNOT TIGHT -- \nREVEAL PREACHER, LANG, TRAVIS, AND THE OTHER TWO SOLDIERS on a pair of horses, their hands now TIED to the reins. Apes on the ground surround them. Preacher looks at Caesar. \nPREACHER You're letting us live...? \nCAESAR Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die. \nThe soldiers look at him, fear and defiance in their eyes. Caesar nods to Luca -- who SWATS the horses' hindquarters, sending them on their way. The stunned humans peer back at the apes as the horses carry them off. \nINT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - COUNCIL ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER \nCAESAR'S SYMBOL carved into the stone floor; around the symbol sit Caesar and Cornelia, Blue Eyes, Lake, Rocket, Maurice, Luca, Winter and other COUNCIL MEMBERS. \nA MAP is laid out on the floor; Cornelius presses his face close, watching Blue Eyes' finger as it points to one spot in particular: \nBLUE EYES (passionately, to Caesar) [This is it, Father. We can start over. A new home.] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCornelia scoops Cornelius into her lap, gently pulling him away from the map -- she looks at Blue Eyes, intrigued, points: \nCORNELIA [What is beyond those mountains, son?] \nBlue Eyes picks up a pouch beside him and digs his hand in, removing a fistful of SAND; he spills it out dramatically -- \nBLUE EYES [A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.] \nCornelia smiles, nodding -- she and Caesar exchange a proud look -- when Winter cuts in anxiously: \nWINTER [We must leave tonight!] \nLAKE [Tonight?    That's impossible!] \nWINTER [How much longer can we wait?      Soldiers are getting closer!] \nBLUE EYES (touching Winter's arm) [Winter...] \nWinter shrugs him off -- Luca and the others all erupt angrily at Winter -- Caesar stands imposingly. Winter immediately lowers his head, afraid; then, to Caesar: \nWINTER [Your son's been gone, he doesn't know how hard it's been!] \nBLUE EYES [I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...] \nCAESAR Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely. \nEveryone looks at Caesar as he sits. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) There were two of you. But we are many. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nMAURICE (concurring) [The woods are filled with soldiers.] \nEveryone falls silent.   Blue Eyes meets Caesar's gaze: \nBLUE EYES Father... We must try. \nCaesar looks at his son, emotional: \nCAESAR I know, son. (he turns to the others) More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer. \nCaesar looks back down at the map, deep in thought; then feels the anxious stares of the apes around him. He looks at them, trying to reassure, though he is still uncertain himself: \nCAESAR (CONT'D) We will find a way out... \nHe raises his fists and brings them together, solemn: \nCAESAR (CONT'D) Apes together strong. \nThey return the gesture, nodding faithfully at their leader. \nINT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - CAESAR'S DWELLING - NIGHT \nA small cave in the upper levels of the fortress, enclosed on one side by the ROARING FALLS. Caesar sits up, awake, as his family sleeps around him. Troubled, he studies Blue Eyes' map in his lap -- when suddenly he feels something... \nCaesar looks down to see Cornelius instinctively hugging his leg as he rests, nuzzled beside his mother. Caesar gazes down protectively at his little one, strokes his head, then turns to look back at the map -- when he notices Blue Eyes staring up at him through heavy lidded eyes. \nBLUE EYES [Can't sleep?] \nCaesar shakes his head, his worried gaze returning to the map. Finally, Blue Eyes reaches out and touches his father's arm; Caesar turns. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBLUE EYES (CONT'D) [Trust me, father. This is a risk worth taking.] \nMoved, Caesar nods; he reaches out and gratefully caresses his son's face, then SIGNS, smiling: \nCAESAR [I am so proud of you.] (then) [I love you, son.] \n-- when suddenly a SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT washes briefly over both their faces... \nStartled, Caesar looks up at the falls to SEE -- \n-- THREE SHAPES distorted surreally in the water, each haloed in green light as they descend rapidly from view. \nUnnerved, Caesar sits up, unsure of what he's just seen. Blue Eyes watches as his father approaches the falls warily, moving in very close... when Caesar sees a STRANGE THIN LINE, whipping about in the current...? \nHe reaches toward THE LINE, mystified -- then plunges his arm deep in the water, grasping for it -- \n-- he pulls the line toward him... revealing a taut section of RED NYLON CLIMBING ROPE, straining against the current... \nAlarmed, Caesar immediately turns back to Blue Eyes and signs, urgent: \nTIGHT ON CAESAR as time seems to stop -- he's reeling, his entire world crashing in -- his eyes lift to the Colonel, a wave of rage rushing over him -- when -- \nTHE COLONEL quickly swings his gun off his shoulder -- \nCaesar DODGES FOR COVER behind the rocks -- as -- \nThe Colonel FIRES -- \nFrom the corridor we hear the furious ROAR OF INCOMING APES -- \nThe Colonel yells into his headset, backing toward the falls: \nTHE COLONEL Get me out! Now!! \nThen he turns -- and LEAPS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WATERFALL! \nCaesar raises his head just in time to see -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTHE COLONEL, barely discernible through the rushing water, clutching the swinging rope -- as HE'S PULLED UPWARD! \nApes spill into the cave as Caesar, desperate with rage, jumps to his feet, charging after the Colonel -- the apes watch in shock as -- CAESAR LUNGES INTO THE FALLS TOO -- ! \nEXT. WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS \nCaesar crashes through the water, hands flailing for -- \nTHE ROPE! He grabs at it -- IT CAREENS WILDLY!      Caesar holds on tight, looks up to see -- \nTHE COLONEL high above -- clinging to the suddenly jerking line -- he looks down to see \nCAESAR starting to climb up furiously after him... \nThe Colonel, unfazed, seizes a KNIFE from his boot as -- \nCaesar closes in, climbing, about to reach him -- when -- \nTHE COLONEL CUTS THE LINE -- and -- \nCaesar PLUMMETS -- down, down, down -- INTO THE RIVER BELOW! \nAn excruciating beat -- then Caesar SPRINGS UP from the water, gasping, enraged -- he peers up in agony to SEE -- \nTHE COLONEL disappearing over the TOP OF THE CLIFF! \nINT. CAESAR'S FAMILY DWELLING - LATER \nCLOSE ON Cornelia and Blue Eyes, as their lifeless bodies are lifted from the rock floor... \nREVEAL CAESAR watching silently, lost in his own world; still wet, he remains completely motionless, consumed with rage, pain. Beside him, Rocket, Luca and Maurice watch, shaken, as the bodies are carried away. \nJust then Spear pushes through, reporting to Luca: \nSPEAR [Luca! We can't find Winter.   He wasn't at his post.] \nLuca and Maurice suddenly exchange a worried look -- \nMAURICE [He was scared. Could he have turned against us?] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe looks to Rocket as well -- but Rocket's gaze is now fixed elsewhere. Maurice and the others all turn to see -- \nCAESAR has been following their conversation.     Finally, Luca signs, wracked with guilt: \nLUCA [Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us. I'm sorry. He was in my command.] \nCaesar remains silent; then: \nCAESAR My youngest son...   Have you found him yet? \nLUCA [We're still looking.] \nMaurice turns to the others: \nMAURICE [Let's help them search.] \nEveryone nods, following Maurice's lead as they shuffle out, giving Caesar some much-needed space... Finally -- \nCaesar is alone. \nHis eyes move to where he found Blue Eyes and Cornelia; there is blood on the floor. He steps closer, in a trance; sees -- \nTWO BRASS BULLET CASINGS on the ground. Caesar crouches, his expression intensifying as he reaches for the spent casings -- \n-- when he hears a NOISE behind him -- on a hair-trigger, Caesar seizes the spear, raising it furiously -- so gripped by animalistic rage that it takes a moment to realize -- it's his toddler son, peeking out from hiding in the rocks; Cornelius peers up in terror at his father, shrinking back. \nCaesar returns to his senses, lowers the spear... then, softening, he bends to the toddler and extends a hand... But Cornelius is still too frightened to approach, his eyes fixed on the spear in Caesar's grasp. \nAshamed, Caesar sets the spear on the ground, then holds both arms out to his son. \nCAESAR Cornelius... you're safe now, son. \nHANDHELD SHOT - PEEKING THROUGH THE TREES \nAs we move closer, we discover we are at the edge of -- \nA DESERTED R.V. PARK \nOld campers lined up, long-since abandoned. Smoke billows from a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of a rusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nREVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA \nspying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. They exchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp? They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when -- \nA LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest. \nHe's mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops in his tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then, very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood: \nMAN I'm just gonna... put this down -- \nHe drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to his shoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUST MISSES MAURICE, when -- \nBANG!   THE MAN DROPS DEAD.   Stunned, the apes turn to see -- \nCAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at the man he's just killed. The others regard Caesar's grim, steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack of remorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows something has broken within him. A line has been crossed. \nFinally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of their stares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man. \nThe others join him, looking down at the body. The tattered rags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn by the human soldiers. \"A\" is crudely tattooed on his arm. \nLUCA [Is he out here alone?] \nROCKET [Maybe he's a deserter?] \nCaesar doesn't respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTED CRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM... \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \nSuddenly a door is ripped open, and light spills in; we are -- \nINT. RUSTED-OUT AIRSTREAM - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe faces of the apes slowly appear, gazing warily in at us; Caesar and Rocket have their guns drawn. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThey stalk silently into the dim space, eyes roaming... It's long and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed and littered with improvised survivalist essentials. \nWe MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through the claustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place a human might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward... \nA CLOSED DOOR \nat the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tense looks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door! \nON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as he sees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL -- \nA LITTLE GIRL \ncowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lower bunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A little waif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildly matted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at -- \nCaesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing through his veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him, shocked at what they see. \nFinally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar's gun, gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but still shows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, to the others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them: \nCAESAR Look around. Take what we can use. \nCaesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasy look, then follow. \nBut Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with a mixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on the floor by the bed, starts to move toward it... \nTerrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawing as far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hoot as he reaches down to the floor and retrieves -- \nA CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates -- then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it. \nMaurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her. She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... as his finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll's head. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nShe blinks up, studying him, fear ebbing; she opens her mouth to speak, but no words come, just GENTLE, GASPING GRUNTS... \nCUT TO: \nA DUSTY COMPASS IN A BATTERED OLD LOCKBOX \nREVEAL LUCA picking it up, as he, Caesar and Rocket search the trailer. Luca sees a PAIR OF BINOCULARS in the box; he takes them too, along with some FLASHLIGHTS. \nImpatient, Caesar looks back, wondering where Maurice is -- when Maurice appears in the doorway, the Girl visible behind him, staring out curiously. Maurice signs to Caesar: \nMAURICE [Something wrong with her.   I don't think she can speak.] \nCaesar looks coldly at the Girl, then back to Maurice: \nBOYLE Shut up, Preacher -- what're you, a donkey lover now? I think you going soft coz that kong let you go. \nSome of the soldiers snicker. Preacher backs down, humiliated and angry. Boyle levels his gun at Winter again. \nBOYLE (CONT'D) Get me a new bowl. \nWinter looks nervously to Red.       Red nods soberly: do it. \nINT. DARKENED MOBILE KITCHEN TENT - MOMENTS LATER \nWinter digs under a supply table for a new bowl. Rising, he catches his reflection in a grimy mirror over a wash basin. He hesitates, maybe suffering a crisis of conscience -- when he sees A REFLECTED FACE lurking in the shadows behind him! \nHe spins to see CAESAR standing there, motionless, staring... \nPanicked, Winter turns for the exit -- but LUCA is there, blocking escape. Turns the other way -- and there's ROCKET. Winter's eyes widen as Caesar takes a slow step toward him... \nCAESAR Where is the Colonel? \nWinter swallows, trembling as he lifts his hands to sign: \nWINTER [He's gone.] \nCAESAR (dubious, stalking closer) ...Gone? \nWinter looks at the other apes, sees them closing in too... Turns back to Caesar, nervously explaining: \nWINTER [This morning. He took many soldiers with him.] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLuca and Rocket exchange troubled glances... but Caesar's eyes remain fixed on Winter as he continues his approach... \nWINTER (CONT'D) [Men are coming down here \u00ad- from their base in the north. The Colonel and his soldiers are going to meet them at the border.] \nCAESAR What border? Why? \nWINTER [I don't know. But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they'll all be coming back here... to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.] \nCaesar finally stops, right in front of him.    Winter pleads: \nWINTER (CONT'D) [Please... I know I betrayed you. But can't you see? We'll never beat them. I was just trying to survive. Red told me the humans promised to spare us if we helped. I beg you, forgive me...] \nBut Caesar is unmoved, barely stifling his rage... \nCAESAR My son... my wife... are dead. \nJust then -- we hear the LAUGHTER OF HUMANS outside; Winter turns, sees SHADOWS OF SOLDIERS passing on the side of the tent -- he opens his mouth to shriek to them -- but a HAND CLAMPS over his mouth, as Caesar wrestles him to the ground to silence him! The others rush in, holding Winter down as he struggles violently, desperately trying to shriek out -- \nThe SHADOWS OF THE SOLDIERS HALT, their laughter subsiding as their heads turn toward the muffled sounds in the tent -- \nSeeing this, Caesar furiously tightens his grip around Winter's neck -- but Winter won't stop, struggling even harder! Eyes fixed on the human shadows, Caesar grips fiercely... choking tighter and tighter... \n...until Winter finally relents. Caesar watches the shadows, tense... And at last, they move on. \nThe apes exhale relief. Luca and Rocket turn to Caesar -- but their eyes drift to Winter. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nCaesar follows their looks down to the young gorilla in his grasp... and discovers he has killed him. \nStunned, he stares at Winter's lifeless face... then, slowly, looks up again at Luca and Rocket, grappling with what he's done. They lower their eyes. \nEXT. DENSE WOODS - NIGHT \nTense silence. The apes and Girl sit by a fire, isolated in the trees; Maurice studies Caesar's face as he gazes into the flames, deeply unsettled. Then Maurice turns to the others, who look equally plagued. Finally, Rocket turns to Maurice: \nROCKET [Winter had it coming!] \nMaurice nods, uneasy; Luca looks up, convincing himself: \nLUCA [Caesar had no choice!] \nMAURICE [So what do we do now?] \nROCKET [Wait for the soldiers to leave.   Follow them to the Colonel.] \nMaurice turns again to Caesar, who is still in his own world, lifting a gourd canteen to his lips. He takes a drink... when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Girl beside him, staring at him guilelessly. \nHe looks at her askance for a moment, deadpan, then hands her the gourd, and she guzzles thirstily. Caesar watches -- \n-- when suddenly his eyes shift, startled to discover a DARK FIGURE on the other side of the fire... \nAlarmed and bewildered, Caesar peers through the flames... amazed to see it's AN APE sitting across from him, his head lowered ominously. Fire dances on Caesar's pupils as he stares at the figure, haunted... \n...when suddenly, the Ape lifts his face, grinning at Caesar through the distorting waves of heat -- Caesar looks haunted: \nCAESAR ...Koba? \nKOBA Ape... not kill ape... \nTIGHT ON CAESAR \nsnapping awake with a start -- we are -- \nCAESAR Winter said they were heading to a border...! \nLUCA [Yes, but which way is that?!] \nON THE GROUND \nThe Girl sits on Maurice's horse, craning her neck all the way back to stare up at the apes high above; as she glances back down to play with the rag doll in her hands -- an OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE IN A GREEN PARKA silently passes behind her... \nCLOSE ON DARK, WEATHERED SNOW BOOTS creeping up and stopping next to the legs of one of the horses -- \nWe watch THE BACK OF THE FIGURE'S HEAD, covered beneath the FUR-LINED HOOD of the bulky parka, as his unseen hands rummage stealthily through a saddle-bag. His breath steams quietly around him. He FREEZES as A FLASHLIGHT drops into the snow by his boots -- \nBut the Girl remains focused on her doll, unaware. \nThe Figure resumes rummaging, finally pausing as we BRIEFLY GLIMPSE the BARREL OF A SHOTGUN he has just found -- \nUP IN THE TREE TOPS \nA NERVOUS SNORT comes from one of the horses below -- the apes turn to see the TINY FIGURE IN THE BULKY PARKA FAR BELOW digging in the saddle bag; Luca lets out a TERRIFYING ROAR -- \nThe Girl finally looks up, startled, as -- \n-- the Figure panics, JUMPING ON THE HORSE, AND TAKING OFF! \nCaesar and his posse scramble down from the trees -- mount their horses -- \nSMASH TO: \nTHE POSSE GIVING CHASE THROUGH THE SNOWY WOODS \nGALLOPING THROUGH THE TREACHEROUS OBSTACLE COURSE OF TREES -- \nThe TINY FIGURE in the parka darts in and out of view    -- \nThe apes are starting to gain on him, when he BREAKS OUT of the woods and up onto -- \nA MASSIVE SNOW-COVERED SLOPE \nWe watch from HIGH ABOVE as his horse CHARGES THE INCLINE, KICKING POWDER INTO THE AIR -- the apes' horses burst out of the woods after him -- all of them just tiny dots climbing the stark white landscape... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFrom this vantage we can now see the TOPPLED CABLES and DILAPIDATED GONDOLAS that tell us this was once A SKI AREA -- \nThe apes again begin to close the gap -- \nCLOSE ON CAESAR CHARGING HARD, EYES FIXED ON -- \nTHE DIM FIGURE up ahead of him -- when suddenly -- BLAM! -- a FLASH OF GUNFIRE ERUPTS from atop the Figure's horse -- \nCAESAR and the OTHERS DUCK as -- CHING! -- the BLAST RICOCHETS off a half-buried GONDOLA CAR far wide of them! \nBLAM! BLAM! TWO MORE SHOTS ring out, wildly astray, kicking up snow clouds nowhere near them or their horses -- \n-- as the Figure disappears over the crest of the slope. \nEXT. TOP OF THE SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe apes arrive, slowing their horses as they come upon -- \nAN ENORMOUS, ABANDONED VICTORIAN HOTEL, built into the mountainside. An old sign reads: The Inn at Deer Creek. \nThe stolen horse wanders rider-less on the snowy front lawn. \nThe apes cautiously dismount, drawing their weapons... As they approach, a SHADOW SUDDENLY BOLTS from behind one of the buildings, dashing into the main lodge -- \nThe apes all exchange looks; then raise their guns as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE INN AT DEER CREEK - MAIN LOBBY ENTRANCE - DUSK \nAn ornate glass door   slowly opens... Caesar, Rocket, and Luca enter, guns first...    As they pass us, the door swings shut behind them... HOLD    as Maurice and the Girl wait outside, pressing their faces   to THE FROSTY DOOR PANE -- their eyes fill with a sense of   amazement as we CUT TO: \nMAURICE AND GIRL'S POV - PUSHING IN ON THE FROSTY DOOR PANE \nInside the lobby, Caesar, Rocket, and Luca creep away from us into what appears to be a kind of SURREAL ICE PALACE... \nBACK INSIDE THE LOBBY \nWe MOVE with Caesar and the others, their breath steaming in the cold as they peer around them at an extraordinary sight -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEvery inch of the cavernous interior -- from furnishings to chandeliers -- is covered in THICK CRYSTALLINE ICE, the building having long-since been breached by weather. Snow swirls in the air, drifting down through a hole in the roof. \nCaesar lifts a hand to stop the others as he spots -- BOOT PRINTS in the frost on the floor. The apes' eyes follow them across the lobby's expanse... to where they disappear into the black opening of AN ENORMOUS HEARTH along the wall. \nThe apes cautiously close in, guns trained on the hearth, deep and dark enough to conceal whoever's hiding inside... \nCaesar stops at the opening; he COCKS his gun LOUDLY, levelling it -- Rocket and Luca COCK their weapons too... \n... when suddenly, the STOLEN SHOTGUN is tossed out at them, landing at the apes' feet with a thud. They stare down at it uneasily -- when to their surprise the STOLEN BINOCULARS come skittering out too. And then the COMPASS. \nBAD APE (nods) Listen to human... \nHis face abruptly contorts into an \"angry human\" expression -- he waves a chiding finger as he mimics: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) \"Bad ape!    Bad ape!\" \nThen, turning his head, he realizes the Girl has the shiny Chevy Nova emblem again -- he reaches for it, possessive: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) (gently admonishes) No... No touch. \nShe stares at it longingly as he sets it down. He looks back at the apes, smiles -- then rushes away for something else... \nThe apes all watch their excitable host, perplexed -- Maurice turns to Caesar, signs an aside: \nMAURICE [Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.] \nJust as Caesar begins to contemplate the mind-blowing thought, Bad Ape bounds back in, hurriedly passing out packages of vacuum-foiled food rations (M.R.E.'s). \nBAD APE Here! Eat, eat! (beaming) New friends. Special day. \nBad Ape tears the top off one, starts eating the dehydrated food, nodding encouragingly for them to do the same. \nCaesar looks slowly down at the ration in his hand -- notices an official military seal: \"U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER\" CUT TIGHTER on the word: BORDER. Caesar suddenly looks up: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nCAESAR Where did you get this? \nBad Ape turns to him, confused. Caesar holds up the package. Bad Ape looks uneasy... his voice lowering to a hush: \nBAD APE Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick. \nEngrossed, Caesar's eyes meet his... as Bad Ape continues: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad humans kill. Then get sick too. All dead now. All dead. \nCaesar and the others take this in, somehow haunted.   Then: \nCAESAR Bad humans...? Soldiers? \nBad Ape recognizes the word, nods gravely: \nBAD APE Soldiers. \nThe posse looks to each other with rising intensity... \nROCKET [An old, deserted military camp on the border...?] \nLUCA [Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?] \nCaesar nods: maybe.    He turns back to Bad Ape. \nCAESAR Is it far?     Can you take us? \nBAD APE (looks agog) Human zoo?! No... No go back there. Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here. Never go back! \nCaesar reaches out his hand, places it on Bad Ape's shoulder: \nCAESAR Please.     You must take us. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nBAD APE No!     Can not take!   Can not take! \nScared, he pushes Caesar's hand from his shoulder, a little too hard -- Rocket GRABS him, incensed \u00ad- but Caesar restrains Rocket, shakes his head no. Bad Ape shrinks in Rocket's grasp -- then sees something, and points desperately to the little windows along the wall -- \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay here. (to the others) Look, look! \nThey all look to the massive lobby window to see it is indeed snowing hard now. \nRocket finally releases Bad Ape.     He exhales, looks at them with renewed optimism. \nBAD APE (CONT'D) You stay here. Eat. Rest. (smiles hopefully) With me. \nCaesar considers, reluctantly nods to the others. Bad Ape is relieved -- when he sees the Girl staring longingly again at the Nova emblem; he grabs it, hands it to her ceremoniously: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Here.    You keep. \nHe looks around, smiling at the apes for approval; the Girl gazes happily at the emblem, as with a WHISTLING HOWL, we -- \nCUT TO: \nHIGH OVER THE CAVERNOUS LOBBY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT \nSnow whirling hard through the ice palace.        HOLD; CUT TO: \nNEAR THE HEARTH - SAME \nThe last embers of the fire dying out as everyone sleeps... \nCLOSE ON CAESAR \nThe only one still awake.    He sits up, eyes settling on -- \nThe group have left the trail, moving through dense forest. \nCaesar watches Bad Ape who peers anxiously ahead... to where SUNLIGHT spills in at the edge of the woods. Bad Ape turns to meet Caesar's eyes, fearful: \nBAD APE There... \nCaesar looks at the light, then turns to the others, raising his hand for them to stop. \nCUT TO: \nEDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER \nOn foot now, the group presses in close behind the trees at the forest's perimeter, squinting into the hard, low sun at -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAN ENORMOUS CANYON BELOW THEM \nSteep, snow-covered granite cliffs slope down in shelves, disappearing into an unseen expanse below. \nThe TOP OF A MASSIVE, PRISON-STYLE WARDEN'S TOWER pokes ominously up in the distance, from the center of the chasm. \nCaesar raises the binoculars, PEERING AT THE TOWER: sun flares off the cement and steel structure, stained with corrosion. Through the windows, it appears to be DESERTED. \nCaesar lowers the glasses, staring uncertainly -- when he notices something about the FADED CALIFORNIA STATE FLAG hanging from the tower -- he looks through the binoculars to examine it: the flag is hung upside-down... and a HUGE \"A\" has been painted in black across it. \nThen Caesar suddenly notices movement down below -- he shifts the glasses to find TINY SILHOUETTED FIGURES, just barely visible along the edge of the lowest visible shelf. \nCaesar turns, looks from face to face... then: \nCAESAR [Luca, let's take a closer look.] (to Rocket) [Stay here. Keep them safe.] \nRocket nods dutifully, and Caesar and Luca start off -- \nCUT TO: \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS - SUNSET \nThe HEAVILY SILHOUETTED FIGURES in the distance are still small, but from this closer vantage we can see now they're in the midst of placing a series of about twelve MYSTERIOUS, X- SHAPED STRUCTURES along the cliff's edge -- maybe this is some kind of defensive perimeter...? \nREVEAL CAESAR LOWERING HIS BINOCULARS; he looks confused as he turns to Luca, lying beside him on the edge of a ridge. \nLUCA [What are they doing?] \nCAESAR (shakes his head) I don't know... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCaesar turns back, looking through the binoculars again, trying to decipher this strange activity -- when Luca GRUNTS at him with quiet alarm. Caesar turns. \nLUCA (points) [What's that? A patrol?] \nCaesar looks -- \nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS \nfinding a PAIR OF HORSES on a ledge right below. \nCAESAR (O.S.) Don't see riders... \nSuddenly AN OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE RISES directly in front of the binoculars -- Caesar drops the glasses to discover -- \nAN ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIER looming right above him, rifle raised! \nThe soldier pulls the trigger -- CLICK -- but the gun is jammed! Panicked, the soldier rears back, about to lunge forward with the rifle's BAYONET -- when -- \nLUCA DIVES PROTECTIVELY in front of Caesar -- \n-- taking the bayonet blade in his gut as he YANKS the man down, WRESTLING him to the ground! They roll violently, finally coming to a stop, Luca atop the motionless soldier -- \nCaesar's eyes land on the BLOOD-STAINED BAYONET, lying in the snow beside them -- he scrambles up, rushing to Luca -- \n-- when a SECOND SOLDIER steps out, startling Caesar -- about to shoot -- when -- \nWHAM! THE SECOND SOLDIER CRUMPLES, revealing Rocket behind him, having just clubbed him with the butt of a rifle. \nRocket looks to Caesar, signs regretfully, out of breath: \nROCKET [I saw them from up there... Coming for you...] \nThey both turn immediately to Luca... who is rolling painfully off the dead man; he looks at them helplessly, GASPING, clutching his gut... CUT TO: \nBACK UP IN THE WOODS - DUSK \nWaiting anxiously at the edge of the trees, Bad Ape, Maurice and the Girl stare as -- \nROCKET returns, climbing quickly up toward them, a grim expression on his face, clutching the bayoneted rifle in his hand... right behind him, CAESAR CARRIES LUCA across his back, like a Vietnam soldier shouldering a fallen brother. \nThey all retreat into the safety of the woods, the group converging around Caesar as he lowers Luca to the ground... \nEmotion in his eyes, Caesar looks down at his loyal friend. Fading fast, Luca smiles weakly. He manages to raise a hand, holding it out to Caesar; Caesar grasps it firmly. \nLUCA [At least this time... I was able to protect you...] \nCAESAR (CONT'D) Wait -- my little son -- is he here...? \nBut Spear just falls to the ground, Caesar watches aghast -- when an APE FOOT steps right beside him -- Caesar turns, startled -- looks up to see -- \nRED standing ominously right above him! The BUTT OF RED'S RIFLE comes SLAMMING DOWN into us -- and we SMASH TO -- \nBLACKNESS \nHOLD for a long moment. Hear the echoing sound of WATER SLOWLY DRIPPING. Then HARD CUT TO -- \nSUPER TIGHT ON CAESAR'S EYES \nas they wince open, disoriented, in pain, his face pressed to the ground... A SHAFT OF HARSH LIGHT blasts down from above. Water drops splatter around him. \nCaesar peers around, struggling to get his bearings, his POV drifting in and out of focus: he finds TRACKS embedded in the ground, a rusted-out TRAIN ENGINE in the shadows. The place was a depot of some kind. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe glances up at the cavernous, curved ceiling; sodium vapor security lamps shine in through a rip, which leaks melting snow. And then he notices -- \nAN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE LOOMING IN THE DARKNESS \na few feet away: it's PREACHER, tensely holding his crossbow, looking unsettled as he stands guard... when an unseen VOICE comes quietly from the shadows as WET FOOTSTEPS approach: \nTHE COLONEL (O.S.) Grant and Lee... Wellington and Napoleon... \nA SHAPE finally enters the light: it's THE COLONEL, who studies Caesar inscrutably: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Custer... and Sitting Bull. (then) You're probably not much of a reader. But this is... this is a big moment. This is... beyond... historic. \nCaesar glares up at him, rage welling... \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Where were you...? (then) We came upon your herd... we got lucky. But I was surprised. You weren't with them. \nThey stare at each other an intense beat... Caesar crawls menacingly toward him -- but is instantly YANKED BACK HARD. \nGASPING, Caesar reaches for his throat to discover his wrists are shackled and his neck is CHAINED by a NECK COLLAR... Writhing, he turns to see RED cruelly gripping the end of the chain. Preacher takes a step closer, levelling his crossbow threateningly; Caesar's eyes lock with his. The Colonel watches their stare-down: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life. He's quite a good shot. \nThe Colonel just watches Caesar a beat; beneath the chilling stillness of his eyes we sense something dangerous, damaged. \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Have you finally come to save your apes? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nCAESAR (still in pain, seething) I... didn't know they were here. (then) I came for you. \nThe Colonel searches Caesar's ferocious expression, surprised, something dawning on him for the first time: \nTHE COLONEL I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...? \nCaesar looks him right in the eye, unblinking... \nCAESAR My... family. \nThe Colonel stares down, some mysterious nerve jolted inside him. He comes closer, stands right above Caesar, looking at him for a long beat, something about this revelation churning in his mind; Red cautiously tightens his grip on the chain. \nTHE COLONEL I'm sorry.     I was there to kill you. \nCaesar just glares up at him, the Colonel so close... Struck, the Colonel inches even closer: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) My God, look at your eyes... they're almost human... (a long beat; then) How did you know I was here? \nCAESAR I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here. \nTHE COLONEL (a cryptic beat) Joining me...? \nCAESAR To finish us off... for good. \nTHE COLONEL (he smiles) Who told you that? \nBut Caesar won't answer. The Colonel just stares at him, then turns to Red and NODS: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Ok, let's go. \nRed quickly responds -- \nRED Ok -- ok, Kerna...! \nRed YANKS Caesar roughly to his feet; Caesar struggles, CHOKING -- as Preacher moves in too -- and we HARD CUT TO: \nEXT. PRISON CAMP - YARD - TRACKING SHOT - NIGHT \nMOVING with the Colonel, Red, and Preacher as they march Caesar into the frozen, desolate yard; Caesar steals a glance back at a CORRODED SIGN over the hangar: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER, PROCESSING DEPOT \nAs they walk along train tracks, Caesar turns forward, SEES SOLDIERS huddled around fires in front of temporary barracks, killing time -- they stare up at him menacingly -- up ahead -- \nA PAIR OF GUARD TOWERS LOOM \nMore HAND-PAINTED SLOGANS hang on signs, recalling the cult- like vibe of the base camp. Armed GUARDS stare down as they pass, straightening tensely at the sight of the Colonel -- \nCLOSE ON THE COLONEL \nwatching the brutality; he stops shaving a moment, calmly pulls a FLASK from his hip, and takes a slow drink; then he disappears into the tower again. \nCUT TO: \nCAESAR \nMARCHING gravely with hordes of apes across the snowy yard... ARMED SOLDIERS pace menacingly atop FUEL TANKER RAILCARS along the side of the camp, keeping watch over the prisoners. Caesar slows, suddenly struck by what's LOOMING up ahead -- \nTHE EXTREMELY HIGH BARRIER WALL \nthat seals in the front of the camp; it's unlike anything we've ever seen. Part of it is man-made, cracked slabs of weathered concrete erected side by side years ago; but a vast section, growing right out of the original wall, is ape-made. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMassive tree-trunks have been fastened in a primitive but elaborate framework, into which huge stones are being set, one by one. The apes have been rebuilding the crumbling wall. \nAs Caesar moves closer, his eyes are drawn to an old slab of cement, still standing in the midst of the ape construction. On it, \"A\" is painted in HUGE BLOOD RED GRAFFITI SCRAWL; next to this drip the words: \"HUMANITY'S LAST STAND\". Caesar stares at the words, chilled... as we CUT TO: \nEXT. THE WALL - DAY \nCaesar labors, just another slave in the sea of apes passing brutally heavy boulders to be laid into the growing wall, as Soldiers keep GUNS trained on them. Caesar squints out at even more apes perched dangerously on the rock shelf above the tanker cars, quarrying for the stones. \nBeside him, Lake heaves another boulder; Caesar peers past her at the apes around them; they look WEARY, GAUNT; on the framework above, EXHAUSTED apes -- Ape Elder among them -- battle to lift boulders on ropes. Lake sees the anguish on Caesar's face as he takes in the suffering, she signs: \nLAKE [We haven't had food or water since we got here...] \nStunned, anger fills his face; he glares up at the structure: \nCAESAR [Why do they need a wall...?] \nLake looks back at him, shaking her head: I don't know -- when Caesar sees -- \nTHE COLONEL arriving at the work site; his Soldiers nervously address him as his eyes roam the wall, surveying the progress -- then fix on Caesar -- when suddenly a SOLDIER CRIES OUT: \nBOYLE (O.S.) HEY!   HEY! \nThe Colonel turns to the commotion -- Caesar turns too -- to find Ape Elder struggling high up on the framework, dizzy with fatigue, losing grip on his rope as Soldiers and Turncoat Apes watch with alarm from below -- \n-- when he COLLAPSES, the rope ripping from his fingers -- the rock CRASHES into the framing, KNOCKING DOWN a big section of the stone wall in a violent chain reaction! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFurious, Boyle spins to one of the Turncoats -- Red. Caesar watches as he orders Red to punish Ape Elder; Red and the other turncoats pull the feeble ape from the rubble and drag him into the yard, in full sight of the Colonel, where Red dutifully begins to WHIP the old ape...! \nStartled, Caesar looks at the Colonel, who watches the beating, unmoved -- then back to the helpless old chimp -- \nON CAESAR \nas he steps slowly forward in horror, pained by the excruciating sight -- the apes in his line follow, affected too... Caesar pulls himself up onto one of the tree trunks in the framework, stepping into a CLOSE UP, his rage starting to boil... until finally, unable to bear it, he ERUPTS: \nCAESAR LEAVE HIM!!! \nHeads turn, everyone stopping dead in their tracks as CAESAR'S BOOMING VOICE ECHOES across the yard... Even Red goes still, turning with the others to SEE -- \nCAESAR UP ON THE FRAMEWORK \nGLARING back defiantly; then, he turns slowly to the Colonel, fury in his eyes, no concern for his own safety... \nFor a moment, the yard is suspended in TOTAL SILENCE as Caesar and the Colonel lock eyes -- when, one by one, the APES START TO CHANT... \nLow and guttural at first... then RISING INTO A DEAFENING CHORUS OF REBELLIOUS HOOTS AND SHRIEKS -- as they defiantly DROP THE STONES AND TOOLS to the ground! \nSurprised, Caesar turns... stunned by what he has started... he peers around at the apes, to find them all gazing at him in solidarity as they chant... \nCLOSE ON APE ELDER still on his knees, clutching his wounds, watching in awe as the protest reaches a fever pitch... \nThe Soldiers are at a loss as to how to restore order -- they turn to the Colonel who just stares ominously at Caesar... \nEyes fearfully on the Colonel, a SOLDIER FRANTICALLY GESTURES across the chaos to Red and the Turncoats: get him! \nCAESAR \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nturns as Turncoats and Soldiers approach (Preacher among them); unafraid, Caesar steps down to meet them -- his chain gang CHANTING protectively -- when the Turncoats GRAB Caesar! The Soldiers anxiously hold the others in check with their weapons -- as the roar of the crowd grows even LOUDER -- \nCaesar glares as Preacher nervously unclips his keys from his belt, tosses them to Red, who unshackles him... \nTHE COLONEL \nwatches as Caesar is marched into the yard, and thrust onto his knees beside Ape Elder. The Colonel considers Caesar; then, eyes still on him, gestures calmly to the Turncoats -- \nThe Turncoats tighten their grip on Caesar's arms -- and Red suddenly WHIPS Caesar's back with a VICIOUS SNAP! \nThe APES' CHANTING SUDDENLY FALTERS as -- \nCaesar WINCES -- but he refuses to break eye-contact with the Colonel, who stares back, a battle of wills... \nThe Colonel nods; and Red LASHES Caesar again! \nSpirits broken, the apes go SILENT; beside Caesar, Ape Elder drops his eyes. \nPREACHER (CONT'D) Look, I owe you one, so let me set you straight here, ok? I think he respects you, he does... that's why you're still alive. But believe me, he can do a lot worse than this. I've seen it. (haunted, almost a whisper) You do not want to agitate the man. Understand? So just... \nHe gestures with his hand: back off. Disturbed, Caesar holds his gaze; then watches as Preacher descends the platform... \nCUT TO: \nBEHIND CAESAR HANGING LIMPLY ON THE X - NIGHT \nWe're looking out past Caesar over the camp, as exhausted apes are herded away from the wall, the work day over... A diesel GENERATOR COUGHS to life, HARSH LIGHTS blinking on. \nCaesar squints into the glare, weary -- when the SOUND OF SOLDIERS makes him look below -- at a group approaching from the rear of the camp, rolling ominous-looking ARTILLERY; suddenly concerned, he watches them head toward the apes... \n...the fraught apes look alarmed as they see the weapons and Soldiers coming their way -- then Caesar discovers even more Soldiers with MASSIVE MACHINE GUNS by the wall. Unnerved, he sees them hoisting the guns up to the sentry towers... where others position them on tripods; but then Caesar NOTICES -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAll the weapons are POINTED OUTWARD, BEYOND THE CAMP... \nCaesar is relieved; he stares at the weapons, perplexed -- when he hears FOOTSTEPS; he turns to see -- \nRED climbing the platform toward him, gripping a long MACHETE with a look of cruel satisfaction... Startled, Caesar tenses; he peers around anxiously to FIND -- \nTHE COLONEL eerily watching from the warden tower window... \nChilled, Caesar turns back, bracing for the worst, as Red stops before him... He looks at the knife, then meets Red's cold gaze. Steeling himself, he hardens, his voice hoarse: \nCAESAR What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone? \nRed just stares, contempt in his eyes. \nCAESAR (CONT'D) No matter what you do... you'll never be one of them. (then) You let them call you \"donkey\"... You are ape. \nRed raises his knife, examining it in his hands; he runs his fingers along the edge... Then looks at Caesar, sneers: \nRED Koba right. You think you know better... than rest of apes. But look you now. (his expression darkens) You nothing. \nRed SUDDENLY LIFTS THE MACHETE -- Caesar's eyes widen as RED SWINGS DOWN AT HIM VICIOUSLY -- THWAP!!! THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE WOOD, AN INCH FROM CAESAR'S WRIST, HACKING THROUGH THE ROPE -- ! Caesar turns to Red in shock, as his arm is set free. \nRED (CONT'D) (menacing, quiet) Kerna... want see you. \nCaesar looks back up at the tower window where the Colonel remains staring a moment longer; then turns, and disappears. \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \nThen a DOOR IS OPENED, REVEALING -- we are -- \nINT. WARDEN'S TOWER - NIGHT \nThe Colonel stands with his back to us, leaning on a map- covered table in the former window-lined control center, smoke rises from sage and grass smudge burning in a tin bowl. \nCAESAR, PREACHER AND RED ENTER \napproaching the Colonel, who still doesn't acknowledge them; as searchlights outside sweep through, Caesar catches a brief glimpse of a room just off the control center -- it looks almost like a sanctum; light passes over APE SKULLS... the word \"HISTORY\" scrawled on a wall... then the room goes dark again. Caesar looks unsettled -- his gaze returning to the Colonel, and noticing for the first time painful looking BRAND SCARS on the back of his hands: one Alpha, one Omega. \nThe Colonel finally speaks, eyes still on the map: \nTHE COLONEL Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall. \nHe looks up coldly at Caesar, then nods at Preacher: that's all -- they start to lead Caesar out, but he won't go yet -- \nCAESAR Apes... need food... water. \nTHE COLONEL (eyes on the map) They'll get food and water when they finish the work. \nCAESAR Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish. \nThe Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar's audacity. \nTHE COLONEL You know you're very emotional. (then) What makes you think you're in a position to make demands? \nCaesar doesn't reply. The Colonel turns back to the map -- Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar's chain -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPREACHER C'mon -- \nBut Caesar stands firm, eyes fixed on the Colonel: \nCAESAR The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they? \nThe Colonel slowly looks up, smiles, suddenly intrigued -- as Red warily tightens his grip on Caesar's chain... \nCAESAR (CONT'D) I saw men outside by the wall... preparing for battle... \nThe Colonel studies him, surprised: \nTHE COLONEL I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive. \nHe stares at Caesar a moment; then finally: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) No.   They won't be joining me. \nPreacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturing closer to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety... \nPREACHER ...sir -- \nThe Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he stops right in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burns, tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage... \nTHE COLONEL What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me? \nCaesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar's angry stare as he starts slowly forward: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (6) \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) Or is killing me more important...? \nThe Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns to Preacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we -- \nCUT TO: \nPREACHER AND RED MARCHING CAESAR OUT OF THE DEPOT - NIGHT \nThey head for the yard -- Preacher utters quietly, shaken: \nPREACHER Didn't I tell you not to agitate him? That was not smart, man... \nCaesar glances at Preacher, then at Red behind them; he turns forward, speaks softly to Preacher, a hint of sympathy: \nCAESAR If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can. \nPreacher turns to him; then abruptly stops: \nPREACHER Leave?     What are you talking about? \nCAESAR You are not like him. \nPreacher looks at Caesar, taken aback -- maybe even offended: \nPREACHER He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? (darkening) I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now. \nCaesar is stunned.    Preacher raises his crossbow: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPREACHER (CONT'D) C'mon, kong. \nHe glances back, nodding to Red O.S., and we -- \nCUT TO: \nHAND-HELD BINOCULAR POV AS RED SHOVES CAESAR FORWARD \nSnow drifts down around them as they march Caesar through the yard, past the soldiers' barracks, LIGHTS inside GOING OUT one by one... REVEAL -- \nON THE CLIFFS JUST ABOVE THE CAMP - NIGHT \nConcealed behind boulders, Rocket LOWERING THE BINOCULARS, gravely SCOPING OUT the camp -- as Maurice, the Girl on his back, and Bad Ape arrive next to him, climbing down rocks. \nMAURICE (worried) [How is he?] \nRocket shakes his head: not good. He rises, waves for them to follow him further down the mountain. They start to go... \nEXT. YARD - NEAR THE PENS - NIGHT \nCaesar waits grimly at the base of the platform, as Red unshackles his hands; Preacher stands guard, the X looming. \nCaesar looks up to discover APES gathered at the bars of their pen, unseen by Red and Preacher, whose backs are to them. Their starved faces are etched with worry for Caesar. He softens, eyes settling on Lake's gentle gaze as Red continues to unshackle him. Concern fills Lake's eyes: \nLAKE [You look weary.] \nCaesar looks back at her, then peers out at the MASS OF DISPIRITED APE FACES. Determination sets in; he steals a look at his captors, then signs discreetly to the apes: \nCAESAR [Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.] \nThe Apes return moved stares -- when Red hands Preacher back the key, and Preacher nods for Caesar to climb the platform. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLake and the others watch as Caesar, weakened, takes an exhausted step -- and suddenly STUMBLES, knocking into Preacher -- who shoves him back, startled -- \nPREACHER Get off! \nThe Apes look scared for Caesar as Red yanks him down. \nRecovering, Caesar lifts his head, glancing meaningfully back at Lake, then rises to his feet... \nConfused, Lake watches as Caesar continues up the steps -- when she notices CAESAR'S HAND slipping behind his back -- as the hand subtly opens, Lake suddenly SEES Caesar is carefully showing her something -- \nPreacher's shackle key is now concealed in Caesar's palm, its small key ring looped slyly around his middle finger. \nLake can't believe her eyes; with dawning hope she turns, points it out to the others -- their eyes widen, excitement spreading as they watch him ascend the platform... \nEXT. SNOWY CANYON FLOOR OUTSIDE THE PRISON WALL - LATE NIGHT \nRocket leads as the group sneaks along the base of the wall. They arrive at a spot where the wall has come down, steal a look around the edge, peering into the camp... \nCUT BACK TO: \nCAESAR \ngazing nervously through the bars at the Girl, who stands at the Apes' pen, her back to us; she seems engaged in some transaction with them, the Apes all trying to get near her -- \nCaesar's eyes dart tensely around at GUARDS ON PATROL in the distance, unaware of her presence, but for how long...? \nFinally, the Girl turns and heads toward Caesar, CRADLING SOMETHING IN HER ARMS. Caesar watches curiously as she steps up to his cage. He glances at the APES IN THEIR PEN to find them all watching expectantly... \nCaesar turns back to the Girl; she leans forward carefully, as if about to spill the contents from her arms -- puzzled, Caesar reaches his hands out to catch whatever it is -- AND A LONG STREAM OF GRAIN RUSHES INTO HIS PALMS. \nSurprised, Caesar looks up at her... then out at the Apes in the pen, their eyes all still on him. One of them raises his hands, quietly pressing his fists together, SIGNING proudly: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAPE [Apes together strong.] \nA wave of emotion floods Caesar's face; and then he sees other Apes silently raising their fists too... Caesar is completely overcome as each and every one of them joins in. \nA smile slowly surfaces on Caesar's face; you can almost see his strength returning... \nThe Girl follows Caesar's gaze to the Apes and their up- stretched hands; then turns back to Caesar. She uncertainly raises her fists together too... smiling, proud of herself. \nMAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE \nwatch from behind the gate, affected by the sight -- when they spot something the apes and the Girl cannot yet see -- \nTHE COLONEL AND SOME OF THE OFFICERS IN THE DISTANCE \ndeep in conference, walking in the direction of the pens...! \nMAURICE AND ROCKET exchange terrified looks -- \nMAURICE [If humans see her, they will kill her...] \nCUT TO: \nON CAESAR AND THE GIRL \nas they SPIN, startled -- suddenly seeing the Colonel and troops stepping into view ten feet away -- when -- a sudden COMMOTION in the distance grabs their attention -- \nCaesar grunts urgently to the Girl, nodding for her to hide -- she presses quickly behind one of the guard tower legs -- just as the Colonel and troops stop in the path right before Caesar's cage, still gazing off at the disturbance... \nCaesar follows their looks to SEE -- \nA SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS, guns-drawn, amped up, shouting at AN UNSEEN INTRUDER... As they approach, prodding with their weapons, Caesar discovers the intruder is -- \nROCKET.   He marches slowly, chin-raised defiantly. \nCaesar watches in shock as Rocket is brought toward the waiting Colonel... who slowly turns and looks suspiciously at Caesar -- unaware of the Girl just behind the tower leg... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAs Rocket arrives at gunpoint, the Colonel gestures to Red. Red and Rocket exchange hard stares; Red moves to restrain Rocket's arms -- but ROCKET SUDDENLY RESISTS, thrashing into Red, HEAD-BUTTING HIM -- Red stumbles, clutching his head, stunned... then LAUNCHES furiously back at Rocket! \nThe two apes begin VICIOUSLY WRESTLING as the SOLDIERS WATCH, guns trained; a few LAUGH derisively, amused by the display -- TWO TURNCOATS nervously approach, unsure what to do -- \nCaesar seizes this momentary distraction -- gestures for the Girl to make a run for it -- SHE DARTS AWAY -- ducking behind the long barracks nearby, streaking toward the wall -- \nThe Colonel peers down annoyed at Red and Rocket; he calmly pulls out his sidearm, points down at them and FIRES -- ! \nCaesar's head whips around -- as Rocket and Red FREEZE, startled -- a CLOUD OF DIRT kicking up from where the bullet hit the ground beside them... \nRed immediately takes the opportunity to get the upper hand, forcing Rocket's face to the ground, pinning him. The Colonel walks closer to Rocket; stares at him a beat... \nTHE COLONEL How many are out there?   Are there others? \nRocket stays silent, refusing to show even a hint of fear. \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) (to Soldiers) Sweep the area. (turns to Red) Put him in the pen. \nAs the Colonel walks off, Red abruptly leaps to his feet, grabbing Rocket by the ankle -- Rocket FLAILS VIOLENTLY as Red drags him across the dirt and ice... \nCaesar watches in horror as the turncoats move in, BEATING ROCKET into submission as they HURL him into the pen. One roughly SHACKLES HIM -- as Red delivers a last, VICIOUS KICK, leaving Rocket in a crumpled heap as they exit. \nCaesar's stricken eyes remain fixed on Rocket as he struggles to his feet. His face bloodied and bruised, Rocket looks back at Caesar through the bars of their pens -- and to Caesar's surprise, Rocket smiles at him... He SIGNS: \nROCKET [Feeling better?] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nThrown, Caesar looks at him, then manages a slight smile; he nods. Rocket nods back, pleased: \nROCKET (CONT'D) [Good.   Then we can talk about escape.] \nHe brings his fists together: \"Apes together strong.\" Emotional, Caesar smiles, proud of his friend; as he brings his own fists together... \nPRE-LAP -- A LONE HUMAN VOICE SINGING OUT in gospel tones: \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left... \nAS WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTANKER GUARD That's high enough, kong! \nCaesar submissively holds up his hands. The soldiers eye him a beat longer as Caesar returns to quarrying... then, coast clear, Caesar peers out at -- \nThe ROCK OUTCROPPING in the distance, outside the camp; he can just make out a DARK FORM behind the boulders -- CUT TO: \nHANDHELD BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR ON THE QUARRY LEDGE \nCaesar looking right at us, signing: \nCAESAR [37 steps to the adult cage...   55 to the children.] \nREVEAL MAURICE \nlowering the binoculars; he ducks down behind the rocks -- \n-- where the Girl and Bad Ape await his command. \nMaurice points to the Girl, then up at his eyes, looking around -- as if to say, \"You, keep a look out.\" The Girl nods back very seriously, his little soldier. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DUSTY COMPASS \nfrom the airstream trailer. The NEEDLE QUIVERS as the compass sits in a massive ape palm -- we are: \nINT. TUNNEL - AT THE CONCRETE-FILLED IMPASSE - DAY \nMaurice stares at the compass in his hand as Bad Ape watches, holding the flashlight... finally, Maurice lifts his head, and POINTS TO TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE TUNNEL WALL. \nBad Ape nods eagerly, moves to one of the spots, and STARTS TO DIG tentatively, looking to Maurice for approval; Maurice nods, goes to the other spot, STARTS DIGGING as well. \nEXT. HIGH OVER THE CAMP - NIGHT \nAt gunpoint, apes roll MASSIVE SOPHISTICATED ARTILLERY out of the depot at the base of the mountain, and along the train tracks toward the barrier wall... \nAT THE BARRIER WALL \nA cluster of POWERFUL GORILLAS struggle to hoist an imposing high-tech RAPIER MISSILE LAUNCHER up to the top of the wall -- \nREVEAL -- WIDE ON THE NOW COMPLETED WALL -- MORE RAPIER LAUNCHERS BEING POSITIONED BY APES AND SOLDIERS ALL ALONG THE EXPANSE. The display of sheer force is a formidable sight. \nON CAESAR -- WATCHING THE WALL FORTIFICATION \nas Red and Preacher march him across the yard amidst masses of weary apes being herded back to the pens; they arrive at -- \nCAESAR'S CAGE \nAs Preacher starts to unlock the door, Caesar's gaze shifts to Red, and then to the ANGRY WELT over Red's eye where Rocket head-butted him; Red glowers, self-conscious. \nPreacher opens the door, and Red shoves Caesar in. Then Red steps forward to remove the chain leash from Caesar's neck collar, pressing his face menacingly close to Caesar's: \nRED You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow... when wall is done. \nCaesar's eyes shift briefly to Preacher's, who looks away. Then he turns back to Red: \nCAESAR His wall is madness. It won't save him... any more than it will save you. \nRED I save myself. \nCAESAR Is there anything left... of you to save? \nA brief flash of uncertainty passes over Red as he meets Caesar's piercing eyes... then he musters a final hard stare at Caesar, and turns to go. \nCUT TO: \nBINOCULAR POV \nas the rest of the apes are prodded off the wall, the intimidating fortification now complete; REVEAL -- \nTHE GIRL \nWatching from behind the rocks. She lowers the binoculars, blinking out at the camp a beat... \nCUT TO: \nMOVING WITH THE GIRL THROUGH THE TUNNEL \nEyes wide, she searches for sign of Maurice or Bad Ape... She approaches the cement-filled impasse... finding TWO NEWLY DUG TUNNELS on either side of the blockage. She enters -- \nONE OF THE NEW TUNNELS \nShe heads toward the distant glow of a flashlight up ahead... Arriving behind Maurice, covered in dirt, still digging away. \nHe stops, noticing her. He looks at her quizzically -- points upward, makes a tentative thumbs up sign -- \"everything ok up there?\" She nods. He smiles: \nMAURICE [You are very brave.] \nShe looks at him, confused.     He gently repeats the sign: \nMAURICE (CONT'D) [Brave.] \nLAKE, who immediately starts to unshackle herself -- she passes the keys down the line of her chain gang, they all begin to unshackle themselves too -- \nROCKET moves to the pen door, uses BOYLE'S KEYS to unlock it -- then tosses BOYLE'S KEYS across to -- \nCAESAR, who starts to unlock his cage -- when he notices something -- he holds up his hand! Everyone freezes. They all look up at -- \nTHE WARDEN'S TOWER \nto see the Colonel stepping toward his lighted window, his face in SILHOUETTE -- he might be staring down at them, or off into the distance, it's impossible to tell... \nCaesar and Rocket share a tense look -- \nROCKET [Do you think he knows we're up to something?] \nUnsure, Caesar peers back up at the Colonel's silhouette. After a beat, the Colonel steps away from the window. Rocket looks anxiously at Caesar, raising the rifle: \nROCKET (CONT'D) [Now?] \nCAESAR (shakes his head) [Wait till he turns out his lights.] \nHOLD as they stare at the lighted window, waiting... waiting... SOUNDS OF FIERCELY GUSTING WIND rising... as we -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. YARD - WIDE ON THE TOWER AND PENS - LATER \nIT'S SNOWING HARD NOW, a fresh layer blanketing everything. And still, the Colonel's lights remain on. The apes are all pressed to the bars of their pen, eyes fixed up on the Colonel's window; some pace, tortured by the wait... \nPUSHING IN ON CAESAR \nStaring up with coiled intensity, totally still... His gaze shifts to Rocket, whose eyes are locked on Caesar -- \nROCKET [The sun will be up soon...] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTorn, Caesar steals a final look at the lighted window... then turns back to Rocket -- forced to make the call: \nCAESAR [We go now. Or die trying.] \nRocket nods -- he waits as the SEARCHLIGHT PASSES, then darts out of the pen, holding the stolen rifle -- crossing to Caesar's cage, as Caesar steps out -- they both streak -- \nTOWARD THE SOLDIERS' BARRACKS \nducking into an alley between the building and the children's pen -- they press against the barrack's wall, peering down the alley to see -- \nSOLDIERS PASSING BY THE CHILDREN'S PEN \nCaesar waits until the Soldiers cross out of sight -- then looks to Rocket, and they head for -- \nTHE CHILDREN'S PEN \nA small cluster of kids rush to the door as Caesar unlocks it; others stir from their sleep, scrambling over to see -- \nCaesar and Rocket enter. The little apes swarm around them, wide-eyed. Caesar gently pats their heads, shushing them -- when suddenly he sees HIS SON in the crowd. Cornelius breaks into a run, clambering up over the backs of the others... straight into Caesar's arms. Emotion floods Caesar's face as he tightly embraces his son... \nCAESAR (overcome, holding him tight) I love you, son... \nCUT TO: \nA POV THROUGH A DOORWAY AT A GUARD TOWER \nWe glimpse the side of the Guard's head as he stares down, eating -- \nREVEAL ROCKET, keeping lookout on the guard from the doorway; behind him the children are huddled with Caesar -- Caesar hustles the children toward a LIGHT POLE, quickly hoisting one after another up onto it -- \nCUT WIDER OVER THE CHILDREN'S PEN \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nwhere we see Caesar, Rocket and the children are on a second story landing, dangerously close to the Guard Tower -- the little apes scale the tall light pole, scrambling out onto -- \nTHE ELECTRICAL LINE \nsuspended high over the Guard Towers and camp -- \nAs SNOW SWIRLS HARD all around them, the children make their way back toward the adult pen -- directly over the heads of the unwitting Soldiers below! \nIN THE ADULT PEN \nThe children arrive on the wire above and begin dropping down silently, one by one -- into the waiting arms of Lake and other unchained apes -- the apes urgently hand the kids off to their anxious parents. \nAs the emotional reunions continue, Caesar (Cornelius clinging around his neck) and Rocket finally arrive overhead too, each dropping down into the grasp of the massive gorillas waiting below. \nCUT TO: \nMAURICE \nStaring up urgently from the hole in the adult pen... as Caesar and the apes converge above; Caesar and Rocket begin HANDING THE CHILDREN DOWN... \nIN THE HOLE \nMaurice lowers the kids to the tunnel floor; they look up to find Nova extending her hand... and they start off after her down the tunnel... \nMesmerized, Red watches motionless as Caesar charges fearlessly through the chaos toward the TANKER directly beneath gunners on the wall! \nCaesar continues through the smoke and debris -- finally grabbing one of the grenades from the bandolier -- eyes fixed on the tanker just 30 feet away -- rearing back, about to pull the pin -- WHEN SUDDENLY -- \nCAESAR DROPS, CLUTCHING HIS SIDE -- TUMBLING TO THE GROUND! \nShocked, Red watches as Caesar, in agony, touches his abdomen, discovering BLOOD; Caesar reaches behind him to find he's been shot in the back with a CROSSBOW ARROW... \nRed looks up to see -- PREACHER stalking through the haze and snow, out of the pen area, almost shocked himself at what he has just done -- he nervously loads another arrow, in turmoil as he moves toward Caesar. \nGasping in pain, Caesar SNAPS the arrow from his side, and turns, seeing Preacher too... \nRed stands frozen, gripped by the sight of Caesar lying there helpless -- \nGUNNER (O.S.) (CONT'D) GODAMMIT!!! \nRed turns, startled, to find the Gunner screaming at him, momentarily turned from the battle -- \nGUNNER (CONT'D) YOU STUPID DONKEY!!! WHERE'S MY LAUNCHER!?! \nRed suddenly looks at the weapon in his hands, remembering what he was ordered to do -- still returning to his senses, he nods to the Gunner -- who immediately turns back to the battle, FIRING RELENTLESSLY at the apes... \nCUT TO: \nCAESAR ON THE GROUND \nas he sees Preacher anxiously closing in... Caesar's eyes frantically dart for an avenue of escape, but there is none. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHis pained gaze returns to Preacher who comes to a stop just 25 feet away, hesitating, torn -- then, finally steeling himself, he raises the LOADED CROSSBOW -- when -- \nFSSSSSSST--KABLOOM! Preacher DISAPPEARS in a HUGE BLAST!!! AND EVERYTHING GOES INSTANTLY SILENT, THE SOUND REPLACED BY A QUIET RINGING -- \nStunned, disoriented, Caesar looks around him, deafened, finally peering up to discover -- \nRED ON THE WALL holding the SMOKING LAUNCHER, looking down stoically. \nCaesar can't believe it... He gazes up in shock at -- \nRED, who just gazes back, calmly holding the weapon, almost in a state of peace -- while BEHIND HIM -- \nTHE GUNNER turns, suddenly realizing what Red has just done, freaking out, his SCREAMING INAUDIBLE to Caesar's ringing ears -- the Gunner pulls out his PISTOL -- pointing it at Red, who doesn't even react -- we see just a split-second of his SILENT MUZZLE FLASH -- when we CUT -- \nCLOSE ON CAESAR \nas he takes in the grim sight, pained -- THEN -- \nTHE GUNNER turns and takes aim at CAESAR! \nCaesar scrambles, the sounds around him (and us) suddenly starting to return -- as -- he SNATCHES UP THE GRENADE from the ground beside him -- jumping to his feet -- \n-- narrowly dodging the Gunner's bullets tearing up earth around him -- as he PULLS THE PIN from the grenade, desperately LAUNCHING it straight for the tanker beneath the wall -- \nThe Gunner's alarmed eyes suddenly whip toward the tanker -- as Caesar takes off, sprinting in the opposite direction -- \n-- when the grenade EXPLODES and THE TANKER ERUPTS -- ENGULFING the WALL beside it, and consuming all the Gunners above in its INCREDIBLE BLAST!!! \nCaesar races into the adult pen -- as behind him, FLAMES CLIMB HIGH INTO THE SKY -- when SUDDENLY -- THE TRAIN CAR NEXT TO THE TANKER EXPLODES TOO! \nStill running, Caesar steals a startled look back -- as ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe DIVES down into the hole -- as -- \nWE CUT WIDE OVER THE CAMP -- AND THE CHAIN REACTION CONTINUES -- CARS ERUPTING ONE AFTER ANOTHER -- BLASTING THE CAMP APART -- HEADING BACK ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD THE DEPOT AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN -- A CATACLYSMIC DISPLAY OF DESTRUCTION SO LARGE, IT'S STAGGERING!!! \nSMASH TO: \nCAESAR RUNNING THROUGH THE TUNNELS BELOW \nAS THE SHOCKWAVES CONTINUE, THE TUNNELS GIVING WAY, BEGINNING TO COLLAPSE BEHIND HIM! \nCAESAR RACES FOR LIGHT AT THE TUNNEL'S END -- LEAPING FOR THE LADDER -- SCRAMBLING UP -- WHEN THE WHOOSH OF DEBRIS SUDDENLY SWEEPS AROUND HIM -- AND HE EMERGES -- TUMBLING OUT -- \nTHROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING \nAnd flat onto his stomach! \nFinally, he lifts his head to see the feet of apes all around, their backs to him -- as he rises, he finds them all staring out beyond the outcropping in awe... \nHe slowly presses his way through the crowd, climbing higher on the rocks... to discover their eyes all fixed on... \nTHE UTTERLY DECIMATED PRISON, engulfed in a massive conflagration as a STORM OF DEBRIS RAINS DOWN FROM THE SKY... \nNow seeing Caesar, Rocket and Bad Ape turn, stunned at the sight of him -- Caesar and Rocket begin to exchange emotional looks -- \n-- when MECHANICAL GROANS beside them make them all turn to see -- \nTHE REMAINING ARMADA as it finally arrives, braking to a stop just 20 yards away... SOLDIERS, FACES ALL OBSCURED in heavy parkas and BALACLAVAS, are packed onto troop carriers, trucks and humvees, gazing in shock at the fiery camp -- when ONE notices... the apes. Others start to see them too... A moment suspended in time as ape and man all stare silently at each other... \nThen, the anonymous soldiers slowly begin to raise their weapons -- Caesar and the apes remaining totally still -- when -- \n", "test1_input": "Rocket nods and as they start to explore deeper, we CUT TO -- \nANOTHER ANGLE FAR BEHIND THEM \nWe see the two apes and the light from their flashlight start to shrink from view -- REVEAL -- \nBAD APE \nwatching from the mouth of the tunnel in the hole they found last night. He gazes anxiously as they disappear -- when -- \nWe hear SHRILL, DISTANT WHISTLES blowing -- Bad Ape turns to see -- THE GIRL CLIMBING the rope ladder toward the sound -- \nBad Ape rushes to the ladder, calling up to her, alarmed -- \nBAD APE No no no -- no climb -- ! \nBut she continues, climbing out the top... Bad Ape clutches his head, torn about what to do; then reluctantly starts up -- \nAT THE TOP OF THE HOLE \nBad Ape pokes his head up... to find the Girl heading away -- \nON THE GIRL \nas she heads toward the edge of the rocks, drawn by something she sees in the distance -- \nBAD APE (O.S.) No, no!   Where you go?! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe appears, running after her.. He finds her SQUINTING out at something past the rocks... He follows her stare to ONE OF THE OPENINGS in the massive wall. He whispers to her: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) What?   What you see...? \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nMaurice and Rocket head down the tunnel -- \nROCKET [Must be under the camp by now!] \nThey stop in a cavernous concrete hub where the sewage tunnels converge -- \nMAURICE [Wonder how close we are... to where soldiers keep apes?] \nHe lifts his flashlight to the ceiling; they both look up -- \nCUT TO: \nA LOW ANGLE SHOT ALONG THE PRISON TRAIN TRACKS - DAY \nApes work on the wall in the distance, some HOISTING heavy BM- 12 ROCKET LAUNCHERS into place above -- when -- we HEAR a QUIET RUSTLING sound -- which continues as we PULL FOCUS to the train rail in front of us, and begin PUSHING TOWARD IT... \nAs we clear over the rail, we TIP DOWN to see the BALLAST GRAVEL under the tracks STARTING TO MOVE... The stones SHUDDER, and suddenly begin to FUNNEL DOWNWARD as we CUT TO -- \nTHE TUNNEL BELOW \nwhere a RUSH OF GRAVEL showers over Rocket, who stands on Maurice's back as Rocket claws through the earth above them. \nDAYLIGHT suddenly peeks in through a TINY HOLE in the surface. Rocket stops digging; he glances down at Maurice, then carefully presses his eye to the hole... \nROCKET'S POV UP THROUGH HOLE \nPeering up through the train tracks we can see A TALL METAL POLE looming against the winter sky. As we -- \nCUT WIDE TO THE CAMP ABOVE \nThe pole is revealed to be a TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH rising in an exposed area of the yard, Soldiers nearby on either side. \nCUT TO: \nCAESAR - SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS - DUSK \nHe is covered in frost and ice, shivering with hypothermia, very near death... \nBAD APE (O.S.) (quietly distraught) Ohhhh no, friend... \nREVEAL BAD APE - STILL AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING \nlowering the binoculars -- he turns to the girl to share the bad news -- \nBAD APE (CONT'D) He -- \nwhen he sees \nTHE GIRL \nalready starting to walk away toward the camp! \nBAD APE (urgent whisper) No! \nHe creeps out from behind the rocks after her    -- FRANTICALLY WHISPERING: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) No no no... no no no... \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nCAESAR ON THE X - NIGHT \nHis head bowed, fading even more now, shaking, his lips cracked, his skin frostbitten and turning blue. He looks as if he might die any second... It is eerily quiet now. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nA SHADOW passes over him... And then, a PAIR OF APE HANDS reach slowly into frame, gently cradling Caesar's face... \nCAESAR'S EYES FLUTTER OPEN, struggling to see; he looks up at the Ape, its face OUT OF FOCUS, haloed by the camp's lights. \nAs the Ape's head nears, blocking the light, its face comes into view: it is KOBA, staring down at Caesar tenderly. Caesar's eyes widen, bewildered; he's breathless: \nCAESAR Koba... \nKoba leans in toward Caesar, gazing into his eyes... then moves even closer, pressing his lips to Caesar's ear: \nKOBA (a comforting whisper) Sleep... \nFighting exhaustion, Caesar pulls back, struggling to resist. \nKOBA (CONT'D) Let go... (glances toward the apes) You cannot save them... They will all die here... \nCaesar follows his gaze, then looks back at Koba, stricken: \nCAESAR No... \nKOBA (O.S.) Yes...    Join me... \nCaesar starts to shut his eyes, devastated -- when a BLINDING FLASH startles him -- he squints back up as a MACHETE swings through the air overhead -- the blade HACKS into the rope binding his wrist with a LOUD THWACK! \nCompletely disoriented, Caesar looks back at the Ape beside him again, realizing now it is RED. He looks past him to see The Colonel and Preacher too -- as Red cuts the rope around his other hand, Caesar finally COLLAPSES. \nTHE COLONEL If he's still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him. (then) Keep him separate from the others. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nPreacher nods; as Caesar sees Red moving for him, he uses his last bit of strength to close his fist around the key... \nEXT. ROCK-OUTCROPPING - TOP OF THE HOLE - NIGHT \nRocket and Maurice clamber urgently out behind Bad Ape, who stops at the edge of the rocks -- pointing frantically with two fingers again and again at the opening in the barrier wall -- trying to sign: \nBAD APE IN!     She go IN! \nStunned, Maurice and Rocket slowly turn to the camp; and we -- \nCUT TO: \nHIGH ANGLE OVER THE WALL \nAs Soldiers work busily in the towers and all along the wall securing artillery -- we see the Girl walking right through the open front gate directly below, totally unnoticed... \nEXT. CAESAR'S SMALL CAGE - UNDER A GUARD TOWER - NIGHT \nPUSHING SLOWLY IN on Caesar through the bars... \nHe lies on his stomach, face to the ground. As the CAMERA stops, a small blurry FORM steps to the edge of frame... \nREVEAL THE GIRL \nStanding in front of the cage, staring down at Caesar sadly. After a moment, she fishes into the pocket of her bulky parka, and pulls out her RAG DOLL. She stretches her arm through the bars, straining toward Caesar... GENTLY TOSSING the doll toward him. \nDazed, Caesar slowly lifts his head, confused... and discovers the doll next to him on the ground. \nHe looks up... to see the Girl staring down with concern. \nShe holds his gaze; then lifts her tiny hand and tentatively slides her finger along her neck -- the sign Maurice was trying to teach her for: \nTHE GIRL [Thirsty...?] \nCaesar looks at her, stunned.    And touched.   And then -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe Girl abruptly turns and walks off. Caesar cranes his head, worried for her... unable to see where she's gone... when she suddenly returns, lugging a pail of water in both hands. She raises the pail, holds it to the bars. \nCaesar lifts himself, pressing his face to the bars... and she tilts the pail, gently spilling water into his mouth. As Caesar thirstily guzzles, the Girl removes one hand from the pail, touching the side of his face -- \nQUIET APE GRUNTS echo from the yard.   The Girl turns to see -- \nA LARGE GROUP OF APES pressed to the bars of their pen, watching her and Caesar. A few silently wave her over... \nCUT TO: \nAN EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD \nAs the Girl crosses from Caesar's cage to the Apes' pen, oblivious to the potential danger around her... REVEAL: \nMAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE \nwatching anxiously, their three faces huddled together in the shadows, peering around the edge of the giant front gate... \n", "test2_input": "IT'S ROCKET. He stares down at Bad Ape, expressionless... and then a big smile spreads across his face. He turns excitedly to the look-out ape: \nROCKET [This is the ape I told you about.] \nThey all stare at him again, fascinated.       The look-out steps forward, and SIGNS to Bad Ape: \nLOOK-OUT [Thank you.] \nBut Bad Ape looks up insecurely, not understanding the sign; seeing this, the look-out slowly reaches down into the hole, OFFERING HIS HAND. \nBad Ape regards the hand uncertainly... then CLASPS it, beaming. He stares up at his new friend, then pats his chest with his other hand, bowing his head as he nods, quietly fumbling for a way to introduce himself: \nBAD APE ...Bad Ape. (shaking other apes' hands) Bad Ape... Bad Ape... \nMore and more apes jostle to get a look, greeting him warmly, Bad Ape overcome by the affection from this new family. \nDOWN BELOW \nMaurice peers up at Bad Ape above him, trying to get a look at what's going on -- when -- Nova tugs on his fur. He looks at her, and she points -- \nDOWN THE TUNNEL \nwhere a SMALL STREAM OF WATER is creeping toward them. \nMaurice looks at the ground beneath him as the water starts to pool around his feet; alarmed, he instinctively steps forward to investigate -- forgetting Bad Ape on his shoulders. Bad Ape tumbles to the wet floor, surprised. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMaurice spins, realizing; Bad Ape looks at the water around him, confused. As Maurice bends to help him, Bad Ape glances up, seeing something above -- Maurice follows his gaze to -- \nROCKET peering over the edge of the hole with concern.       His eyes lock on Maurice's, immediately sensing trouble -- \nROCKET [What's wrong?] \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAESAR'S CAGE - NIGHT \nCaesar waits alone, staring     tensely at the apes across the way, all huddled around the     hole, backs to us. Rocket suddenly breaks through the     crowd to report to Caesar, who has been anxiously awaiting     news. Rocket looks grave: \nROCKET [There's a problem.] \nAs worry creeps into Caesar's face, we CUT TO -- \nINT. TUNNEL - IMMEDIATELY \nMUD AND WATER GUSH IN through a WIDENING FISSURE in the wall where Maurice had been digging -- Maurice and Bad Ape try desperately to plug the opening with earth and rocks... \nEXT. YARD - THE PENS - NIGHT \nWe hear QUIET APE GRUNTING -- Caesar stands pressed to the bars of his cage looking across to a large group of apes gathered at the edge of their pen, all eyes fixed on Caesar. \nCLOSER ON THE PEN \nThe apes in mid-debate -- \nROCKET [We can't dig any further, it will flood the whole tunnel!] \nLAKE [If we don't dig further, we'll never get to the children! How are we going to get them out?] \nA sudden swell of APE GRUNTS echo the sentiment -- \nCaesar raises a hand to quiet the apes, peering around at the GUARDS PATROLLING THE CAMP to see if the noise alerted them -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nRocket and some of the others glance up at THE GUARD TOWER directly above Caesar's cage... where Boyle is leaning suspiciously over the ledge. Boyle listens for a moment -- then, hearing no more commotion, leans back. \nThe apes all pause warily for a beat; then Lake signs stealthily, worried: \nLAKE (CONT'D) [We have to keep looking down there, see if there's another way to reach the children...] \nBut Caesar shakes his head, gravely serious: \nCAESAR [We must leave tonight!] \nPained, Caesar turns behind him, glances at the children, all asleep in their pen -- he can see little Cornelius sleeping too -- he turns back to the other, decisive: \nCAESAR (CONT'D) [We'll have to get the children out above ground!] \nThe apes exchange tense looks; then all look back at Caesar: \nROCKET [How...?] \nEXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP - LATE NIGHT \nThe lights in the soldiers' barracks go out, one by one... \nUP BY THE GUARD TOWER OVER THE ADULT APE PEN \nBoyle steps slowly out onto the catwalk, quietly drinking from a steaming thermos, staring out into the distance -- \nWHEN SPLAT! He is SUDDENLY PELTED HARD in the back of his head with a handful of what looks like WET MUD from somewhere below. Stunned, he looks at himself, wiping the disgusting muck off: wtf?! He peers furiously over the railing at the pen below -- \n", "test2_true": "SMASH TO: \nBOYLE \nCHARGING down the tower ladder, heading for the pen! He thrusts his keys into the lock, slides open the door, and enters, shutting it behind him; he raises his gun at the shackled apes who shuffle fearfully out of his way: \nBOYLE Who did that?! \nThe apes cower, shaking their heads, protesting innocence -- when SPLAT! Another WAD of muck smacks the side of his head! \nBOYLE (CONT'D) SONUVA--!!! \nHe spins, swinging his rifle -- the chained apes rush out of the way in panic, parting to reveal -- \nTHE CULPRIT. It's Rocket, who stands his ground as he glares back clutching another fistful of muck... Boyle recognizes him: \nBOYLE (CONT'D) You... \nLivid, he raises his gun, about to shoot -- when an ORANGUTAN HAND SEIZES HIS ANKLE from below and YANKS HIM DOWN INTO THE HOLE IN THE GROUND! The Apes all stare at the hole... \nAnd a moment later, BOYLE'S KEYS are TOSSED BACK UP. \nRocket moves forward and snatches them up. He looks down into the hole at Maurice; they share a determined look; then Maurice HANDS HIM UP Boyle's RIFLE -- \nINT. CAESAR'S CAGE - SIMULTANEOUS \nCaesar urgently feels for something along the wall above the cage door -- until he finds where he's hidden Preacher's key. \nHe bends down and immediately begins unshackling his feet... He gets one free -- when -- he hears FOOTSTEPS... He stops, quickly turns, seeing -- \nTHE FIGURE OF THE COLONEL approaching in the distance. \nCaesar straightens, carefully palming the key, eyes on the Colonel heading toward the pens... as Rocket, across the way, slowly hides Boyle's rifle behind his back... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nBut as the Colonel arrives, mysteriously he doesn't even glance at the apes, instead staring off at the finished wall in the distance, lost in thought... He continues right past them... stopping 20 paces away, back to us... He just stands there, motionless, taking the sight in. \nCaesar watches the Colonel anxiously -- when -- the Colonel turns. He starts slowly back... heading to Caesar's cage. As he comes closer, we can see he is still in a fog. Caesar is surprised to see the FLASK grasped absently in his hand. \nA strange silent beat. And finally, the Colonel speaks -- his tone is oddly vacant: \nTHE COLONEL Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor. \nHe eerily studies Caesar's body... musing to himself: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) You apes are so strong... I wonder... what kind of world you would have built... on our graves. \nCaesar's eyes search the Colonel's, trying to make sense of his demeanor. The Colonel gazes off, as if lost in a dream: \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) You know when I first got to the city... a man said he had to see me. He said he knew you. That you worked together. \nCaesar looks surprised.    Beat.   Finally, warily: \nCAESAR ...Malcolm? \nCaesar's voice pulls the Colonel out of his reverie for a moment -- he looks at Caesar a bit confused; then, realizing: \nTHE COLONEL I think that was his name, yes. \nCAESAR He... was a friend. \nTHE COLONEL He said you were remarkable.   More than just an animal... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) THE COLONEL (CONT'D) you were a great leader. I thought he was crazy... But I almost see what he meant. (he drifts off again) He pleaded with me to find you. To make peace with you. \nCaesar is rapt, stunned by these revelations... But the Colonel is wholly unaware of Caesar's reaction, staring off in a long unnerving silence. Caesar hesitates, then: \nCAESAR What... happened to this man? \nThe Colonel remains staring off a moment longer, then finally looks at Caesar... and then off again: \nTHE COLONEL I shot him. \nHe remains still a moment longer -- then suddenly looks around, disoriented, as if awakened from a dream -- \nTHE COLONEL (CONT'D) (quietly paranoid) What's going on here? \nCaesar frowns at him, disquieted and perplexed... The Colonel's eyes dart suspiciously around him; he cranes his neck to peer up through the falling snow at the guard tower, but the angle is too steep to see if anyone is up there -- \nA CLANK at his feet makes him look down... where he finds he's dropped his flask. He picks it up, looks at it as if having no memory of even bringing it out here. \nSuddenly self-conscious, he looks around at the apes in their pen, all staring back at him -- and then at Caesar. He slowly backs away, then turns, retreating through the darkness to his tower. \nCaesar watches him go, then turns to find Rocket and the other apes looking at him, confused. \nROCKET [...What was that?] \nCaesar shakes his head, just as confused. Then returns to action, bending down to unshackle his other ankle -- he unlocks it -- then TOSSES PREACHER'S KEY TO -- \nROCKET, who reaches through the pen bars and catches them mid- air; he quickly unshackles himself, TOSSES THE KEY to -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \n", "test3_input": "EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) COLONEL! COLONEL!!! (turns to one of the men) OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR, SOLDIER! \nSOLDIER (O.S.) I CAN'T!     IT'S BLOCKED FROM INSIDE, SIR! \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) WHERE THE HELL IS HE?! \nSOLDIER (O.S.) I DON'T KNOW, SIR! WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE COLONEL ALL NIGHT! \nCaesar ducks back, quickly stares up at the tower overhead -- SPOTS the Colonel's OPEN WINDOW four stories above... He takes a last look around -- then LEAPS across from the barracks' roof to the side of the tower... \nEXT. YARD - PRE-DAWN \nMore Soldiers rush past -- when one SLOWS, looking RIGHT AT US in utter shock. It's Preacher: \nPREACHER Jesus Christ... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPAN with him as he steps right past the camera to REVEAL -- \nTHE EMPTY APE PENS; he SPINS BACK to us, SHOUTING: \nPREACHER (CONT'D) THE APES!!! THEY'RE GONE!!! \nINT. WARDEN'S TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - PRE-DAWN \nCaesar silently climbs in the window; he looks around... and immediately spots an unnerving, incongruous sight -- \nTHE FRONT DOOR is BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE from the inside. \nConfused, Caesar looks around, sees the area in total disarray: a SMALL STOCKPILE OF MUNITIONS lie scattered chaotically across a table, alongside a tray of HALF-EATEN FOOD and the Colonel's SPILLED FLASK... \nSoaked in liquid from the flask is a PHOTO OF A LITTLE BOY; beside it OLD WAR MEDALS; Caesar peers around, wary: where's the Colonel...? \nEXTREME WIDE SHOT - IN FRONT OF THE CAMP \nA SERIES OF INTENSELY BRIGHT RAPIER MISSILES rip into the sky from atop the barrier wall, SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, illuminating the landscape below -- \nTOP OF THE HOLE \nBad Ape shudders, watching the missiles -- as they EXPLODE into the path of the armada -- TWO OF THE FRONT VEHICLES ERUPT! \nPanicked, he frantically urges the children -- \nBAD APE Hurry!   Go go go! \nWhen A SUDDEN ROAR AND BLINDING FLASH makes him turn to see -- \nARTILLERY SHELLS SOARING in return from the giant vehicles -- \nBad Ape LUNGES protectively over nearby children -- when -- \nBOOOOMM!!!    The SHELLS MAKE IMPACT 30 feet from the wall! \nDEBRIS HAILS DOWN on our group as they hug the ground! \nSMASH TO: \nTHE TUNNELS BELOW -- CROWDED WITH ESCAPING APES \nThey stop, look around in fear as the space RUMBLES VIOLENTLY around them -- alarmed, ROCKET begins pushing his way through the crush to get to the other end, gripping his rifle -- \nROCKET [Let me through!] \nSMASH TO: \nCAESAR IN THE WARDEN'S TOWER \nHe whips his head at the sound of continued shelling -- panicked, he rushes to the window to see INCOMING MISSILES FROM THE ARMADA beginning to make IMPACT INSIDE THE YARD -- ! \nWhen a QUIET CRASH comes from somewhere close behind him. Caesar turns, startled, gaze fixing apprehensively on a PARTIALLY OPENED DOORWAY; he steels himself, and slowly approaches the door. \nHe hesitates, wary... then carefully peers around the door frame, glimpsing a BROKEN COLEMAN LAMP at the foot of a small table; kerosine still pools from the lamp's base. \nBeyond the door, Caesar suddenly hears labored breathing... He pushes it open to REVEAL... \nTHE COLONEL'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN/INTO DAWN \nThe Colonel is splayed on his stomach across a military cot -- head lowered, his outstretched hand trembles mid-air as he struggles in a total daze, like a drunk, grasping helplessly for something out of reach on the table... HIS PISTOL. \nHeart racing, Caesar crosses silently to the table... eyes glued to the Colonel, he places his hand firmly on the gun before the Colonel can get to it. \nCaesar lifts the gun slowly, then trains it down at the Colonel beneath him, who is so out of it he continues listlessly groping for a gun that isn't there. \nCaesar glares down at the Colonel, pitiless... his expression hardening as he prepares to finish him, once and for all -- \n-- when the Colonel slowly lifts his head to peer up at Caesar... and for the first time, Caesar sees there is BLOOD smeared on his face from under his nose. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe Colonel's eyes look desperate, like a wounded animal's; he opens his mouth pleadingly, trying to speak -- but the only sounds that come are eerie, GASPING GRUNTS... \nCaesar stares back in utter shock -- when he notices something on the floor near the bed... \n", "test3_true": "Reeling, Caesar unconsciously lowers the gun -- but as the Colonel reaches lamely for it, Caesar instantly remembers himself, raising the weapon threateningly again at his head -- \nBut the Colonel doesn't even flinch, the barrel just inches from his face. He begins quietly gasping once more; Caesar watches, unnerved, finger on the trigger, as the Colonel lifts himself, slowly leaning his head forward... \n...and pressing his own temple against the muzzle -- he looks up at Caesar, his tortured eyes pleading mutely for death. \nHOLD ON CAESAR \nas he stares down, haunted... his gaze shifting from the Colonel's agonized face... to the gun in his hand... \nFinally, horrified, he slowly LOWERS THE GUN. Self-awareness returns to his eyes -- a look of humanity we haven't fully seen since before the death of his family, as if the war within him is finally coming to an end. \nThe Colonel gapes helplessly... as Caesar, quietly stunned by his own decision, starts to back away... Caesar pauses, pitying eyes on the Colonel's; then finally, he gently sets the gun back down onto the table. \nA look of confused gratitude flickers through the Colonel's primitive gaze... and he resumes REACHING LAMELY for the gun. \nEyes still on him, Caesar backs slowly out -- \nINTO THE CONTROL ROOM \nWe see Caesar, his back to us, as he continues gazing into the Colonel's sleeping quarters... then, after a quiet, clumsy fumbling sound, a SINGLE GUNSHOT echoes from the room. \nCaesar remains still, then lowers his head as day breaks outside... \nCUT TO: \nUP ON THE BARRIER WALL - DAYLIGHT NOW \nThrough SWIRLING SNOW we see RED and other TURNCOATS arrive at one of the posts, laden with ammo for the troops who hurriedly load their weapons, preparing for the imminent firefight once the rapidly approaching armada arrives. As Red hands bullet belts to a GUNNER loading a big .50 cal machine gun -- \nSoldiers around them unleash another round of Rapier missiles -- WHOOOOSH -- two more MLRS vehicles EXPLODE on the horizon! \nSoldiers around the missile launcher react with raucous cheers to the direct hits, a sense that the battle's theirs to win -- \n-- when the GUNNER beside Red suddenly NOTICES THE APES scrambling by the rock out-cropping -- his jaw drops, in complete shock! \nGUNNER (screams to the others) LOOK!!! THE APES!!! \nRed spins with disbelief to see the apes below -- as the Gunner rotates his machine gun -- and OPENS FIRE!!! \nEXT. WARDEN'S TOWER - WINDOW - IMMEDIATELY \nWe see Caesar about to climb out -- when he SEES the apes taking heavy fire from gunners on the wall! He freezes, terror-stricken, grappling for a way to save them -- when his eyes lock on the TANKER CARS just beneath the wall -- \nHe quickly turns from the window, charging back into the control room -- when -- \nA SUDDEN BANGING comes from the front door -- \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) Colonel!   Are you in there?! Colonel! \nCaesar spins, startled -- then finishes grabbing a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES off the table strewn with the Colonel's belongings -- he bolts for the window -- when -- \nCRASH! The door SMASHES OPEN -- Caesar turns to see the X.O. AND HIS MEN ENTERING -- they see him too -- raising their weapons, and FIRING AS -- CAESAR LEAPS \nOUT THROUGH THE WINDOW!!! \nHE SWINGS DOWN FROM THE TOWER LEDGE -- and GRASPS onto the FLAGPOLE stretched across the open space beneath -- the pole breaks his fall, but only so much -- as ONE SIDE SNAPS FREE! \nCaesar hangs on, riding the swinging pole as it descends -- and finally releasing it, tumbling to the ground! \nCaesar scrambles to his feet, still clutching the grenades -- \n-- when the Officer and his men appear in the tower window! \nThey OPEN FIRE -- as Caesar sprints away -- bullets tearing up snow and ice right behind him as he goes -- ! \nCUT TO: \nROCKET - AT THE ROCK OUT-CROPPING \nDESPERATELY FIRING Boyle's automatic rifle, trying to provide cover for the FLEEING APES who are now PINNED BELOW IN CHAOS -- as BEHIND HIM ON THE ROCKS, Bad Ape and another HORDE OF APES are gathered helplessly around the hole, some apes still crawling out to discover there's now nowhere to go... \nUP ON THE BARRIER WALL \nThe Gunner ducks from Rocket's bullets, then jumps back up, returning a mad volley from his machine gun, SHOUTING over the din to the other soldiers firing beside him -- \nGUNNER Kill them, man!!!   Kill them all!!! \nREVEAL RED behind them, watching the apes under attack -- the SOUND FADES as he gazes, unexpectedly disturbed by the sight -- when A MUFFLED VOICE rises out of the silence -- \nGUNNER (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...Donkey -- DONKEY!!! \nRed SNAPS OUT OF IT, turning to the exasperated Gunner -- \nGUNNER (CONT'D) GET THE GRENADE LAUNCHER!!! \nFlustered, Red turns, moves to his rucksack, retrieving the launcher -- when he stops suddenly, SEEING -- \nCAESAR - IN AN EPIC WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP BELOW \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nQUADRUPEDING at great speed for the yard, as another incoming mortar hits the ground -- Caesar DARTS HARD around the front of the pen -- and fearlessly straight through the PLUMING DEBRIS and SWIRLING SNOW -- a heroic battlefield image! \n"}

Now!! \nThen he turns -- and LEAPS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WATERFALL! \nCaesar raises his head just in time to see -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTHE COLONEL, barely discernible through the rushing water, clutching the swinging rope -- as HE'S PULLED UPWARD! \nApes spill into the cave as Caesar, desperate with rage, jumps to his feet, charging after the Colonel -- the apes watch in shock as -- CAESAR LUNGES INTO THE FALLS TOO -- ! \nEXT. WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS \nCaesar crashes through the water, hands flailing for -- \nTHE ROPE! He grabs at it -- IT CAREENS WILDLY!      Caesar holds on tight, looks up to see -- \nTHE COLONEL high above -- clinging to the suddenly jerking line -- he looks down to see \nCAESAR starting to climb up furiously after him... \nThe Colonel, unfazed, seizes a KNIFE from his boot as -- \nCaesar closes in, climbing, about to reach him -- when -- \nTHE COLONEL CUTS THE LINE -- and -- \nCaesar PLUMMETS -- down, down, down -- INTO THE RIVER BELOW! \nAn excruciating beat -- then Caesar SPRINGS UP from the water, gasping, enraged -- he peers up in agony to SEE -- \nTHE COLONEL disappearing over the TOP OF THE CLIFF! \nINT. CAESAR'S FAMILY DWELLING - LATER \nCLOSE ON Cornelia and Blue Eyes, as their lifeless bodies are lifted from the rock floor... \nREVEAL CAESAR watching silently, lost in his own world; still wet, he remains completely motionless, consumed with rage, pain. Beside him, Rocket, Luca and Maurice watch, shaken, as the bodies are carried away. \nJust then Spear pushes through, reporting to Luca: \nSPEAR [Luca! We can't find Winter.   He wasn't at his post.] \nLuca and Maurice suddenly exchange a worried look -- \nMAURICE [He was scared. Could he have turned against us?] \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe looks to Rocket as well -- but Rocket's gaze is now fixed elsewhere. Maurice and the others all turn to see -- \nCAESAR has been following their conversation.     Finally, Luca signs, wracked with guilt: \nLUCA [Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us. I'm sorry. He was in my command.] \nCaesar remains silent; then: \nCAESAR My youngest son...   Have you found him yet? \nLUCA [We're still looking.] \nMaurice turns to the others: \nMAURICE [Let's help them search.] \nEveryone nods, following Maurice's lead as they shuffle out, giving Caesar some much-needed space... Finally -- \nCaesar is alone. \nHis eyes move to where he found Blue Eyes and Cornelia; there is blood on the floor. He steps closer, in a trance; sees -- \nTWO BRASS BULLET CASINGS on the ground. Caesar crouches, his expression intensifying as he reaches for the spent casings -- \n-- when he hears a NOISE behind him -- on a hair-trigger, Caesar seizes the spear, raising it furiously -- so gripped by animalistic rage that it takes a moment to realize -- it's his toddler son, peeking out from hiding in the rocks; Cornelius peers up in terror at his father, shrinking back. \nCaesar returns to his senses, lowers the spear... then, softening, he bends to the toddler and extends a hand... But Cornelius is still too frightened to approach, his eyes fixed on the spear in Caesar's grasp. \nAshamed, Caesar sets the spear on the ground, then holds both arms out to his son. \nCAESAR Cornelius... you're safe now, son. \n", "test1_true": "The child finally comes, reluctantly...

RIVERBANK AT THE BASE OF THE WATERFALL - DAY \nThe entire ape community is here, urgently loading up their horses, preparing for the imminent exodus. HEADS TURN as --- \nCAESAR makes his way through the crowd; clutching a rifle in one hand and holding his little son's hand in the other, gaze fixed ahead as he crosses to -- \nLAKE, who stands by her horse, surrounded by Maurice, Luca, and Rocket on theirs. Caesar looks at Lake. He seems stoic, but his eyes belie heartbreak, and something deeper... tremendous rage: \nCAESAR You loved my son.    Look after his brother until I return. \nLAKE (stunned) [You're not coming with us?] \nCAESAR No. \nCaesar crouches down to Cornelius, caresses his little son one last time, then guides him to Lake. \nANGLE ON Rocket and Luca; they exchange a look, shocked. \nMaurice looms behind them on horseback, watching it all too: \nMAURICE [Caesar!    You're not going after them?!] \nCAESAR Not them... Him. \nMAURICE [Caesar, you are our leader!   We can't leave without you!] \nCAESAR You must.    The soldiers will be back soon. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCaesar looks for one last time at his son -- Cornelius cries out as Lake tries to comfort him -- \nCORNELIUS [Father!] \nBut Caesar remains unrelenting, already completely consumed by his dark, vengeful quest as he starts to head off: \nCAESAR (to the apes around him) When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me. That may give you the best chance to get out of the woods. Until then, be safe. \nAnd with that he moves straight for his horse. As the reality that their leader is leaving them sets in, the ape community begins to react in anxious protest -- shockwaves of HOOTS rise as Caesar mounts his horse. \nON MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA watching Caesar amidst the growing turmoil -- they stare after him in total disbelief... \nEXT. WIDE SHOT ON THE APE EXODUS - WOODS - DAY \nA seemingly endless line of ape refugees. Spear leads the procession; armed apes in warpaint guard the group, parents protectively clutching their children, others help the injured along -- as they set off uncertainly for the perilous journey ahead... \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nCaesar rides alone, rifle in hand, the sound of the ape exodus now barely audible in the distance. Suddenly, he hears RUSTLING behind him. He turns, stops, alert. As the sound gets closer, we recognize the CLOP OF HOOVES -- then -- \nMAURICE, ROCKET, and LUCA appear, riding out of the trees. They come to a halt, eyes on Caesar. Caesar returns a hard look, shakes his head. But Luca is undeterred: \nLUCA [The soldiers' camp is always moving. My guards think they know where it is. Let me take you.] \nROCKET [You'll need me to back you up.] \nRocket reveals a rifle in his hand.    But Caesar remains firm: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCAESAR No. \nROCKET [Please... I know what it's like... to lose a son.] \nThat strikes a chord; Caesar looks at him, affected... \nCAESAR I might not make it back. \nMAURICE [That's why I'm coming.   To make sure you do.] \nCaesar looks at his three friends, moved, torn... \nCUT TO: \nA MOVING SHOT - CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA \nRiding silently through woods, close together. A posse. HOLD on this iconic image of the foursome; then CUT TO -- \nEXT. LOWER WOODS - SEASIDE CLIFF - LATER \nThe posse making their descent, when they see -- \nSMOKE rising from an old shack across the way. \nThey look at each other, slowing... \nLUCA [This is where the guards thought they might be.

His breath steams quietly around him. He FREEZES as A FLASHLIGHT drops into the snow by his boots -- \nBut the Girl remains focused on her doll, unaware. \nThe Figure resumes rummaging, finally pausing as we BRIEFLY GLIMPSE the BARREL OF A SHOTGUN he has just found -- \nUP IN THE TREE TOPS \nA NERVOUS SNORT comes from one of the horses below -- the apes turn to see the TINY FIGURE IN THE BULKY PARKA FAR BELOW digging in the saddle bag; Luca lets out a TERRIFYING ROAR -- \nThe Girl finally looks up, startled, as -- \n-- the Figure panics, JUMPING ON THE HORSE, AND TAKING OFF! \nCaesar and his posse scramble down from the trees -- mount their horses -- \nSMASH TO: \nTHE POSSE GIVING CHASE THROUGH THE SNOWY WOODS \nGALLOPING THROUGH THE TREACHEROUS OBSTACLE COURSE OF TREES -- \nThe TINY FIGURE in the parka darts in and out of view    -- \nThe apes are starting to gain on him, when he BREAKS OUT of the woods and up onto -- \nA MASSIVE SNOW-COVERED SLOPE \nWe watch from HIGH ABOVE as his horse CHARGES THE INCLINE, KICKING POWDER INTO THE AIR -- the apes' horses burst out of the woods after him -- all of them just tiny dots climbing the stark white landscape... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nFrom this vantage we can now see the TOPPLED CABLES and DILAPIDATED GONDOLAS that tell us this was once A SKI AREA -- \nThe apes again begin to close the gap -- \nCLOSE ON CAESAR CHARGING HARD, EYES FIXED ON -- \nTHE DIM FIGURE up ahead of him -- when suddenly -- BLAM! -- a FLASH OF GUNFIRE ERUPTS from atop the Figure's horse -- \nCAESAR and the OTHERS DUCK as -- CHING! -- the BLAST RICOCHETS off a half-buried GONDOLA CAR far wide of them! \nBLAM! BLAM! TWO MORE SHOTS ring out, wildly astray, kicking up snow clouds nowhere near them or their horses -- \n-- as the Figure disappears over the crest of the slope. \nEXT. TOP OF THE SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe apes arrive, slowing their horses as they come upon -- \nAN ENORMOUS, ABANDONED VICTORIAN HOTEL, built into the mountainside. An old sign reads: The Inn at Deer Creek. \nThe stolen horse wanders rider-less on the snowy front lawn. \nThe apes cautiously dismount, drawing their weapons... As they approach, a SHADOW SUDDENLY BOLTS from behind one of the buildings, dashing into the main lodge -- \nThe apes all exchange looks; then raise their guns as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE INN AT DEER CREEK - MAIN LOBBY ENTRANCE - DUSK \nAn ornate glass door   slowly opens... Caesar, Rocket, and Luca enter, guns first...    As they pass us, the door swings shut behind them...

Snow swirls in the air, drifting down through a hole in the roof. \nCaesar lifts a hand to stop the others as he spots -- BOOT PRINTS in the frost on the floor. The apes' eyes follow them across the lobby's expanse... to where they disappear into the black opening of AN ENORMOUS HEARTH along the wall. \nThe apes cautiously close in, guns trained on the hearth, deep and dark enough to conceal whoever's hiding inside... \nCaesar stops at the opening; he COCKS his gun LOUDLY, levelling it -- Rocket and Luca COCK their weapons too... \n... when suddenly, the STOLEN SHOTGUN is tossed out at them, landing at the apes' feet with a thud. They stare down at it uneasily -- when to their surprise the STOLEN BINOCULARS come skittering out too. And then the COMPASS. \n", "test2_true": "THE FIGURE slowly begins to emerge from the darkness, head hung remorsefully, still obscured in the hood of the worn-out parka... He starts to raise his hands in surrender, and as his head lifts... we discover -- \nHE IS AN APE. \nA chimp with more skin than hair on his small, rounded head, he has oversized ears and a little scruff of beard, his scrawny frame swimming in the big green parka. \nHe stares up at our shocked trio with a sheepish, apologetic smile... and finally, he SPEAKS ALOUD in halting grunts, pointing a finger at his own chest -- \nSCRAWNY CHIMP (chastising himself) Bad... ape... Bad ape... \nOur three apes just gape back, no idea what to make of him... Rocket lowers his gun. Then signs: \nROCKET [Who are you?] \nBut Bad Ape just tilts his head, not comprehending. Our apes exchange uncertain looks. Then Luca turns to Bad Ape, leery: \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nLUCA [Where are you from?] \nNo answer.    Luca turns to Caesar. \nLUCA (CONT'D) [I don't think he understands.] \nROCKET (to Caesar) [I don't recognize him.   He's not one of us.] \nCaesar regards the odd little chimp a moment; then SPEAKS: \nCAESAR Are you... alone here? \nBad Ape's eyes dart uneasily from face to face -- it's not clear if he understands this either -- but then he looks back at Caesar... and NODS. \nA soft CREAKING across the lobby causes their heads to turn -- \nMAURICE AND THE GIRL \nstand just inside the entrance, peering back uncertainly at them across the giant space. \nBad Ape notices the Girl, SHIVERING BADLY beside Maurice. Bad Ape considers her a moment, then lowers his hands -- \nRocket lifts his weapon again, wary -- but Bad Ape just continues, removing his parka; finally he holds it out in one hand -- calls out to the Girl -- \nBAD APE Cold...? \nNo one says anything. Bad Ape turns to Caesar. Holds out the parka, gesturing to the Girl with a tentative smile: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Cold. \nCaesar stares hesitantly at Bad Ape and the ratty jacket. Finally, he reaches out, accepts it from Bad Ape's fingers. \nCUT TO: \nAROUND THE HEARTH - A SHORT TIME LATER \nas Bad Ape starts A FIRE. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWarming herself by the flames, the Girl -- now in Bad Ape's parka -- sits with Caesar and the others, looking around in wonder at SPRAWLING PILES OF BAD APE'S SCAVENGED TREASURES beside the hearth, a hoarder's paradise of dry goods, canned food, and an endless array of STOLEN ITEMS and TRINKETS. \nBad Ape beams as he stokes the flames for his new guests: \nBAD APE I see girl. Think... you human.   But you... apes. Like me! \nHe smiles excitedly -- when he sees the Girl picking up a trinket from a pile: a glinting CHEVY NOVA CAR EMBLEM. He gently snatches it from her, kindly shakes his head no. \nCAESAR (peering around) You... live here? \nBAD APE (nodding quickly) Long time. Long, long time. \nHe suddenly scurries away; puzzled, Caesar watches him as he rummages through what looks like a little sleeping area. He returns with a small STUFFED CROCODILE, hands it to Caesar -- \nBAD APE (CONT'D) (a wistful look) Home. Old home. \nConfused, Caesar looks down at the stuffed crocodile, finds embroidered on its belly: WORLD FAMOUS SIERRA ZOO. \nCaesar peers up at him, trying to make sense of this... then: \nCAESAR Are there more like you?   More apes? From zoo? \nBAD APE (shakes head) Dead. All dead. Long time. \nHe looks at Caesar, growing solemn as he explains: \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Humans get sick... Apes get smart... \nCaesar nods, understanding he means the Simian Flu -- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nBAD APE (CONT'D) Then humans kill apes. But not me... (grins, proud) Not me. I run. \nCAESAR You learn to speak...? \n", "test2_id": 346, "test3_input": "EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) COLONEL! COLONEL!!! (turns to one of the men) OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR, SOLDIER! \nSOLDIER (O.S.)

He takes a last look around -- then LEAPS across from the barracks' roof to the side of the tower... \nEXT. YARD - PRE-DAWN \nMore Soldiers rush past -- when one SLOWS, looking RIGHT AT US in utter shock. It's Preacher: \nPREACHER Jesus Christ... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPAN with him as he steps right past the camera to REVEAL -- \nTHE EMPTY APE PENS; he SPINS BACK to us, SHOUTING: \nPREACHER (CONT'D) THE APES!!! THEY'RE GONE!!! \nINT. WARDEN'S TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - PRE-DAWN \nCaesar silently climbs in the window; he looks around... and immediately spots an unnerving, incongruous sight -- \nTHE FRONT DOOR is BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE from the inside. \nConfused, Caesar looks around, sees the area in total disarray: a SMALL STOCKPILE OF MUNITIONS lie scattered chaotically across a table, alongside a tray of HALF-EATEN FOOD and the Colonel's SPILLED FLASK... \nSoaked in liquid from the flask is a PHOTO OF A LITTLE BOY; beside it OLD WAR MEDALS; Caesar peers around, wary: where's the Colonel...? \nEXTREME WIDE SHOT - IN FRONT OF THE CAMP \nA SERIES OF INTENSELY BRIGHT RAPIER MISSILES rip into the sky from atop the barrier wall, SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING, illuminating the landscape below -- \nTOP OF THE HOLE \nBad Ape shudders, watching the missiles -- as they EXPLODE into the path of the armada -- TWO OF THE FRONT VEHICLES ERUPT! \nPanicked, he frantically urges the children -- \nBAD APE Hurry!   Go go go! \nWhen A SUDDEN ROAR AND BLINDING FLASH makes him turn to see -- \nARTILLERY SHELLS SOARING in return from the giant vehicles -- \nBad Ape LUNGES protectively over nearby children -- when -- \nBOOOOMM!!!    The SHELLS MAKE IMPACT 30 feet from the wall! \nDEBRIS HAILS DOWN on our group as they hug the ground! \nSMASH TO: \nTHE TUNNELS BELOW -- CROWDED WITH ESCAPING APES \nThey stop, look around in fear as the space RUMBLES VIOLENTLY around them -- alarmed, ROCKET begins pushing his way through the crush to get to the other end, gripping his rifle -- \nROCKET [Let me through!] \nSMASH TO: \nCAESAR IN THE WARDEN'S TOWER \nHe whips his head at the sound of continued shelling -- panicked, he rushes to the window to see INCOMING MISSILES FROM THE ARMADA beginning to make IMPACT INSIDE THE YARD -- ! \nWhen a QUIET CRASH comes from somewhere close behind him. Caesar turns, startled, gaze fixing apprehensively on a PARTIALLY OPENED DOORWAY; he steels himself, and slowly approaches the door. \nHe hesitates, wary... then carefully peers around the door frame, glimpsing a BROKEN COLEMAN LAMP at the foot of a small table; kerosine still pools from the lamp's base. \nBeyond the door, Caesar suddenly hears labored breathing... He pushes it open to REVEAL... \nTHE COLONEL'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN/INTO DAWN \nThe Colonel is splayed on his stomach across a military cot -- head lowered, his outstretched hand trembles mid-air as he struggles in a total daze, like a drunk, grasping helplessly for something out of reach on the table... HIS PISTOL. \nHeart racing, Caesar crosses silently to the table... eyes glued to the Colonel, he places his hand firmly on the gun before the Colonel can get to it. \nCaesar lifts the gun slowly, then trains it down at the Colonel beneath him, who is so out of it he continues listlessly groping for a gun that isn't there. \nCaesar glares down at the Colonel, pitiless... his expression hardening as he prepares to finish him, once and for all -- \n-- when the Colonel slowly lifts his head to peer up at Caesar... and for the first time, Caesar sees there is BLOOD smeared on his face from under his nose. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe Colonel's eyes look desperate, like a wounded animal's; he opens his mouth pleadingly, trying to speak -- but the only sounds that come are eerie, GASPING GRUNTS... \nCaesar stares back in utter shock -- when he notices something on the floor near the bed... \n", "test3_true": "Reeling, Caesar unconsciously lowers the gun -- but as the Colonel reaches lamely for it, Caesar instantly remembers himself, raising the weapon threateningly again at his head -- \nBut the Colonel doesn't even flinch, the barrel just inches from his face. He begins quietly gasping once more; Caesar watches, unnerved, finger on the trigger, as the Colonel lifts himself, slowly leaning his head forward... \n...and pressing his own temple against the muzzle -- he looks up at Caesar, his tortured eyes pleading mutely for death. \nHOLD ON CAESAR \nas he stares down, haunted... his gaze shifting from the Colonel's agonized face... to the gun in his hand... \nFinally, horrified, he slowly LOWERS THE GUN. Self-awareness returns to his eyes -- a look of humanity we haven't fully seen since before the death of his family, as if the war within him is finally coming to an end. \nThe Colonel gapes helplessly... as Caesar, quietly stunned by his own decision, starts to back away... Caesar pauses, pitying eyes on the Colonel's; then finally, he gently sets the gun back down onto the table. \nA look of confused gratitude flickers through the Colonel's primitive gaze... and he resumes REACHING LAMELY for the gun. \nEyes still on him, Caesar backs slowly out -- \nINTO THE CONTROL ROOM \nWe see Caesar, his back to us, as he continues gazing into the Colonel's sleeping quarters... then, after a quiet, clumsy fumbling sound, a SINGLE GUNSHOT echoes from the room. \nCaesar remains still, then lowers his head as day breaks outside... \nCUT TO: \nUP ON THE BARRIER WALL - DAYLIGHT NOW \nThrough SWIRLING SNOW we see RED and other TURNCOATS arrive at one of the posts, laden with ammo for the troops who hurriedly load their weapons, preparing for the imminent firefight once the rapidly approaching armada arrives. As Red hands bullet belts to a GUNNER loading a big .50 cal machine gun -- \nSoldiers around them unleash another round of Rapier missiles -- WHOOOOSH -- two more MLRS vehicles EXPLODE on the horizon! \nSoldiers around the missile launcher react with raucous cheers to the direct hits, a sense that the battle's theirs to win -- \n-- when the GUNNER beside Red suddenly NOTICES THE APES scrambling by the rock out-cropping -- his jaw drops, in complete shock! \nGUNNER (screams to the others) LOOK!!!

He freezes, terror-stricken, grappling for a way to save them -- when his eyes lock on the TANKER CARS just beneath the wall -- \nHe quickly turns from the window, charging back into the control room -- when -- \nA SUDDEN BANGING comes from the front door -- \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) Colonel!   Are you in there?!

Kill them all!!! \nREVEAL RED behind them, watching the apes under attack -- the SOUND FADES as he gazes, unexpectedly disturbed by the sight -- when A MUFFLED VOICE rises out of the silence -- \nGUNNER (O.S.)

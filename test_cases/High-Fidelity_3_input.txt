MARIE Thank you. 
Rob glances at T-Bone, his mind calculating the new info. 
ROB Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff? 
MARIE Yup. 
Marie slides closer, turning her back on the others.  The loop is closed. 
ROB You share a place with T-Bone? 
MARIE No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that. 
ROB I understand completely. 
SERIES OF CUTS - ELAPSED TIME 
Rob and Marie lean in to each other, everyone else out of focus. 
ROB (V.O.) Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... 
ROB AND MARIE - LATER 
MARIE Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd -- 
ROB What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me. 
MARIE Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks. 
Rob glows -- 
ROB (V.O.) Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life. 
ROB AND MARIE 
ROB Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it? 
MARIE The Conformist. 
ROB Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly! 
MARIE (laughs) You haven't even seen it! 
ROB Nor have you! 
They just laugh and laugh -- 
ROB (V.O.) References, titles, lyrics, flew and met each other in mid-air embraces. The evening goes with breathtaking precision. 
INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Rob and Marie are kissing standing up. 
MARIE Are you okay? 
ROB (nodding) Yes.  You? 
MARIE For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening. 
ROB I'm sure it isn't. 
MARIE Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee? 
ROB Whiskey. 
Marie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around the corner. 
MARIE Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket. 
ROB I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'. 
MARIE When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff. 
She plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table. 
MARIE I'd like it if you could stay the night. 
ROB (as if it is dawning on him) Oh, right.  Alright. 
MARIE Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz. 
ROB I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.

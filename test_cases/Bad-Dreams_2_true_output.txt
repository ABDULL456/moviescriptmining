195   FALLING                                                            195 It is a dizzying spiral. We hear the WIND RUSHING up as we go FASTER AND FASTER down. We SLAM into the ground. 
CYNTHIA'S HEAD hits rock. 
196   ON HER FACE                                                        196 She is still. Blood drips out her nose and mouth. She is dead. We HOLD ON HER until gradually bright light pours in over her. The CAMERA LIFTS UP revealing 
197   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                             197 Cynthia rises and walks towards the house through a field in the foreground. 
She walks up the porch. 
198   INT. UNITY HOUSE ENTRANCE - DAY                                    198 She opens the door. Everything is clean and fresh.      Flowers. Light. Birds CHIRPING. 
Harris is at the far and of the hall. There is an intense white light behind him. He is smiling beatifically. Cynthia goes towards him. As she nears him, she reaches out her hands. He does too. They clasp. 
ALAN'S VOICE Cynthia! 
Suddenly she FALLS. 
She drops and dangles in the night air against 
199   EXT. HOSPITAL BUILDING - NIGHT                                     199 She is unconscious.     She swings twelve stories above the pavement. 
The CAMERA FOLLOWS UP her arm to her hand grasped tightly by Alan's hand. We CONTINUE UP TO Alan. 
ALAN Cynthia! Open your eyes!   Open your eyes! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He is over the railing holding on with his other hand. 
Cynthia is coming to. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Pull up! Pull yourself up so I can got a grip on you! 
CYNTHIA Let me go. 
ALAN No! 
CYNTHIA Let me go.     I saw it.   It's beautiful. 
ALAN You didn't see shit!       Hold on! 
BERRISFORD Eternal bliss. 
CYNTHIA Yes!   I want to go!    Let me go! 
BERRISFORD (coming forward) Let her go. She needs it. 
ALAN No! Cynthia, Harris doesn't exist! He's dead! Look at who that is! Look at him! Look! 
Cynthia looks at Berrisford deliriously. 
He CHANGES from Berrisford to Harris with each FLASH.    He comes to the railing where Alan is holding on. 
Almost politely, he tries to undo Alan's grip. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Goddamn you! Goddamn you! 
Alan's grip on Cynthia slips down to her fingers. 
BERRISFORD Let her go. Let her go and I'll forget your disobedience. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2)       BERRISFORD(CONT'D) You can stay one with me in the psychosis and cult behavior study. We'll publish our findings together-- 
ALAN Publish this, asshole! 
Alan SWINGS one leg up, KICKS Berrisford in the groin. Berrisford HOWLS and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks. Snarling like an animal, he stomps, claws and even bites at Alan's hand. 
ALAN (CONT'D) (to Cynthia) Don't you hear him? He's trying to bribe me--but I'm not letting go! I'll go with you, but I'm not letting go! 
Berrisford sees the discarded gun... picks it up. He aims unsteadily... SHOOTS. Alan yanks himself out of the way. Berrisford misses. Berrisford moves closer. Raises the g= barrel at point black range towards Alan's hand. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Cynthia, help us! Help us both! 
BERRISFORD You'll be with them, Dr. Goldman, Be happy.

{"train": "CELLULAR by Larry Cohen \nRevised by Chris Morgan \nCurrent Revisions by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress \nJuly 16, 2003 \nTITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND. We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood. HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet. CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical placard that reads, \"The Martins\" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE KEYHOLE into the foyer. \nINT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her side. \nWOMAN (into phone) Yes Donna, I'm out the door. We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the kitchen, unable to see her face. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Just inform Kayleigh that anesthesia is on the way to prep the epidural and I'll be there as soon as I can. Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she talks. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) And promise her she's about to have a woooonnderful labor. As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket. They give each other a silent wave. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Right, I'll see you in twenty. She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but ready for the day ahead. \nJESSICA Buenas dias, Rosario. \nROSARIO Good morning Miss Jessica. Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY. In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry. \nMALE VOICE (on machine) Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the- And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips-- SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts, noise and confusion. Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark. Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM -- \nLEAD GUNMAN Get away from there! Don't touch that -- !! -- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on Jessica. \nLEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D) (dire) Where is he? Jessica cringes. \nJESSICA Where is who? \nLEAD GUNMAN Wrong answer. The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the face, knocking Jessica cold. Then he turns to his men. \nLEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D) Search the house. And as the answering machine fills the silence: \nCRAIG VO (on machine) -I'll call back later. The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness of his masked face. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us. We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing. As the van stops-- \nWE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS: \nINT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see-- \nTHE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid. Imposing. \nJESSICA Wh... what do you want? Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room. Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT. Grim as death, he stalks toward her -- \nJESSICA (CONT'D) No, wait.. And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS -- \nJESSICA (CONT'D) \nNO!   PLEASE--// SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that hung there. As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking Jessica in the darkness. Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to show through. Trembling, tears running down her face, Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic-- \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Wha... what the hell is happening?! The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE OCEAN Skimming along the water. And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA \nPIER. \nEXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are preparing for a \"HEAL THE BAY\" rally at the end of the pier. VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead. BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design. HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand. FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite. \nCHLOE Chloe. The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and they both smile at each other. Chad splits. \nCHLOE (CONT'D) I can't tell if you're full of it. Ryan stops posturing, gets real. \nRYAN You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used to take me there all \nRYAN (CONT'D) the time. Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes. He's managed to win her back. \nCHLOE Maybe you and I can take a break later when Pat Benatar goes on. \nRYAN Sounds like a plan. There's a moment...     Then -- \nCHLOE Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to pick up a box of T-shirts at the Kinkos on Venice. \nRYAN I'll do it for you... if you want. \nCHLOE Seriously, you would? \nRYAN Sure.     How much is the bill? \nCHLOE Nothing.    It's been paid up front. \nRYAN Do you promise not to go anywhere? \nCHLOE Done. Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back. \nRYAN Okay, I won't be long. \nCHLOE (laughing) Bye. Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot: \nRYAN Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VENICE - DAY A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice neighborhood. \nRyan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn across the backseat, and a box of \"Heal the Bay\" T-SHIRTS now sits on the shotgun seat. Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush. He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing. Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa, and grabs the cellphone. \nRYAN (into phone) Dex, wassup? You won't believe the hotties I just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don't get too excited 'cause I need my money. Ryan stops at a red light. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Bullshit, you're not going anywhere, (quickly adding) I'm pulling up right now. Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening. Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily. \nRYAN (CONT'D) (covering his ear) What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your shower, I'm talkin' code red stankage- The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan drives under an OVERPASS. Suddenly -- The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED \nWITH STATIC. \nRYAN (CONT'D) (into phone) Dex? You still there...? And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Damn. \nEXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10 As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass-- \nID                                                                   iu \nSFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS. Ryan picks up the phone. \nRYAN Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's my Caller ID say? But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Yo Dex...? \nMATCH CUT TO: \n11   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          11 \nECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES 12   Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12 the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone, foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS, tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear: \nINTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC                    19 \nJESSICA (VO) --an you hear me?! \nRYAN You still there? You're getting kinda creepy, lady. See ya. \nJESSICA No!    Don't! They're going to kill me!    They're going to kill me!! A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes... RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold. On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY. \nRYAN Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with the fake tears, lady... \nJESSICA Please...   I just need help. But Ryan won't be manipulated. \nRYAN You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds and bug someone else. \nJESSICA These men!!!-- Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at the attic door, then continues, more in control. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) These men killed my housekeeper. My dog. You have to help me. Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this. \nRYAN No, actually( I don't. Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier. \nJESSICA Please...you're my only hope. (beat) What's your name? That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make this personal. \nRYAN Why, you writing a book--? \n19                                                                  x? \nJESSICA --Please, just tell me your name! Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone fountain outside a French Restaurant. \nRYAN Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain. \nJESSICA Johnny... What if it was your mother who was calling for help? How would you feel? \nRYAN Well, I'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead. \nJESSICA Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police?! I'll pay you! \nRYAN How much? \nJESSICA Five thousand dollars. \nRYAN Sure you will. I'm hanging up now. \nJESSICA No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's a eighty percent chance I'm lying, you nave a one in five chance to make five grand f9r a lousy twenty minutes of your life. (panics as Ryan is silent) Haven't you ever bet on a horse or bought a Lottery ticket? I'm talking one-in-five odds, twenty minutes. Ryan slaps the radio off. \nRYAN What do you want me to do? \nCUT TO: \n20   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - STATION DESK - DAY                        20 \nSOMEONE'S POV. In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a nightmare -- OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on \nan OFFICER'S FACE and there's a lethal race for disinfectant through invisible soup. Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.      A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE lets us know we're in hell. CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked. MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall, legal but hard. SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR? CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the \nLEFT WRIST. MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly -- WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed into the station desk by a ROOKIE. \nROOKIE OFFICER Problem, Mooney. If I put this one in with the others, there's gonna be a bloodbath. \nGANGBANGER Put me in there! I'll waste all them pussies! REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA. \nMOONEY Come on Powell, put the Sharks with the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets and make room. Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the Gangbanger back over to the holding cells. Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner. \n21   ON THE TELEVISION                                                 21 a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him, FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court; being led away in handcuffs. \nNEWS REPORTER ...was somber when the indictments came down this afternoon in the 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Though the names of six police officers were read aloud, the District Attorney stated that this was merely the \"tip of the iceberg\" and that unfortunately many other arrests are likely to be coming as the investigations proceed. \nRyan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge on the Station Desk. \n27   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          27 Jessica hears the phone being shuffled around. \nRYAN (VO) Where? \nJESSICA Hello?    Officer? Hello?! \n28   BACK TO POLICE STATION                                          28 Mooney, recognizing an emergency when he hears one, ignores the incoming CROWD him long enough to assist Ryan. \nMOONEY Up the stairs, Tomlin! Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear, he's startled to hear-- \nJESSICA (VO) (terrified) Oh my God... \nRYAN What? What is it? \nCUT TO: \n29   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          29 Jessica hears: \nSFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR. \nRYAN (VO) Lady, what's going on?! Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her, they stand silently, trying to unnerve her. \nLEAD KIDNAPPER Where's your husband? \nJESSICA What?     I don't- The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her. The Leader bends down and yells right in her face. \nLEAD KIDNAPPER Where is he!? \nJESSICA At work!     Why, what do you want--? SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first. \nLEAD KIDNAPPER \nNEGATIVE!    WHERE WOULD HE RUN?! \nMATCH CUT TO: \n30    RYAN - IN THE POLICE STATION STAIRWELL                               30 Phone to his ear. Wide-eyed. Hearing it all.         For the first time, starting to believe Jessica's story. \nRYAN Oh shit... Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs for the station stairwell. \nCUT BACK TO: \n31   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                               31 -v The Lead Kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling Jessica -- Oh God! Does he see the phone cord? \nJESSICA Please, he should be at work! That's all I know. The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is short-lived as: \nLEAD KIDNAPPER You have a little boy, right? Ricky? The Wyman School in Westwood? Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest. \nJESSICA \nNO! NO--.'.' STAY AWAY FROM MY SON! \nLEAVE HIM ALONE!! But -- the men silently head out the door -- SLAM!       The door locks. Jessica scrambles back to the phone. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Johnny!! \n32    INTERCUT CALL - RYAN RUNNING UP STAIRWELL/JESSICA IN ATTIC           32 \nRYAN I know.    I'm trying to get help. \nJESSICA My son -- Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts breaking up the call. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) (worried) Oh my God! What's happening?! \nRYAN I just got off the 405. \nJESSICA (VO) You've got to go faster, Johnny! \nRYAN You've gotta chill! You're stressing the crap out of me! (looking around) Where the hell is a cop hiding in a speed trap when you need one? Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against his better judgment. \nRYAN (CONT'D) What do these guys want, anyway? \nJESSICA (VO) How should I know?! \nRYAN What do you do? \nJESSICA I'm an obstetrician. They don't want anything from me. \nRyan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver. \nRYAN So your husband's like, uber-rich? \nJESSICA (VO) What--? No. He's an accountant. I make more money than he does. \nRYAN Could they've mistaken you for someone else? \nJESSICA No! I don't know.    None of this makes any sense. Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! -- \n37   EXT. ROAD CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS                                37 The BRONCO EXPLODES through an orange-and-white \"ROAD CLOSED\" \nCONSTRUCTION BARRIER! And dead ahead is a CONSTRUCTION CREW resurfacing the road! \nRYAN Oh...SHIT!! Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR against another BARRIER -- Ryan cringes with every muscle! And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend! \nRYAN (CONT'D) (smirking) ...Ain't that a bitch. As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away, CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER. More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and -- \nRYAN (CONT'D) There's the school. Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see: \n38   EXT. THE WYMAN SCHOOL - DAY                                        38 \nprivate prep school for boys. Ryan pull: A private prep it. Walks quickly toward the building.    school for boys. Ryan pulls over and hops out, \nRYAN Okay, I'm here. \nJESSICA (VO) How much time do we have? Ryan checks his watch.     It reads:   \"1:40 PM\".   He enters. \nRYAN Five minutes. What's your kid's name? \nJESSICA (VO) Ricky. \nRYAN Ricky what? \nJESSICA Martin. \nRYAN Ricky Martin? You named your kid Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you tattoo \"kick me\" on his ass while you were at it? \nJESSICA He was named before the singer ever- \nRYAN Forget it.     What does he look like? \nJESSICA (VO) He's eight years old. Blonde hair. Green eyes. Small for his age. He's wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants-- \nRYAN They're all wearing blue shirts and pants! Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS. As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him and wheels him around. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Ricky Martin? The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away. \nTIMID BOY Don't touch me! \nRYAN No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean to-- \nRYAN Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid-- (stops, realizing) Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it? \nJESSICA (VO) No! \nRYAN Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me. \nJESSICA (VO) No-- \nThis is great, the police think I'm a whack job. The school thinks I'm some kind of perv child molester. I'll probably get the Herpes from the gym teacher's whistle -- \nJESSICA (VO) No, Johnny, you have to listen to me-- /.' But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave -- \nRYAN I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance -- -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT- YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides \"screw it\", and keeps on hoofing. Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD. \nGYM TEACHER Here he is! He's the one that's been stalking the students. \nRYAN Stalking?!     No, I can explain-- The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie. \nRENT-A-COP #1 Okay, we got him. We're at the front of the school. (then, to Ryan) Sir, come with us. \nRYAN (as they grab him) Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding-- A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close-- \nJESSICA (VO) (interrupting) Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week! Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades. \nRYAN (struggling) \nRICKY MARTIN!! The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes-- \n[CONTINUED) \n--and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off. WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Oh shit!    You just see that?! Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner in the car. \nRENT-A-COP #1 Roy, some help over here! Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway. \nRYAN (struggling harder) Goddamn it, that little kid was just kidnapped!! Do something!! \nRENT-A-COP #1 Roy--! ! The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free! \nRENT-A-COPS \nHEY--! ! They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's seat. Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws the little car in gear and burns away. \n39       INT. RENT-A-COP CAR - RACING DOWN A RESIDENTIAL STREET           39 Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood. \nJESSICA (VO) What's happening, Ryan?! \nRYAN Don't worry, I can fix this. \nJESSICA (VO) Oh my God. There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade. \nRYAN It's okay, I can see them ahead. \nJESSICA (VO) Don't lose them! If you follow them back here, you can tell the police where they're holding us! \nRYAN Okay. \nCUT TO: \n40    INT. THE KIDNAPPERS' ESCALADE                                       40 The mountainous Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO. Ellis, turns down the radio.       Faking sincerity, he turns to face Ricky. \nELLIS (gesturing to the radio) Do you want me to change the station to something else? Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile quickly vanishing. \nELLIS (CONT'D) Yeah.   I like Creedence too. He's about to turn the radio volume up when -- \nJESSICA (VO) What?!    Yo u lost-- \nRYAN No, No!    just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine CLATTERING, to the intersection. Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade is nowhere to be seen. He floors it. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Jesus!    Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the receiver. \nRYAN (CONT'D) Jessica, I-- \nJESSICA (VO) You let them get away. Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of him. He knows she's right. \nDISSOLVE TO: j    INT. 15TH PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                           45 Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS in the corner, boasting about an arrest. \nCOP ONE -- so of course everyone's playing dumb to what kind of drugs he's on. The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before. \nCOP ONE (CONT'D) So I start searching the place. I'm about to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the 405. Mooney tries to join in on the conversation. \nMOONEY It must've been around '84, when... The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff. \nCOP TWO Sorry Moon, we're late for a briefing. Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being able to join in. \nDEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.) I'll bet in your day you had some stories. Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN. \nMOONEY Hey Tomlin. \nDETECTIVE TOMLIN Taking off? \nMOONEY (hardly thrilled) My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. (beat) Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping -- \nDETECTIVE TOMLIN I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask around. Kidnapping, huh? \nMOONEY I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up-- \nDETECTIVE TOMLIN Well, don't you get worked up.

Once he's inside and out of view, Jessica collapses in a heap on the floor. Greer is about to exit the attic -- when Jessica speaks. \nJESSICA You won't get away with this. When I didn't show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police-- \nGREER The police are the last people on earth I'm worried about...

The pumping cacophony coming from the phone behind the beam. It's subtle at first, but grows increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer won't hear it-- But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room, Greer stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to cover it with her own voice. \nJESSICA Do you honestly expect me to believe we're going to walk away from this alive? But Greer isn't listening to her.

Mooney gets out. Knocks. The door opens, revealing the ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN from before. \nMOONEY Ms. Martin? \nATTRACTIVE WOMAN Yes? \nMOONEY Jessica Kate Martin? The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the woman. Maybe his hunch was wrong... \nATTRACTIVE WOMAN Cam I help you, Officer...? She scans Mooney's badge. \nMOONEY Mooney. (shakes his head) No. No, I guess not. Must've been a prank. I m sorry to have b9thered you, Ms. Martin. Have a nice day. The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself. As Mooney drives off-- \nTHE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks back into the house and flips open her CELLPHONE.

Craig looks at his wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes. \nCRAIG (CONT'D) Oh, God, Jess... What have they done to you? But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity. \nJESSICA Who are they, Craig? Craig doesn't know what to say. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Tell them, Craig. Tell them they have the wrong family. Tell them they've made a mistake-- But something in his eyes disagrees. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) What?!      What is it? \n.u          CRAIG This isn't a mistake, Jess. And that's all it takes for Jessica's world to shatter. GREEK emerges from the shadows, startling them, and backhands Craig's jaw with the butt of his gun. \nGREEK Where is the disc now? Blood trickles from the corner of Craig's mouth. \nCRAIG You have to promise. If I give it to you... you'll let my family go. \nGREER I'll tell you what, you tell me where it is-- (turns his gun on Jessica) --and I won't blow her brains all over you right now. Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek. Craig looks utterly helpless. \nGREEK (CONT'D) Your call Craig. It's an eighty-five ''cent bullet to me. \nGreer lowers the gun to her neckline( pulls her shirt lower... She pleads \"no\" at Craig with her eyes, but he finally breaks. \nCRAIG Okay.

When he gets near the door, Jessica is overcome with emotion and races to her husband. \nJESSICA Wait!   WAIT!! She brushes past Hodges and hugs on tight to her husband, tears flowing from her eyes. v Hodges goes to pull them apart, but Greer stops him.        He knows this is going to be their last time together. \nCRAIG I love you. Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise. \nJESSICA (quickly; sotto voce) Pretend I'm telling you that I love you. There's an open phone line in here. You'll have help at the office, but if you give these men what they want, we're dead. Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving Craig with an utterly confused expression on his face. But before his look can betray him-- \nGREER Let's go. --Greer and Hodges move forward, ushering Craig out of the room.

He's so close... \nRYAN (CONT'D) Aw, screw this! Ryan throws some bills at the driver, hops out the passenger side and starts RUNNING. \nMAILROOM SUPERVISOR Happens all the time. Let me see what's back there. Gimme a sec'. The Supervisor disappears into the back room. Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan. The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as-- \nMAIL CLERK , Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir? Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is speaking to him. \nRYAN Me? \nMAIL CLERK You waiting for a package? Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer. \nRYAN (facing away) Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure. \nMAIL CLERK From what department? \nRYAN I'm not sure... They said it was a contract, though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal? \nMAIL CLERK What's the tracking number? \nRYAN (patting himself down) Uh... Right. Tracking number. It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears. \nMAILROOM SUPERVISOR Mr. Martin? I found a number of things that could be what you're looking for. Mind coming back to take a look? Hodges shoots Craig a look, \"go\". \nCRAIG Sure. The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room. Unfortunately, Greer stays behind. \nRYAN (patting himself) I might...

HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers, opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside down -- and a DVD case slides out! A quick glance at the label, \"ADT Digital Surveillance'. 5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00\" confirms it's the disc. \nCRAIG This is it.

Everyone's got their head up their ass over there. The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to. Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window at the end of the hall. \nMAIL CLERK (impatiently) Sir? You think you could just go outside and get your clipboard? Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault. \nMAIL CLERK (CONT'D) Sir? Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone. At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the door -- \nA moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and suddenly realizes: This is the guy! It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something. \nMAIL CLERK (CONT'D) Sir!? \nRYAN (to Clerk) Screw the package. Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by-- \nMAIL CLERK \nWHAT ARE YOU DOING--?! -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!   Hodges drops like a slaughterhouse cow. Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has come to life; drawing down on them. \nSECURITY GUARD \nFREEZE! Craig does.   But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the bank. \nRYAN \nCOME ON, LET'S GO! \n119   INT.

The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the stressed metal. Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear. Desperate to console her, Ryan -- BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks up to see it angrily launching itself right at him! He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses himself to one side but -- WHAM!!

WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR. And it's lit.

WHO HAVE YOU \nTOLD?! \nJESSICA \nNO, DON 'T H URT M E-- Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand. HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR, shattering it in a million pieces around her. Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip. \nDEASON \nYOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD! She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...        You win. \nJESSICA Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything... Anything.. . There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper arm. Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand-- \nDEASON (sarcastic) Oooh. --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river. Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused. \nJESSICA Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the attic. \nBACK TO: \n132         INT. TRASH CHUTE - DAY                                            132 RYAN'S still trapped.

As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan's got to make his move -- he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the opposite side of Greer. \nBLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! \nBullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and Ryan summons his courage -- and takes off limping! \n135    EXT.

Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends! It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit! He's gonna have to search this whole place-- Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone, making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT MESSAGE to-- x95   EXT.

The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault. Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp. \nTOMLIN Shoulda stayed at home this morning, kid. And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing-- Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else. \n^_        RYAN (OS) Funny.

SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LAX                                  89 Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass through airport's METAL DETECTORS. This is Ryan's chance. He cuts through the line. \nRYAN Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My grandmother needs her walker... Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE -- ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket. Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there. Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands innocently the next line over-- --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd. Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to walk through the metal detector and... \nSFX:   BZZZZZZZTTH ...sets off the alarm. \nDETECTOR OPERATOR Excuse me, sir. Would you mind emptying your pockets over here? Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then his keys... Then looks baffled as he pulls out -- the GUN 1 \nDETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D) Code red!     Code red! The response she gets is stunning. SECURITY GUARDS jump out of the woodwork with guns drawn.

Due to a security problem, all persons are required to clear the terminal and return immediately to the security checkpoint at the entrance to Concourse B... At once, everyone begins filing out of the terminal. Ryan looks like a salmon swimming upstream, the only figure moving against the tide of people rushing to get out. \nJESSICA (VO) \"Left Field\" is in Terminal C. \nRYAN Listen to me! They're clearing the terminal. Before your husband passes me, what does he look like? \nJESSICA (VO) He's thirty-eight. Six feet.     Trim build.

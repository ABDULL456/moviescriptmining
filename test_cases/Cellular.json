I make more money than he does. \nRYAN Could they've mistaken you for someone else? \nJESSICA No! I don't know.    None of this makes any sense.

And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend! \nRYAN (CONT'D) (smirking) ...Ain't that a bitch. As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away, CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER. More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and -- \nRYAN (CONT'D) There's the school. Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see: \n38   EXT.

Why didn't you tattoo \"kick me\" on his ass while you were at it? \nJESSICA He was named before the singer ever- \nRYAN Forget it.     What does he look like? \nJESSICA (VO) He's eight years old. Blonde hair. Green eyes. Small for his age. He's wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants-- \nRYAN They're all wearing blue shirts and pants!

Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't believe I'm yelling this at an all- boys school. All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge Gym Teacher races after him.

Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school. \nRYAN No one's gonna get your kid!    He's not slow, is he? \nJESSICA (VO) What--?   No! \nRYAN Then he won't go anywhere with strangers. \nJESSICA (VO) Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11 think it's Rosario and hop right in! She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the pick-up spot. Scans the lot. \nRYAN What color? \nJESSICA Black! \nRYAN (looks) Of course it is. PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac Escalades. \nRYAN (CONT'D) There's three of them.

He pulls it out -- the SCRAP OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words \"JESSICA MARTIN\" and \"BRENTWOOD\" when Ryan handed him    the phone. Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and address appear on the screen: \nJESSICA KATE MARTIN.   327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD. \nMooney stares at the name.

Tries to push the PHONE GUTS behind a beam with her foot as Greer enters -- but fails. The receiver sits in front of the beam, EXPOSED! Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to Jessica.

I don't know what you want me to say. I swear-- \nGREER Shut up!!! Which field?! He wouldn't leave a message that didn't make sense to you! Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again-- \nJESSICA Wait! The bleachers behind left field at Dodger Stadium! That's where we first met. \nGreer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment, searching her soul. She's lying. \nJESSICA (CONT'D) Please! Believe me. That has to be where he means.

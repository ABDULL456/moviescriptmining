FARQUAAD I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you! 
FIONA No, Shrek! 
FARQUAAD (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And as for you, my wife... 
SHREK Fiona! 
FARQUAAD I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I'm king! 
Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles. 
FARQUAAD I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon show up and the dragon leans down and eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah! 
DONKEY All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on the edge! 
The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground. 
DONKEY Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? 
The congregation cheers. 
DONKEY Go ahead, Shrek. 
SHREK Uh, Fiona? 
FIONA Yes, Shrek? 
SHREK I - - I love you. 
FIONA Really? 
SHREK Really, really. 
FIONA (smiles) I love you too. 
Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation. 
CONGREGATION Aawww! 
Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around her.

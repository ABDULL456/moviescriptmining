The two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts jury-rigged. 
308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY 
JACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals midshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron. 
JACK Signal... 'Parole prisoners Valparaiso'... 
WILLIAMSON You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir? 
JACK No. Captain Pullings. 
WILLIAMSON hurries to the signals locker, the signal book and JACK's message in his hand. 
309.   TELESCOPE POV   DAY 
The line of colored signal-flags run up to the mast-head of the Surprise. 
309A   QUARTERDECK ACHERON 
Midshipman Rye is reading the signal for Pullings 
RYE ....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God- speed, Captain Pullings.' 
A contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is confirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a sharp turn away from the Surprise. 
310.   DELETED 
311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK 
Slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and routines reassert themselves. 
· Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck composing a poem in memory of the battle. 
· JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to a small attentive audience. 
· While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about BECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way around most of his torso. 
· BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures collected at the Galapagos, as... 
· BONDEN reads his first book, 'Diseases of Seamen' by Stephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently. 
· While the powder-monkeys skylark in the rigging 
313.   INTERIOR, GREAT CABIN - NIGHT 
STEPHEN plays a note on his cello [      ] 
STEPHEN Shall we begin? 
JACK pauses, gazing into space. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) Jack, brother, you're gathering wool. 
JACK (smiles) Thinking about their captain. A great seaman, whatever you may say of him. The doctor said he was killed by our first broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him, face to face. 
STEPHEN Maybe you did. 
JACK What? 
STEPHEN While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago. There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you will find one there now. 
JACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of water flowing gently past the hull. 
He looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the thought of a possible final deception flooding through him. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) Shall we? He starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello carrying through to .... 
312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT 
KILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is preparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL. 
KILLICK That's the last of the cheese and like as not they'll leave it seizing to their plates with their tweedly tweedly tweedly. 
JACK (O.S.) Killick? KILLICK THERE! 
KILLICK (projecting) Which it will be ready when it's ready! 
In the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling, undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through the great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far away. Jack breaks off abruptly: 
JACK 
You're still missing your cormorant... flightless eh...well then. It will still be there when we come back 
And he breaks into a merry jig

Please, my daughter. 
HARLAND 
Think about it.    ...    They defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days. Walked right over us. ....    And these are only the first, they'll keep coming. This is not a war any more than there's a war between men and maggots. This is an extermination. 
Ray walks over to where Rachel is sleeping. 
HARLAND 
(feeling he's not grasping the reality) Are you afraid? 
RAY 
Of course I am. 
HARLAND 
(going on) I been around death plenty. Drive an ambulance in the city. Well, drove and ambulance in the city. That's all over now, huh?    ....   You know the people who make it Ray? The ones that don't flatline before the hospital? It's the ones who keep their eyes open, keep looking at you, keep thinking. ....    There the ones who survive... ....   We can' t loose our heads Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll kill you.    ......     I'm dead set on livin'. 
He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke. 
HARLAND 
Hah. Dead set on Living. 
Harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first started. 
RAY 
Thank you for taking us in. 
Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes... 
HARLAND 
We're not going to be exterminated. 
The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside. Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of the basement collapses from all the vibration. 
HARLAND 
(with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come on, I wanna show you something! 
They both are waling towards a window. 
HARLAND 
We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta have a weakness. Come on, take a look. 
Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground. 
HARLAND 
Somehow they killed a few of these things in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling me the Japanese can figure it out but we can't? 
Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere else. 
HARLAND 
We can do it. We can get 'em. We can figure it out. 
Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair. 
RAY 
Stay right there! 
Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands that robots do this on a regular basis. 
RAY 
I have a daughter! Why did you bring us here? 
HARLAND 
To fight 'em together, Ray.   .... Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground. When the time is right, we'll take 'em by supries, the way they took us. We'll take 'em by surprise. 
Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying with an insane man. 
HARLAND 
We're right under their feet, Ray. Right here, under their feet. 
INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK 
Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall and studies that one. 
Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.

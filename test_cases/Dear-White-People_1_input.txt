LIONEL Hey, some could argue that a show with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty Black show. 
TROY Yeah? That work out for you? 
LIONEL No. No it did not. At least not in High School. I bet there's a statue of you at your High School. 
TROY I was beloved. Won't lie. 
LIONEL Did they know you were a trekker? 
TROY My pops left a paint by numbers template for success at that High School. All I had to do was fill in the blanks. Football captain. Valedictorian. Prom King. 
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy. 
TROY (CONT'D) So what? You're growing that out? 
LIONEL I think it's gaining sentience. 
TROY It's...out there. 
LIONEL It's like a black hole for white people's fingers. They're obsessed. 
TROY You know I cut hair. Why didn't you ask me? 
LIONEL You're I dunno...you? 
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to Gillespie. 
GEORGE Li! You ready man? 
LIONEL No costumes? I got a tux for this. 
ANNIE We just got out of the staff room. 
GEORGE Yeah, we're going as overworked. 
LIONEL Where is it? 
ANNIE Garmin House. On third I think? 
LIONEL Third and Basin. I know it. 
Before Lionel jets to join them. 
TROY Yo man. If I'd gone to your High School, I'd have had your back. 
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends. 
78   EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    78 
Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in. 
79   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    79 
The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz. 
It's a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff. 
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 
Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE. 
TROY ...my own firm. Maybe run for office. Make a difference you know? 
The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy's eyes to his phone - photos from "Dear White People" pop up in his news feed. 
80    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    80 
Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers. 
LIONEL This is kind of fucked up. Right? 
GEORGE Pastiche. The world's most erudite boneheads. Who wants another round? Come on Lionel, help a brother out. 
LIONEL Kitchen's this way. 
80A   ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS                                       80A 
Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She's feeling herself as she's handed a drink. 
She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.

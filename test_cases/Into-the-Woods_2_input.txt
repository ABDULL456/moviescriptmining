WE'RE SEEING OUR SIDE-- 
LRRH/JACK

CINDERELLA/BAKER 
OUR SIDE-- 
ALL FOUR 
MAYBE WE FORGOT:/ THEY ARE NOT ALONE./ 
NO ONE IS ALONE. 
SOMEONE IS ON YOUR SIDE--/ NO ONE IS 
ALONE-- They're interrupted by the ominous sounds of the approaching 
GIANT. 
LRRH Here she comes! 
ANGLE ON JACK AND THE BAKER. 
BAKER Go, Jack! Be careful. 
ANGLE ON THE GIANT'S FEET Destroying everything in its path. ANGLE ON JACK, as he scurries up higher in the tree. 
WIDE SHOT The GIANT approaches LRRH and CINDERELLA. 
GIANT Where is the boy? 
LRRH We have him. 
GIANT Where? 
LRRH 
(POINTS) He's hiding in that tree! JACK pops up and reveals himself at the top of the tree. 
JACK Here I am! The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK. JACK and the BAKER load their slings. 
BAKER (calling up to JACK) Ready? 
JACK Ready! ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path. Suddenly, she steps into the expanse of the tar pit, which slowly stops her in her tracks. She fights to free herself as she begins to sink. 
SERIES OF SHOTS -- The BIRDS fly from the trees. -- BAKER'S POV through the tree branches as the BIRDS swarm around the head of the GIANT. -- CINDERELLA and LRRH watch and hear the GIANT'S screams. 
CINDERELLA Good birds! 
LRRH She doesn't look happy. -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at the 
GIANT. -- JACK shimmies to the end of a high limb for better aim. -- The GIANT reaches blindly towards JACK. 
LRRH (CONT'D) Look out Jack! -- The GIANT seizes hold of the branch where JACK is standing which knocks JACK off. JACK catches himself on the way down, grabbing the branch, and hangs on for dear life. Using one hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to the GIANT'S forehead. -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway. BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him. The GIANT'S hand grabs some tree branches, as she fights for her balance. We hear the crackling branches as the GIANT FALLS pulling the tree down with her, snapping it in a final deafening THUD. 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CINDERELLA and LRRH run around the gigantic, exposed roots. 
CINDERELLA Where are they? 
LRRH Jack? Mr. Baker? 
CINDERELLA Jack? 
JACK Over here! 
LRRH Jack! 
LRRH (CONT'D) 
(TO LRRH) Will you take him. LRRH takes the BABY as CINDERELLA helps JACK out of the tree roots. 
CINDERELLA Oh, be careful, are you alright? 
JACK Where is he? 
CINDERELLA He's not with you? 
LRRH Mr. Baker? All three feverishly look for him. 
BAKER Jack, Jack! 
JACK Help me. Help me! 
BAKER Jack, I'm here. CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER, breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY from 
LRRH. 
CINDERELLA Let me take him. 
BAKER (To Jack then LRRH) Are you okay? Are you alright? We did it! We did it! Come here. They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen tree. 
BAKER (CONT'D) Now we can all return home. 
JACK What home? I have no one to take care of me. 
LRRH (to the BAKER) And we have nowhere to go, so we'll move in with you. 
BAKER 
WELL -- He hesitates then: 
BAKER (CONT'D) -- of course you can come home with me. 
JACK 
(TO CINDERELLA) And you can come, too. 
BAKER If you want to.

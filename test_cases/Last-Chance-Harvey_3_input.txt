Harvey enters the room. He sees his daughter, standing off to one side, with Scott, talking to some friends. 
She looks beautiful. He takes a moment to just watch her. As she turns in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her father and joins him. 
SUSAN Hi Dad. 
HARVEY Suz... (beat) You look beautiful. 
SUSAN Thank you. 
Slightly awkward pause. 
HARVEY Give us a hug then, as they say in this country. 
They embrace. Beat. Off Susan's look... 
HARVEY (CONT'D) I know, I look ridiculous. 
SUSAN No. You look... 
HARVEY Like a bad lounge act. 
Susan smiles at her Father. Beat. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) I spilt something on my trousers. (beat) I've been doing that a lot recently. 
Harvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh with his buddies. 
SUSAN Dad. 
HARVEY Long way to come to see two American kids get married. 
Susan looks at her father, a little irked. 
SUSAN Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad. 
Harvey looks at his daughter. 
HARVEY Sorry. 
Beat. 
SUSAN Have you seen mum yet? 
HARVEY No. They're here? 
SUSAN Yes. They're over by our table. 
Harvey looks over. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Please Daddy. 
HARVEY What? (beat) I'll be good. 
Just then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends over to say hello. 
SCOTT Look who i've got! 
Susan's girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach. Susan turns to greet them. 
HARVEY I'll speak to you later Suz. You enjoy your friends. 
As Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats. 
INT. PUB - NIGHT 
Kate rejoins the others. Oonagh and Matt are standing. Matt has his jacket on. 
OONAGH (to Kate) We've gotta go. Problem at home. Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing serious. (MORE)

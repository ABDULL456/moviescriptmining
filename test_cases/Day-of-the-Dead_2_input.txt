RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee. 
RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins. 
RHODES Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss Henried's pride and joy. 
RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly. 
RHODES Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here. 
A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see. 
82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT 
MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into A CELL marked "SAMSON!". 
SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out grey matter. 
JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as well and she reels away from the hideous sight. 
RHODES Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse. 
MARY God....damn you, Rhodes! 
RHODES God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours? 
MARY You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat! 
RHODES No wonder they're so....hungry. 
Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth. 
THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle. 
RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR. 
MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical. 
RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet. 
83	INT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT 
A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL X-RAYS. 
MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the open doorway. 
JULIE I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived! 
RHODES Any dead whose brains are intact will revive. 
JULIE But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them! 
RHODES They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this. 
JULIE I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to... 
RHODES The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there. 
MARY You gave them a fresh taste of blood! 
RHODES They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it! 
JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She looks at MARY accusingly.

Walter's alone again. He's back near the park in the city, waiting to cross State. He puts the skateboard down and starts kind of messing around with it a little, moving around on it a little bit. Then he takes off on it pretty well, then he grinds the low garden curb - nicely done. 
CUT TO: 
THIS IS A CLOSE UP OF THE NON-SPECIFIC PHOTOGRAPH OF WATER 
INT. FILM PROCESSING ROOM, TIME-LIFE BLDG - DAY 
Walter's got the water photo under a light lamp. He's scrutinizing it, hoping to gain some information. 
WALTER (quietly, to himself) Is this the Arctic Ocean..? A glass of Sprite. 
Then he finds something. There's been a light leak at the edge of the frame. Here, with the picture blown-up and light poured on, Walter can make out something reflected in the water. It's the stern of a fishing trawler. Its vessel name and registry number are visible. She's the Erkigsnek SO709. Her port home is almost visible painted beneath, but only the first two letters are legible due to the light leak - Nu. 
INT. BREAK ROOM, LIFE MAGAZINE - LATER 
Walter and his colleague Tim Naughton have met up in their breakroom, having some coffee.  On the wall beyond them is a massive photo of Evel Knievel on fire. 
WALTER Hey were you able to use the Circulation computer to find that ship? That boat? 
TIM NAUGHTON Yeah, it's registered in Nuuk. 
WALTER Nuuk? 
TIM NAUGHTON That's a town. I think the town in Greenland. It's a coastal fishing vessel. 
WALTER ....Greenland. 
Walter considers that. It connects to nothing for him. He turns to other matters. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Tim, what would you say is a good accomplishment of yours, like something that you'd put on an online dating page? 
TIM NAUGHTON I don't know. 
Tim considers this. 
TIM NAUGHTON (CONT'D) I broke Adam Lopez's record for hitting the highest singing note for a male, I guess. 
WALTER Seriously? 
TIM NAUGHTON Yeah. 
After a moment, Gary hits the highest singing note ever recorded for a male. 
WALTER Wow... 
TIM NAUGHTON But I don't know if I'd put that on eHarmony. (MORE) 
TIM NAUGHTON (CONT'D) I just don't think that's really going to do a lot for the ladies. 
WALTER Yeah. How did you know you can do that? 
TIM NAUGHTON My voice goes way up there when I'm emotional, or whatever, can't really control it. 
WALTER I was thinking about putting that I've never really been late coming back from lunch. 
TIM NAUGHTON ...I don't know. Kind of weak. That's not exactly winning the Tour de France. 
WALTER ...Yeah 
EXT. CHOPPED SALAD, CHAIN SALAD FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - LATER 
Walter is visible at a table for one. He's finishing up lunch. He checks his watch. Then he stands to leave to get back to work on time. 
EXT. STATE STREET - LATER 
Walter's running to the subway station a half-block ahead. Then he passes a man who's just standing there silently extending (to Walter) a cup of water. Walter takes it without breaking stride, drinks it and drops the cup on the sidewalk it was unusual. Then Walter hustles down the subway steps and checks his watch to ensure he's running on time. 
INT. SUBWAY MOVING - MOMENTS LATER 
Walter has taken his subway seat. Then a shirtless, beaming Frenchman leans into view (in the seat behind Walter's) and offers Walter pats (congratulatory) on the back. 
EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATER 
Walter's made it to the corner of 6th and 49th. He looks up ahead at the Time-Life building (his destination). Then he checks his watch and finds he'll be on time. He's relieved Then a Frenchman comes up and sprays Walter in the face with Champagne. Then multiple Frenchmen mob Walter, fighting for turns at congratulating him through frantic head rubs. 
EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATER 
Walter is carried on the group of Frenchmen's shoulders as they run him up 6th avenue, chanting. 
FRENCHMEN (European sports chant) Wal-ter Mi-tty.

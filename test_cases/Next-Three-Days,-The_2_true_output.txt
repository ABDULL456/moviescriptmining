NICOLE I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it? 
JOHN No.  She's not like that.   She'd... (has to admit) She's in prison. 
NICOLE Oh. 
JOHN I don't tell most people. 
NICOLE I understand. 
JOHN She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman. 
NICOLE ...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't. 
Nicole doesn't know what else to say. 
JOHN We should really be getting home.

159   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                    159 
NICOLE (feigns disappointment) Oh, okay. 
JOHN (waving the envelope) Thanks for the invitation.    We'll try and make it. 
NICOLE That would be great. 
John heads back and scoops up Luke.       Nicole watches, trying not to look dumbfounded. 
160   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON                                 160 
John and Luke enter, John sorting through the mail.      Nothing from Lara. 
161   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                         161 
John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new letter in the old yellow envelope. 
162   INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT                                            162 
This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself. 
JOHN You want to read a letter from Mom? 
Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As Chocolate... 
LUKE She didn't write that. 
JOHN My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out. 
163    EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON                    163 
Luke and John water Paula's vegetable garden. 
LUKE But what's wrong with her? 
JOHN She's not feeling well. 
LUKE Why didn't she just stay home? 
JOHN Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed. 
LUKE How do you know when you're that sick? 
JOHN The doctors do tests. 
Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley, at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He drops the hose and takes Luke's hand. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Come on. 
They drop the hose in the garden and walk back to the house. 
163A   INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                    163A 
John flings open the medicine cabinet, finds an old bottle of Lara's insulin. He checks the label. 
163B   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                       163B 
John hits a key and a medical article appears: LIFE THREATENING COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES. 
...Severe Hyperkalemia...extremely high levels of potassium ...cardiac arrest...particularly dangerous as there are no outward symptoms... 
164    INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - LATER -- NIGHT                               164 
The camera swirls as John searches the wall and photos of delivery vans arriving at the jail. Not seeing what he wants, he charges the desk & rifles through more photos. 
(CONTINUED) WHITE    9-10-09                                             59. 
164   CONTINUED:                                                         164 
He finally snatches the photo he's looking for. He turns it over -- on it is written TUESDAY 9:30 AM. And right over the phrase FIND THE KEY he pins the photo of a delivery van from a medical laboratory. 
165   EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- MORNING                                        165 
Parked at a distance, John watches from inside his Prius. Finally, a DRIVER steps out of the jail carrying a tray of test results. He opens the back door of the van. 
166   EXT.    STREETS -- DAY                                             166 
John follows the van.

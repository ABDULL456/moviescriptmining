MODEL God, I love those. Which ones -- 
BISHOP Mr. KcKenna has a creative relationship with the truth. I don't actually... The model glances around, unsure... 
MODEL Oh, okay. That's funny. So what do you do? 
STEVE Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do? Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down. BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope. 
STEVE (CONT'D) Come on, Mr. Bishop. We're all waiting. Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then Bishop is up and moving through the crowd, pushing by people LAUGHING, DANCING. He almost runs into a bright blue-haired woman on the arm of a jockish RAPPER. 
BISHOP Excuse me... He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the Woman. She's utterly different than we've seen her. Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick, bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) Hi. 
WOMAN Hi... This is strange. The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High- fives all around. He glances around for his date... 
BISHOP Is he your...? 
WOMAN No, just a job. (off his nod) I have to... 
BISHOP I know. Go on. She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES... ... and suddenly she's back with him. No words. Lights and sound and dance around them. She leans forward, kisses Bishop once. Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse. Bishop... staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve's voice fills the outdoor space, amplified. 
STEVE Ladies and gentlemen! The man of the hour! A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes space for him. Steve's near the DJ, speaking on a mic. 
STEVE (CONT'D) I know that not many of you know my friend. My good, dear... friend. I mean, he's a man of few words... And he's an art lover! Did you know that? His home is covered with work. It's amazing, what you can find in there. Amazing. A weird beat. Steve, smiling fierce. 
STEVE (CONT'D) Happy birthday, Arthur. Behind Steve, a covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls the cover off a PORTRAIT of Bishop, clearly done by the Artist he collects. The image is twisted, vivid, disturbing. As the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE the ARTIST himself now comes forward, Steve's arm around his shoulder and bumping fists before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop's hand. Faces BEAM. People CLAP. On Bishop, just looking at Steve who stares back... unreadable. 
EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT 
Bishop bangs out a door into the front drive, makes it to his car, fumbles for his keys. Sweating, off-kilter. 
STEVE (O.S.) Hey, you forgot something. Steve's there, holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it. 
BISHOP Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm just not used to -- 
STEVE No worries, man. It's your party. You can leave it. 
(BEAT) It's true, isn't it? What you said to me the first time we met. 
BISHOP What's that? 
STEVE This thing we do. Finally, you always do it alone. Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces himself to stop. 
BISHOP Steve... thank you. 
STEVE Uh-oh. I can feel some male bonding coming. We gonna hug it out, Bishop? 
BISHOP No, I'm serious. Thank you. People don't... Anyway, it's been a long time, since someone did something for me. Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark. 
STEVE Happy Birthday, Arthur. Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink, and he turns and is gone, back to the party. Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away. 
INT. BISHOP'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Bishop drives the car out of McKenna's estate, pulls out onto the street. He starts to accelerate away... then STOPS the car in the middle of the street. ON BISHOP. Fighting what his guts are screaming at him. Losing it, POUNDING on the steering wheel. Suddenly still... 
EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT 
Party rages on, oblivious to the absence of its recipient. Suddenly faces turn UPWARDS... to where Steve is looking down on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool. 
STEVE

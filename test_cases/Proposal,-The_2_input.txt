RICHARD You look gorgeous. 
MARGARET 
(SMILING) You look disgusting. 
RICHARD So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl? 
MARGARET Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits. MARGARET (cont'd) Ramone. 
RAMONE 
(QUIETLY) Mi amo. (To the crowd) We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments.   To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways... Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's looking straight ahead, determined to get through this. RAMONE (cont'd) ...of Richard and Margaret's true love... "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices. RAMONE (cont'd) ...before their family and friends. "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated. RAMONE (cont'd) For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today. 
RAMONE (cont'd) And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace. Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask. Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention. He's not sure what to do. RAMONE (cont'd) Mi amo, do you have a question? We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself. 
MARGARET No. 
RAMONE Then why is your hand up? 
MARGARET I have something to say.   It's not a question though. 
RAMONE Can it wait âtil after? 
MARGARET Uh.   Um.   No. 
RICHARD What are you doing? Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner. 
MARGARET Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the "wedding." 
RICHARD Don't do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand. 
MARGARET Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air. 
MARGARET (cont'd) I was going to get kicked out of the country -- so I told Richard that I would destroy his career if he didn't marry me. 
RICHARD Now wait... 
MARGARET Richard.   Please.   Let me finish. (to the Paxton family) Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't blame him.   This is all my fault. (to Ramone) Could you get the band started?   And give these people something to drink. (to Gilbertson) And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport. 
MR. GILBERTSON You got it! Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets to Gertrude and leans down. 
MARGARET Take care of him. 
GERTRUDE Promise. Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone. 
INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY 
Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone. 
MARGARET (unenthusiastically to phone) Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good news.   Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up. 
RICHARD So Frank's back in? Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn't mean much right now. 
MARGARET Yup.   He's in.   For now. 
RICHARD Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird? 
MARGARET Yeah.   Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags. 
RICHARD Great exit back there. 
MARGARET Thanks.   Fun weekend. 
RICHARD Same old, same old, around here. 
MARGARET Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them.

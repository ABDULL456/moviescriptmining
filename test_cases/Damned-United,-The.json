ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                1 \nHeavy leaden skies over the arachnoid stands and floodlights of Elland Road stadium: home to Leeds United football club. \nAnd rain. Sheets of angry, Yorkshire rain. \nTITLE: \"THE DAMNED UNITED\" \n2   INT. BOARDROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                    2 \nFlashlights pop as DON REVIE, (late 40's), the most successful manager in English football, walks out in front of a pack of newspaper and TV REPORTERS. He is flanked by the Chairman of Leeds United, (MANNY CUSSINS, 60's), and several other white-haired blazer-wearing members of the Board. \nREVIE I'm just going to make a brief statement. \nCAPTION: \"JULY 4th, 1974\" \nREVIE stands under a large trophy cabinet, filled with the silverware he has won. REPORTERS wait: intimidated. Cowed. \nREVIE (cont'd) Yesterday afternoon at 3.00, I accepted the FA's offer to become the next manager of the England national football team. \nA gasp among the JOURNALISTS. A burst of flashlights. The BOARD MEMBERS look down at the floor in silence. Bereaved fathers losing their favourite son. \nREVIE (cont'd) Obviously that involves me leaving Leeds United after 13 happy and successful years, which makes me very sad. I'd like to think I have built the club into a family and there must be sadness when anybody leaves a family. However, when one man goes, another steps into his place. I know who I think that person should be, the man to replace me, and I shall make my feelings clear to the directors. Thank you. No further comments. \nREVIE turns and walks out, a volley of REPORTERS shouting questions... \nFADE TO BLACK: \n3   EXT. MOTORWAY - DAY - (1974)                                  3 \nWe're in a car. Tarmac passes beneath us. Roadmarkings. \nOVER THIS: the sound of a flat Teeside voice, singing along with Frank Sinatra on the radio... \nVOICE (V.O.) \"Fly me to the Moon..\" \n4   INT. CAR - DAY - (1974)                                       4 \nTwo young BOYS, (12, 9) stare out of car windows. Raindrops on the panes of glass. Their father, BRIAN CLOUGH, (39), slick, modern, cocky, handsome. About as big a contrast to DON REVIE as it's possible to find, is up front. Driving.. \nCLOUGH (singing) \"And let me play among the stars..\" \nSIMON When are we there? \nCLOUGH Any moment now. On the right. (singing) \"Let me see what spring is like...\" \nThe car turns a bend, and suddenly the floodlights and stands of a football stadium come into view. The BOYS' eyes widen. \nBOY 1 There it is! Dad! There it is! The BOYS smile in excitement. \nCLOUGH (singing) \"..on Jupiter and Mars..\" \n`LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB' written on the side of the stadium. CLOUGH smiles, then puts his foot down. The car accelerates past the turning. The BOYS' smiles fade. \nBOY 1 Where are you going? Dad? You've missed it. \nCLOUGH We've something else to do first. Won't take long.

In other words, darling kiss me...\" \nThe MUSIC continues as the car drives on, turning into the MUSIC of a television program.. \n5   INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY - (1974)                          5 \nThe `CALENDER' front title sequence, a Yorkshire TV current affairs program. We're in a TV studio. The presenter is AUSTIN MITCHELL, (40).. \nMITCHELL Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom Leeds have won everything.. CLOUGH ..not QUITE everything. Not won the European Cup... \n7    EXT. CAR PARK - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     7 \nCLOUGH's car pulls up. He and his sons get out. A few waiting press. Cameras. Lights. A few FANS with autograph books. \nJIMMY GORDON Where have you been, boss? \nJIMMY GORDON, CLOUGH loyal trainer, his face creased with anxiety.. \nJIMMY Directors have been waiting more than an hour. C'mon.. \n(CO NTINU ED) \n5A 7   CON TINUE D:                                                  7 \nJIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH past the training pitch.

(gestures shivering) I tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca! \nCLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths. \nJOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues talking disrespectfully. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Not much of a welcome, was it? And not so much as a smile from Johnny Giles. \nJIMMY You're five days late!! And did you really need to say that about Majorca? (beat, changing the subject) You know he was Revie's first choice for getting your job. \nCLOUGH Who? Johnny Giles? \nCLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes training.... \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Was he now? And Bremner? \nJIMMY Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His first born. You're never going to get any love from him. \nBREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH.. \nCLOUGH Great. Here's to happy fucking families. \n8   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                     8 \nJIMMY GORDON leads CLOUGH and his BOYS down a corridor, where countless photographs of DON REVIE hang on the walls. Holding silverware. \nThey pass an open door, with a sign outside, `MANAGER. Mr. DON. REVIE.' CLOUGH stops. Looks at the sign. \n(CO NTINU ED) \n6A 8   CON TINUE D:                                              8 \nThen pushes open the door.. \n9   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)             9 \nCLOUGH walks into the manager's office. The empty chair. The bare desk. His desk. Don's desk. \nCLOUGH takes a seat in the chair. \nPresently, a middle-aged matron, JEAN REID, Don Revie's faithful SECRETARY for 13 years, appears in the doorway.. \nCLOUGH Any chance of a cup of tea, duck? \nJEAN They're waiting for you. Upstairs. \nCLOUGH swings his feet on the desk. \nCLOUGH Who's that? JEAN The Directors. \nCLOUGH For me? Why? \nJEAN For the board meeting. \nCLOUGH Let them wait. Now, how about that cup of tea? \nCLOUGH smiles sweetly, but JEAN stares at CLOUGH. She pointedly doesn't move. CLOUGH lowers his feet. \nCLOUGH Thank you. I'm the best old one, too. \nCUSSINS ...I also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club. For the city of Leeds. So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and Don? \nCLOUGH Of course it's just about me and Don. Always has been. But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means I won't sleep and won't eat until I take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it -- beaten it so I never have to hear the name \"Don Fucking Revie\" again -- beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian Clough. Brian Clough uber fucking alles. Understand? \nThe blazers and brass buttons, WHITE-HAIRED ELDERS of Leeds stare at one another. \nCUT TO: \n11   OMITTED                                                            11 \n10A-11 \n12   INT.

It's SAM LONGSON, Chairman of Derby County, (60's) looks like Krushchev, cue-ball head, voice like a power-drill, a tough haulage millionaire.. \nUNCLE SAM I can hear the cash registers now! \nCLOUGH Happy days, Sir. Happy days. UNCLE SAM You're not wrong, Brian. Take the family out for a meal. Go to The Mumtaz. Tell `em I'm paying. \n14   INT. CLOUGH'S HOUSE - NIGHT - (1968)                       14 \nCLOUGH hangs up the phone.. \nCLOUGH Put the fish and chips in the bin. Tonight's on Uncle Sam. We're going posh. Chicken fucking bhuna in town. General excitement. Everyone starts putting on their coats. \n15   EXT. BASEBALL GROUND - DERBY - DAY - (1968)                15 \nCLOUGH stands with two men in overalls, indicating a fading `Visitors' sign... \nCLOUGH Right, you two, I want Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles to be able to read THAT... (indicates door-frames) And this woodwork has seen better days.. \n12A \nBREMNER Don never did that. \nCLOUGH Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I never want to hear that man's name again. Ever. Next player who mentions it, or what he did or didn't bloody do in the good ol' days, will spend a week cleaning my boots. (clapping hands) Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean, and sensible. No fifty-fifty's. CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Right, I'll play myself. You might learn something, Irishman. Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts. \nCLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it up onto this head - down onto his chest, then \"WHAM\" volleys it into a distant goal.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Like to see Don fucking Revie do that, eh? \nCLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the whistle.. (CO NTINU ED) \n27   CON TINUE D: (4)                                                  27 \nThe game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove himself, is soon darting about, calling out... \nCLOUGH (cont'd) (clapping hands) Here, son. To feet. Keep it simple. Think and give. On the deck. Nice and crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me. \nCLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out.. \n\"CRUNCH\", a bone-shaking tackle from \"BITES YER LEGS\". \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!! \nCLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON runs up to NORMAN HUNTER.. JIMMY Fucking matter with you? He said no fifty-fifty's. \nHUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS. Crowding the referee. Intimidating him. \nHUNTER What are you going to do about it? Book me? \nJIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on the floor. In agony. Holding his knee. \n28   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DRESSING-ROOMS - SAME TIME                  28 \nCLOUGH listens to the PLAYERS laughing at him. Disrespecting him. His face darkens. \nBREMNER (mimicking) \"Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two hundred and seventy-four starts.\" \nThe sound of coarse, cruel laughter among the LEEDS PLAYERS. JIMMY GORDON appears, CLOUGH's two SONS in tow.. \nJIMMY I've got what you were looking for. \nJIMMY holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. CLOUGH's expression changes. \n(CO NTINU ED) \n28   CON TINUE D:                                                  28 \nCLOUGH What about the petrol? \nJIMMY In the boot of the car. \nCLOUGH Good lad. \n29   INT. CORRIDOR - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                      29 \nCLOUGH limps down a corridor. In a thunderous mood. Holding the parcel. PEOPLE scatter. \n30   INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)              30 \nThe door flies open. CLOUGH storms into his office. He walks over to the desk. DON REVIE's desk. He unwraps the parcel, and takes out an axe. \nCLOUGH Stand back. \nCLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood. \n31   EXT. ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1974)                                 31 \nCLOUGH watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside. MANNY CUSSINS and several DIRECTORS walk out. They are surprised to see CLOUGH by the fire holding an axe... \nCUSSINS Everything all right? \nCLOUGH (sunny, waving with the axe) Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins. \nCLOUGH smiles politely, then turns, and walks to his car. The DIRECTORS watch.. \nCUT TO: \nTAYLOR In the middle of the park. Somewhere he can see everything, use his loaf, and tell the kids what to do. \nCLOUGH We'll play him as a sweeper, then. \nTAYLOR (eating crisps) Aye. \nThey climb into the waiting car... \nCLOUGH Won't have to run about too much. And what's all this I hear about a tie shop? \nTAYLOR He's got a tie shop, hasn't he? In London. Which he spends two days a week at. \nCLOUGH starts the engine... \nCLOUGH Fucking tie shop? \n(CO NTINU ED) \n24A 37   CON TINUE D:                                                  37 \nTAYLOR It's his \"nest egg\".

Like kids. The car pulls off... \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Hope his footballing brain is better than his business brain. \n38   EXT. MACKAY'S HOUSE - NORTH LONDON - DAY - (1968)                 38 \nCLOUGH's car pulls up outside a house in a quiet terraced road in North London. TAYLOR checks it against the address on a piece of paper. The two men get out of the car... \nCLOUGH You know it's illegal. To sign someone on the sabbath. \nTAYLOR Is it? (immediately cautious) Then perhaps we should just shake on it today? And sign tomorrow? \nCLOUGH What? And let Hearts in again in the morning? Fuck off. (producing contracts) I'm not leaving here without a signature. CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) You'd bloody DO that, too - wouldn't you? Come all this way, then just \"shake hands\"? (shaking head) Dear oh dear. What would you DO without me? \nTAYLOR Hey, you would never have FOUND him if it weren't for me. \nCLOUGH stops, rings the doorbell. Looks at TAYLOR. \nCLOUGH Good job we're both wearing ties. \n(CO NTINU ED) \n38   CON TINUE D:                                                  38 \n`Snap', the door opens to reveal DAVE MACKAY, a thick set, dark-haired bull of a man, with a thick Scots accent. CLOUGH smiles ear to ear.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) Jehova's Witness, Dave! May the Lord be with you! \nMACKAY Who the bloody hell are you? \nCLOUGH My name's Brian Clough, and I once had the pleasure of playing for England against you in an Under-23 match. \nMACKAY I remember you now. You had a black eye, a right bloody shiner. (a beat) And never stopped fucking talking! What are you doing here? \nCLOUGH Come to talk to you about the Promised Land, Dave. Land of Milk and Honey. It's a little place up the M1 called Derby. (a beat) May we come in? \n39   EXT. BASEBALL GROUND - PITCH - DAY - (1968)                   39 \nCLOUGH, TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON training with the Derby PLAYERS. SAM LONGSON, (late 60's), Chairman of Derby County approaches, visibly angry.. \nUNCLE SAM Dave Mackay?? \nCLOUGH You don't look happy, Uncle Sam. \nUNCLE SAM I'm not. What were you thinking? Going over my head like that? Why didn't you call? \nCLOUGH Because you'd have said `no'. \nThe trophy is centre-stage. CLOUGH sings a Sinatra classic.. \nCLOUGH \"Love and marriage, love and marriage, it's an institute you can't disparage..\" \nTo everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not his own wife.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) \"Try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion. Try, try, try and you will only come to this conclusion..\" \nIn another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON.. MACKAY ...\"the man's crocked\", \"older than time\" \"broken more bones than Evel Knievel?\" \nLONGSON All right, I admit it, I was wrong. \nLONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty. \nSuddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls for quiet!! \nON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is being presented with an award... \nREVIE ..for Leeds to win the First Division title, and for me to be named as English Manager of the year...feels like a dream come true... \nCLOUGH watches. His expression changes. His eyes burn into REVIE's. \nCLOUGH You enjoy it, Don. Go home, put your feet up and fucking enjoy it. There's a good lad. Because we'll be in the First Division next season. And we're going to have you! \nLoud CHEERS from LONGSON, TAYLOR, MACKAY and CLOUGH. OVER THIS: we fade in the sound of roaring...

Let's show them some of the things we've been working on. Our changes in attitude, too. Our new outlook. New discipline. New approach.

Lovely pair of feet. \nTAYLOR I've heard he wants out of Sunderland, too. They're all jumping ship up there. \nCLOUGH thinks for a moment, then... \nCLOUGH Well, go on then. Sign him. TAYLOR What? We can't. Longson's already told us. Club's in debt. \nCLOUGH Bollocks to that.

Suppose it depends on your priorities. Players or prawn sandwiches? I know which I'd prefer. I know which honest, working class Derby supporters would prefer, too.. \nA commotion breaks out.

And now this bloke is the only man left in the whole of London. \nCLOUGH continues stroking his son's hair.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) And he suddenly feels very, very lonely because there's no one else to talk to. Nobody else but him. CLOUGH's SON falls asleep. CLOUGH doesn't notice.. \nCLOUGH (cont'd) So he decides that he's had enough, that he can't bear being this lonely, and so he climbs up to the top of the one building still standing. The Post Office Tower. And then he jumps off. And he's falling down, down and down and down, the sixteenth floor, the fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and that's when he hears the phone ringing...

Don't worry, they'll never let us. We just won them the championship. But it will strengthen our position and force them to get rid of Longson. \nTAYLOR What? Oh, no, Brian. They'll never do THAT. He's Chairman. \nCLOUGH I can't do it, Pete. I can't work with my hands tied, a Chairman telling me what I can or cannot do. \nTAYLOR You're picking the wrong enemy. The enemy's not Longson.

Because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years - about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man - or men - can stop me talking to people like you. I love football. It's deep, it goes right down through. It's in every nerve, vein, you name it. It consumes me. And when I have to come and talk about I like the passions of football to come out. Because there are not enough in the game.

And come Monday morning, mark my word, I shall be taking this further... \nThe LEEDS PLAYERS stare at one another.

Hinton, O'Hare, Todd, Mackay. (looks left and right) That's our strongest side. \nCLOUGH Of course it's our strongest side. It's Leeds United.

I wouldn't want my employer to be unhappy.. \nCLOUGH My employer? \nLONGSON Chairman of Derby County. And Chairman LONG before you ever showed up. \nCLOUGH That's right. You were Chairman of Derby County before I came here. I remember that. When Derby County were at the fucking foot of the Second Division, when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full stop. And that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you. There would BE no Derby County without me, no league title, no Champions of England; not without Brian Clough. \nA door opens and PETER TAYLOR walks out in time to hear... \nLONGSON I'm going to give you some good advice, Brian Clough.

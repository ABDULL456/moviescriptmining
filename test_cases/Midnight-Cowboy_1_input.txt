O'DANIEL Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged! 
Joe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air. O'Daniel laughs with him. 
O'DANIEL (CONT'D) You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now? 
JOE Get down -- where? 
O'DANIEL Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer. 
O'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an electric cord. He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic Jesus glows on the dresser. O.S. a revivalist congregation sings. And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner evangelist. 
JOB Shee-it... 
O'DANIEL That's the ticket, just open your heart and let it flow. It ain't the words, it's the love beyond 'em! 
EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME 
Sally Buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned preacher stands in the river, preparing to immerse little Joe. 
O'DANIEL'S VOICE Don't fight it, boy! 
INT. WEST SIDE HOTEL ROOM - DUSK 
O'Daniel tries to pull Joe down beside him. 
O'DANIEL Pray and you shall be heard! 
EXT. REMEMBERED BAPTISM - ANOTHER TIME 
Camera becomes little Joe, glimpsing the fevered faces of Sally Buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank, just before being plunged under the river. O'Daniel's voice reechoes, filtered through water. 
O'DANIEL Don't be frightened, son! 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT 
Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation. 
O'DANIEL Don't run from Jesus! 
Joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a newsstand. There is a picture of Joe being led away by two deputies, under a headline ALABAMA MURDERER SHOTGUNS ELEVEN. 
EXT. FORTY-SECOND STREET - NIGHT 
Joe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a large convertible. Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand. 
INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT 
The saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull. The BARTENDER doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe approaches. 
JOE Say, you know that runty little bastard I was with? 
BARTENDER I don't know nothing. 
Joe tenses as he sees the . tabloid picture of himself on the back of the bartender's paper. Joe's hand closes around an empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the surface. O.S. women scream. 
INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME 
Reflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women screaming O.S. -- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which shatters the mirror and his own image. 
INT. EVERETT'S BAR - NIGHT 
The empty beer bottle stands where it was. Joe has disappeared. On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph, revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

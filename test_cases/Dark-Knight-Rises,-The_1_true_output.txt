(FASCINATED) If I pull this off, will you die? 
BANE It would be extremely painful. 
CIA MAN You're a big guy - 
BANE For you. 
CIA MAN 
(UNNERVED) Was being caught part of your plan? 
BANE Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us. 
DR. PAVEL Nothing! I said nothing! 
CIA MAN Why not just ask him? 
BANE He would not have told us. 
CIA MAN You have methods. 
BANE Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem. CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window. 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS 
The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane looming over it, dangerously close... 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
The plane lurches. The noise is building. 
SERGEANT Sir? 
CIA MAN Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught. What's the next step of your master plan? 
BANE Crashing this plane... 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS 
The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each side... 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane above. CIA Man looks at Bane. 
BANE 
(RISING) With no survivors. A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is outside the window. Bang - 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS 
Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted, unnaturally. 
INT. COCKPIT, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward. 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms, legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends. Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud. Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart. 
EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS 
The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off. 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down, by Dr. Pavel. 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS 
The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away, swinging out as the tail explodes. 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables. A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body the same age and build as Dr. Pavel. 
Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm - runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches, horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest, drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the body... 
An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2. 
BANE Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage. The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm. 
HOODED MAN 2 Have we started the fire? 
BANE 
(NODS) The fire rises. Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr. Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr. Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle. 
BANE Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for fear... Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator. 
BANE That comes later. Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr. Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport, and we - 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOTHAM - EVENING 
Drifting over the vast city... 
MAYOR (V.O.) Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday... ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge... 
MAYOR (V.O.) But we're here tonight because it's one of the most important... ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side... 
MAYOR (V.O.) Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime and, yes, ultimately, his sacrifice, have made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago... ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham. 
MAYOR This city has seen a historic turnaround. No city is without crime. But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act. And to them I say...not on my watch. Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up. I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event. I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit...

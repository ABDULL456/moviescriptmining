MICHAEL Almost three. 
JULIANNE That is so romantic. 
Which makes him reach and touch her hair. 
MICHAEL I just wonder if you know why. 
Do you? 
MICHAEL It's because romance isn't mystery, and tricks, and doubts, and halting, unspoken longings. That's not the real romance. 
Tears in his eyes now.  First time. 
MICHAEL The real romance is saying yes. 
Does she know that now?  He looks at his watch. 
MICHAEL (sighs) Woulda been a nice wedding. 
Oh.  That. 
JULIANNE (urgently) You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love... 
JULIANNE Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock. (beat) You've got a lot of explaining to... 
MICHAEL I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over. 
JULIANNE That's little egotistical. 
He glares at her. 
JULIANNE But, undoubtedly accurate. 
She claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency. 
JULIANNE Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who... 
MICHAEL If you find her... 
Strange tone.  A gentle warning. 
MICHAEL The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain. (beat) Because the only fear she really has, is... 
JULIANNE ... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed. 
Looks at her own watch.  Shit! 
MICHAEL But if you do get to her first... 
She looks up. 
MICHAEL There is something you are authorized to say. 
EXT.  TAXI STAND - DAY 
Julianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi.  The driver smokes, paces, while she waits for a connection on her cellular.  Then... 
MANDY (V.O.) Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking. 
JULIANNE It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you? 
MANDY (V.O.) Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty. 
A shallow laugh... 
MANDY (V.O.) Or crying in her nachos, down at Comskey Park. 
Julianne's face SNAPS to alert. 
JULIANNE Ex-cuse me? 
MANDY (V.O.) I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding... 
JULIANNE You are so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh? 
Signals the driver, let's GO! 
JULIANNE I want to pick up a little something for the ceremony. 
INT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON 
Game in progress.  Julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway of the deserted skybox.  Everyone Walter knows is going to a wedding.  The box is empty except for one cardboard container of nachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair. 
BODYGUARD She wouldn't confide in me, so I called the house. 
He sighs.  Feels terrible about all this. 
BODYGUARD Luckily, I got her cousin. 
Julianne nods.  Yeah, big break, there. 
JULIANNE Going to the john, she said? 
BODYGUARD Could be there awhile. 
INT.  WOMEN'S RESTROOM - AFTERNOON 
Julianne BURSTS into the enormous chaotic restroom.  Looks around wildly, no sign of Kim. 
JULIANNE YO!  IMMIGRATION! 
Everybody stops.  Pays attention. 
JULIANNE I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY WALLACE!

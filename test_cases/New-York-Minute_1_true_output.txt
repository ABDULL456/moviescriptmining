EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF PLAZA - DAY The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly take a left into... 
EXT. THE OTHER ALLEY ADJACENT THE PLAZA - DAY Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door -- locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out while the girls step inside. 
INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE - DAY Chaos. MODELS, DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, "I ONLY DATE MODELS" GUYS and the famous couture fashion designer, BOBO, are mid-show and friggin' frantic. BOBO (French accent) Where are they?! No more breaks! Do you hear me! We have a show to do, you nitwits! Models! BAH! You have hollow gourds for heads! The kind they make those Mexican rattles out of! SHOWRUNNER (always at his elbow) Maracas. BOBO Maracas! Maracas that take coffee breaks when I am paying them a FORTUNE!

She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls her   eyes. Boring. The DREW TEAM parts and    we are stunned to see they've chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW OUTFIT that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini. ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in the movie, speechless. DREW Why does this not surprise me? THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs Drew... DREW Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be going to my college interview. SHOWRUNNER That's rich. A model going to college. What next? Talking monkeys? ... and pushes her through the curtains and...

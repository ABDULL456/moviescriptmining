MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Okay, just focus. Now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind... 
After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it. 
MARK (CONT'D) Good morning. 
Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred. 
EXT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY JOAN, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to Mark's front door, takes a key from her purse and lets herself in. 
INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY She comes in. 
JOAN Good morning. 
Mark does not immediately acknowledge her. 
MARK You're late. 
A LITTLE LATER 
The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a bed bath. He is frail and helpless. 
There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least temporarily. 
MARK (V.O.) Joan I swear this was one crazy bitch Who'd swing me about enough to scare me, But careful enough so she could say: "Now what was all the yelling about? You polios are screamers. Always were." I didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, And thought about revenge. 
In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He feels belittled and humiliated. A LITTLE LATER 
Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.     DAY Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version of his iron lung. 
JOAN Would you mind if I asked you a favor? 
MARK You need help moving furniture? 
She has no apparent sense of humor. 
JOAN I need an advance on my pay, like two weeks. That's not a big ask, is it? 
Mark looks rightfully shocked. 
MARK What if you don't last another two weeks? 4A. 
He gives her a look, and means it. We hear his thoughts. 
MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Joan never failed to put me in a crappy mood. It was also a drag that I was no longer allowed to use my other gurney, the self-propelled one. It had caused a couple of spectacular accidents. 
They turn a corner and approach a church. 
MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Basically, in spite of all the mirrors, I couldn't see where I was going. 
6A   EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH.     DAY                            6A 
Joan pushes Mark's gurney into the sanctuary. INT.   CATHOLIC CHURCH.    DAY FATHER BRENDAN is giving a sermon. Mark listens with satisfaction. There are not many others there. 
FATHER BRENDAN The Apostle Luke tells us that when Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby in her womb leapt - "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy". So Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose. Elizabeth saw the greatness in Mary. "Blessed art thou among women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John, felt the power of this wondrous woman. It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave Mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour".

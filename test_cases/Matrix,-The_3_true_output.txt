Morpheus smiles. 
MORPHEUS Tank, load the jump program. 
Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building rooftop in a city skyline. 
MORPHEUS You have to learn to let go of that anger.  You must let go of everything. 
A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side. 
MORPHEUS You must empty yourself to free your mind. 
Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing out behind him like a cape -- 
Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street. 
NEO Shit. 
Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away. 
NEO Okie dokie. 
He takes a deep breath. 
NEO Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No problem. 
He concentrates.  Runs. 
INT.  MAIN DECK 
They are transfixed. 
CABLE He's gonna make it. 
APOC No way.  Not possible. 
MOUSE No one's ever made their first jump. 
SWITCH What if he does? 
APOC He won't. 
TANK It's never been done. 
Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she whispers. 
TRINITY Come on. 
EXT.  ROOFTOP 
Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek 
But comes up drastically short. 
His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the ground rushing up at him, but as he hits -- 
The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net. 
He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on his back. 
He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from his face. 
Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet. 
MORPHEUS Everyone falls the first time. 
Neo nods quietly. 
MORPHEUS If you never know failure, how can you know success? 
INT.  MAIN DECK 
They break up. 
MOUSE What does it mean? 
CABLE It doesn't mean anything. 
CYPHER Everyone falls, right, Trinity? 
But Trinity has left. 
Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to move and groans, cradling his ribs. 
While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand. 
NEO I thought it wasn't real. 
Neo stares at the blood. 
NEO If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here? 
MORPHEUS The body cannot live without the mind. 
INT.  NEO'S ROOM 
Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food. 
TRINITY Neo, I saved you some dinner -- 
She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray down and pulls the blanket over him.

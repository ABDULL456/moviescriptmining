STILLWELL (BREATHING HARD) We just lost Downs and one of the troopers...Card. 
JANEK God damn it! 
He pounds on his console. 
INT. JUGGERNAUT - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE NAVIGATION CHAMBER 
Watts shocks awake. Gasping. 
She lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of the Juggernaut. A corridor. Not far away, the doorway DAVID opened to the Navigation Chamber. 
A spasm of disgust crosses her face. She gags and spits: a viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings. 
A dead facehugger lies belly-up beside her. The implications slam home. Her face fills with horror. 
She rises, shakily. Looks at the facehugger. Feels the neck ring of her vacuum suit. Looks around. No sign of her helmet. 
There's no sign of DAVID. Silently she steals away. 
PYRAMID WORKSITE 
Ravel and Chance toil away at the terraforming engine. 
Ray stands guard wearily: bored, he watches Ravel and Chance working more than he watches the shadows. 
Watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs. Bare-headed and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover. Slips into the cab and activates the air reserves. The doors seal; air cycles. 
Ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off. 
EXT. DARK CITY - TUNDRA FIELD - PRE-DAWN 
The windows of the Magellan shine in the distance. The mottled ground-cover of lichens glows eerily in the dark. 
A lone cargo rover speeds across the central crater and down the canal leading to the ship. 
EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT - PRE-DAWN 
Bare-headed inside the rover's cab, Watts drives onto the cargo lift. Watches in relief as the lift doors close. The lift cycles air as it rises. 
INT. MAGELLAN - EXCURSION CHAMBER - DAY 
Watts peels off her vacuum suit. The thin clothes underneath are drenched with sweat. She lifts her shirt. Looks at her belly: flat and unmarked, for the moment. 
Brick enters carrying a brace of air tanks, a pistol on his hip, and startles violently. 
BRICK Where the hell have you been? We thought the snake got you. 
Watts rushes past him without answering. 
BRICK (CONT'D) You were better off outside. It's a fucking madhouse in here. 
CORRIDOR 
Watts sprints down a steel corridor. A pang of pain in her stomach sends her staggering against the wall. 
VICKERS'S CABIN DOOR 
Watts sticks her head around the corner. Shepherd stands post outside Vickers's cabin, rifle in his hands. She curses silently and ducks back. 
A sound makes her look again. Vickers steps out of her cabin into the corridor. Shepherd escorts her toward the Bridge. 
Watts waits for them to disappear. Dashes for the cabin door. 
INT. VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. Turns, holding her stomach. Moves across the suite to the Med Pod. 
She thumbs the machine out of stand-by mode. Its screen fills with menu items. Bewildering. Watts finds and touches a red button labeled EMERGENCY. 
A new, simpler list. Watts scans it frantically. 
WATTS (under her breath) Come on...I need a Caesarean. 
A spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. She throttles her scream into a hiss of air. 
Watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and shaking. One hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked against her ribs. With the other hand she taps options... 
SURGERY ... EXPLORATORY ... ABDOMINAL ... PENETRATING INJURIES ... FOREIGN BODY ... INITIATE 
The Med Pod opens with a hiss. 
Watts strips off her clothes. Struggling with fastenings under a new wave of pain. Her hands shaking. 
She's barely keeping her feet. She clutches the frame of the Med Pod in a death grip. It's happening. 
Naked she staggers into the pod. Hits INITIATE. 
The surgical apparatus swings into place. Scalpels, forceps, scopes and suction tubes. A spraygun mists her torso with yellow antiseptic. 
The clear canopy descends over her. 
Watts SCREAMS. A wail of indescribable agony. 
An ARMORED PARASITE erupts from the deepening incision. Its needle-toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) As a result, he was basically a single parent to their young son, Gore. He glances at his watch.      Wow. 
GENE I'm rattling on here, and you've got a morning train. But she's just staring in his eyes.   This could be her last chance to ask... 
AMELIA How's Nina doing? 
GENE Oh, fine. Really?   He smiles, gently. 
GENE (CONT'D) Actually, she hasn't been feeling her best. She'll probably summer in Newport. So my kid's stuck with Dad again. 
AMELIA If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes. 
GENE You suggesting you're less boring than I am? 
AMELIA Well, yeh. He smiles first.    Hers is slower, but here it comes. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches. A full beat.    He's deciding. 
GENE Gore would love that. He has a little crush, I'm afraid. 
AMELIA At seven? 
GENE He's eight. Well, then. He breaks the look.     Fishes out some cash for the bar tab.        G 
ENE (CONT'D) Listen, Paul and I would be thrilled to rope you into our shuttle. 
AMELIA Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure. He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding. 
GENE The next adventure.    What is it? She shrugs.    No idea. 
GENE (CONT'D) Because we're running out of oceans. 
AMELIA Wish you'd do something about that. 
GENE I'm serious, Amelia. Her soft smile. 
AMELIA I know.   Always. 
GENE The only way you can stay where you are. And be who you are... Serious indeed. 
GENE (CONT'D) Is to keep feeding the beast. She can't smile anymore.     Because this is the very fear she lives with. 
GENE (CONT'D) And the beast always needs something larger, greater, more daring... AMELIA (quiet) He costs money, too. 
GENE The price of fame, literally. Do you and George talk about this? Silence. 
AMELIA We don't have to. 
GENE With all respect.    Yes, you do. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 
Walking together down the hallway of her hotel. No one speaks. Their thoughts are their own. She reaches her room, finds her key. Opens the door, and... ...turns to him. A brief, direct look.       She reaches one hand gently behind his head. Leans up. 
K isses his mouth. AMELIA (a whisper) Thank you. His eyes question.

AMELIA For understanding. There is no smile. Without a word, she goes into her room. CLOSES the door behind her. e stands alone. Do I knock on that door?     Then, smiles to himself, and simply... Walks away.

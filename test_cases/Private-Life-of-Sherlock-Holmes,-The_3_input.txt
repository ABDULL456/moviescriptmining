MYCROFT Yes, Ma'am. 
QUEEN VICTORIA Without any warning? 
MYCROFT That is correct, Ma'am. 
QUEEN VICTORIA And without showing her colors? 
MYCROFT Indeed, Ma'am. 
QUEEN VICTORIA Mr. Holmes, we are not amused. (Mycroft stares at her) It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste. We will have none of it! 
MYCROFT I beg your pardon, Ma'am? 
He exchanges a look with Holmes. 
QUEEN VICTORIA Sometimes we despair of the state of the world. What will scientists think of next? 
MYCROFT That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a dirigible -- 
QUEEN VICTORIA A dirigible? And what, pray, is that? 
MYCROFT A rigid balloon, which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace. It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second. 
QUEEN VICTORIA Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like that. 
MYCROFT We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the border. 
QUEEN VICTORIA (indicating sub) Nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it! Scuttle it! The sooner the better. 
MYCROFT May I point out, Ma'am -- 
QUEEN VICTORIA And don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser. (to equerry) Now we wish to return to Balmoral. 
She starts toward the spiral staircase. The equerry precedes her up the stairs, the lady-in-waiting follows, the scientists trail after them. Mycroft and Holmes linger behind. 
HOLMES Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman. (Mycroft is staring at the sub) What a shame. 
All that superb engineering, and all that cunning espionage, for nought. 
MYCROFT Not necessarily. If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them? 
HOLMES Give it to them? 
MYCROFT Invite them aboard for the final journey -- seven hundred feet -- straight down. 
HOLMES And how are you going to arrange that? 
MYCROFT I'm rather counting on you to do it. Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal. 
O.s., the bagpiper resumes playing. 
MYCROFT Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty? 
He starts up the spiral staircase.    Holmes follows slowly and thoughtfully. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CALEDONIAN HOTEL - DAWN 
The gig, with the quide driving and Holmes beside him, comes up the driveway, stops in front of the entrance. Holmes hops down, and twirling Gabrielle's parasol in his hand, walks into the hotel. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN 
In the half-light, Gabrielle can be seen asleep in her bed. She is wearing the pink negligee with the maribou feathers, which has slipped halfway off her shoulders. The other bed has not been slept in. 
The door from the corridor opens and Holmes steps in, carrying the parasol. 
He crosses to Gabrielle's bed, looks down at her for a long moment, adjusts the negligee with the tip of the parasol. The he moves to the French window, opens it, glances out. 
LAKEFRONT - FROM HOLMES' ANGLE - DAWN 
The seven Trappist monks are standing on the shore, silhouetted against the water, watching the hotel. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN 
Holmes withdraws from the window , looks at the sleeping Gabrielle, then casually swings the parasol, hitting a metal lamp-shade overhead. Gabrielle sits up abruptly in bed, clutching her negligee around her. 
HOLMES Sorry about that. But as long as you're up -- what is the German word for castle? Schloss, isn't it? 
GABRIELLE (carefully) I think so. 
HOLMES And how would you say under the castle? Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss?

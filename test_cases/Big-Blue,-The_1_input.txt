ENZO (calmly undressing, expressionless) How did it happen? 
SUPERVISOR (upset) The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help? 
ENZO How many are, down there? 
ENZO goes back to the car. 
SUPERVISOR Just one... We're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly... You've got to get him out fast. 
ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site. 
ENZO (a beat) Ten thousand. 
SUPERVISOR Lira? 
ENZO Dollars. 
SUPERVISOR You're going to hold me up at a time like this? 
ROBERTO You do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world? 
SUPERVISOR Yes, but ten thousand dollars... 
ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack. He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the American, straight in the eyes. 
ENZO Okay.  You tell me.  How much would you say the man's life is worth? 
Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer. 
ENZO In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction. 
SUPERVISOR (baffled) What does that mean? 
ROBERTO That you should get your checkbook. Damn quick. 
EXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO 
He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below. 
ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow. He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense. 
Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. 
ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay. 
UNDERWATER - WRECK 
ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris. 
He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were changing a tire, begins to pump the handle... 
Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris rises off the diver's leg. 
EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully. The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder. 
ROBERTO Since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check? 
UNDERWATER - WRECK 
ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso. Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls him free. 
The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as possible toward the surface. 
EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
The diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits, breathless. 
ROBERTO (to the Supervisor) Sign here. 
Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the back. 
ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO. Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car. 
ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO bends down into the car and opens the roof. 
SUPERVISOR (through the open roof smiling) Thanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that too... You extortionist bastard! 
The car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police (carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site. 
INSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY 
ENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy. 
ENZO Dollars, Roberto!  We took him for ten thousand dollars! 
ROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea. 
EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

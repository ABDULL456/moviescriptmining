Stephanie's hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket. The thin brass button in her palm. 
STEPHANIE .this? She holds the button up for him to inspect. But it's presence makes him uneasy..He wags his finger back and forth. She lowers it. 
STEPHANIE What if I just burn the thing? 
RHAM JAS No matter what condition the button is in, you would still be the owner. The Lamia would still come to take you. 
STEPHANIE Take me where? 
NO 
Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text. She knows where. Stymied, she tucks the button back into her coat pocket. 
STEPHANIE There's got to be something I can do. 
RHAM JAS Yes. There are many ways to appease a spirit. The simplest is a blood offering. An animal sacrifice. A small creature would do. You could sacrifice a chicken. It's all in here... Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he sets before her. 
STEPHANIE No way. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a member of PETA, for Christ's sake. I don't go around killing animals. 
RHAM JAS You will be surprised what you will be willing to do when the Lamia comes for you. She considers his words, looks down to the book. CLOSE ON A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL SACRIFICE - A creature's heart being cut from it's body. CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her kitchen table, reading the book. We see other diagrams: The heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire. The burial of the smoking heart. Stephanie's kitten PURRS, as it rubs against her leg. Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing images. She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to the window and peers out. The rusting iron gate is open. Stephanie senses a change in the room... Shadows shift and grow deeper. The air is suddenly oppressive. Something is coming. 
She moves to the front door and puts her ear to it. Quiet. 1b But then-- 
SCRATCH... SCRATCH... She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM 
She can hear the sound of the SCRATCHING, even here., She rushes to the phone picks it up: No dial tone, only high pitched static, the sounds of the Lamia buried within. She sets the phone down. For a moment all is quiet. Should she go back down? Then she hears a tiny SQUEAKING. The knob on the front door, turning. Then the CLICK of the lock, followed by the CREAKING of rusty hinges as the front door swings open. She calls through her bedroom door. 
STEPHANIE Ellen? ! But it's not Ellen. Stephanie puts her,ear to the door. The sound of an animal's hooves on wood. Something is climbing the stairs. It stops outside her bedroom door. Stephanie holds her breath, listening. She sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door. 
STEPHANIE I know that you're there! The window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening 
ROAR! She ducks for cover. Another window is blown inward and the glass sent her way. She SCREAMS and runs toward the bathroom door. It SLAMS shut in her face! BOOM! Another window is SHATTERED by the angry, unseen thing. The force knocks her to the bed. The blankets are torn from the mattress, throwing Stephanie to the floor. The bedsheets whisk around the room, flapping and twisting about like 1b drunken ghosts. 
She tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank her into the air, suspending her upside down, taking her on a wild and harrowing ride about the room. Abruptly all the madness halts: She drops to the floor. The bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her. Whatever it was, .it's gone. It's quiet now. A terrified Stephanie sits, shaking, in the wreckage of her room. 
INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - LATER 
With a trembling hand, she jams a ZAGNUT BAR into her mouth, and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor. She chases it with a double shot of Maker's Mark Whiskey. She removes a knife from the butcher block and hefts. it's weight. She sings out, in a sweet but trembling voice.

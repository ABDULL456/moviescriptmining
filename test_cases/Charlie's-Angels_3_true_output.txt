It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox. Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance to go off. 
Dylan runs to Charlie's side. 
DYLAN Charlie, no.   NO! 
She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round their fallen leader. He gasps for air. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) He's trying to say something. 
Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for air, there's something stuck in his mouth. 
With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                101. 
CONTINUED: VOICE Ucch, that tasted terrible! 
The voice isn't Charlie's. Dylan reaches down and rips off Charlie's mask, revealing... 
NATALIE Bosley!   Are you okay? 
BOSLEY Think so. 
He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small wound where the bullet grazed his side. 
BOSLEY (CONT'D) Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel. 
Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair. 
DYLAN Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's here... then where's Charlie? 
The Angels all look at each other.      No one knows. 
EXT. CENTER PASSAGE - DAY 
In gorgeous SLOW MOTION, the three angels walk side-by-side with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them. 
They won. 
As MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels away to reveal... 
EXT. GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY 
The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in- hand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc on his sniffer. 
Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Great work, angels. You'll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation. 
The Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Enjoy your vacation, angels. 
THE ANGELS Thank you Charlie. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                102. 
CONTINUED: 
They toast the speakerphone. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been putting in some long hours on this case, so I thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends. 
NATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE 
PETER AND JASON 
walking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a drink of his own. They wave. Damn those men look good. 
Alex and Natalie share a smile. 
DYLAN Any chance you'll be joining us, Charlie? 
CUT TO: 
A SUNNY DECK 
We're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face, but we get some sense of the man. 
He turns away, begins walking.    Steps down onto the sand. 
CHARLIE (to cell phone) I'd love to, Angels. But I have some precious treasures to watch over. 
With that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking across the beach. And it's not just any beach. 
TO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE 
PETE AND JASON 
approaching.    We're on the same beach. 
Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley. They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them. 
A beat, then Dylan looks back. 
She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie? From her reaction, it's not clear.

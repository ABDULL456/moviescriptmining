BOB You'll only thaw it out. 
PHIL Come on, Bob, we could have a great week up in Vermont. 
Bob looks from him to Judy, whose expression is almost pleading. 
BOB I see what you mean.  But Wednesday we've got to be back in New York. 
PHIL All right -- so it's just for a couple of days.  Don't you want me to enjoy the winter sports? 
BOB You enjoy them all year round. (He looks to Betty) We won't get in your way, will we? 
BETTY As long as your friend doesn't try to take my sister for a sleigh ride. 
BOB If he tries it, I'll smash his flexible flyer. (To Phil) It's all set. 
PHIL (Really pleased) The thing I like about you, Bob, is you're not only kind and generous, you're handsome. 
BOB We're going to have to sit up all night.  Let's get some shut eye. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT - EXT. TRAIN - (NIGHT) 
The rhythm of the wheels and the engine funnel, underscored musically. 
MED. SHOT - INT. TRAIN 
All but Phil are half dozing.  One or two other people are seen in the background, asleep.  There is an air of peace and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues. Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes emanating from the surrounding countryside.  Phil turns to the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising Vermont.  CAMERA PULLS UP TO scene, the music swells and we DISSOLVE to a similar landscape in stylized concept.  This is the WINTER FANTASY production number.  At the end of the fantasy we hear the Conductor's voice, "Pine Tree.  Pine Tree, Vermont." 
MED. SHOT - OUR GROUP - (DAY) 
They are bundling themselves up, coat collars tight, expecting to enter the snow country. 
REVERSE ANGLE - SCENE THROUGH PLATFORM DOOR 
Pine Tree Station, all green, no snow.  Four hotel busses await, one marked 'Columbia Inn Bus.' 
FULL SHOT - PINE TREE STATION - (GLASS SHOT) 
Our foursome is just getting off the train.  They are the only ones.  They are looking about, puzzled. 
PHIL Are you sure this is the right Vermont? 
BOB This isn't a southern Vermont? 
JUDY I don't understand it. 
BETTY There has to be snow!  This place is advertised as America's Snow Playground! 
BOB Well, if you say so. (Gesturing to the waiting Columbia Inn bus driver) Driver, your sleigh and reindeer. 
The other three bus drivers are disappointed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT - BUS EN ROUTE 
The bus goes by an incongruous skating rink, with water instead of ice.  Signs indicate the direction of the sun scorched toboggan slide.

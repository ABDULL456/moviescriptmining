DUKE You degenerate pig! 
GONZO It can't be helped.  This is Lucy. (laughing distractedly) You know--like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds." 
LUCY eyes DUKE venomously. 
GONZO Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what happened at the airport!  No more of that, okay? 
LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his arm round her shoulder. 
GONZO Lucy... this is my client.  This is Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. He's paying for this suite, Lucy. He's on our side. 
DUKE flops onto the sofa. 
GONZO Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves artists. 
DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face. 
GONZO Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. 
LUCY I drew these from TV. 
GONZO Fantastic.  She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra.  We're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage... 
DUKE's voice rises above GONZO. 
DUKE (V/O) I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on this.  Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship. 
DUKE Well, I guess they brought the car round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF OUT OF THE TRUNK. 
DUKE fixes GONZO hard. 
GONZO Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF. (to LUCY) Now, we'll be right back.  Don't answer the phone if it rings. 
LUCY (makes one-fingered Jesus freak sign) God bless. 
INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY 
DUKE collars GONZO -- serious. 
DUKE WELL?  What are your plans? 
GONZO Plans? 
DUKE Lucy. 
GONZO (struggling to focus) Shit.  I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. (he shrugs) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink. 
DUKE Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention. 
GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE. 
GONZO Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months.  It's terrible. 
DUKE She's perfect for this gig.  These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her.  We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own. 
GONZO's face twitches badly. 
GONZO Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff. 
DUKE It's straight economics.  This girl is a god-send.  Shit, she can make us a grand a day. 
GONZO NO!  Stop talking like that. 
DUKE I figure she can do about four at a time.  Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day.  Maybe three. 
GONZO You filthy bastard.  I should cave your fucking head in. 
DUKE In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member. 
GONZO starts crying.

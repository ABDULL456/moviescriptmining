116   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY 
KIRSTY and TIFFANY burst out into the corridor and almost fall over the PATIENT IN THE WHEELCHAIR. 
PATIENT So what, girls? It's O.K. for an ego-trip but it doesn't got the job done. 
Shaking their heads at the insanity, they run up the corridor. 
TIFFANY looks slightly distracted and when she speaks it is half to herself. 
TIFFANY I have to go back. Or it'll never stop. 
KIRSTY (Confused) What are you talking... 
TIFFANY (to herself) I've got to finish it. 
KIRSTY Finish what? 
Even as KIRSTY says this, TIFFANY has moved past her and is resuming her run down the corridor. 
KIRSTY Tiffany! Wait! 
KIRSTY starts after her friend. 
They turn back into the main section of the corridor that contains their own rooms, TIFFANY still four or five yards in front of KIRSTY. 
TIFFANY reaches her room. The door is open. She goes in. A second later, KIRSTY follows. 
117      INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   DAY 
KIRSTY enters the room. It is as we last saw it except that the walls have re-parted to give onto the corridors of Hell. 
Carefully and slowly, KIRSTY moves across to the entrance and looks down it. She is rewarded with the sight of TIFFANY just disappearing at the far end of the first corridor. With a grimace, KIRSTY follows her in. 
118   INT.   CORRIDOR/LABYRINTH 
TIFFANY's skill at finding her way through puzzles means the GIRLS are soon in the murkier corridors close to the Centre. 
Hell seems angrier now, steam is issuing in jets from the corridor walls, the cries of children are heard faintly on the soundtrack, LEVIATHAN's breathing is more dominant, perhaps the light is even pulsing in time with it. 
KIRSTY is still several yards behind TIFFANY. TIFFANY takes a corner and is out of sight for a second or so . KIRSTY dashes around the corner to find TIFFANY staring with distress at something on the floor. 
It is the skin ripped off JULIA by the vacuum tunnel earlier. 
KIRSTY Oh, gross. 
TIFFANY bends down and retrieves the white diamond BOX from the empty fingers. 
KIRSTY What are you doing? What are WE doing? 
TIFFANY looks at the BOX in her hand. When she speaks, it is not to KIRSTY but to herself. 
TIFFANY I can't do it here. I have to go to it. 
119   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL 
LEVIATHAN spins and fires light in the centre, his machine-like breathing drowning all other sound. We are looking down the catwalk as KIRSTY and TIFFANY approach its edge. 
The beams of black light wash across their faces, as they passed over MALAHIDE's in the earlier scene. Images of horror freeze momentarily before them and then pass on, only to be replaced by others. 
TIFFANY I'm scared. 
KIRSTY No. Don't let it. You've come this far. 
The GIRLS press on. Whether LEVIATHAN is oblivious to their presence or simply doesn't consider them a threat, the beams stop striking the GIRLS' faces. Nevertheless, the mood remains ominous. The audience should feel something is about to happen. 
They are six feet from the lip of the catwalk. TIFFANY kneels and, holding the white diamond BOX in front of her, begins to move her fingers over it. The music box tune begins to play as the BOX begins to move. 
That 'something' that the audience was waiting to happen, suddenly does; MALAHIDE flies up from the abyss beside the catwalk. The vastness of the limb that seals him to LEVIATHAN is now directly apparent; instead of merging into black light, the limb itself trails through the air over the huge distance to LEVIATHAN itself. 
One of the limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies out and knocks the BOX from TIFFANY's hands. It rolls perilously close to the edge of the catwalk.

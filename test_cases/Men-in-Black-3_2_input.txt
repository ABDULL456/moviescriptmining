CASUALTY... HUMAN DEAD AT THE SCENE... 
ZED (O.S.) Ready to bring the pain? Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit. 
BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY 
Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become their bowling balls. It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk. We see shots of games in progress: An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane, it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins. 
The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins. A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins with his laser-eyes. We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE 
THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY -- Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia. 
ZED Where's Kay? We either roll or forfeit -- and I didn't put this on to forfeit! 
JAY Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we built you for. Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is better than Women." 
ROBOT 
(ROBOT VOICE) This is my time to shine. Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car alarm. 
ROBOT (CONT'D) There goes my perfect game. 
(ROBOT LAUGH) Ha ha ha. 
JAY Guess it's on me. Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a 
STRIKE! Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime! Jay looks around -- 
JAY (CONT'D) Of course -- the one time Kay isn't here... 
MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody who did some celebrating last night. We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB 
BOWLING TROPHY. 
JAY Check it out-- The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in fact AN ALIEN. 
TROPHY We're number one! In your face! Suck it! 
JAY Look who's league MVP. 
GUARD Big surprise, you win every year. That's weird... 
JAY I... huh? 
MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash talk. 
JAY Where are you, Kay? I think you want to see this. It's the bowling MVP trophy with MY name on it. Jay works his way to his desk. Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work, his back to Jay. 
JAY (CONT'D) Maybe you want to think twice next time you ditch me. Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer. 
JAY (CONT'D) Kay?

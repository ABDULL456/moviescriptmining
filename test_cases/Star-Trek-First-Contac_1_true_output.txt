GEORDI They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing? 
PICARD We're crossing the threshold! 
The ship is really SHAKING HARD now -- and the compartment is DISTORTING slightly, stretching, everything becoming elongated... 
230   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   230 
The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but this effect is much slower. It's on the verge of hitting warp speed. The Enterprise still on their tail. 
231   INT. BORG HIVE                                             231 
Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is studying the Borg console intently. Two Borg drones stand nearby, watching closely. 
DATA I believe I see the problem. 
In the blink of an eye: 
-- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet. 
-- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD. 
-- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of sparks. 
-- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill. But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion, he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across the room. 
232   NEW ANGLE                                                  232 
As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. A HUGE EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured tank. The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the entire Borg Hive. 
BORG QUEEN (screams) No! 
She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them! 
233   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   233 
As it GOES INTO WARP -- it shoots forward and streaks away from the Enterprise! 
234   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       234 
As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats and the stars WHIP PAST the windows in the familiar warp effect. 
235   INT. BORG HIVE                                             235 
Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each other amongst the spewing gas. The Borg drones try to get away, but they are SWALLOWED by the rush of gas, fall to the deck, twitching in pain. 
Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck, grappling with each other. 
236   EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP                                 236 
As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top speed. 
237   INT. BORG HIVE                                             237 
Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and skin. 
238   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       238 
As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably, Warp stars streaking by. 
PICARD Bring us about... 
A beat as Geordi works. 
GEORDI Dropping out of warp. 
Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be seen in the distance. 
They smile. It's a moment of victory. 
PICARD Let's begin the landing procedure. 
239   INT. CARGO BAY/BORG HIVE                                   239 
The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies, leaving only raw mechanical skeletons. 
MOVE TO REVEAL: 
240   DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN                                    240 
lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a shocking image: all of his human flesh has been STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him before -- raw and mechanistic. 
Data rolls over... still locked around him is the MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the very top of the spine.

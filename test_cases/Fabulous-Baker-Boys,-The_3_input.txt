JACK Nothing. 
SUSIE What'd I say? 
JACK Nothing. 
SUSIE You're upset. 
JACK I'm not upset. 
SUSIE All I said was you were good. 
JACK (stops) Look. You don't know good. All right? 
SUSIE What's that supposed to mean? 
JACK It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you. 
SUSIE You were good. 
JACK Let's make a deal.  You shut up. 
SUSIE You were good. 
JACK (exasperated) How do you know? 
SUSIE (yelling) Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit! 
Jack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment, they just stand on the corner, not talking. 
SUSIE (continuing) So you wanna get a drink? 
INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT 
JACK Nina? 
SUSIE Who's Nina? 
JACK Friend. 
SUSIE Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her. 
JACK She's four feet tall.  Ed? 
SUSIE Ed? How many people live here? 
Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at Susie.  Jack moves to the kitchen. 
JACK I have to make him some chili. Okay? 
SUSIE (a look) Sure. 
INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic as Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window, the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming. 
Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as if they were veils. 
SUSIE (at window) Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it. 
JACK How come you didn't close your eyes? 
She looks surprised by the question. 
SUSIE I don't know.  I guess I didn't trust the night like she did. 
Susie finishes her drink and sets it down. 
SUSIE (continuing) Let me have a cigarette, will you? All of mine are down there on the sidewalk. 
Jack looks at her curiously. 
SUSIE (continuing) Long story. 
Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it. 
SUSIE (continuing) You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt. 
JACK Must've been a cheap date. 
SUSIE Soap convention. 
JACK Soap? 
SUSIE Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ... (shaking her head) Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby. 
Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly. 
SUSIE (continuing) It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once. Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me four dozen roses. (almost wistful) But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed. Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie. (pause) I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ... 
Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She looks out the window again. 
SUSIE (continuing) Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up. 
She stares at the lights another moment, then turns and nods to the phone booth. 
SUSIE (continuing) So what's this? 
Jack frowns, takes another drink. 
JACK History. 
SUSIE Huh?

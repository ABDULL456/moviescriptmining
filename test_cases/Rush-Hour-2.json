The house making out okay? \nKenny follows as Carter opens a door to -- \nINT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very smokey and very crowded. \nCARTER (to Kenny) This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud voice, they all scream and run and shit. Watch.  It's real funny. \nKenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside. \nKENNY Come with me. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nKenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door. \nKENNY Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James. \nCARTER What??  Where'd you hear that? \nKENNY I got my sources. \nCARTER And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out. (beat) I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down. \nKENNY James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather? \nCARTER Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate. \nKENNY Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass. \nCARTER I'd like to see you try. \nKenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him -- countering Kenny's move. \nKENNY (to Lee) We're on, then. \nKenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence -- Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance. \nLEE (impressed) That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where did you learn that? \nThey switch to Chinese. \nKENNY Master Ching taught me. \nLEE The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing? \nKENNY No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw. \nLee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny. \nKENNY (CONT'D) What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck? \nLEE Baby Duck? \nKENNY That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up. \nCARTER I heard that. \nLee and Kenny laugh. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around. \n", "test1_true": "CARTER How'd you know? \nKENNY You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about. \nCARTER So tell me what you know. \nKENNY I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you? \nCARTER Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference. \nKenny considers this for a moment. \nCARTER (CONT'D) What? \nKENNY One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. \nLEE Do you still have the bills? \nKENNY I still have my lunch money from third grade. \nCARTER Lemme see 'em. \nKenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter checks it out. \nKENNY See.  It's perfect. \nCarter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it. \nKENNY (CONT'D) Whoa, what are you doing? \nKenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED. \nKENNY (CONT'D) (pissed off) I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza. \nCARTER All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now. \nCarter and Lee move for the door. \nKENNY You sure you guys don't want to stay and have a bite?

LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS \nCarter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the stairway -- coming almost face to face with -- \nHU LI \nWho has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is parked beside it. \nLee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out, putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink without getting mowed down. \n", "test1_id": 1116, "test2_input": "He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS. \nLEE Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have change for a twenty? \nThe GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a right cross. \nHu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife to Lee's throat. \nHU LI (in Chinese) Open your mouth. \nShe puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. She holds the detonator in her hand. \nHU LI (CONT'D) (continuing in Chinese) That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth into your brain. \nINT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nA crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him. \nCRAPS DEALER Winner six! \nCARTER How much is that? \nCRAPS DEALER Two-hundred thousand! \nCARTER Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars? \nCarter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Here, your highness, have a hundred dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight! \nGAMBLER (South African accent) I am not royalty, sir. \nCARTER Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit -- we probably cousins, man.  How much you got on the table? \nGAMBLER One million. \nCARTER Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who wants to blow on my hand for luck? \nCarter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady blows on my hand for luck? \nTEXAN (embarrassed) She's not my lady.  She's my niece. \nCARTER Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come on, baby, give me some luck. \nThe GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Nice blowing.  When's your next birthday, I'll be the cake. \nTEXAN Hey, buddy, watch yourself. \nCARTER Don't threaten me.  I got friends in this town that will bite off your ears.

And you hand them back absolutely nothing. \nRicky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the sight of Ricky Tan alive. \nRICKY TAN (CONT'D) Now that's a true American dream. Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a very greed driven US Customs agent. \nRicky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile. \nRICKY TAN (CONT'D) Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You know it didn't have to be like this. But it's too bad!  Like father, like son. \nLee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of the monitors. \nHU LI (in Chinese) He's going for the plates. \nRicky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE SUITE. \nRICKY TAN Look at this old fool, what does he think he's doing? \nRicky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee. \nRICKY TAN (CONT'D) It's almost impossible to find a partner that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't you agree, Lee? \nON ANOTHER SCREEN \nWe see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to Isabella as he goes. \nRICKY TAN (CONT'D) Well, at least you will die with honor. But choy Gien. \nSUBTITLES: \"Won't see you again.\" \nINT.

Somebody cash me out! \nSeveral TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table. \nPIT BOSS Sir, we'd like to escort you to the cashier. \nCARTER That would be great.  Don't want any of these rich white people to jump me. \nAs they walk toward the door marked \"VIP ROOM\", Carter glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit. \nINT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT \nRicky Tan turns to Hu Li. \nRICKY TAN Chai Hu Li. (\"Little Fox\") Have fun. \nRicky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee, plays with the button. \nHU LI (in Chinese) In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push this button. \nHu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls her gun. \nIsabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella. \nISABELLA It's time to end this, Inspector. \nIsabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and sticking the gun under her chin. \nISABELLA (CONT'D) Don't move!  United States Secret Service. \n", "test2_id": 1117, "test3_input": "Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't. \nRICKY TAN That's what I thought. \nTan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the plates hit him across the face and knock him down. \nTHE GUN IS LOOSE \nTan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when: \nLee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.

She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. This one twice the size of the one from earlier. \nHU LI (in Chinese) We'll go together, Inspector. \nCARTER Please tell me she just asked for a ride to the airport. \nHu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW. \nEXT.

They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE SIGN. \nIt's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD. \nLee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them. \nLEE I can't believe I flew ten-thousand miles for this shit!! \nThey lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.

{"train": "Rush Hour 2 \nRUSH HOUR 2 \nBY \nJeff Nathanson \nEXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING \nA smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and a half million people a day. \nEXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY \nTHE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. \nHU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET VENDOR across the street. \nShe pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first bite we see: \nTHE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER \nTWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball erupting over one side of the embassy. \nPeople panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned street vendor. \nHU LI (Chinese, subtitled) Someone better call the police. \nEXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best \"do me\" look to two girls in a convertible. \nCARTER (int Chinese) Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu. \nThe HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who is driving and singing to his radio. \nLEE (singing) ...wish they all could be California... wish they all could be California girls... \nCarter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it out of the SUNROOF. \nCARTER I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car. \nLEE That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD. \nCARTER Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor. \nLEE Those girls drove off because of you. \nCARTER All I did was invite them for a drink. \nLEE You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat. \nCARTER (checking Chinese-English dictionary) I said that?  Which word was \"goat?\" \nLee picks up his CD case. \nLEE You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two. \nCARTER Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu. \nLEE Mu-shu?  You're hungry? \nCARTER Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu! \nCarter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over LEE'S CELL PHONE. \nINTERCUT \nLee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he realizes he's hearing Carter belting out \"DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH.\" \nINT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS \nA room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open, watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a few of the smitten women who are watching him. \nLEE (whispering from side of stage) Carter, get off that stage! \nCARTER Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people! \nCarter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF. \nLEE This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover. \nCARTER I knew you were lying. \nLEE I'm sorry. \nCARTER Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. (beat) Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing. \nLEE No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open. \nCARTER Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar? \nLEE Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China. \nCARTER Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done. \nLEE No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto. \nCARTER You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night. \nBefore Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar. \nCARTER (CONT'D) (Chinese) Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang lui. \nNobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to Lee. \nCARTER (CONT'D) (whispering) What'd I say? \nLEE You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking. \nCARTER Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out. \nReluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese as Carter speaks, Lee translating. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go to that side, all fine ass women on this side. \nNobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Let's try this again.  Who here knows Ricky Tan, raise your hand. \nNobody moves. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand. \nNobody moves. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Now I know you're lying. \nThe crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage -- \nCARTER (CONT'D) (as they run out) I come back and catch y'all singing Michael Jackson and you're all going to jail. \nEXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT \nLee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI and several gangsters round a corner. \nCarter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in silence, bruised and covered in garbage. \nCARTER You lied to me. \nLEE I'm sorry. \nCARTER You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home. \nLEE No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed. \nCarter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck. \nCARTER So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew up the Embassy? \nEXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING \nLee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12 year olds are going through their warm up routines. \nMASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids. \nCARTER I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner. \nLEE This won't take long. \nMaster Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES. \nMASTER FU Dragon kick! \nLike well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD. \nMASTER FU (CONT'D) Lotus block! \nThe students YELL and form an \"X\" with their arms.  Master Fu notices Carter and Lee watching from the back. \nMASTER FU (CONT'D) Twisting Tiger! \nNo response.  The students exchange baffled looks. \nMASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D) (staring straight at Lee) Twisting Tiger! \nLee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in the glow... \n...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment. \nMASTER FU (CONT'D) Didn't I teach you to always arch your back? \nLEE (bowing, humbled) Yes, Master. \nWhile Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12 YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. \nCarter starts stretching his legs, warming up. \nCARTER I was watching you kids.  My name is Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree black belt.  At least that's what I tell the girls at the Holiday Health Spa where I work out. \nCarter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no reaction. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Let me give you kids some tips.  The key to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why don't you stand up. \nTHE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw punches. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show you how to block.  Come on, stand up, give me your best shot -- try to kick right to my head. \nThe kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION. \nCARTER (CONT'D) That's pretty good.  Which one of you kids did that? \nINT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS \nCARTER How you doin'? \nLEE My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time. \nHOSTESS Oh, you American? \nCARTER That's right. \nHOSTESS You bring American money? \nCARTER (holding up a Platinum AmEx) Never leave home without it. (to Lee) Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money. \nThe Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven. \nHOSTESS You get massage from Chinese girl before? \nCARTER No.  It's my first time. \nHOSTESS You pick any girl for you and your friend. \nCarter looks like a kid in a candy store. \nCARTER Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one. \nHOSTESS Oh yes, she's very nice. \nCARTER She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet. \nLee elbows Carter. \nLEE What are you doing? \nCARTER She said I could pick any girl I want. \nLEE Well, hurry up. \nCARTER Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line. \nHOSTESS (to Lee) Your friend have big appetite. (handing ROBES to Lee and Carter) Please put these on and wait upstairs in the quiet room. \nINT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY \nTWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the background. \nLee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink. \nCARTER Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come through, Lee. \nLEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality. \nCARTER (CONT'D) What's wrong? \nLEE Over there -- that's Ricky Tan. \nCARTER That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down. \nLEE This is a very dangerous man. \nCARTER I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat. \nLEE I'm calling for back up! \nLee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits. \nCarter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a decision, gets up and walks towards him. \nCARTER Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over for you.  Get up. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a 50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus. \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN This is still Hong Kong. \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people... \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other? \nSUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash can lid, Carter using a red construction cone. \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D) Who the hell is that? \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN (humiliated) That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation. \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee. \nINT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting on a suit and fixing his tie. Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from Lee's closet, then moves for the door. \nLEE Where are you going? \nCARTER Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home. \nLEE Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you. \nCARTER Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards. \nLEE Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit! \nCARTER My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords! \nLEE It's my job! \nCARTER You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date? \nLEE I have plenty of dates. \nCARTER Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat? \nLEE You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese. \nCARTER And you ain't black! \nThe two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half dressed. \nINT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nLee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin stands in the back. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service. \nLEE The Secret Service?  Why? \nSTERLING What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.  The men who were killed yesterday were not American translators. They were undercover U.S. customs agents trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. We don't know what they're transporting out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it got the agents killed. \nLEE How can we help? \nSTERLING Stay the hell out of our way. \nLEE I can get to Ricky Tan. \nSTERLING We know all about Tan.  That's why we're leaving him out there as bait.  We think this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads. \nMAN You wish to spank my sister with a ping pong paddle? \nCARTER No man, I was just asking... \nMAN Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake. \nAs the man walks into his store, Carter runs off. \nPause. \nCarter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see if it's worth staying... \nINT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY \nLee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin approaches. \nLEE All he wanted was some mu-shu. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN Are you okay, Lee? \nBeat. \nLEE I'm sorry, I have to go. \nEXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON \nCarter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a waiting Daimler. \nThe Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the street with a determined look on his face. \nCARTER I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi! \nCarter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat. \nINT. TAXI - EVENING \nThe CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo. \nCARTER (loud) Follow that limo. \nThe Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter. \nCARTER (CONT'D) You understand what I'm saying?  Follow that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This is a chase -- we are chasing that limo! (beat) We are still parked -- we're not moving! This is the opposite of chasing -- drive the car or I will kill you! \nThe driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash. \nCAB DRIVER Now you speak my language. INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY \nLee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in tribute to Carter. \nHis CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music. \nINTERCUT -- \nINT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to... \nLEE Did you tell Sterling? \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this. \nLEE Thank you. \nLee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC up, a man on a mission. \nEXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT \nCARTER That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan. \nISABELLA El Capitan? \nCARTER I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes. \nISABELLA Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called? \nCARTER Called?  What's my ship called? (he has no idea) Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson. \nISABELLA The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was \"Red Dragon.\" \nCARTER Red Dragon?  You sure about that? \nISABELLA I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party. \nCARTER Your friend's ship? (looking around) Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work. \nSTEVEN REIGN (taking seat next to Isabella) Who's your friend? \nISABELLA Somebody who got on the wrong yacht. \nCARTER Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong? \nSTEVEN REIGN (ushering away Isabella) I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights. \nISABELLA Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter. \nCarter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. Carter's watching. \nINT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the throat, pushing him against the wall. \nLEE Ricky Tan.  Where is he? \nBODYGUARD #1 Who's asking? \nLEE The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a detective today and he's not getting away with it.  Now where is he? \nCARTER Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or we'll kick your lying ass! \nLee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing right behind him. \nLEE Carter? \nCARTER Who died? \nLEE You. \nCARTER Detective Yu?  Never met him. \nLEE Not Yu.  You! \nCARTER Who? \nLEE Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? \nCARTER Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth. \nBODYGUARD #1 Get your hands in the air. \nLee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front of them with GUNS in hand. \nBODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D) Ricky Tan is expecting you. INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT \nIt looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom. \nIt's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED Hu Li with his leg. \nCARTER All right, get your hands up. \nHu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head. \nEXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS \nLee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and Bodyguard #2. \nINT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nCarter and Hu Li face off. \nCARTER You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give you a little LAPD ass kickin'. \nHu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows. \nINT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS \nLee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines. \nLEE Hu Li! \nLee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the moving boat. \nLee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the stern. EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS \nLee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time -- watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat. \nCarter turns his head, sees -- \n-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears back into the shadows. \nEXT. DOCK - NIGHT \nThe yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks. \nSterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock. \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation. \nCARTER What \"revenge\" is he talking about? \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that? \nCARTER Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- \nSPECIAL AGENT STERLING Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A. \nCARTER Fine with me. \nSterling walks away disgusted. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to fully cooperate with the Secret Service. \nLee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to approach. \nSUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D) (to police officers) Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- \nLEE I'll take him. \nCARTER Hell no. \nThe Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat. \nCARTER (CONT'D) (to Lee) Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to you. \nCARTER It sounds impossible -- \nLEE You said -- \nCARTER -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it. \nCarter turns, walks away without looking back. \nCARTER (CONT'D) You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane. \nLEE Why LA? \nCARTER (still not turning) I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one. INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT \nCarter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of doubt. \nLEE I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor... \nCARTER Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man. \nLEE Follow the Rich White Man? \nCARTER Almost, but you've got to say \"Rich White Man\" all run together like it's one word. \nLEE Follow the RichWhiteMan... \nCARTER Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign. \nLEE Who? \nCARTER Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked. \nLEE How do you know he's our man? \nCARTER Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like \"Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!! \nLEE You sound like that all the time. \nCARTER Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down. \nLEE Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic. \nCARTER Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off. \nLEE Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign. \nCARTER The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. (a tray arrives) Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear. \nBINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL \nCUT TO REVEAL -- \nCarter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars. \nLee standing next to him.  WE ARE: \nINT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT \nCartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack. \nBINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL \nTraveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the door. \nCarter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching. \nCARTER Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking? \nLEE I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice? \nCARTER What's going on? \nLee stares at Carter, looks dazed. \nLEE She's getting undressed. \nCARTER Gimme the binoculars. \nLEE No.  It's not right. \nCARTER Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you. \nLee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as Carter watches to the window. \nLEE What's she doing? \nCARTER Oh, sweet glory hallelujah... \nLEE I don't want to hear this. \nCARTER Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy. \nLEE Snoopy?  I love Snoopy. \nCARTER She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands. (to Lee) You better get that ice. \nLee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view. \nLEE That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing this! \nIsabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in bra and panties. \nCARTER This is our job.  We took an oath as police officers.  If we don't do this, who will?  Firemen? \nLee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees Isabella hang up the phone. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs? \nLEE What? \nCARTER She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick. \nLEE What is it? \nCARTER No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired... \nCLOSE ON ISABELLA \nAs she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom and puts on a robe. \nLEE I don't understand? \nCARTER She's walking back towards the door. \nBINOCULARS P.O.V. \nWe see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her hotel room talking with someone. \nCARTER (CONT'D) She opened the door.  Someone is delivering a package. \nBINOCULARS P.O.V. \nInside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Lee...it's the girl who delivered the package to your office.  It's a bomb! \nLEE Roof! \nEXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT \nLee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS. \nLEE Wait!  There's people down there! \nCARTER There's people up here! \nLEE Get it out of here! \nCARTER Take it! \nLee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package. \nISABELLA Get on your feet. \nLee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella begins to open the package. \nCARTER I wouldn't do that!!! \nLEE It's a bomb. \nIsabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nISABELLA You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction. \nCARTER Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now. \nISABELLA I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service. \nCARTER How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge. \nIsabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to her bra. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Let me see it again? \nLEE We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong. \nISABELLA I know who you are, Inspector Lee. \nLEE Then you know I'm not walking away from this case. \nCARTER Yeah, that's right. \nISABELLA We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite. \nINT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER \nISABELLA (she locks the door) Look, I've been working this case for months now... \nCARTER So what's your story? \nISABELLA They think I'm a crooked customs agent. \nLee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge. \nLEE Is this a payoff? \nISABELLA No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill? \nCARTER It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit. \nISABELLA It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses. \nCARTER How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses? \nHU LI (in Chinese) The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will be remembered for ridding the Triads of your petulance. \nHu Li savors the moment. \nCARTER I hope you just said I have no business being here, 'cos I was just leaving. \nCarter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him, freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks. \nISABELLA Hu Li, I think there's someone who will want to talk to them first. \nHu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun. \nBANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across the jaw with her fist. \nCARTER ...oh, that's a filling right there. That's gonna cost you. \nHu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards. \nHU LI Put them in the truck. \nThe WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck. \nCARTER I should kill you right now, but I'm gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine, and maybe you can be reformed. \nThe WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands. \nCARTER (CONT'D) No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck myself. \nAs Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun. \nEXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY \nThe eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway. \nEXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY \nThe truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it. \nINT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY \nLEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY. \nThey're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. Carter is flexing his battered body. \nLEE Are you okay? \nCARTER What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty. \nLEE She saved our lives. \nCARTER For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides. \nLee looks disappointed. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her. \nLEE Shhh, my head hurts. \nCARTER I'm about to be killed and you \"Shhh\" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you. \nLEE Why did you help me? \nCARTER It doesn't matter. \nLee thinks about this for a BEAT. \nLEE I'm not used to having a partner. \nLEE Let's go. \nCARTER Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out. \nLEE What is Mac out? \nCARTER Follow me my Asian brother. \nCarter and Lee start to walk away. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Just stay down wind, because I think you stepped in some serious rat shit down there. \nEXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT \nLee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store. \nINT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS \nAs they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them. \nSALESMAN May I help you gentlemen? \nCarter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of superbills. \nCARTER Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this body but pure silk.  And get my partner something from the children's department. \nCarter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder. \nSALESMAN Would your partner like silk as well?  I personally like it when a couple matches. \nCarter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder. \nCARTER Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case. \nLEE Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us. \nSALESMAN I'm sure all the boys are chasing you two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys the bell of the ball. \nHe WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee. \nCARTER This is the last time I go shopping with you. \nEXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT \nLee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. Le is awkward in \"player\" guise. \nCARTER (whispering) Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You own the place. \nCarter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as they walk through the doors. \nLEE I own the place. \nINT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS \nCarter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT BUDDHA -- \nCARTER That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell. \nLEE Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune. \nCARTER Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia. \nThey are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle. \nRICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around the perimeter - a sign reads: \nSIGN $50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER! \nISABELLA (CONT'D) Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there. \nLEE Why don't you go get them? \nISABELLA If I'm wrong then my cover is blown. \nINT. CASINO - NIGHT \nAs Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug. \nCARTER Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot. \nSTEVEN REIGN Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong. \nCARTER Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz... \nSTEVEN REIGN Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here? \nCARTER You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius. \nSTEVEN REIGN You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house. \nReign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave. \nINT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nLee is dancing close with Isabella. \nISABELLA The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in. \nLEE How do I know I can trust you? \nISABELLA Dip me! \nLee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT. \nISABELLA (CONT'D) I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service? \nLEE No. (beat) But I'll help you. \nLee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor. \nCARTER Lee, what the hell are you doing? \nLEE Dancing? \nCARTER Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend? \nLEE It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room. \nLee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD standing in front of a small door. \nCARTER Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again! \nLEE No.  I'm going to find out. \nCARTER Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction. \nCarter looks around the casino. \nCARTER (CONT'D) I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move. \nLEE Try to keep them busy for five minutes. \nCARTER I'll give it my best shot. INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nCarter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare. \nHe turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS. \nLEE Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have change for a twenty? \nThe GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a right cross. \nHu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife to Lee's throat. \nHU LI (in Chinese) Open your mouth. \nShe puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. She holds the detonator in her hand. \nHU LI (CONT'D) (continuing in Chinese) That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth into your brain. \nINT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nA crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him. \nCRAPS DEALER Winner six! \nCARTER How much is that? \nCRAPS DEALER Two-hundred thousand! \nCARTER Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars? \nCarter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Here, your highness, have a hundred dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight! \nGAMBLER (South African accent) I am not royalty, sir. \nCARTER Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit -- we probably cousins, man.  How much you got on the table? \nGAMBLER One million. \nCARTER Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who wants to blow on my hand for luck? \nCarter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady blows on my hand for luck? \nTEXAN (embarrassed) She's not my lady.  She's my niece. \nCARTER Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come on, baby, give me some luck. \nThe GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Nice blowing.  When's your next birthday, I'll be the cake. \nTEXAN Hey, buddy, watch yourself. \nCARTER Don't threaten me.  I got friends in this town that will bite off your ears. Just sit tight, because I've got the dice and I am on fire! \nCarter throws the dice. \nCRAPS DEALER Winner, seven! \nThe table erupts as Carter grabs the dice. \nCARTER Let it ride! INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room. \nINT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nFORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features. \nHu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator -- the TWO WOMEN fight around it. \nLee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when: \nTHE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR \nThey're about to move in. \nHU LI Get the detonator! \nThe Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet, KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her. \nOne of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his back. \nHu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM. \nLee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW. \nINT. CASINO - CASHIER \nTwo security guards lead Carter away from the table when: \nCRASH! \nAn AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor. \nThe NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including: \nCARTER Lee!! \nThe guards restrain him. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Lemme ask you something.  Any of you ever felt $500,000 before? \nHe SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying as the GUARDS hit the floor. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Doesn't feel so good, does it? \nINT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW. \nINT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS \nOn his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the detonator on her rounds. \nPanicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it, but he does see: \nACROSS THE CASINO \nCarter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at bay with a croupier stick. \nCARTER Black man gets on a hot streak and you're all trippin'? \nCarter and Lee see each other.  They have the same simultaneous though: \nCARTER (CONT'D) (help!) Lee! \nLEE (help!) MMMMMM!!!! \nCarter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way is the HIGH WAY. \nLee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller -- landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other side. \nCarter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in the Sky Room.  He grins. \nCARTER Check it out.  Catfight! \nHu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her. \nCARTER (CONT'D) You go after Ricky.  I got this. \nLEE Carter... \nCARTER Just GO! \nLee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes short work of them, and races toward the elevators. \nDEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF! \nEach readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches, flexes, ready to sting like a bee. \nCARTER (CONT'D) I'm not gonna hold you back this time just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna pretend you're a man. \nShe pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her undershirt. \nCARTER (CONT'D) A very beautiful man with a perfect body who I'd like to take to the movies. \nShe takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND like a master. \nCARTER (CONT'D) I may have been absent the day we went over this in karate class. \nQuick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him. \nINT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT \nLee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND cuts through, parting the doors. \nIt's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder. \nLEE Are you okay? \nISABELLA I'm fine. \nShe steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down. \nLEE I didn't know which side you were on. \nISABELLA Now you know. \nDING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY - the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and steps into the elevator. \nISABELLA (CONT'D) I'll try to get backup.  Be careful. \nThe elevator doors close. INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nSteven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan. \nRICKY TAN American's love to gamble.  Don't they, Mr. Reign? \nSTEVEN REIGN I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm leaving. \nRICKY TAN And my plates? \nSTEVEN REIGN They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't have a problem with that. \nReign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and starts to walk toward the door. \nRICKY TAN I enjoyed that little story you told about the Dragon and the treasure.  My mother used to tell it to me all the time.  Do you know the moral of that story, Mr. Reign? \nSTEVEN REIGN Greed will imprison us all. \nTan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife. \nRICKY TAN I hate that fortune cookie shit. \n", "test1_input": "CARTER Kenny!  How you doin'? \nKenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance. \nCARTER (CONT'D) How's the action tonight?  The house making out okay? \nKenny follows as Carter opens a door to -- \nINT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very smokey and very crowded. \nCARTER (to Kenny) This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud voice, they all scream and run and shit. Watch.  It's real funny. \nKenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside. \nKENNY Come with me. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nKenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door. \nKENNY Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James. \nCARTER What??  Where'd you hear that? \nKENNY I got my sources. \nCARTER And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out. (beat) I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down. \nKENNY James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather? \nCARTER Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate. \nKENNY Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass. \nCARTER I'd like to see you try. \nKenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him -- countering Kenny's move. \nKENNY (to Lee) We're on, then. \nKenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence -- Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance. \nLEE (impressed) That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where did you learn that? \nThey switch to Chinese. \nKENNY Master Ching taught me. \nLEE The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing? \nKENNY No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw. \nLee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny. \nKENNY (CONT'D) What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck? \nLEE Baby Duck? \nKENNY That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up. \nCARTER I heard that. \nLee and Kenny laugh. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around. \n", "test1_true": "CARTER How'd you know? \nKENNY You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about. \nCARTER So tell me what you know. \nKENNY I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you? \nCARTER Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference. \nKenny considers this for a moment. \nCARTER (CONT'D) What? \nKENNY One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. \nLEE Do you still have the bills? \nKENNY I still have my lunch money from third grade. \nCARTER Lemme see 'em. \nKenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter checks it out. \nKENNY See.  It's perfect. \nCarter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it. \nKENNY (CONT'D) Whoa, what are you doing? \nKenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED. \nKENNY (CONT'D) (pissed off) I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza. \nCARTER All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now. \nCarter and Lee move for the door. \nKENNY You sure you guys don't want to stay and have a bite?

A LIMO is parked beside it. \nLee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out, putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink without getting mowed down. \n", "test2_input": "CARTER As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice. \nLEE I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something? \nCARTER That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims? \nLEE They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head. \nCARTER Go ahead.  Sing your ass off. \nLee clears his voice. \nLEE Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world...and if you did, was she crying, crying...hey! \nEXT.

HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER. \nINT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS \nCarter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up, takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They start prying the crate open. \nCARTER Very nice. \nLEE It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike. \nCARTER I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box. \nCarter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about $1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee. \nCARTER (CONT'D) Hello, Benjamin. \nLEE Who's Benjamin? \nCARTER Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity. \nLEE A Chinese man discovered electricity. \nCARTER No Chinese man discovered electricity. \nLEE Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle. \nCARTER Now that I believe. \nCarter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him. \nCARTER (CONT'D) You never know.  Besides, I always wanted to die rich. \nThe truck lurches. \nLEE We're slowing down.  This must be it. \nCARTER End of the line. \nLEE You've been a good friend, James Carter. \n", "test2_true": "LEE You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy. \nCARTER Don't you talk about my mama.

Except for boxes of money, the truck bed is EMPTY. \nTwo soldiers enter the truck bed. \nANGLE UP TO REVEAL \nLee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers. \nLee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers to the ground.  In the next instant: \nON LEE \nstill holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips onto the roof of the truck. \nON CARTER \nwho swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to use a shield as gunfire erupts. \nLee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN the first two guards. \nCarter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like the closest way out: \nA LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel. \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nLee and Carter run through - it extends out from the underground loading docks. \nLEE This way.

The richest of the rich are making their way inside. \n", "test3_input": "Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't. \nRICKY TAN That's what I thought. \nTan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the plates hit him across the face and knock him down. \nTHE GUN IS LOOSE \nTan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when: \nLee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM SQUARE IN THE CHEST. \nTan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.

She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. This one twice the size of the one from earlier. \nHU LI (in Chinese) We'll go together, Inspector. \nCARTER Please tell me she just asked for a ride to the airport. \nHu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.

A HUGE TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them. \nLEE I can't believe I flew ten-thousand miles for this shit!! \nThey lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE STRETCH LIMO. INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS \nLee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH when they realize they're alive! \nCARTER We made it, man. \nLEE No problem. \nLee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a night on the town. \nVERSACE SALESMAN Well, there is a God after all. \nLee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of the hotel. \nLIMO DRIVER Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel. \nIn front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS. \n", "test3_true": "INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT \nLee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane, Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling. \nCARTER I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back. \nLEE She's going home to New York.  I need some ice. \nLee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane. \nCARTER That your gate down there? \nLEE Yes. \nCARTER I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye. \nLEE I guess so.  Thank you, Carter. \nCARTER You take care of yourself, Lee. \nCarter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away. \nLEE Carter, wait.  There's something I want you to have. \nLee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter. \nCARTER Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this. \nLEE It's okay.  I can finally let it go. \nCarter takes the badge.  Smiles. \nCARTER In that case, I got something for you. I picked it up at the hotel. \nCarter pulls out a WAD OF CASH. \nLEE What is this? \nCARTER About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables. \nLEE No, Carter.  I can't take this. \nCARTER It's okay, I got lots more. \nCarter pulls out another wad of cash. \nCARTER (CONT'D) They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do. \nLEE This money is evidence. \nCARTER Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want. \nLee looks back toward Isabella. \nLEE I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play. \nCARTER New York City? \nLEE First class. \nCARTER The Plaza Hotel? \nLEE A little Mu-shu. \nCARTER Some Kung-Pao? \n"}

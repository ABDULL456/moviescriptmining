CONTINUED: 
BOY. What would you do if I died? 
MAN. If you died I'd want to die too. 
BOY. So you could be with me? 
MAN. So I could be with you, yes. But that's not going to happen. They look at each other a moment, unsure, the BOY shivering and sick-looking. The BOY lies down and shuts his eyes. The MAN puts a blanket over him. The MAN walks away a few paces and coughs endlessly, a nagging cough that won't go. 
EXT. ORCHARD - DAY 
THE MAN'S DREAM - a dream and a memory of an early summer day, the MAN and the WOMAN are in an orchard, lying in the sun on a picnic blanket, an array of food, bread, fruit and wine beside them. The MAN lies back and the WOMAN cradles his head in her lap, stroking his brow. She brings her face down and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids, then on each of his lips. POV MAN - the WOMAN's face, smiling a dazzling, radiant smile, framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves and blossom and petals against the sky - to him she is angelic. Then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too - their ritual caress. 
END OF DREAM SEQUENCE. 
EXT. ROADSIDE DUNES, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAWN 
The MAN awakes distressed, he wipes a tear, blinks in confusion. POV MAN - the BOY is kneeling beside him, watching him calmly, no longer sweating and shivering, recovered. 
BOY. Papa? The MAN rouses himself, sits up and just stares at the BOY, amazed, as if he has arisen from the grave 
MAN. How are you feeling? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOY. I feel kind of weird. 
MAN. Are you hungry? 
BOY. Just thirsty. The MAN gets up and fetches water from a ferry can in the trolley, pours a cup, hands it to the BOY who drinks thirstily. The MAN reaches out and strokes the BOY's hair as he drinks. 
EXT. RESORT TOWN, OUTSKIRTS - DAY 
The MAN and the BOY head towards a seaside town off in the distance. 
EXT. RESORT TOWN - DAY 
They enter a small beach resort with a faded "Welcome" sign across the road, the BOY holding the MAN's hand now. 
EXT. RESORT TOWN/WATER'S EDGE - DAY 
They are down by the water. Small pleasure boats are half sunken in the grey water. Faded colored bunting and painted signs advertise ICE CREAMS, FOOD and a FUN FAIR. The BOY helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they can go no further, they stop and drop onto the sand, exhausted. 
BOY. Can I tell you something? 
MAN. Yes. 
BOY. You tell me I shouldn't cry but I've heard you crying. I hear you coughing and crying to yourself in the night when you think I'm asleep. 
MAN. What of it? 
BOY. So if I shouldn't cry you shouldn't cry either. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: They look at each other. 
EXT. PORT - LATE AFTERNOON 
On the port side of town the MAN wheels the trolley through the deserted docks past rotten piers, a row of empty wooden warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed up. He is COUGHING and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls. The BOY is trailing a few paces behind, they're not speaking now. 
EXT. BACK STREET - EVENING 
As they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the MAN slows down to let the BOY catch up. But the BOY is now studying the ground intently. He bends down and picks up: POV BOY - an old cardboard match box, it's decals faded. He pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved Beetle. 
BOY. What is it? 
MAN. It's a Beetle. Suddenly the beetle twitches, then activates its wings and flies out of the box with a BUZZ and upwards into the sky... The BOY and the MAN stare up at the flying creature, amazed

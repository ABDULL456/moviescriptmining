SCHUYLER (grabbing him) I can't!  Listen to me-- 
DAVID Fuck you! 
David SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his BLEEDING nose.  David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the Japanese Tea Garden. 
SCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of breath, calling after David, who's vanished.  He leans against a tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE from his pocket.  He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it, emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE... 
He pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE.  He decides not to pick it up, looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward civilization.  He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it.  He moves faster, freaked.  At the edge of the park, he snatches one up-- 
SCHUYLER (on phone) What have you done to my brother, you bastards?!  This is over, I'm not playing anymore-- (beat) Hello, is anyone there-- 
PHONE VOICE If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help-- 
SCHUYLER slams the phone down.  He dabs his nose one more time, tosses the paper scrap into the trash. 
CLOSE ON SCRAP-- "CRS" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD... 
SCENE 75 DELETED 
76(NEW).  E X T .   F U L T O N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 
POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park.  The car suddenly MOVES FORWARD-- 
WITH SCHUYLER.  He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand for a cab, which pulls up instantly.  He climbs in. 
77.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 
An aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back. 
SCHUYLER Six three six Mission, please. 
The cabbie nods and hits the gas. 
78.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 
The cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters. 
79.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the windows are wet and fogged.  Then he looks out, narrows his eyes and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION. 
SCHUYLER You're heading the wrong way. 
CABBIE (filter) Relax, pal, you'll get where you're going. 
The cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment.  He appears to be wearing a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing into his shirt.  And there's something familiar about his face. Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat-- 
CLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new hairdo.  The COMPANY NAME-- "CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS."  CRS. 
SCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry. 
SCHUYLER Why are you doing this-- 
CABBIE/RASTA (filter) We do it all for you!  We're the best friends you got, no one ever worked so hard to make you feel alive... but you gotta let it happen... 
The cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT.  SCHUYLER tries the doorhandle-- it doesn't work. 
80.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T 
The cab PEELS OUT when the light turns green, heads for a pier. 
81.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler looks around in increasing panic. 
SCHUYLER What the fuck is this-- 
CABBIE/RASTA Have a nice day... 
The cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the MOVING CAB-- 
82.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T 
The cabbie/rasta hits the ground and ROLLS in a perfect stunt fall. The cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and-- 
--GOES FLYING off the edge into the San Francisco Bay, illuminated by SPOTLIGHTS from the end of the wharf. 
83.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler SCREAMS as the cab plunges and HITS the water. 
84.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 
The STEAMING cab's nose slowly DIPS below the surface. 
85.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 
FILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead.  EERIE LIGHT from the front of the cab.  Schuyler tries to roll down the window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens. 
86.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 
The cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES. 
87.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T

VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols, opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans, passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the cops in the studio. 
Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off of his chest and head. 
Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of gunsmoke in the room. 
As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little, then falls backwards with a mighty THUD. 
Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and pulls something out -- Jesse's heart. 
Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head rolls back -- he's dead. 
Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio, revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan turns out the light, Lizzy asks: 
LIZZY You forgot to check under the bed. 
Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed -- nada. 
MEAGAN No monsters here. 
LIZZY But what if they come back? 
MEAGAN Then we'll just have to kick their ass again. 
Lizzy giggles. 
LIZZY I love you, Meagan. 
MEAGAN I love you too. Go to sleep. 
INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up to her from the bottom of the staircase. 
MEAGAN'S DAD Meagan? 
Meagan looks down at her parents. 
MEAGAN Yes, dad? 
MEAGAN'S DAD Your mom and I... well, we want to thank you for saving your sister's life... we know you went through a lot. 
MEAGAN'S MOM We're going to be there for you from now on... for both of you! And that nice lawyer we hired for you said he thinks he can get all the charges dropped... except maybe for the grave robbing and human desecration ones. 
MEAGAN'S DAD Everything is going to be fine. 
MEAGAN I know... 
MEAGAN'S MOM And I'm going to get sober... 
MEAGAN'S DAD We're going to be a normal, happy family again. 
MEAGAN I know... 
MEAGAN'S MOM Goodnight, sweetheart. 
MEAGAN Goodnight mom... goodnight dad. 
MEAGAN'S DAD Goodnight, Meagan. 
INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers, when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up. 
MEAGAN Hello? 
FREDDY (filtered) I'll be seeing you in your dreams... 
Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the phone down. 
MEAGAN (sighs) I know...

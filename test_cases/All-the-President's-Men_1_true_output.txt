CUT TO: 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN heading toward the office. As they enter-- 
BRADLEE I got Clawsen on hold-- 
WOODWARD --his dialing finger must be falling off-- 
BRADLEE --what do you think?-- 
WOODWARD --he went to her apartment and he told her-- 
BERNSTEIN --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows. 
BRADLEE I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts. (calling out to his SECRETARY) Put him on. (picks up the phone) Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid? (pause) Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled. (pause) A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken. (pause) Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP--BRADLEE. He is genuinely enjoying himself. Now, he puts his hand over the receiver-- 
BRADLEE It's like they taught us at Harvard: few things are as gratifying to the soul as having another man's nuts in a vise... 
Now, as he goes back to talking-- 
CUT TO: 
A BIG HEADLINE IN THE POST READING: NIXON AIDES SABOTAGED DEMOCRATS. 
Now we HOLD on that headline as the three deniers are visible through it in the same places they spoke before. 
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN The story is based entirely on hearsay and-- 
CREEP P.R. MAN --we at the Committee are continually amazed at the creativity shown by the Washington Post-- 
WESTERN SENATOR --although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I am happy that this latest onslaught against the intelligence of the American people will be wrapping fish tomorrow. I offer my condolences to the fish... 
And now, the headline fades as we 
CUT TO: 
SIMONS IN ROSENFELD'S OFFICE 
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN hurry in. 
ROSENFELD Speak. 
BERNSTEIN We've just been talking to Young-- 
SIMONS --which Young? 
WOODWARD Larry Young, a California lawyer-- 
BERNSTEIN --he was going to go into law practice with Segretti. 
ROSENFELD And?-- 
WOODWARD --and he says Chapin hired Segretti-- 
SIMONS --well and good, but when will he say it on the record. 
WOODWARD He just did. 
BERNSTEIN He'll give us a sworn statement. 
WOODWARD We're inside the White House now. 
ROSENFELD and SIMONS just look at each other. They should be happy, and maybe they are. But at the moment more then anything else they look scared... HOLD. Then-- 
THE MONTPELIER ROOM OF THE MADISON HOTEL. 
It's a very fancy restaurant and BRADLEE is at a corner table as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sit down. They are exhausted. 
BRADLEE Look, I wanted to talk because things are getting really hairy and there's a couple of things we've got to be careful of because-- 
A waiter is nearby. 
BRADLEE --either of you want a drink or should I order?-- (They don't) --because-- 
And suddenly he lapses into perfect French with the waiter, ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes 
BRADLEE --because our cocks are on the chopping block and you've got to be sure that you're not just dealing with people who hate Richard Nixon and want to get him through us. You see, I don't give a shit who's President--I really don't, it's an adversary situation between them and us and it's always gonna be. I never had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy and once I printed something that pissed him off and for seven months I didn't exist. 
A wine steward appears, hands BRADLEE the list. As he examines it, a man walks up to the table, stands there... 
MAN You none of you know who I am, do you? (they don't) You screw me up good, you don't even know what I look like. 
BRADLEE OK, you've had your preamble; who the hell are you? 
MAN Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last week, you said I was one of the guys at the Committee who was sent reports. You were wrong.

SALESMAN #1 Or I could go. Whatever. 
CINDY Are you sure? 
SALESMAN #1/SALESMAN #2 Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show you the case it comes with too. The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the back to find the other guitar. Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks out the front door with it. 
EXT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off. 
INT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat, disappointed, before they realize what just happened. 
SALESMAN #1 Oh shit!... 
(FRANTICALLY LOOKING 
AROUND) 
THE GIBSON! They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone. 
INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY 
Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in, excited. 
BRIAN You're not gonna believe this. Remember the guy from General Mills that called a while back? Talking like he wanted to buy us out? 
JOEL I thought you said he wasn't serious; he was just sniffing around. 
BRIAN Yeah, well he's serious now. He just made an offer -- I mean a real offer this time. 
JOEL You're kidding.

JOEL Wow... Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking down on the production floor. 
JOEL I could unload all this... I could probably retire... 
BRIAN I mean, yeah, there's a lot of details to work out, but this could be great. They'll be calling back next week, what should I tell them? Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded, shaking her head. 
JOEL Tell 'em hell yes. 
INT. MANUFACTURING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
Mary sits with her arms folded, refusing to hold the line. 
MARY I already warned him. This is the last time. I'm just gonna sit here. In SLOW MOTION, we see: 
- The first box falls off the end of the assembly line, bottles shatter. - Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle. - A forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a huge stack of pallets to fall off. - Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion. - Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the pallets land on a bunch of pipes and high-pressure valves which burst open sending a piece of shrapnel flying across the room heading straight for - STEP'S CROTCH. The shrapnel heads straight for his genitalia, as we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY 
Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch. ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head.

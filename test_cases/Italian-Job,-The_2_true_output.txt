It soars but with a slight downward trajectory... 
Towards a large window on the top floor... 
Then lower... 
And the look on the driver's face says it all as... 
The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of the building, just below the window. 
The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH through the window as -- 
A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the LAPD chopper and -- 
INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA 
The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass shards. 
I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER 
Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING THROB, the injured chopper banks away. 
INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY 
PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY 
She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari. 
Just a Jeep Wrangler back there. 
Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET 
Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans. 
She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets out and hands the cargo loader a ticket. 
EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT 
The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system. 
Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly picking up speed. 
INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT 
The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets their attention. 
CHARLIE I want to make a toast. Cause there's somebody missing here today, and we all know who it is. 
They all raise their glasses. 
CHARLIE To John Bridger. The most brilliant master planner of them all. We wish he was with us. 
We PAN ACROSS their faces. It's been a three year odyssey for them. They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved. 
ALL OF THEM To John. 
Clink. 
INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT 
OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside... 
And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. It's safe. 
He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case. 
It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic face of a Balinese girl on each one. 
Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold. 
These bricks are real. 
But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

Dwayne nods, seriously. 
DWAYNE You know, there's a reason I sleep 'til noon everyday. And it ain't 'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of me having so many goddamn dreams. Big ones. And once that money's mine, they're all gonna come true. 
Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative. 
DWAYNE Like I had this one dream last night. I was cruising through town in a Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt. There was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me. And in the back seat, Jay...was you. Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys. 
JAY Wow. I didn't know you dreamt about me, Dwayne. 
DWAYNE It was only this once, Jay. To be honest, I didn't know what to make of it. So I consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you're my road dog. You got my back. (MORE) 
DWAYNE (CONT'D) That's why I want to make you my partner. 
JAY In what? 
DWAYNE In crime. And business. You see, it ain't just about the inheritance money. It's about what I'm gonna do with it. 
Dwayne leans across the table. 
DWAYNE I'm about to clue you in on something. And then you'll understand the true magnitude of what's at stake here. Are you ready? 
JAY Yes. I'm totally ready. 
DWAYNE Then answer me this...what's this town missing? I'll give you a hint. It's a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches. 
JAY (BEAT) A Chinese food restaurant? 
DWAYNE No. A tanning salon. (BEAT) Think about it. All that green. All that brown flesh. 
Jay nods, thinking about. He smiles. 
DWAYNE It's also the perfect front for a prostitution ring. 
JAY Yeah, of course. Because of the booths. 
DWAYNE Yes. And because of the bitches. (BEAT) It can all be ours. 30 percent for you, 70 percent for me. You just gotta help me out here. 
Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover. 
DWAYNE I'm starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you. Maybe you sitting behind me doesn't mean you're my road dog. Maybe it means you're plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass. 
JAY That's crazy. I'd never do something like that. The dream book was right! 
Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing... 
JAY Ok. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting him or anything. I'll hold him while you shoot him. That's it. 
Dwayne chuckles. 
DWAYNE Here's a fact: they don't build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots. Shit, they got three different types of CSI on TV, just laying out how the police do their business...and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself. (BEAT) If you wanna be a millionaire, you gotta think like one. And millionaires don't kill people. They hire assassins. Which I did. We gotta pay him on Tuesday. 
JAY What? Why would you do that? 
DWAYNE I was presented with an opportunity. I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal. 
JAY But we don't have that kinda money. 
DWAYNE Now we're addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause once we get that, we get the million. (MORE) 
DWAYNE (CONT'D) And once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it. 
JAY I guess we could just...rob a bank. One of these local banks with nothing but a dipshit security guard. 
DWAYNE Again, not quite thinking like a millionaire. 
JAY Okay, then let's hire someone to rob a bank. 
Dwayne thinks about this for a second. 
DWAYNE Fuck hiring them, we could just force someone to rob a bank for us. Like with blackmail, or death threats, or - 
JAY (ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY) A bomb. Everyone's scared of a bomb. 
DWAYNE I was gonna say hypnotism...but I like that. It's out of the fucking box. We just strap one to some motherfucker's chest, like we did to those watermelons. Think you can you build some kinda bomb vest? 
JAY Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it in caves. I got a garage workshop. 
DWAYNE I'm pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it. And the beauty of it is: we don't lose any sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.

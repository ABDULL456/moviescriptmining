INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING 
A0 As he watches the security feed of River's fight his image becomes a vidscreen. He's addressing Wash, Mal and Zoe. We intercut between the two spaces: 
MR UNIVERSE Oh, this is good. This is... 
(GIGGLES) .she's beating up all the burly men and I'm having a catharsis, it's happening right now, you guys always bring me the very best violence. You think you're in a hot place? 
WASH That's what we're looking to learn. Is there any follow up, a newswave... 
MR UNIVERSE There is no "news", there's the truth of the signal, what I see, and there's the puppet theatre the V0 Parliament's jesters foist on the somnambulant public. Monkey taught to say the word "monkey" -- lead story on 32 planets. But the slum riots on Hera, not a -- 
MAL What about this? Did this make the... puppet theatre? 
MR UNIVERSE No sir. And no lawforce flags, either -- I hadda go into the security feed direct... 
MAL You can do that? 
MR UNIVERSE Can't stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere and I go everywhere. Security feeds are a traipse to access -- and I wasn't the first one in, this has prints on it -- oh! Look at her go! A0 Everyone is getting bruises and contusions. Contoooosions. 
ZOE (to Mal, over that) So somebody else has been fed this. That doesn't like me too well. 
MR UNIVERSE Zoe, you sultry minx, stop falling in love with me. You're just gonna embarrass yourself. I have a commitment to my Lovebot, it was a very beautiful ceremony, Lenore wrote her own vows, I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby. (re: screen) And she falls asleep. Which, she would be sleepy. 
J 
MAL Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her... Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it, looking at it. She whispers the word, "Miranda", and starts to move away. 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) Miranda...? Go back further. 
MR UNIVERSE No.. He pulls another screen close, starts working that one. Matching timecodes, he pulls up the commercial. 
MAL Um... please? Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as 
(NON-MATRIXY) well -- and it starts breaking down, bursts of code showing through. As he does so: 
MR UNIVERSE Friends and potential lovers, I 
4DO have good news and I have the other kind. Good is you're very smart. Someone is talking to her. 
WASH The oaty bar? 
MAL Subliminal. It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her. 
MR UNIVERSE 
(NODDING) I been seeing this code pop up all over, last few weeks. And I cannot crack it. It's Alliance and it's high military, so here then is the bad. Someone has gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend. And found her they have. Mal, Zoe and Wash look at each other. 
MR UNIVERSE 
(CONTINUING) Do you all know what it is you're carrying?

INT. STORAGE LOCKER - NIGHT 
River stares at us, impassive, as the camera pulls away from her to reveal Simon, who is cleaning blood off her face. 
RIVER They're afraid of me. 
SIMON I'm sorry... 
RIVER They should be. What I will show them... Oh God... She starts tearing up, breathing faster... Simon runs his hands through her hair. 
SIMON It's okay, it's okay... 
RIVER (somewhere else) Show me off like a dog, old men covered in blood, it never touched them but they're drowning in it... so much loss... I don't know what I'm saying. I never know what I'm saying... 
SIMON You said something. When you were triggered, do you remember? The Captain saw you say something on the feed... 
RIVER Miranda. 
SIMON Miranda.

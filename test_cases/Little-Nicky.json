{"test1_input": "CASSIUS Got ya! \nNICKY (picking up his head) Yes, you got me... \nNicky's head slams back down again. \nCASSIUS Got ya, again! \nNICKY (picking head up) Got me for sure, yes... \nHe grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head. \nCASSIUS Got ya!  Now here's the big finish... \nNicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch. \nNICKY Oh no.  Please Cassius... \nNicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer until it latches on to Nicky's crotch. \nNICKY (CONT'D) Aaaaah. \nCassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them. \nDAD What are you boys doing? \nCassius releases Nicky's hand. \nNICKY Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the furniture. \nDAD Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind? \nCASSIUS I forgot. \nDAD Maybe this will help you remember. \nDad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor. \nDad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of confidence and power. \nDAD (CONT'D) Now everybody sit down. \nNICKY Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape.  I really think it's a masterpiece. \nDAD Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later. \nHe leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad closes the curtains. \nNicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons. \nDAD (CONT'D) My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne... \nConfused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand. \nDAD (CONT'D) ...to step aside. (Nicky lowers his hand) ...and let me become the ruler of hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness.  So I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me. \nJimmy the Demon walks in. \nJIMMY THE DEMON Knock, knock. \nDAD Yes, Jimmy. \nHe whispers in Dad's ear. \nDAD (CONT'D) No, no, that's not what I said.  He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go. \nJIMMY THE DEMON (turning to leave) Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock. \nDad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention back to his sons. \nDAD This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons.  I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And Nicky, so...so... \nNICKY Don't worry about coming up with anything.  It's cool. \nDAD Such a sweet boy.  But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me. \nCASSIUS AND ADRIAN (dumbfounded) What!? \n", "test1_true": "They all look at Nicky. \nNICKY (CONT'D) I mean...tough break. \nDAD The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil.  And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time. \nCASSIUS Dad!  This is Hoyashit. \nDad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch. \nDAD Right.  Right.  Send him in. (to the boys) I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back to work. \nNicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops. \nADRIAN You sure about this decision, Dad? \nDAD I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do. \nHITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by Jimmy.  They head towards the closet. \nInside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head \"no.\"  Dad walks over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple. Dad nods \"yes.\"  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit... \nCLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES \nAs the pineapple's jammed up his ass. \nHITLER Holy schnit!! \nEXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY \nCassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along. \nCASSIUS You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that. \nADRIAN And he's dead serious. \nCASSIUS It's just such a slap in the face. \nAdrian turns to the Monster. \nADRIAN Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here. \nCASSIUS Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it! \nCassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face. The Monster shrugs and walks off. \nADRIAN Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, \"It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.\"  Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell.  We need a place where we can rule. \nCassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back. Cassius sees this and gets enraged. \nCASSIUS Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it on!! Let's see what you got! \nThe Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in an \"aw phooey\" gesture and continues walking away. \nCASSIUS (CONT'D) That's what I thought! \nADRIAN (to Cassius) Could you concentrate for five seconds? \nCASSIUS I am concentrating.  Where can we rule? \nADRIAN What do you think about...Earth? \nCassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) We could create our own hell there. \nCASSIUS You saying we go up there and kill everyone? \nADRIAN Eventually, Cassius.  But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them... \nCASSIUS ...their damned souls will be ours. \nADRIAN It's our time, brother. \nThe two look at each other.  They start running toward the fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way. \n", "test1_id": 312, "test2_input": "GATEKEEPER Hey, what are you doing?!? \nThey get closer to the fire. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) You can't go through there.  The fire flows in, not out. \nThey dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) You know something?  You guys suck!  You really suck! \nSirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the firewall hard. \nINT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER \nDad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb.\" Pause.  Dad exhales. \nDAD Now that was an experience.  \"You are only coming through in waves.\"  That line blows my mind every time. \nNICKY Definitely. \nDAD I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song.  When it's over, that mood has been altered.  Wow. Great shit.  What's next? \nNICKY Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester. \nHits the tape player.  \"Enter Sandman\" blasts. \nDAD Who is this, Metal-lick-a? \nNICKY Metallica, Dad.  Come on. \nDAD I was just playing with you. \nDad and Nicky dance to the song. \nINT. THRONE ROOM - LATER \nCLOSE ON DAD. \nDAD I'm sorry.  After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline. \nON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO. \nDAN C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring. \nDAD In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino. \nDAN You did it for Namath. \nDAD Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that. \nDAN This is bullshit, man. (gets up to leave) I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you! \nDAD Now you're talking. \nDan exits. \nNICKY You're a good devil, Dad. \nDAD And I also happen to be a Jets fan. \nNicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees. \nGATEKEEPER Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell.  They went through the fire, and they broke it.  I think they took the New York tunnel.  I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir. \nDAD Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off your knees. \nThe Gatekeeper stands up. \nGATEKEEPER Thanks for being so understanding, your worship.  You're the man.  You've always been the man. \nDad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We only see them from the front for a second. From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to Nicky. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) (to Nicky) I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right? \nNICKY Coulda been much worse. \nGATEKEEPER That's what I'm thinkin'... \n", "test2_true": "DAD This is bad, Nicky. \nNICKY How bad? \nDAD I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing. \nGRANDPA LUCIFER enters. \nLUCIFER What's with all the whoo-whoo noises? \nDAD Everything's fine, pop. \nLUCIFER Last time you said that the renaissance happened. \nDAD Please, pop, just go back to your room. \nLUCIFER (regarding gateskeeper) Can I take him with me and have sex with his head? \nDAD Sure, pop.  Whatever you want. \nThe gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer. \nGATEKEEPER Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it. \nEXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER \nWe see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED SOULS in hell are sneaking off. \nThe DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do. \nDad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire. \nDAMNED SOULS (O.S.) What's going on?  Where are we? \nWe keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud thuds. \nJIMMY THE DEMON Nothing's getting through that.  The fire is solid as a rock. \nNICKY We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas? \nDAD To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way. \nNICKY So go get 'em, Dad! \nDAD I'm too weak.  The process has already begun. \nDad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight. \nNICKY So go get 'em, Jimmy! \nJIMMY THE DEMON I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers. \nNICKY You're not saying it's up to me? \nThe MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as if to say, \"oh no.\" \nNICKY (CONT'D) I've never been to Earth.  I've never even slept over at some other dude's house! \nJIMMY THE DEMON You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it in you. \nDAD Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here. \nNICKY Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers? \nJIMMY THE DEMON Not go.  They left together at the exact same time.  They gotta come back together at the exact same time. \nDad takes an ornate flask from his robe. \nDAD Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate. \nDad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it. The Monster gags. \nJIMMY THE DEMON Your ol' man's got less than a week. \nNicky looks petrified. \n", "test2_id": 313, "test3_input": "ANGEL Oh my G-d.  This is so wild. \nThey laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled. \nINT. THRONE ROOM - DAY \nDad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne. Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand around. \nDAD I can't see shit.  You're all still here, right? \nAdrian enters.  They all cheer. \nJIMMY THE DEMON Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal in a jiffy, sir. \nDAD LIPS Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came through. \nADRIAN Where's Nicky? \nJIMMY THE DEMON He came with you and Cassius, right? \nADRIAN I came through that gate alone. \nJIMMY THE DEMON Sorry, sir, false alarm. \nDAD Boooo. \nADRIAN Somebody explain what's going on. \nPuts the Gatekeeper in a headlock. \nGATEKEEPER You'll get nothing out of me. \nADRIAN Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips. \nHe twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the information immediately. \nGATEKEEPER The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely. \nADRIAN How much time does Dad have before that happens? \nAdrian twists hard. \nGATEKEEPER Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power. \nAdrian throws him down. \nLUCIFER All boobs and no balls. \nADRIAN Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you. \nHe moves to the throne and throws the lips off. \nDAD LIPS Ahhh! \nHe pushes Lucifer out of the way. \nLUCIFER I don't get no respect. \nADRIAN Ten thousand years.  And I never once got to sit here. \nHe sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He grins as two horns grow out of his forehead. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Wow.  And this is just a little taste of my power. \nDAD Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons, get him out of the chair! \nThe demons approach. \nADRIAN Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested.  Anyone interested? \nThe demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy. \nINT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY \nEveryone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes. \nNICKY Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too? \n", "test3_true": "ANGEL I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like... \nThere's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore. \nCHUBBS Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson. \nANGEL Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so sorry.  I have company.  It's my son, Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it? \nCHUBBS Wow, that's terrific. \nANGEL Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor. \nCHUBBS You mambo? \nNICKY I don't think so. \nCHUBBS Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's all in the hips. \nChubbs dances as he leaves. \nNICKY Where did you meet my father? \nANGEL It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer. \nCHRISTA I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris. \nANGEL Try four and a half.  At first I totally didn't like him. \nJENNA He was really conceited. \nANGEL But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body. \nNICKY And that made you want to make a baby with him? \nThe Angels laugh. \nANGEL Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time! \nHer cell-phone rings.  She answers it. \nANGEL (CONT'D) Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv!  I'll call you back... (laughs) Oh my G-d, I will call you back, goodbye. (hangs up) That was my friend, Michelle, she says \"hi.\" \nNICKY Well tell her I said \"hi\" back. \nAngel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops. \nANGEL I'll call her later. \nCHRISTA You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life. \nJENNA That was so cool. \nANGEL That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here. \nNICKY How did you see me? \nANGEL We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth.  Look. \nAngel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a reflection of Earth below. \nEXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT \nPeople are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance stores... \nANGEL (O.S.) All these good people have totally been led astray. \nCHRISTA (O.S.) Show him Central Park. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT \nPeople are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators exchange money. \nANGEL (O.S.) There's like a three day rave goin' on down there.  No on is going to work anymore. \nThen suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm around him. \n", "test3_id": 314}

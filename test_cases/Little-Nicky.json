{"train": "\"LITTLE NICKY\" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven Brill \nFADE IN: \nEXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT \nA beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling. \nWe PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly the lights turn on. \nPEEPER (whispering) Showtime! \nWe see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's window.  She is wearing business attire. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy? (takes bite of sandwich) Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats. \nThe mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh... \nHe sips some wine. \nThe mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off, revealing a nice bra. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Looks like Victoria just told me her secret. \nThe peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing the words as he goes. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m., first brassiere sighting... (stops writing) I will pleasure myself to this image for months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU! \nThe mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What unfortunate timing.  You mother was just getting comfy. \nThe son talks to his mother excitedly. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever.  Now get out. \nThe son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Now what.  This simply won't do. \nThe peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son answers. \nSCOTTIE Hello? \nPEEPER Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up. \nSCOTTIE Who is this? \nPEEPER Just a little birdie.  A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra. \nMOTHER Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up our tree? \nThe peeper gets nervous. \nPEEPER Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big bird. \nThe peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises. We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls to the ground with a thud. \nPEEPER (CONT'D) Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And wear your bikini. \nThe peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead. \nHARD CUT: \nINT. HOLE - DAY \nThe peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on all sides. \nThe peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way screaming like a five-year old girl. \nPEEPER'S POV \nWe see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He SCREAMS. \nEXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL \nCASSIUS Got ya! \nNICKY (picking up his head) Yes, you got me... \nNicky's head slams back down again. \nCASSIUS Got ya, again! \nNICKY (picking head up) Got me for sure, yes... \nHe grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head. \nCASSIUS Got ya!  Now here's the big finish... \nNicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch. \nNICKY Oh no.  Please Cassius... \nNicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer until it latches on to Nicky's crotch. \nNICKY (CONT'D) Aaaaah. \nCassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them. \nDAD What are you boys doing? \nCassius releases Nicky's hand. \nNICKY Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the furniture. \nDAD Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind? \nCASSIUS I forgot. \nDAD Maybe this will help you remember. \nDad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor. \nDad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of confidence and power. \nDAD (CONT'D) Now everybody sit down. \nNICKY Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape.  I really think it's a masterpiece. \nDAD Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later. \nHe leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad closes the curtains. \nNicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons. \nDAD (CONT'D) My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne... \nConfused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand. \nDAD (CONT'D) ...to step aside. (Nicky lowers his hand) ...and let me become the ruler of hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness.  So I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me. \nJimmy the Demon walks in. \nJIMMY THE DEMON Knock, knock. \nDAD Yes, Jimmy. \nHe whispers in Dad's ear. \nDAD (CONT'D) No, no, that's not what I said.  He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go. \nJIMMY THE DEMON (turning to leave) Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock. \nDad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention back to his sons. \nDAD This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons.  I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And Nicky, so...so... \nNICKY Don't worry about coming up with anything.  It's cool. \nDAD Such a sweet boy.  But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me. \nCASSIUS AND ADRIAN (dumbfounded) What!? \nGATEKEEPER Hey, what are you doing?!? \nThey get closer to the fire. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) You can't go through there.  The fire flows in, not out. \nThey dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) You know something?  You guys suck!  You really suck! \nSirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the firewall hard. \nINT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER \nDad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb.\" Pause.  Dad exhales. \nDAD Now that was an experience.  \"You are only coming through in waves.\"  That line blows my mind every time. \nNICKY Definitely. \nDAD I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song.  When it's over, that mood has been altered.  Wow. Great shit.  What's next? \nNICKY Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester. \nHits the tape player.  \"Enter Sandman\" blasts. \nDAD Who is this, Metal-lick-a? \nNICKY Metallica, Dad.  Come on. \nDAD I was just playing with you. \nDad and Nicky dance to the song. \nINT. THRONE ROOM - LATER \nCLOSE ON DAD. \nDAD I'm sorry.  After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline. \nON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO. \nDAN C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring. \nDAD In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino. \nDAN You did it for Namath. \nDAD Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that. \nDAN This is bullshit, man. (gets up to leave) I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you! \nDAD Now you're talking. \nDan exits. \nNICKY You're a good devil, Dad. \nDAD And I also happen to be a Jets fan. \nNicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees. \nGATEKEEPER Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell.  They went through the fire, and they broke it.  I think they took the New York tunnel.  I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir. \nDAD Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off your knees. \nThe Gatekeeper stands up. \nGATEKEEPER Thanks for being so understanding, your worship.  You're the man.  You've always been the man. \nDad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We only see them from the front for a second. From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to Nicky. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) (to Nicky) I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right? \nNICKY Coulda been much worse. \nGATEKEEPER That's what I'm thinkin'... \nNICKY No.  This can't be happening. \nDAD Son, just do your best. \nNicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster, who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire. \nNicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, \"gotta get a move on.\" \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY \nA SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL \nPAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near distance. \nNICKY Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This doesn't look too bad. \nNicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and WHAMMM! \nEXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER \nNicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him. \nJIMMY THE DEMON You were gone ten seconds.  What happened? \nNICKY I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal. \nDAD That's a train, son.  Don't stand in front of them. \nNICKY Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one. \nDAD Please, Nicky, get back up there. (his ear falls off) Try to hurry. \nNicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall. \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY \nNicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side. In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is scrawled \"NICKY.\" \nNicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat. \nNICKY I'm Nicky. \nBeefy drops the sign from his mouth. \nBEEFY (voice of Sandy Wernick) Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains. \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY \nThe throng of commuters making their way through the terminal are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking around suspiciously, talking to the dog. \nBEEFY My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of your father's.  He's asked me to help you out. \nNICKY I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy. \nBEEFY It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers can possess people.  So they probably won't look like themselves.  You have to be suspicious of everyone. \nNicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat. \nNICKY Okay, \"bro,\" this jig is up... (pulling out the flask) Just get in the bottle.  Just slide right on in there. \nBEEFY It's not me, moron. \nNICKY Oh.  Sorry. \nEXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY \nA BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put money in his pot. \nPREACHER Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his children. (passerby puts in money) He thanks you for your kindness. (another woman puts in money) God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you... \nWe see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER sniffs. \nPREACHER (CONT'D) The Lord does not love you.  I sense...pure evil. (thrusts his cross in Nicky's face) You make the Lord very nervous. (feeling hot) I'm burning...ahhh. (running away) The Devil walks among us! \nHe runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people. \nPREACHER (CONT'D) Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast! \nBEEFY So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate. \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village. \nTODD (on phone) I know exactly how you feel... The night Reagan was elected, I said to my mother, \"Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy?\"  Then we both cried for like an hour. (knock at the door) Somebody's here.  Call you later. \nTodd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced. \nNICKY Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice.  Would it be possible for me to fill the slot? \nTODD Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is? \nNicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both nod imperceptibly. \nNICKY Yes.  What is rent? \nTODD Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits. \nNICKY Off limits. \nTODD Right.  And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. (looks at Nicky) Aren't you boiling in that outfit? \nNICKY No. \nTODD It's like eighty degrees in this hallway.  You from the South? \nNICKY Yeah.  The deep South. \nNicky laughs a little too hard. \nTODD Why is that funny? \nNICKY I don't know. \nTODD And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed. \nTodd turns and goes into the apartment. \nBEEFY You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. \nNICKY Got ya. (to Todd) Is it okay if I do the sleep thing? \nTODD Yeah, your bedroom is right over there. \nThe door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It reads: I \"heart\" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over it. \nINT. NICKY'S ROOM \nNicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we hear disturbing \"speaking-in-tongues\", Exorcist-style voices. \nSLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned. \nEXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING \nWe HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a large church. \nINT. CATHEDRAL \nCLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation. We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He gins his homily. \nCARDINAL In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat. \nThe crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open. \nCARDINAL (CONT'D) Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really done anything for us?  Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes?  No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us. \nA MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs. \nCARDINAL Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs.  He's a bore.  At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally. \nA YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up. \nYOUNG MAN After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby. \nnicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at Nicky as he walks away. \nINT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY \nBeefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the flask. \nINT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER \nNicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again. The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs. \nGATEKEEPER Bus? \nNICKY Beast. \nThe Monster laughs. \nGATEKEEPER (to Monster) You like that?  You think that's funny? \nThe Gatekeeper swirls his tassels. \nGATEKEEPER (CONT'D) How about that?  You like that? \nThe Monster howls with delight. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nNicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a Popeye's drumstick. \nNICKY All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early. \nBEEFY I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects.  Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. \nBeefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep. Beefy sighs. \nBEEFY (CONT'D) Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just begging to come out... \nBeefy walks away. \nEXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY \nNicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores. \nON WORRIED PEOPLE \nStaring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down: it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore. \nPETER Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time. \nJOHN 'Bout time... \nNicky snores.  It sounds like \"I will eat your hearts.\"  The worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores. \nPeter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench. \nJOHN (CONT'D) There's our man. \nPETER Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side. \nA sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket. \nJOHN What's with that guy? \nPETER Gotta be one of his disciples or something. \nSuddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten drumstick) and runs off. \nJOHN Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off. \nPETER Should we wake him up? \nJOHN Yeah.  You do it. \nPeter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud SNORT. \nPETER Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude just stole your shit. \nNicky feels for the flask.  It's gone. \nSTREET VENDOR Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy. (looking at Valerie) And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner.  Before I show you what real crazy is. \nThe vendor does crazy eyes again. \nVALERIE Fine.  I will. \nNicky picks up the flask and the drumstick. \nNICKY Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a few years. \nValerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky follows her. \nNICKY (CONT'D) That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You didn't have to do that. \nVALERIE That's okay.  I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it.  I hate when people take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it for the rest of us. \nNICKY You think I'm a tourist? \nVALERIE I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent maybe.  Where are you from? \nNICKY The South. \nVALERIE Really? \nNICKY Yeah.  Deep south. (laughs hard) \nShe laughs along with him, not sure why. \nVALERIE Why are you laughing? \nNICKY I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your glasses are nice.  They make your eyes look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look at them. \nVALERIE My dad's an optometrist. \nNICKY My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart. \nVALERIE I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your parents get older. \nNICKY If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do. \nVALERIE Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out. \nNicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He hands her the half-eaten drumstick. \nNICKY Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'. \nVALERIE That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati. \nNICKY Could I come with you to getting a Gelati? \nVALERIE If you want to. \nNICKY Want to?  A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back! \nVALERIE \"Octopus people?\" \nNICKY Uh, it's a deep south expression. \nNicky laughs. \nEXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nThey exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati. \nNICKY It's freezing my hands. \nVALERIE It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap it. \nValerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head, sensing Nicky. \nPREACHER Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die! \nHe takes off running right into a lamp post. \nVALERIE This town is really going to hell lately. (Nicky nods) So what part of the city do you live in? \nNICKY I have an apartment.  I don't remember exactly where.  My dog knows, though. \nWe SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head is sticking out. \nPEEPER I deserve this! \nEXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY \nSeveral ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk. \nKID I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar. \nKID #2 How many beers did you have? \nKID # 3 Eight sips. \nKID I had five!  I'm so wasted. \nThey both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS. \nADRIAN When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific.  But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business. \nAdrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with Valerie.  He's shocked. \nValerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her collection. \nNICKY So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store? \nVALERIE Basically, yeah. \nNICKY Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles. \nValerie laughs. \nVALERIE You know what's nice about you?  You just seem happy being yourself.  You don't try to act cool. \nNICKY Thanks much.  You know what's nice about you, Valerie? \nVALERIE What? \nUp the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's been stunned by something. \nNICKY Your juicy, heart-shaped ass. \nVALERIE What was that? \nNICKY (shocked and confused) I...I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that... \nQUICK CUT TO: \nAdrian's eyes flashing. \nNICKY (CONT'D) ...I've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig.  What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens? \nValerie's very hurt. \nVALERIE You're a jerk. \nShe turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian. His inner voice speaks to him. \nNICKY (O.S.) ADRIAN! \nADRIAN (O.S.) You shouldn't have come here. \nNICKY (O.S.) Please, get out of my mind! \nAdrian's eyes flash. \nNICKY (CONT'D) Hey, Valerie! \nShe stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up, giving her the \"finger.\" \nVALERIE What the hell's your problem? \nShe runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still across the street. \nNICKY (O.S.) Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick. \nADRIAN (O.S.) He's sick? \nBEEFY (high-pitched mocking) \"But those are my roommate's sodas...\" Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make? \nNicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare at the Coke. \nBEEFY (CONT'D) You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid - engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just have to release the evil within you. \nNICKY Release the evil? \nBEEFY I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores. \nNicky stares at the can. \nBEEFY (CONT'D) Release your evil... \nNicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little. \nTODD What are you doing? \nTodd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire escape. \nTODD (CONT'D) I know it's your living room night.  But can I finish watching the Globetrotters' game out here?  To me it's classic Comedia Dellarte. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TODD'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe TV clicks on.  We see TODD sit down and look at the TV. Nicky's behind him. \nON TV \nINT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY \nBILL WALTON What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans. \nA Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and makes the travelling signal. \nREF He's walking, get him a bus! \nBILL WALTON Oh, another awful call.  There is no way that was travelling. \nRef takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face. \nCORNROWS What's with all these crazy calls?  You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years. \nREF Technical foul! \nRef snaps just like Cassius in the players' face. \nON TODD AND NICKY \nNICKY That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know... \nON TV \nThe ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously slam their heads on the scorers table again and again. \nON TODD AND NICKY \nNICKY (CONT'D) It looks like the work of a brother... \nTODD A black guy? \nNICKY If it's Cassius, yes. \nNicky races for the door. \nINT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY \nAs the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's shirt yells out. \nGLOBETROTTER FAN Get your head out your ass, ref!  The kids came to see the Globetrotters win. \nREF Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten points off for the Globetrotters. \nThe Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36. \nON STANDS \nNicky throws an underhand shot.  The ball arcs through the air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere and swats it away. \nREF Get that crap outta here! \nThe crowd BOOS!  Nicky and the ref stare at each other. \nNICKY (O.S.) I know you're having fun, Cassius, but you gotta come back to Hell. \nCASSIUS (O.S.) Look around you, Nicky.  We're in Hell. The New Hell. \nSTANDS \nWe see FITZIE, sitting between TWO PREGNANT WOMEN, raising the roof. \nCOURTSIDE \nAs the crowd BOOS, Nicky runs over and grabs the microphone. \nNICKY Listen up, New York.  Your souls are in great danger... \nNicky gets hit by a hot dog. \nNICKY (CONT'D) Alright, how about this?  I get one more shot.  The ref will cover me.  I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game. I make it, he doesn't ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again. \nThe crowd is silent. \nNICKY (CONT'D) And we get free pizza. \nThe crowd roars. \nINT. ANNOUNCING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS \nBill Walton's hair is now burnt looking. \nBILL WALTON I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man. \nBill Walton reaches over to an old lady sitting near him.  He takes off her wig, leaving behind her bald head, and puts her wig on his head in order to cover his burnt hair. \nThe crowd starts YELLING. \nCROWD Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky! \nSTANDS \nJohn and Peter are yelling the loudest. \nCOURTSIDE \nThe ref walks to half-court and hands Nicky the ball. \nNICKY You know, Dad got very sick when you left. \nREF I heard.

BASKETBALL COURT - MIDCOURT - CONTINUOUS \nNicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays extremely tight defense.  Nicky fakes one way, then heads toward the basket.  The ref stays tight.  Nicky's eyes are redder than ever.  He fakes left, he fakes right.  He dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then takes his momentum up toward the basket.  He jumps from the foul line and flies through the air.  He emits a crazy, blood curdling, devil yell. \nCUT AWAY DURING DEVIL YELL TO: \nSHOT CLOCK \nIt reads: 666. \nPAN UP from Popeye's laying everywhere.  Everyone's laughing hard. \nJOHN Come on.  One more time. \nNICKY Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts. \nPETER Please.  You got to. \nNICKY (resigned) All right... \nNicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360 degrees.  Everyone cracks up, high fives.  Even Todd LAUGHS. PAN OVER to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes. \nBEEFY I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog. \nJOHN She was human? \nBEEFY Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man, that pissed my parents off. \nJOHN I dated a Japanese girl once.  My parents disapproved.  Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen. \nNICKY I'm only fifteen...thousand years old. \nEveryone cracks up. \nTODD I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough.  And she needed that. \nJOHN By she, do you mean he? \nTODD No. \nBEEFY Busted. (laughs) \nPETER How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar? \nNICKY A little strange.  I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie. \nTODD Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss her?  Need a shoulder to cry on? \nJOHN Easy, Liberace. \nTODD Oh, would you grow up. \nNICKY We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass. \nBEEFY Maybe you love her.  But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind. \nPETER Me, too.  We're gonna get going. \nTODD You guys want to stay?  I have a futon in my bedroom. \nJOHN That's a big pass, Elton John. \nPETER We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come, Nicky? \nNICKY No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves. \nJOHN Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then.  Later on. \nNICKY See ya, fellas. \nThey leave. \nBEEFY (O.S.) You better snap out of it soon, kid. Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow. Seven AM.  Nighty, night. \nHe falls asleep and starts snoring.  We hear the SOUND of THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing \"Ring Around The Rosie\" as he exhales. \nTODD That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen. \nNicky stands and moves to the window.  He looks out longingly over the sleeping city... achingly.  RACK FOCUS behind him, we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection. \nNICKY Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School of Design? \nEXT.

And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before. \nCUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window. The student's dripping candle wax on his belly. \nSTUDENT You got the wrong window again, man. \nNICKY Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie? \nNicky resumes floating up. \nVALERIE I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left. \nNicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies back ten feet. \nVALERIE (CONT'D) Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger. \nNICKY That wasn't me.  I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who call you a gross pig. \nVALERIE What do you mean, \"possessed?\" \nNICKY Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell? \nVALERIE Yes... \nNICKY Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years.  Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad... \nVALERIE ... \"The Devil?\"... \nNICKY ...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad very much.  So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and...well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you. \nHis vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is totally in shock but still here. \nVALERIE Okay, now I get that \"deep south\" joke. \nNicky laughs.  Valerie joins in. \nVALERIE (CONT'D) I don't know if I should believe you. \nNicky starts to drop. \nNICKY You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe in the butterflies. \nVALERIE Okay, I do.

SKY - NIGHT \nVALERIE He's kind of ruining the mood. \nNICKY Let me take care of that. \nNicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break. \nNICKY Ow...what was that for? \nBUM Fifty million dollars. \nThe bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads \"MONSTER WANTED!\" And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked. \nNicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running right at him.  He closes his eyes. \nNICKY Release the evil. \nNicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD. \nThe Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked out. \nINT.

You get the rest when I get Nicky. \nPETER Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man. He's not human. \nCHIEF OF POLICE Really? \nJOHN We think he's the son of Satan. \nPAUSE.

GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY \nWe see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.

Come on out and say hello... \nJOHN Urr...uggg...errr... \nADRIAN (eyes getting red) I'm calling you out, brother... \nAdrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles. \nJOHN/NICKY Urrr...uggh... (as Nicky) Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful. \nNicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the \"Schnapps bottle\" to see the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside. \nADRIAN Hello, Cassius. \nCASSIUS (O.S.) All right.  Let me out. \nADRIAN You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan. \nCASSIUS (O.S.)

Right into the oncoming train. \nNICKY Valerie!!! \nNicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky. \nADRIAN See you in Hell! \nWHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky. \nADRIAN Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to see all of you here. \nNICKY (O.S.)

But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS. \nEXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS \nPETER This don't look good. \nJOHN Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this? \nTODD They castrated him.

He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the baffled chipmunk in one bite. \nNicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of flowers. \nAdrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a lawn mower comes by and mows them down. \nNicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage. \n", "test2_id": 313, "test3_input": "Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who leaps out and starts beating up on the mother. \nNicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf stops beating her up and holds her hand. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my bare hands. \nAdrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the platform. \nNicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit, when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall. \nINT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS \nWe now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS watching the action on the table. \nANGEL I totally had to do that. \nALL THE GIRLS Yah you did. \nCHUBBS is there, too. \nEXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT \nNicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds out the flask. \nNICKY Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas... \nAdrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face, sending him flying off the bed. \nNICKY (CONT'D) Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?! \nNicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed. \nNicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes down hard.  Nicky towers over him. \nNICKY (CONT'D) Now will you get in the flask? \nADRIAN Absolutely not. \nAdrian turns to his demons. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) A little help over here. \nA bunch of Demons advance. \nON FLAGPOLE \nWe see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run over and lowers the five from the flagpoles. \nON ADRIAN \nHe looks up and glares at Henry. \nADRIAN (CONT'D) Henry! \nON FLAGPOLE \nHenry's eyes widen. \nHENRY WINKLER Oh no. \nHe is covered in bees again. \nBACK ON ADRIAN \nHe turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't open his mouth. \nAdrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his mouth. \nADRIAN Goodbye, Nicky. \nWe hear CASSIUS banging against the walls. \nCASSIUS (O.S.) Come on in, bro. \nNicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in. Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him. \nAs the flask hits the ground, we HEAR: \n", "test3_true": "ADRIAN (O.S.) I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius.  I swear. \nNICKY (O.S.) Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I heard him keep saying. \nWe HEAR the sounds of a struggle. \nAll the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down off the stage. \nWe HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a horrible thud. \nVALERIE Nicky! \nNICKY (O.S.) That was Cassius! \nThe FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the street.  They root for their side. \nDEMON Kill him, Adrian. \nJohn and Peter start beating up the Demon. \nINT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS \nThe Angel and the Friend are praying. \nEXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS \nWe HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY. \nHOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono. The people and demons near him are grossed out. \nValerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him. \nVALERIE Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that? \nNICKY From my dad's side of the family. \nShe laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS. But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh. \nThe crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh. \nADRIAN What?  No tongue? \nAdrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies around, laughing, scaring people. \nValerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside. \nVALERIE (whispering) Nicky. Nicky. \nNo response. \nVALERIE (CONT'D) You gotta fly out...I know you can do it. (still no response) Do it for the butterflies. \nA long beat, then: \nNICKY (O.S.) Butterflies... \nAnd Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock is one minute from midnight. \nAdrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE. \nOZZY Hello, New York. \nJOHN AND PETER Ozzy. \nThey faint. \nThe Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie hands Ozzy the flask. \nVALERIE Put him in, Ozzy. \nOzzy spits the bat head into the flask. \nEXT. CLOCK TOWER \nThe clock reads: 00:23 seconds left. \n", "test3_id": 314}

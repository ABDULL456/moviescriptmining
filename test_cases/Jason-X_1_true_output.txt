KICKER Don't touch that! 
Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE. 
KKINSA This is bad, no? 
THORGAN Relax, it's only a  glitch in the system. 
JANESSA First field trip and you think you're a Scientist. Move out of the way geek. 
JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 
As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES looms forward! 
JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere! 
DELONGPREE Jesus, used to make the suckers big didn't they? 
Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body. 
KAY-EM 14 Subject was dead prior to incubation. 
Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason. 
YLLO My God, look at him. Why would they freeze a dead body? (a beat) Alright, load him up, and let's get out of here! 
OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL 
A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor. 
BACK INSIDE 
One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP. 
BOEMAN Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement. 
FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left arm falls to the ground! 
Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She injects him. The drugs take immediate effect. 
AZRAEL Cool . . . check out my arm. 
CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK. 
HALL 
The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our heroes. 
YLLO Kicker! 
KICKER Defense droids. I'm on it. 
Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it. 
KKINSA There goes prom night. 
Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm. 
KICKER They're only class two. I can handle this. No problem. 
AZRAEL Not a problem?! 
Kay-Em injects him again. 
AZRAEL I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr- (re:shot) Oh, that's dreamy. 
The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges. 
JANESSA Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit. I gotta date tonight. 
KICKER Stand back! 
He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons. 
YLLO We have to get these two back in one piece! 
Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl. 
KAY-EM 14 Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization immediately. 
YLLO Kicker! Do something! 
ADRIENNE Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that. 
At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically. 
AZRAEL (drugged up) That is soooo cool! 
Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget. 
KAFOOM! 
KICKER Come on! 
Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear around the bend - towards the exit. 
A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - - 
CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK. 
A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well. 
INT.  LONG CORIDOOR 
Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING all around our group. 
KKINSA Have I told you guys how much I hate this class? 
KICKER We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off! Teach, find a way out! 
BOEMAN I'm on it! 
KICKER Sorry kid, leave this to the pros. 
BOEMAN (re: gadget) Left at the end of the hall!

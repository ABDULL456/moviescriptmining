As sunlight breaks across the edge, warming the surface... \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nWe're MOVING THROUGH the channels of Acidalia Planitia to find the ARES 3 HAB SITE. \nLEWIS (OVER RADIO) All right, team. Stay in sight of each other. Let's make NASA proud... \nTITLE: SOL 18 \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nCLOSE ON ASTRONAUT MARK WATNEY. He's in the middle of an EVA experiment. He chips at a section of rocks and records his observations on his ARM COMPUTER. \nBright-eyed and optimistic. Another day at the office. \nMARK In grid section fourteen twenty-eight, the particles appear predominantly \"coarse,\" but as we move to twenty-nine, the particles are much finer, and should be ideal for chem analysis. \nVOICE (OVER RADIO) Hear that, everyone? \nAnd we FIND RICK MARTINEZ inspecting the MARS ASCENT VEHICLE (a.k.a \"The MAV\") on the launch pad. They speak over radios. \nMARTINEZ Mark just discovered \"dirt.\" Alert the media. \nMARK What's your job today, Martinez? Confirming the MAV is still upright? \nMARTINEZ Visual inspection of equipment is imperative to mission success. \nMartinez studies the MAV for a moment, then speaks thoughtfully into his arm computer: \nMARTINEZ (CONT'D) \"The MAV is still upright.\" (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nVOICE (RADIO) Watney, you keep leaving your channel open... \nFIND COMMANDER MELISSA LEWIS across the way, overseeing a drill experiment. \nLEWIS Which leads to Martinez responding, which leads to us listening, which leads to me being annoyed. \nMARK Martinez, Commander Lewis would like you please shut your smart mouth. \nVOICE Speaking for the smart people of the world... \nINT. HAB - DAY \nDR. CHRIS BECK studies samples on slides at his station. \nBECK We would prefer you use a different adjective to describe Martinez' mouth. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nMARTINEZ Did Beck just insult me? \nMARK Doctor Beck. And yes. \nVOICE Happy to turn their radios off from here, Commander... \nINT. HAB - DAY \nBETH JOHANSSEN sits inside at her computer, tracking (among other things) the group's communications. \nJOHANSSEN Just say the word. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nMARK Johanssen, constant communication is the hallmark of a -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLEWIS Shut `em off. \nClick. Mark and Martinez' radios go SILENT. \nAs Lewis works, we see Mark throwing up his arms in the background, like \"Hey! C'mon!\" \nLEWIS (CONT'D) I apologize for my countrymen, Vogel. \nALEX VOGEL wears the EUROPEAN UNION patch on his shoulder. \nALEX Accepted. How many samples do we need, Commander? \nLEWIS Seven. One hundred grams each. Drill at least thirty centimeters down. \nWhile the two of them use a SPECIMEN DRILL to bore holes in the ground, we see Mark waving his arms in the background: C'mon, turn my radio back on... \nLEWIS Watney, report -- (NO REPLY) WATNEY, REPORT! \nJOHANSSEN BECK He's offline. I don't know -- Commander, before we lost where he is -- telemetry, his decompression alarm went off -- \nLEWIS JOHANSSEN Shit! Johanssen where did -- He was right in front of you last see him? me and then he was gone. He flew off due west -- \nLewis surveys the scene. Visibility is NEAR ZERO. She can barely see the people next to her. Tries to keep her heart from POUNDING out of her chest. \nLEWIS (CONT'D) Okay... okay... Martinez, get to the MAV and prep for launch. Everyone else, home in on Johanssen. \nJOHANSSEN (STUMBLING) I can't see anything -- \nVOGEL Doctor Beck! How long can a person survive decompression? \nBECK Less than minute. \nLEWIS Line up and walk west. Small steps. He's probably prone. We don't want to step over him. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThe group fights through the chaos -- \nINT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nWHOOSH! Martinez dives into the airlock, forces the door closed. Waits for agonizing seconds as it pressurizes... \nPressurized. Martinez races up the ladder, slides into the pilot's couch and boots the system. \nMARTINEZ Commander -- The MAV's got an 8 degree tilt. It'll tip at 12.3 -- \nEXT. HAB - STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nLEWIS Copy that -- \nBeck checks the readout on his arm computer. \nBECK Johanssen, Watney's bio-monitor sent something before going offline. My computer just says \"Bad Packet\" -- \nJOHANSSEN It didn't finish transmitting. (works her arm computer) I have the raw packet. It's plaintext: BP 0, PR 0, TP 36.2. \nBECK Copy. (THEN) Blood pressure zero. Pulse rate zero. Temperature normal. \nLEWIS Temperature normal? \nBECK It takes a while for the... it takes a while for the body to cool. \nEveryone stops short as that news lands. \nMARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) Commander. Tilting at 10.5 degrees now, with gusts pushing it to 11. \nLEWIS Copy. If it tips, can you launch before it completely falls over? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) (HESITATES) Uh. Yes. Ma'am. I could take manual control. \nLEWIS Copy that. Everyone home in on Martinez' suit. That'll get you to the airlock. Get in and prep for launch. \nVOGEL What about you, Commander? \nLEWIS I'm searching a little more. Get moving. And Martinez, if you start to top, launch. \nMARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) You really think I'm leaving you behind? \nLEWIS I just ordered you to. You three, get to the ship. (as they hesitate) GO. \nINT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nVogel, Beck, and Johanssen stumble into the airlock. \nEXT. STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nLewis can't see a thing in any direction. C'mon, think, Melissa, think... \nShe reaches into the pack on her back and removes two of the one meter drill bits she was using earlier to take samples. She holds one in each hand, dragging them on the ground as she trudges through the sand. \nLEWIS Johanssen, would the rover IR camera do any good? \nINT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nJOHANSSEN (INTO RADIO) Negative. IR can't get through sand any better than visible light. \nThey rip off their helmets. Scramble up the ladder. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBECK What's she thinking? She's a geologist. She knows IR can't get through a sandstorm. \nVOGEL She's grasping. For anything. \nMARTINEZ Commander. We're tilting 11.6 degrees. One good gust and we're tipping. \nLEWIS (OVER RADIO) What about the proximity radar? Could it detect Watney's suit? \nMARTINEZ No way. It's made to see Hermes in orbit, not the metal in a single suit. \nLEWIS (OVER RADIO) Copy. Give it a try. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nClear skies above the surface of Mars once again. PRELAP the sound of an ALARM: ARRR... ARRR... ARRR... \nA BODY lies facedown, half-covered in red sand at the base of a hill. We catch a glimpse of the nametag on the spacesuit: \n\"Watney.\" \nThe OXYGEN ALARM inside the helmet continues to BLARE. And just as it builds to crescendo... \nMark Watney gasps for air. \nHe jerks back into consciousness. He's disoriented, alarms BLARING inside his helmet. As he struggles to move... \nHe screams in pain. Glances down. Sees: \nA JAGGED LENGTH OF ANTENNA has pierced his spacesuit and stabbed straight into his abdomen. CAKED BLOOD all around the wound. \nMark's training kicks in -- the suit is breached -- he struggles to his knees -- gasping in pain -- he reaches to the side of his helmet for the BREACH KIT -- pulls the valve free -- grabs hold of the antenna... grits his teeth... \nAND YANKS the antenna out of his side. The antenna SNAPS FREE -- the suit is exposed to atmosphere -- the pressure inside DROPS -- Mark CRIES OUT, goes woozy -- \nBut stays conscious. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe slams the breach kit over the hole. Seals it. Checks his arm readout. The oxygen stabilizes. He's still alive. \nFor now. \nHe struggles to his feet. Picks up the length of antenna. Begins the LONG CLIMB up the hill. \nEXT. MARS - HAB - DAY \nWe're WITH MARK as he makes the climb, and as he crests the hill we swing around to reveal: \nTHE ARES 3 HABITATION (a.k.a. \"The Hab\"): The large, white tent-like structure where the six crew members lived during their time on Mars. \nIt's been battered by the storm, but it's still intact. Mark registers momentary relief. But then his eyes dart over to the MAV LAUNCH SITE. \nIt's empty. \nHe keeps walking. \nINT. HAB - AIRLOCK - DAY \nMark fumbles his way into one of the hab's airlocks. As soon as the airlock equalizes, he tears off his helmet... \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark stumbles into the main area. Peels off his jumpsuit. WINCES as he rips the blood-caked fabric away from HIS WOUND. \nHis fingers probe the puncture. It's deep. That's bad. He checks his back for an exit wound. There's none. That's good. He grabs the broken antenna he brought with him. His fingers trace the bloodied end. It's jagged -- as though a piece of the antenna broke off inside him. \nThat's really bad. \nMark stumbles over to the first-aid station. Grabs supplies. Anesthetic. Syringe. Forceps. Needle. Suture thread. \n(This is not exactly going to be easy to watch.) \nSweat pouring off his brow, Mark loads up the syringe with anesthetic. Grits his teeth. Injects it into his wound. Gasps. Breathes. Grabs the forceps. Hesitates. I don't want to do this. He takes a deep breath... \nAnd digs the forceps into his wound. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe CRIES OUT in pain. Nearly goes unconscious. Fights it. Don't pass out, Mark. He probes with the forceps, grimacing in agony. He can't find it. Pushes the forceps in deeper. And DEEPER. Jesus. Mark's face goes WHITE. \nHe finds it. Yanks the forceps free. Sees the small piece of shrapnel. It's out. Hallelujah. \nMark grabs the needle. Tries to thread it. His hands won't stop shaking. He makes fists. C'mon Mark. Steadies himself just enough. \nHe begins to stitch himself up. Bit by agonizing bit. His hands keep shaking, but he refuses to stop until the wound is closed. Finally... \nHe's done. He clips the sutures. Collapses back into his chair. Oh Jesus. Tries to catch his breath. \nWe slowly ANGLE IN ON MARK as he struggles to breathe... and breathe... \nAnd as we settle into a CLOSEUP, we see the full reality of Mark's situation hit him. He's in agony. Left for dead. All by himself. \nThe only man on the planet. \nHis eyes drift to the middle distance. Then... \nMARK Fuck. \nCUT TO TITLE: THE MARTIAN \nINT. HAB - DAY \nCAM ANGLE: we're looking through what (we assume) is a NASA camera. Mark's head peeks into frame. He adjusts the camera, seems unfamiliar with how to work the video journal. \nMARK Okay. Okay... \nHe types on the keypad. We see the NASA TIMESTAMP appear on the frame. There, it's working. \nMARK (CONT'D) This is... Mark Watney. Astronaut. I am entering this log for the record, in case I... don't make it. It's... (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARK (CONT'D) oh-six-fifty-three on Sol 19. And... I'm still alive. (THINKS) Obviously. But I'm guessing this is going to be a surprise to my crewmates. And NASA. And... the world. So... surprise. (THEN) I didn't die on Sol 18. Best I can tell - \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark cuts each potato into four quarters, making sure each quarter has at least two eyes. \nHe begins planting each potato quarter in nice, orderly rows. As he works, we slowly WIDEN OUT to reveal -- \nThe ENTIRE HAB is now covered in SOIL. Not just the floor -- Mark has cleared every available surface -- bunks, countertops, table -- and covered it with his dirt. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark packs soil on top of one of the crew member's bunks. As he moves the personal items aside, he finds a DATA-STICK. He holds it up and looks at it: hmmmm. CUT TO: \nMark has plugged the data-stick into the computer and is now viewing its contents: old episodes of seventies television. \nMark just sits there. Watching HAPPY DAYS. \nTITLE: SOL 36 \nMARK (PRELAP) The problem is water... \nINT./EXT - ROVER - DAY \nMark trudges out to the Mars Descent Vehicle (MDV) -- the lander that brought the six of them to Mars. He delicately begins to remove the Hydrazine tank from the undercarriage... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK (V.O.) I've created one-hundred and twenty-six square meters of soil. But each cubic meter needs forty liters of water to be farmable. So, I gotta make a lot of water. Fortunately, I know the recipe. Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn. Unfortunately... burn. (THEN) I have hundreds of liters of unused Hydrazine from the MDV. If I run the Hydrazine over an iridium catalyst, it'll separate into N2 and H2... \nINT. HAB - DAY \nScience time. Quick cuts now as Mark shows us how to make water by burning rocket fuel: \n-- Mark duct tapes torn trash-bags to create a tent, which he uses to cover his work table. \n-- He tears an air hose from one of the space suits, tapes it to the tent, hangs it from the roof. Now he has a chimney. \n-- Mark vents pure oxygen from a tank, lights it with a spark from battery wires. Whoosh. Points the flame at the wood shavings. Now he has a small torch. \n-- Mark holds the torch, starts the Hydrazine flow. The Hydrazine sizzles on the iridium and DISAPPEARS. \nFOLLOW Mark's gaze up to the chimney. FLAME BURSTS start sputtering out from the hose. Mark grins. It's working. \nMark checks his instruments. Watches the temperature carefully. Repeats the process. \nWe may also notice Mark is wearing the protective inner lining of his EVA suit. Along with goggles. An oxygen mask hangs around his neck. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark talks directly to camera. We may notice he is standing in the middle of what looks like a mad-scientist's chemistry experiment. \nMARK Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it. Luckily, in the history of humanity, nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMark just stares at the camera. Then continues. \nMARK (CONT'D) Believe it or not, the challenge has been finding something that will hold a flame. NASA hates fire. Because of the whole \"fire makes everyone die in space\" thing. So everything we brought with us is flame retardant. With the notable exception of... Martinez' personal items. \nHe holds up Martinez' pack. Removes a small wooden cross. \nMARK (CONT'D) Sorry, Martinez. If you didn't want me to go through your stuff, you shouldn't have left me for dead on a desolate planet. \nHe starts shaving the cross down with a knife. \nMARK (CONT'D) I figure God won't mind, considering the situation. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark's still at it. He looks exhausted. He goes through the procedure once again. Glances at the atmospheric analyzer. Hm. Is that right? Doesn't give it a second thought. \nHe strikes the torch again... \nBOOM! \nThe explosion is LOUD, FAST, and CONTAINED. It blasts Mark clear across the room. He hits the ground like a wet rag. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark talks to camera. His clothes are somewhat scorched. His hair is singed in patches. \nMARK So. Yes. I blew myself up. (THEN) Best guess? I forgot to account for the excess oxygen I've been exhaling when I did my calculations. Because I'm stupid. \nHe's still dazed. A little out of it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK (CONT'D) Interesting side note: this is how Jet Propulsion Laboratory was founded. Five guys at Cal Tech were trying to make rocket fuel and nearly burned down their dorm. Rather than expel them, Professor... Von Karman? I want to say... banished them to a nearby farm in Pasadena and told them to keep working. And now we have a space program. (THEN) See? I pay attention. (THEN) I'm gonna get back to work. As soon as my ears stop ringing. \nHe just sits there for a while. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark's back at it. He checks his math, adjusts the O2 levels. He glances at camera, then crosses his fingers. Winces as he fires up the torch. \nHe doesn't blow up. Phew. Starts venting the hydrazine. \nCONTINUED: \nTEDDY You're not the only one who needs satellite time. We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up. We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater. \nVINCENT I'm talking about securing us another mission. We have twelve satellites in orbit, we can surely spare a few hours -- \nTEDDY It's not about the satellite time, Vince. \nVincent shrugs -- then what is it? \nTEDDY (CONT'D) We're a public domain organization. We have to be transparent about this. \nVINCENT And? \nTEDDY The second we point the satellites at the Hab... I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world. \nVINCENT (DISBELIEF) You're afraid of a PR problem? \nTEDDY Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem. Another mission? Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post. \nVINCENT So... what do we do? He's not going to decompose. He'll be there forever. \nTEDDY Meteorology estimates he'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year. \nVINCENT We can't wait a year for this. We have work to do. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTEDDY Ares 5 won't even launch for another five years. We have plenty of time. \nVincent thinks about it. Frustrated. Tries another tack. \nVINCENT Okay, consider this. Right now, the world is on our side. Sympathy for Watney's family is high... \nHe knows this sounds cold, but he's out of options. \nVINCENT (CONT'D) Ares 6 could bring the body back. We don't say that's the purpose of the mission, but we make it clear that would be part of it. We frame it that way, we get more support in Congress. I can sell it. But not if we wait a year. \nTeddy stares back out the window. Vincent has a point. \nVINCENT (CONT'D) In a year, people won't care any more. \nINT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT \nA WOMAN in her twenties checks the work order on her screen. \nTITLE: MINDY PARK, SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS, NASA \nShe straightens up when she sees the request comes from \"KAPOOR, Vincent.\" She enters the latitude and longitude... \nMINDY Acidalia Planitia... \nHer heart starts to beat a little faster. Click. The images pop up: overhead shots of the Hab site. Morbid curiosity getting the better of her, she scans for Mark's dead body. Doesn't find it. Hmmm... \nShe zooms in on the Hab. That's strange. \nAnd then it hits her. \nOh god. \nShe doesn't know what to do. It takes her a moment to find the phone. Heart POUNDING. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINDY (CONT'D) Security? This is Mindy Park in SatCon. I need the emergency contact number for Dr. Kapoor. Yes, him. Yes it's an EMERGENCY -- \nINT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT \nA hard-charging WOMAN stares at us in SHOCK -- \nWOMAN Oh you have GOT to be SHITTING ME -- \nTITLE: ANNIE MONTROSE, Director of Media Relations, NASA \nAnnie, Vincent, and Teddy all huddle in the conference room. IMAGES of the HAB site on the screens around them. \nTEDDY How sure? \nVINCENT Nearly 100%. \nANNIE Do you understand the shitstorm that's about to hit us? \nTEDDY Annie, one thing at a time. (TO VINCENT) Prove it to me. \nVINCENT (points to images) For starters, the solar panels have been cleaned. \nTEDDY They could have been cleaned by wind. \nVINCENT Look at Rover 2. According to the logs, Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17. Plugged it into the Hab to recharge. It's been moved. \nTEDDY She could have forgotten to log the move. \nVINCENT Here's the clincher. Check the MDV. It's been taken apart. There's no way they do that without telling us. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMark speaks to the camera. His teeth are chattering. \nMARK Okay, so... success? I've doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1. BUT. If I use the heater, it'll eat up half my battery power every day. If I don't use the heater, I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics. (tries to stop shaking) I'd like to solve this problem, but unfortunately my brain is frozen. \nMark drives back towards the Hab. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nMark drives the Rover across Acidalia Planitia. IN THE DISTANCE: a GREEN FLAG is planted at the top of a hill. \nMARK (V.O.) Good news: I may have a solution to my heating problem. \nMark climbs the hill. \nMARK (V.O.) Bad news: it involves me digging up the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now, if I remember my training correctly, one of the lessons was titled, \"Don't Dig Up The Big Box of Plutonium, Mark...\" \nMark begins to dig up the big box of plutonium. \nMARK (V.O.) I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft, but if they rupture around humans... no more humans. Which is why we buried it when we arrived. And planted that flag so we would never be stupid enough to accidentally go near it again. \nMark unearths the RTG. It looks like a small missile. \nMARK But. As long as I don't break it... (HESITATES) I almost said \"everything will be fine\" out loud. My point is... \nINT. ROVER - DAY \nMark talks to camera while he drives the rover. He's covered in sweat. He even has his shirt off. \nMARK I'm not cold anymore. And yes, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me, but right now I have bigger problems on my hands. I've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis' personal drive, and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns. \nMark hits play on the computer. \"Hot Stuff\" by Donna Summer starts playing. It's super disco-y. Mark drives, stone- faced, while it plays. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nThe rover heads towards the Hab in the distance, growing smaller and smaller in frame. Gotta have some HOT LOVE baby this evening... Hot hot hot hot... stuff... \nINT. NASA - PRESS ROOM - DAY \nSATELLITE IMAGERY: from above, Mark's rover cuts across Mars. \nREPORTER 1 Where is Watney going? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA CNN REPORTER conducts an interview with Vincent in the NASA MEDIA ROOM. Annie watches like a nervous stage mom. \nVINCENT We believe he's preparing for a journey. He's conducting incremental tests -- taking Rover 2 out for longer and longer trips each time. \nREPORTER 2 To what end? Why would he leave the relative safety of the Hab? \nVINCENT Communication. We believe he plans to travel to the Ares 4 launch site in order to make contact with us. But it would be a dangerous gamble. \nREPORTER 3 He'd be risking his life to talk to you? \nVINCENT (NODS) This is the problem Mark faces. He's alone. And he needs to make contact to survive. But if we could talk to him, we'd tell him to stay put. Mark needs to trust we're doing everything in our power to bring him home alive. \nINT. NASA - DAY \nVenkat walks quickly down the halls with Annie... \nANNIE Don't say \"Bring him home alive.\" It reminds the world he might die. \nVENKAT You think people might forget that? \nANNIE You asked how you did and I'm giving you my answer. My answer is \"Eh.\" And yes, I'm going to make everyone forget there's a strong likelihood Mark Watney is going to die because that's what you pay me for and unfortunately I need this job because I'm currently paying alimony to two deadbeat ex-husbands because somehow gender equality has bitten me square in the ass. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nVENKAT Hard to believe tha-- \nANNIE I left them. \nINT. NASA - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nVincent and Annie enter just as the rest of the Department Heads are settling for the meeting. Teddy glances up -- \nTEDDY Don't say \"Bring him home alive,\" Vincent. \nVINCENT You know, these interviews aren't easy. God forbid I try to say something proactive and positive. \nTEDDY Annie... \nANNIE No more Vincent on television. Copy that. \nVincent starts to muster an \"are you kidding me?\" as Mindy passes out a brief to the department heads. \nTEDDY Seventy-six kilometers. Am I reading that right? \nNobody's quite sure who Teddy is asking. \nMINDY Are you asking me? \nTEDDY I am. \nMINDY Yes, sir. Mark drove straight away from the Hab for almost two hours, did a short EVA, then drove for another two. We think the EVA was to change batteries. \nVincent rips the poster off the wall. \nTECHNICIAN Hey -- c'mon -- \nVINCENT I'll buy you a new one. (TO MINDY) What's the Hab's location? \nMINDY 31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west. \nVincent marks it off on the map with a sharpie. Draws Mark's location. He needs a ruler. Looks around, grabs the Technician's notebook out of his hands. Uses the spine to connect the dots. Studies it. Grins. \nVINCENT I know where he's going. \nVincent, lost in his own world now, bolts for his office. As he hurries away (leaving Mindy and the Technician behind): \nVINCENT (CONT'D) I need to get on an airplane! \nTECHNICIAN Who's he talking to? \nMINDY I'm honestly not sure. \nEXT.

JPL LOBBY - DAY \nBruce waits in the lobby as Vincent walks through the front doors. \nTITLE: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California \nThey shake hands. \nINT/EXT. JPL STORAGE - DAY \nBruce and Vincent hurry across the JPL campus. In the background, deer frolic. (NOTE: This is real. Deer frolic out in the open on the JPL grounds. NOTE: It's awesome.) \nVINCENT What are the odds Mark can get it working again? \nBRUCE Hard to say. We lost contact in `97. We think it was battery failure. (THEN) Though I'd like to point out it lasted three times longer than expected in any scenario. \nVINCENT Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce. I want talk to everyone who was here in \nBRUCE They're already waiting for you. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nMark, on foot now, digs at the location. As he begins to reveal the buried metal... \nINT. JPL - GARAGE \nVincent and Bruce enter the cavernous JPL garage. A large crowd mills around an APPARATUS covered by a sheet. \nVINCENT This the replica? \nBruce nods, pulls off the sheet to reveal... (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nVINCENT (CONT'D) Pathfinder. \nThe American spacecraft launched in 1996. It's in two notable sections -- the large LANDER and the smaller SOJOURNER ROVER. \nVincent's eyes gleam as he stares at the craft. \nEXT. MARS - DAY \nMark has now uncovered Pathfinder. He stares at it with a similar gleam in his eye. Then he drags the Lander to the back of Rover 2, begins lashing it to a makeshift hitch... \nTITLE: SOL 109 \nEXT. HAB - DAY \nSojourner now sits beside the workbench outside the Hab, watching as Mark methodically takes apart the Lander. \nIt looks like he's been at this a while. He removes the battery, replaces it with an environment heater. Like a surgeon performing a heart transplant. \nHe locks the heater into place, and as it CLICKS we -- \nCUT TO BLACK. \nINT.

(THEN) One big bonus of this NASA communication: Email! Just like the days on the Hermes, I get data dumps. Not just friends and family, but NASA also sends choice messages from the public. Rock stars, athletes, even The President. The coolest one is from my alma mater, the University of Chicago. They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially \"colonized\" it. So, technically, I colonized Mars. (THEN) In your face, Neil Armstrong. \nMUSIC UP: \"Right Back Where We Started From\" by Maxine Nightingale takes us into... \nEXT.

I want to announce we're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window. \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) I'm on a plane to you this afternoon. We'll have the release ready. \nTEDDY Good, but Annie will handle camera appearances. \nVincent gives a look that says \"Et tu, Teddy?\" \nTEDDY (CONT'D) Bruce, is your team still on schedule? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRUCE (ONSCREEN) It'll be tight. But we'll make it. \nTEDDY Nine-month travel time, that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868. Did we get the Botany Team's analysis? \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) They estimate Mark's crops will last him until Sol 912. They grudgingly admit Mark is doing great work. \nMITCH Grudgingly? \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) Mark has a tendency to tell them to have sex with themselves whenever they question one of his decisions. \nTEDDY Get him in line, Vincent. We can't afford any miscommunication. I hate this margin. 912 sols worth of food. We get there on 868. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong... \nEXT/ INT. HAB AIRLOCK - DUSK \nMark finishes putting on his spacesuit. Snaps his helmet into place. Grabs his toolkit. \nMark steps into the airlock. Closes the door behind him. As he does, we begin ANGLING towards the carbon-thread canvas lining the side of the airlock. \nAs the depressurization process begins, the canvas starts to STRETCH... \nAnd the sheet RIPS. \nThe Hab breaches. In one-tenth of a second, the tear travels the length of the airlock -- \nThe full force of the Hab's atmosphere rushes through the breach... \nKAAAA-BOOOOM! \nThe airlock (with Mark in it) is LAUNCHED LIKE A CANNONBALL. It flies forty meters through the air -- \nINT. HAB - DUSK \nQUICK SLO-MO SHOT as the crops inside the HAB are DESTROYED in the depressurization. \nINT/EXT. AIRLOCK - DUSK \nRAMP to regular speed -- \nWHAM! The airlock hits the hillside -- Mark's body SLAMS into the wall -- his faceplate SHATTERS -- the airlock FLIPS and TUMBLES down the hill. Mark is tossed around inside like a ragdoll in a washing machine. \nThe airlock rolls another fifteen meters... \nAnd comes to a stop. \nINT. AIRLOCK - DUSK \nPanicked breaths. Ringing ears. \nMark struggles to stay conscious. His head bleeding. Jesus Christ. What just happened? \nHe looks through the window. Sees the collapsed Hab. The debris of ruined equipment scattering the field between them. \nVINCENT Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: VINCENT (CONT'D) Any bacteria that survived, died in the sub-zero temperatures when exposed to Mars' atmosphere. \nANNIE How long does he have? \nVINCENT He can still eat the potatoes he has, he just can't grow any more. We estimate they'll give him about 200 sols. \nTEDDY And rations get him to what? Sol 409? \nVINCENT (NODS) So with potatoes he can stretch to 609. \nANNIE By Sol 868 he'll be long dead. \nTEDDY We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible. Which changes our travel time. \nMITCH We're working on it. Prelim estimates call for a four-hundred fourteen day trip. \nTEDDY (DOES MATH) It's Sol 135 now. We need thirteen days to mount the boosters and perform inspections. Which gives Bruce and his team... (FUCK) Forty-seven days to make this probe. \nANNIE How long does it normally take? \nVINCENT Six months. Minimum. \nTEDDY I'm gonna let you call Bruce and give him the news. \nINT. JPL BULLPEN - NIGHT \nBruce and his team sit around a speakerphone. They've just hung up with Vincent. Everyone looks suitably SHELLSHOCKED. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRUCE Okay. (LONG PAUSE) Okay. \nEveryone is at a loss for words. You might as well have told this team they have to build a unicorn. \nBRUCE (CONT'D) I'm, uh... I'm gonna need a change of clothes. We're all gonna need a change of clothes. \nEXT. HERMES - SPACE \nThe Hermes continues on its course back to Earth. \nTITLE: SOL 136 \nMARTINEZ (PRELAP) \"Dear Mark...\" \nINT.

Sorry we left you behind on Mars, but we don't like you.\" \nINT. ROVER - NIGHT \nMark reads his email. \nMARTINEZ (V.O.) \"Also, it's a lot roomier on the Hermes without you. We have to take turns doing your tasks, but it's only botany (not real science.) How's Mars?\" \nMark types his response. \nMARK (V.O.) \"Dear Martinez, Mars is fine. I accidentally blew up the Hab, but unfortunately all of Commander Lewis' disco music still survived.\" \nINT. HERMES REC ROOM - SPACE \nMartinez reads Mark's response. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTINEZ \"How's the Hermes? Cramped and claustrophobic?

HAB - DAY \nBack to work. No choice. Mark clears the detritus from inside the Hab. Stares at the hole in the airlock. \nINT./EXT. HAB - DAY \nMark covers the hole with Hab canvas. Begins strapping it in place with duct tape. Doubles up the tape in a circular pattern. Studies his work. It's not pretty, but with a little luck... \nMark repressurizes the Hab. Watches the canvas stretch as the pressure equalizes. He holds his breath... \nThe canvas holds. \nINT. HAB - NIGHT \nMark takes inventory of his remaining potatoes. Outside, gusts of wind slam the canvas. \nMark tries to stay focused on the matter at hand. Tries not to think about the fact that his life is currently held together by duct tape. \nKeep working, Mark... \nINT. JPL - RICH'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nA man sleeps in his office, half-on and half-off his small love seat. He snores ever-so-slightly. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTEDDY It's on me, Vincent. (TO BRUCE) You've got your two weeks. Get it done. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark sits at the table. A ration pack and two potatoes in front of him. He talks to camera. He looks depressed. \nTITLE: SOL 154 \nMARK So. I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food. And this is what \"minimal calorie count\" looks like. (holds up the pack) Standard issue ration. But instead of three every one day, I'm now eating one every three days. (OPENS PACK) Oh good. Meatloaf. \nHe divides the meatloaf into thirds. Sets the majority aside. Focuses on what's left. Which is pathetic. \nMARK (CONT'D) This is today's allotment. Which I will supplement with potatoes. Which I am beginning to hate with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. And now I've been told to do this. \nMark hacks off even more of the meager ration and half of a potato and sets that aside. There's barely anything left. \nMARK (CONT'D) The point is, \"Stretch the rations four more days\" is a real dick-punch. \nThere are also two pills on the table. Mark crushes them. \nMARK (CONT'D) I'm dipping this potato in Vicodin and there's nothing anyone can do about it. \nEXT. CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY \nThe IRIS PROBE, now mounted on the booster, is readied for launch. WATER VAPOR clouds the launchpad. \nThe final SUPPLIES are loaded into the probe. \nINT.

Why hasn't NASA approached us? \nZHU They don't know. Our booster technology is classified. \nGUO So if we do nothing... \nZHU The world would never know we could have helped. \nGUO Then. Merely for the sake of argument, let's say we decide to help them... \nZHU We'd be giving up a booster and effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen. \nGUO considers this.

NASA - TEDDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nWe're SLOWLY PUSHING IN on Teddy as he listens to the voice on the other end of the phone detail the terms. \nTeddy closes his eyes. Relief washes over him. It takes him a moment to realize they're waiting for his answer. \nTEDDY Yes. \nINT. JPL - BULLPEN - DAY \nBruce stands at the white boards, addressing his department heads. He's energized, writing like a madman while he talks: \nBRUCE All right, thanks to our friends in China, we get one more chance at this. We finished the Iris probe in sixty-three days. Now we get to do it again in twenty-eight... \nINT. NASA - SUPER COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nRich Purnell stares at the calculations on the screen. Can these be right? He runs the numbers again.

HAB - DAY/DUSK \nMark trudges out of the airlock, goes about his routine. He walks over to the solar panels, starts to scrub them for (what seems like) the thousandth time... \nAnd stops. \nHe can't do it anymore. He stares at them for a long time. Then drops the brush. \nHe walks to the top of the hill. Sits down. \nHe closes his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nLater. Mark hasn't moved. The sun is beginning to set. The temperature ALARM on his suit is beginning to BLARE. It gets cold FAST on Mars. \nMark overrides the alarm. Sits in the silence. As he glances back towards the setting sun, something METALLIC glints in the dust beneath him. \nHmm. Mark gets up. Walks towards it. It's Vogel's specimen drill. Dropped when the storm hit. Mark looks around, sees the HOLES drilled in the rock formation. \nHis fingers trace the unfinished work. \nHe picks up the drill. \nINT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL - DAY \nSATELLITE VIEW: We can see Mark making his way to the Rover. \nMINDY He's been doing EVAs throughout the day. \nVincent is hovering over Mindy's station. \nMINDY (CONT'D) There's a pattern to them.

HAB - NIGHT \nMark addresses camera while he works at the experiment table, diligently crushing the rock samples and testing them with his chemistry set. Still somber. But he's working. \nMARK We evac'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission... Which means we've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules. For each of us. So. Commander Lewis... your work's in good hands. Beck -- I'll be honest with you, I don't understand chemolithotrophic detection. At all. But I'm doing my best. Johanssen, I know you don't like it when I touch the ChemCam, but guess what? I'm touching the ChemCam. Vogel, I think I've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I've titled \"Das Core Samples\" out of respect for the Fatherland. And Martinez... I still don't know what it is you do.

So, as a result, the MAV for Ares-4 is already waiting at the Schiaparelli Crater. And the plan is to use it to launch me into orbit just as the Hermes is passing. And then, I guess... they catch me? In space. \nMark thinks about that. Grins. Okay, I guess that sounds awesome. \nMARK (CONT'D) Anyway, that's not really my problem right now. First, I have to get there. And it's 3,200 kilometers away. So I have 200 sols to figure out how to bring everything here that's keeping me alive -- the Atmospheric Regulator, the Oxygenator, and the Water Reclaimer -- along for the ride. Luckily, I have the brainpower of the entire planet Earth helping me with this endeavor.

I know what they're doing. They keep repeating \"accelerate faster than any man in the history of space travel\" like this is a good thing, like this'll distract me from how insane their plan is. Oh really? I get to be the fastest man in the history of space travel? You're launching me into space in a convertible. No no, it's worse, because I don't have any controls. You're launching me into space in a tin can. And, by the way, physicists don't even use words like \"fast\" when describing acceleration, so they're only doing it in hopes I won't raise any objections because I like the way \"fastest man in the history of space travel\" sounds.

And it might blow the nose of the ship off in the process. \nJOHANSSEN And... all the air would leave. And we need air. To not die. \nLEWIS We'll seal the bridge and reactor room. We let everywhere else go vacuo. \nMARTINEZ But we'd still have the same problem as Watney. We can't direct the thrust. \nLEWIS We don't have to. The VAL is in the nose. We just point the ship at Mark. \nMARTINEZ (reading the numbers) A breach at the VAL would decelerate us 29 meters per second. \nJOHANSSEN Which gives us a relative velocity of 13 meters per second. \nLEWIS Beck -- you hearing this? \nINT.

The Hermes cannot enter Mars orbit, or they'll never have enough fuel to make it home. The MAV is only designed to get to Low Mars Orbit. So in order for Mark to escape Mars' gravity entirely and intercept the Hermes... \nVINCENT He needs to be going fast. \nBRUCE (NODS) Which means we need to make the MAV lighter. A lot lighter. Five-thousand kilograms lighter. \nVINCENT You can do that? \nBruce gives him a look that says, well, that depends on your definition of \"do that,\" Vincent. He begins to deconstruct a scale model of the MAV: \nBRUCE There were some gimmes right off the bat. The design presumes 500 kilograms of Martian soil and samples. Obviously, we won't do that. \nMITCH There's just one passenger instead of six. With suits and gear, that saves another 500. Then we ditch the life support. We don't need it.

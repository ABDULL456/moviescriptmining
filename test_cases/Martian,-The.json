{"test1_input": "INT. HAB - DAY \nMark cuts each potato into four quarters, making sure each quarter has at least two eyes. \nHe begins planting each potato quarter in nice, orderly rows. As he works, we slowly WIDEN OUT to reveal -- \nThe ENTIRE HAB is now covered in SOIL. Not just the floor -- Mark has cleared every available surface -- bunks, countertops, table -- and covered it with his dirt. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark packs soil on top of one of the crew member's bunks. As he moves the personal items aside, he finds a DATA-STICK. He holds it up and looks at it: hmmmm. CUT TO: \nMark has plugged the data-stick into the computer and is now viewing its contents: old episodes of seventies television. \nMark just sits there. Watching HAPPY DAYS. \nTITLE: SOL 36 \nMARK (PRELAP) The problem is water... \nINT./EXT - ROVER - DAY \nMark trudges out to the Mars Descent Vehicle (MDV) -- the lander that brought the six of them to Mars. He delicately begins to remove the Hydrazine tank from the undercarriage... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK (V.O.) I've created one-hundred and twenty-six square meters of soil. But each cubic meter needs forty liters of water to be farmable. So, I gotta make a lot of water. Fortunately, I know the recipe. Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn. Unfortunately... burn. (THEN) I have hundreds of liters of unused Hydrazine from the MDV. If I run the Hydrazine over an iridium catalyst, it'll separate into N2 and H2... \nINT. HAB - DAY \nScience time. Quick cuts now as Mark shows us how to make water by burning rocket fuel: \n-- Mark duct tapes torn trash-bags to create a tent, which he uses to cover his work table. \n-- He tears an air hose from one of the space suits, tapes it to the tent, hangs it from the roof. Now he has a chimney. \n-- Mark vents pure oxygen from a tank, lights it with a spark from battery wires. Whoosh. Points the flame at the wood shavings. Now he has a small torch. \n-- Mark holds the torch, starts the Hydrazine flow. The Hydrazine sizzles on the iridium and DISAPPEARS. \nFOLLOW Mark's gaze up to the chimney. FLAME BURSTS start sputtering out from the hose. Mark grins. It's working. \nMark checks his instruments. Watches the temperature carefully. Repeats the process. \nWe may also notice Mark is wearing the protective inner lining of his EVA suit. Along with goggles. An oxygen mask hangs around his neck. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark talks directly to camera. We may notice he is standing in the middle of what looks like a mad-scientist's chemistry experiment. \nMARK Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it. Luckily, in the history of humanity, nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMark just stares at the camera. Then continues. \nMARK (CONT'D) Believe it or not, the challenge has been finding something that will hold a flame. NASA hates fire. Because of the whole \"fire makes everyone die in space\" thing. So everything we brought with us is flame retardant. With the notable exception of... Martinez' personal items. \nHe holds up Martinez' pack. Removes a small wooden cross. \nMARK (CONT'D) Sorry, Martinez. If you didn't want me to go through your stuff, you shouldn't have left me for dead on a desolate planet. \nHe starts shaving the cross down with a knife. \nMARK (CONT'D) I figure God won't mind, considering the situation. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark's still at it. He looks exhausted. He goes through the procedure once again. Glances at the atmospheric analyzer. Hm. Is that right? Doesn't give it a second thought. \nHe strikes the torch again... \nBOOM! \nThe explosion is LOUD, FAST, and CONTAINED. It blasts Mark clear across the room. He hits the ground like a wet rag. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark talks to camera. His clothes are somewhat scorched. His hair is singed in patches. \nMARK So. Yes. I blew myself up. (THEN) Best guess? I forgot to account for the excess oxygen I've been exhaling when I did my calculations. Because I'm stupid. \nHe's still dazed. A little out of it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARK (CONT'D) Interesting side note: this is how Jet Propulsion Laboratory was founded. Five guys at Cal Tech were trying to make rocket fuel and nearly burned down their dorm. Rather than expel them, Professor... Von Karman? I want to say... banished them to a nearby farm in Pasadena and told them to keep working. And now we have a space program. (THEN) See? I pay attention. (THEN) I'm gonna get back to work. As soon as my ears stop ringing. \nHe just sits there for a while. \nINT. HAB - DAY \nMark's back at it. He checks his math, adjusts the O2 levels. He glances at camera, then crosses his fingers. Winces as he fires up the torch. \nHe doesn't blow up. Phew. Starts venting the hydrazine. \n", "test1_true": "Later. Mark steps back from the table. Wipes the sweat from his brow. Looks at his hands. Sweat. He walks over to the walls. Sees the condensation. Beads of water everywhere. He traces them with his finger. \nIt's as though he's created a rainforest in his Hab. \nHe walks to the WATER RECLAIMER. Takes the lid off the TANK. \nIt's now FILLED with water. Mark grins. \nTITLE: SOL 48 \nINT. HAB - DAY/NIGHT \nWIDE SHOT: we see the entire Hab. The surfaces covered with soil, the cramped living space, the mad-scientist experiment. \nMark works at the table. And as he does so... we begin to SPEED UP. Time lapse photography: \nMark vents the Hydrazine -- Mark checks his readouts -- Mark collects water from the reclaimer -- Mark spreads the water over his soil -- Mark eats lunch -- Mark goes back to work -- \nMoving faster and FASTER: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMark sleeps -- Mark puts on his spacesuit -- Mark exits the Hab -- Mark brings in more dirt -- Mark vents Hydrazine -- Mark eats -- Mark sleeps -- \nWhile the days FLY BY, we're slowly ANGLING towards the back of the room... \n-- Mark works Mark eats Mark sleeps Mark works -- \nTowards a small patch of SOIL in the corner. We land in CLOSEUP: soil filling the frame. We HOLD. \nAnd after a beat... \nA single, green SPROUT breaks through the soil. \nTITLE: SOL 54 \nCUT TO BLACK. \nEXT. SPACE \nAnd FROM BLACK, we FIND EARTH. The calming blue-greens a welcome reprieve from the fiery reds of Mars. \nEXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY \nTeddy speaks before a memorial. A somber crowd listens in silence. We watch from far away. \nTEDDY Our nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program. His loss will be deeply felt, but the men and women of NASA will soldier forth, onward and upward, unbroken in the mission of their agency. In doing so, they honor the legacy Mark leaves behind, and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain. \nEXT. NASA - DAY \nA MAN walks past the NASA logo greeting visitors at the gate. \nTITLE: JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, HOUSTON, TX \nINT. NASA - DAY \nThe man enters the main lobby. \nTITLE: VINCENT KAPOOR, DIRECTOR OF MARS MISSIONS, NASA \nGuards glance up from the television, nod hello. As Vincent walks through security, we catch a glimpse of their screens: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA CNN TITLE reads: \"President Speaks At Watney Memorial.\" \nINT. NASA - VARIOUS - DAY \nAs Vincent makes his way through NASA, we notice EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING is watching news reports of the Watney service. \nON THE SCREENS: We catch a brief glimpse of a female astronaut floating in zero-g, eulogizing Mark. \nINT. NASA - TEDDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nA man sits at his desk, staring out the window. We recognize him from the beginning of the movie. \nTITLE: TEDDY SANDERS, DIRECTOR OF NASA \nON THE TELEVISION, we see Teddy shake hands with the President at the service. \nVincent gives it a passing glance as he enters. \nVINCENT I thought you gave a lovely speech, by the way. \nNot one for small talk, Teddy gestures for Vincent to hand him the request form he's holding. \nVINCENT (CONT'D) I need you to authorize my satellite time. \nTeddy gives it a quick glance, shakes his head. \nTEDDY It's not gonna happen. \nVINCENT We're funded for five Ares missions. I think I can get Congress to authorize a sixth. \nTEDDY No. \nVINCENT They evac'd after eighteen sols. There's half a mission worth of supplies up there. I can sell another mission at a fraction of the cost. I just need to know what's left of our assets. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 2565, "test2_input": "MARK (CONT'D) In other news, there's been a request for me to pose for a picture on the next transmission. I'm debating between \"High School Senior...\" \nMark leans one elbow against an imaginary pillar and hooks his other thumb on his imaginary belt loops. \nMARK (CONT'D) And \"Coquettish Ingenue...\" \nMark turns his back to camera, looks at us over his shoulder, and bites on his thumb suggestively. \nMARK (CONT'D) But I'm not sure how that will translate with the spacesuit on. (THEN) One big bonus of this NASA communication: Email! Just like the days on the Hermes, I get data dumps. Not just friends and family, but NASA also sends choice messages from the public. Rock stars, athletes, even The President. The coolest one is from my alma mater, the University of Chicago. They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially \"colonized\" it. So, technically, I colonized Mars. (THEN) In your face, Neil Armstrong. \nMUSIC UP: \"Right Back Where We Started From\" by Maxine Nightingale takes us into... \nEXT. HAB - DAY \n-- Mark stands outside in his suit. Positions himself in front of the camera. Holds up a notecard. We're behind him, we don't see what the notecard says. As he poses -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. NASA - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nAnnie tosses a photo on the conference room table: \nMark, in his spacesuit, gives the camera a big thumbs-up. He holds up a note that says, \"Ayyyyyyy!\" \nANNIE I ask for a picture and I get the goddamn Fonz? \nVincent and Bruce are both on monitors from JPL. \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) Just be grateful you got something, Annie. \nANNIE It's not gonna work. I need something with less-Happy-Days and more... Mark's face. \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) I could tell him to take his helmet off, but then he'd, you know, die. \nTEDDY Let's release the photo when we detail the rescue operation. I want to announce we're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window. \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) I'm on a plane to you this afternoon. We'll have the release ready. \nTEDDY Good, but Annie will handle camera appearances. \nVincent gives a look that says \"Et tu, Teddy?\" \nTEDDY (CONT'D) Bruce, is your team still on schedule? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBRUCE (ONSCREEN) It'll be tight. But we'll make it. \nTEDDY Nine-month travel time, that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868. Did we get the Botany Team's analysis? \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) They estimate Mark's crops will last him until Sol 912. They grudgingly admit Mark is doing great work. \nMITCH Grudgingly? \nVINCENT (ONSCREEN) Mark has a tendency to tell them to have sex with themselves whenever they question one of his decisions. \nTEDDY Get him in line, Vincent. We can't afford any miscommunication. I hate this margin. 912 sols worth of food. We get there on 868. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong... \nEXT/ INT. HAB AIRLOCK - DUSK \nMark finishes putting on his spacesuit. Snaps his helmet into place. Grabs his toolkit. \nMark steps into the airlock. Closes the door behind him. As he does, we begin ANGLING towards the carbon-thread canvas lining the side of the airlock. \nAs the depressurization process begins, the canvas starts to STRETCH... \nAnd the sheet RIPS. \nThe Hab breaches. In one-tenth of a second, the tear travels the length of the airlock -- \nThe full force of the Hab's atmosphere rushes through the breach... \nKAAAA-BOOOOM! \nThe airlock (with Mark in it) is LAUNCHED LIKE A CANNONBALL. It flies forty meters through the air -- \nINT. HAB - DUSK \nQUICK SLO-MO SHOT as the crops inside the HAB are DESTROYED in the depressurization. \nINT/EXT. AIRLOCK - DUSK \nRAMP to regular speed -- \nWHAM! The airlock hits the hillside -- Mark's body SLAMS into the wall -- his faceplate SHATTERS -- the airlock FLIPS and TUMBLES down the hill. Mark is tossed around inside like a ragdoll in a washing machine. \nThe airlock rolls another fifteen meters... \nAnd comes to a stop. \nINT. AIRLOCK - DUSK \nPanicked breaths. Ringing ears. \nMark struggles to stay conscious. His head bleeding. Jesus Christ. What just happened? \nHe looks through the window. Sees the collapsed Hab. The debris of ruined equipment scattering the field between them. \n", "test2_true": "Mark wipes the blood from his brow, rolls to his knees. Struggles out of his suit. Checks his wounds. He's alive. \nPsssssshhhhhhhh... \nWhat the hell is that sound? \nAir. \nThe airlock is leaking. \nMark's heart starts to pound. He searches frantically for the leak, checking every seam, every inch of fabric... \nPsssssshhhhhhhh... \nMark checks his arm computer. Oxygen flow steady. This will keep him alive. For now. But he has to find that leak... \nThink, Watney. How do you find an invisible leak? \nHe does an inventory. He has his toolkit. He has the patch kit from his suit. Think, Watney... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIt hits him. \nHe pulls the knife out of the toolkit... \nAnd cuts his own hair. \nHe hacks a chunk clean out of it. Holds the loose hair tight. Then he goes back to the arm computer. BOOSTS the oxygen flow. Now, all I need is a spark... \nYanks the WIRES from the power generator free. Strips the casing. Here goes nothing... \nHe holds the wires in the oxygen flow, rubs them together to create a SPARK. WHOOSH. He lights the hair on fire, creating the key to his plan: \nSMOKE. \nMark holds his breath. Watches the smoke wisp and curl towards the floor... \nHeading right through the microscopic TEAR in the fabric. \nMark grins. I've got you. Goes back to the toolkit. Finds that old stalwart of every NASA space mission: Duct tape. \nHe tears a piece free. Seals the hole. The hissing stops. Mark breathes. Okay... \nNow what? \nCUT TO: \nMark cuts off one of the arms from his EVA suit. Cuts it into one square piece. Opens the patch kit. Works fast to glue the square over the area where the faceplate used to be. Then glues the arm-hole shut. \nCUT TO: \nWHAM! Mark slams his back into the airlock wall, hitting it with enough force so that... \nThe airlock ROLLS. \nIt's clumsy -- like rolling a phone booth from inside -- but it works. The airlock rolls a little less than a meter. \nMark takes a breath. Girds himself to do it again... \nINT/EXT. AIRLOCK/HAB - NIGHT \nThe airlock has traveled the fifty meters so that it's now close to the Hab. \nMark exits the airlock. He's wearing the patched-up suit. Which means his faceplate is completely covered with fabric, and he only has one arm free. \nHe points the free arm in front of him and begins to walk. \nINSIDE THE SUIT: \nMark is using the camera in his arm computer to navigate. The camera projects an image onto the inside of the faceplate. Which is now fabric. It's crude, but it'll work. \nMARK'S POV: Mark hurries through the rip in the airlock. Stumbles through the deflated Hab, past the mess of debris, heading for the bunk. Finds what he's looking for... \nMartinez' SUIT. \nINT. HAB - NIGHT \nMark stands in the center of the Hab. We finally get a good look at it. And it's A MESS. Equipment overturned, debris everywhere. But the worst part? \nMark's crops are RUINED. \nMark stares at the disaster of frozen soil and uprooted plants. All his work. His lifeline. Destroyed. \nHe stares at the mess for a long time. \nThen he begins to clean it up. \nINT. ROVER - NIGHT \nMark sits at the keypad. Takes a moment to compose his words. God, how do I explain this?

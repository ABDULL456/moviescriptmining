Eddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room. Boom. A skip in time. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Then... I found myself at the door. With no consciousness that I had moved. 
He puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he has become. 
LINDY Are you all right? 
He doesn't look all right. 
LINDA When was the last time you ate something? 
Dully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog: 
EDDIE (V.O.) It had been three days. 
INT. THE ORPHEUS ROOM - NIGHT 
Eddie sits at a table, discreetly wolfing a few appetizers. Kevin Doyle arrives, looking a little nervous. 
KEVIN Hey. 
He sits, launches in. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) He'll be here in ten. Now look, since we have a minute, be warned: Van Loon's mercurial. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: KEVIN (CONT'D) One minute your best friend, the next...you're a leper. And he needs direct answers... anything tentative and you've lost him forever. I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.. 
EDDIE I'm eating, Kevin. 
There is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again. 
KEVIN You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line HERE- 
EDDIE Have a toast point. 
Brazening it out again. Because Eddie isn't sure he can pull this off either. 
ACROSS THE ROOM - LATER 
There is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man. 
EDDIE'S TABLE -LATER 
The martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE, does the same. 
VAN LOON So. Eddie Morgan. 
He looks Eddie directly in the eyes. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) What's your secret? 
A beat. Eddie looks at him back, directly in the eyes. 
EDDIE Medication. I'm on special medication. 
Another beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT 
Eddie is in mid-spiel, Van Loon listening intently. 
EDDIE --Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING-- 
PIERCE (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) Pattern recognition? So that's your snake-oil? Look, if there's one thing we all understand, it's understanding itself --that's how the business works... (SCOFFING) Pattern recognition. Please. 
EDDIE (POINTEDLY) Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns. 
Kevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights: 
EDDIE (CONT'D) Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze. 
PIERCE Until they weren't. 
EDDIE Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works. 
PIERCE (SCOFFING) And you have a formula. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KEVIN (MEDIATING) Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days-- 
EDDIE Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce. 
PIERCE (SNORTING) Delusions of grandeur. 
EDDIE I don't have delusions of grandeur. 
A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I have an actual recipe for grandeur.

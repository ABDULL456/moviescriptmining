PASSAGEWAY B - DAY 2A                                                               2A Jimmy follows Anton in a walk `N Talk. The walls have yellow blast shields over the windows. ANTON Jimmy Anderson, United Spaceworkers Orbital 108 since 2147, allergic to pollen. Certified level... nine rating? JIMMY Engineer level nine rating. Anton is unimpressed. Jimmy stops to poke a panel with a loose wire. ANTON Level 9 engineers aren't rated for central systems repair. JIMMY No, they are. I am. Do you want me to go back? Anton corners Jimmy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   4. \nANTON We got you up here, I'll put you to work. JIMMY Great. This is my first orbital assignment. ANTON Let me clue you in. Up here the work never stops. There's always orbital debris piling up and someone has to be in each sector with a line of sight on it to keep launch vectors clear. Do you follow me? JIMMY No problem chief. ANTON I'm not a chief I'm a Captain. JIMMY Sorry, Captain. They keep walking, reaching the junction at the end. ANTON Just make sure you finish by zero eight hundred Zulu. I'm not signing overtime forms. Do you know how to fix mess hall food dispensers? JIMMY No. Maybe. What's the matter? ANTON All it's giving is sandwiches. That's your next job after the mainframe. \nOMITTED \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY Computer monitors with important data cover the walls, there are six stations with rotating chairs and an island of consoles in the middle. Flight Specialist TILDA GENERO (25) has her feet up, headphones on. The door opens and Jimmy follows Anton into the control room. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   5. \nANTON The terminal on the fritz is over there. Jimmy sees Tilda. ANTON (CONT'D) That's Lieutenant Tilda Genero. You don't need to talk to her. Tilda glances at him and turns her chair away from him. Jimmy drags his suitcase, hitting everything, and dumps out electronic junk near the terminal. He opens up a panel near a screen showing static. JIMMY There's your problem. Jimmy digs around in the panel with wires sticking out. ANTON And the sonovac coffee machine is malfunctioning. Can you fix that? JIMMY I don't know. I might have to take the mainframe offline to fix this- ANTON Whatever, get it done. Anton goes to another terminal and uses the computer. JIMMY What's his problem? Tilda ignores him. JIMMY (CONT'D) I said, what's his problem? ... I guess you can't hear me with your headphones on. TILDA I can hear you. \nOMITTED Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   6. \nINT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY An intercom on the wall next to a bunch of bubbles. VALENTINA NOVAK (33) takes a bubble bath in a water tank, with a rubber duck. A towel is hung on equipment nearby. Anton sounds like he puts the mic too close to his mouth. ANTON (O.S.) Valentina to the control room immediately please. Valentina to the control room. GROUND CONTROL (O.S.) How about you just take a pod out there and pick up the debris? She turns to listen to the voices on the intercom. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   9. \nANTON (O.S.) We don't take pods out for class two debris. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY Continuous. Anton practically eats a headset microphone. ANTON Sanitation Station Regina out. Anton switches off the radio. ANTON (CONT'D) Morons. TILDA Did he just tell us to take a pod to look for a class 2 object? Jimmy hangs out next to Tilda. JIMMY Do you know where can I get lunch? TILDA Mess hall. JIMMY Can you show me the way? ANTON Oh, you'd like lunch? Know what I'd like? I'd like my computer fixed right now. Fix it. JIMMY Ok Anton. ANTON That's Captain Balvenie. \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY The cargo drone ship cruises along. It's approaching the metal screw floating in space. SMASH - the drone hits the screw and EXPLODES. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   10. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY Red lights and indicators flash. A siren sounds. Tilda and Anton leap into action at the controls. Jimmy comes over. JIMMY What's that? Is everything ok? TILDA Collision detected. Secondary explosion. Reading a level six debris field out there. Lots of it. ANTON Are there any salvage crews in the sector? TILDA Nope. But they're scrambling two teams. They must really want the pod. ANTON You think there's something good in there? TILDA That's my bet. ANTON Well I'm calling it. VALENTINA (O.S.) What happened? Is that the collision alarm? ANTON Match orbit and position for pod launch. Run the checklist. Valentina report to airlock two. We're going fishing. Anton runs out. \nINT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY The siren sounds over the intercom. Valentina towels off. She zips up her jumpsuit and runs out. \nGROUND CONTROL (O.S.) Sanitation Pod, do not approach the debris field. The area will be salvaged by an authorized crew. Repeat; do not approach the cargo drone debris field, this now is a secure sector. ANTON Ground control, this is our sector and we need to keep this space clear. We got all kinds of transports coming through today. GROUND CONTROL (O.S.) Negative. Stand down- Anton turns off the radio. ANTON They really want whatever was on that shuttle. It's going to be good. Anton pulls out sandwiches from a pouch with difficulty and eats. VALENTINA Did you bring one for me? Anton hands her a sandwich. VALENTINA (CONT'D) Veggie? Have you got ham? ANTON You got the good space suit. Valentina looks at him, stops steering the pod. ANTON (CONT'D) Fine. God damn it. Take the ham. He gives her the ham sandwich. They eat and fly the pod. \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY The pod scoots through a cloud of junk and boxes floating and spinning in space. \nOMITTED Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   14. \nINT. WASS ORBITAL SANITATION POD - DAY Anton and Valentina flip switches and use joysticks. ANTON Almost full. Lets dump this load and try for another pass. VALENTINA Got it. Closing the hatch. Hatch secure. Looks like there may be an active energy source in there. A clunk noise. Anton checks his watch. ANTON It's fine. Skip the safety check, we've got two minutes left. Once it's onboard, it's ours. \nOMITTED SCENES 22-23 \nINT. STORAGE MODULE - DAY The room has salvage bins, heavy machinery, gamma ray detectors, piles of cables and garbage everywhere. Large pieces of burned space junk dump into the room through a hatch. Gary's Time Cube falls in. It glows ominous blue. It starts to HUMM. A FLASH OF LIGHT ripples out of the box! \nINT. PASSAGEWAY B - DAY 30A                                                               30A Jimmy walking looking for Tilda hears A SCREAM O.S. He goes around a corner at the end of the hall where it came from. \nINT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY 30B                                                               30B Tilda2's arms framed, stuffing a female human leg into a hatch marked ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING. She bends down and picks up a clean dry Tilda jumpsuit off the floor. Around the corner in a different area of the room, Jimmy pokes his head in and looks around. JIMMY Tilda? Jimmy finds a way around a large machine just as Tilda2 zips up her jumpsuit, facing away. She has strange geometric lines like tatoos on her back. He's struck by her picturesque beauty and doesn't realize he's staring. She turns and meets eyes with him. He's very embarrassed and ducks back behind the machine. JIMMY (CONT'D) Is this the laundry room? I was looking for the mess hall. Sorry if I surprised you. I thought I heard something. I didn't see anything. The heavy machinery starts grinding and humming. CRUNCHING, SAWING AND SPLATTERING SOUNDS. The light turns from red to green. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   18. \nJIMMY (CONT'D) Okay well I'll see you on the bridge. Sorry. Jimmy turns and starts to head out, bumping into Tilda2 with a start. She's different; dissociated, laconic, very nervous. JIMMY (CONT'D) I was just going. Tilda2 (henceforth \"Tilda\") stares at him, shivering. JIMMY (CONT'D) Hey, what's the matter? Jimmy pats her shoulder. She looks up and they meet eyes. JIMMY (CONT'D) Are you ok? She turns and runs away. Jimmy watches her go out the hatch. JIMMY (CONT'D) You forgot your shoes! Jimmy picks up some sneakers. He doesn't notice blood dripping out from below the organic waste reprocessor as he goes. \nINT. STORAGE MODULE - DAY The HUMMING SOUND again: The Time Cube sits in deep shadows, glowing with faint blue light - the light dims and the humming stops. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY The wall is marked W.E.N.D.I. Orbital Station System Computer. Jimmy sits next to the computer with Tilda's sneakers. Wendi has a female voice this scene only. Jimmy hits buttons on the keyboard. The computer turns on. JIMMY Wendi? WENDI (O.S.) Hello Jimmy. JIMMY Where is the laundry room? WENDI (O.S.) Deck C. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   19. \nJIMMY Does Tilda have a boyfriend? The intercom buzzes. Anton voice is distorted to the edge of comprehensibility. ANTON (O.S.) Jimmy, how are the repairs coming? Jimmy? Get on the intercom Jimmy. JIMMY Anton? ANTON (O.S.) You'd better be getting all over this mainframe problem. I want hourly reports every half hour. JIMMY I can't understand- ANTON Just get on it, God damn it! JIMMY Roger that. Jimmy opens the top binder from a tall stack of binders. The screen turns off. JIMMY (CONT'D) Wendi? He hits buttons. It doesn't work now. \nINT. ENGINEERING MODULE - NIGHT Tilda pokes a water filtration system. A sign says DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE. She pokes the wires. A SNAP of high voltage short circuit. She takes out her finger, it's burnt a little. She pokes the power box again, searching and exploring, unfamiliar with the world around her and troubled. \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy, Anton and Val play scrabble. Val makes a word. VALENTINA \"Giraffe.\" Eighteen points. Anton writes down the score. Jimmy turns the board to face him. Jimmy places tiles as he eats his soy protein sandwich. He spells \"blorxr\" and writes down his points. Valentina eyeballs him. Anton rotates the game board. He ponders what word to make. He moves his letters around. VALENTINA (CONT'D) That's not a word. JIMMY Do I have to play? ANTON We need to take breaks. Keep to a schedule. Schedule says scrabble. How's your sandwich? JIMMY Not very good. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   23. \nANTON Well that's all there is until breakfast tomorrow. JIMMY What's for breakfast? ANTON Sandwiches. VALENTINA Thirty seconds Anton. JIMMY Is there anything to eat besides sandwiches? ANTON Can you repair food dispensers? JIMMY No. ANTON Well then there's nothing else. VALENTINA Twenty seconds. ANTON So Jimmy, is there someone back on earth waiting for you? JIMMY Yes. I have a girlfriend. ANTON Do you actually have a girlfriend? JIMMY There's a girl I'm friends with, I was planning on asking her to out. ANTON Are you actually friends? JIMMY We know each other. I know her. VALENTINA Times up Anton. Minus one point. Tilda comes in and looks through the cupboards in the kitchen. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   24. \nANTON Hi Tilda. Want a sandwich? We saved you the pickled onion and cheese. She ignores them. ANTON (CONT'D) What are you looking for? What's she looking for? VALENTINA Fifteen seconds overtime. Hurry up and make a word. ANTON I'm making a word. Tilda knocks little containers around searching the cupboards. She carelessly knocks things off the shelf. VALENTINA Five seconds. ANTON Tilda would you stop making that racket? What the hell are you looking for? VALENTINA You need to make decisions faster. ANTON I don't rush into things and make irrational snap decisions, like some people. VALENTINA Leaving you isn't a snap decision. ANTON It's totally inexplicable. Jimmy gets up. JIMMY You guys need a minute? ANTON Sit down. We're playing scrabble. A FLASH outside the window. Tilda turns, very scared, and looks out the window. Jimmy goes to the window next to her. JIMMY What was that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   25. \nSMASH! The sound of an impact, like a car accident. The room trembles. METAL CREAKING NOISES. Things jiggle and fall off the shelves. Tilda stares at Jimmy, scared. Val and Anton are bracing themselves for more. The shaking stops. ANTON That was an impact. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Red lights blink, warnings flash on monitors. Valentina and Anton run in and sit, hit buttons. Jimmy takes a station and presses buttons too, scared. ANTON Pressure nominal. Jimmy, check the CNW3. That thing there. JIMMY I don't know what I'm looking at. ANTON Orbital position? Jimmy? JIMMY Orbital position is... ANTON The other console. JIMMY Got it. The fail-safe thrusters kicked in. Orbit is stable. Tilda comes in and sits at a console, hits buttons. VALENTINA Nice of you to join us, Tilda. Valentina looks through binders stacked on a shelf, finds one, pulls it, and flips to a page. ANTON Collision checklist? VALENTINA Working on it. ANTON Where did it hit us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -     11/12/11   26. \nJimmy looks at the ducks. JIMMY They're not identical. See? Tilda comes between them and checks out the ducks urgently. Jimmy leans in next to her. JIMMY (CONT'D) What is it Tilda? ANTON Do you know something about this? Tilda walks away. VALENTINA Has she said anything today? ANTON Not to me. VALENTINA She's acting weird. ANTON I hadn't noticed. \nOMITTED SCENES 46-47 \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY The station's orbit comes into the sunlight. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS ~ JIMMY'S ROOM - DAY Jimmy wakes up. His clock says \"06:00\". He has bed-head. \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - DAY Anton practices martial arts with multiple styles in his karate gear. Jimmy passes by, gets a sandwich. ANTON Your shift started ten minutes ago. Valentina sips coffee at the table as Jimmy walks past. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   29. \nVALENTINA Coffee machine is still broken. It barely made one cup so there's nothing left for you. Fix it today please. Jimmy walks past Val's room, glances in. From his pov sees... \nOMITTED \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT [No yellow shields on windows.] Jimmy wanders down the hall, wearing one of Anton's jumpsuits, reading the technical binder. It's darker. Tilda is standing looking out the window into space, with her reflection in the glass. JIMMY Hi Tilda. Trouble sleeping? Tilda looks at him. JIMMY (CONT'D) Want to play scrabble? \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 57A                                                              57A Tilda and Jimmy are in the middle of a scrabble game. JIMMY What's happening to us Tilda? What's with the rubber ducks? She looks at him. JIMMY (CONT'D) Anton thinks you're space-crazy. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   33. \nTilda makes the word \"oxyphenbutazone\" and looks at him. JIMMY (CONT'D) Sometimes you do seem kind of distant. Tilda turns the board to face her. JIMMY (CONT'D) I guess you're just dealing with things in your own way. Tilda has an idea! She grabs all the tiles and starts making words. SECRET. INTRUDER ON BOARD. DANGER. Jimmy leans over looking. Tilda is very serious. Anton leans in (out of nowhere). ANTON You have to connect the words. Jimmy knocks the board up in nervous reaction to hide the message. ANTON (CONT'D) Did I startle you? I'm everywhere Jimmy. I've got my eye on you. Is that my jumpsuit? Who said you could wear my jumpsuit? JIMMY I didn't pack anything else. ANTON You have to earn that uniform. You can't just put it on. Wash it carefully, fold it and put it back. Jimmy gets up, hesitantly leaves Tilda. ANTON (CONT'D) And you, shape up. Anton goes to his quarters. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS ~ ANTON'S ROOM - NIGHT Valentina looks at her 2 rubber ducks, Anton comes in. ANTON What is so special about that rubber duck? Why do you keep it around? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   33A. \nVALENTINA Fond memories. ANTON Fond? Anton takes one and looks at the V+G written on the bottom. VALENTINA Yes. What's wrong with that? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -     11/12/11   34. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS ~ VALENTINA'S ROOM - NIGHT Anton sits with his back to Valentina. They're not talking. Valentina continues to fix up after just having a bath. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -     11/12/11   45. \nANTON Lets put the Gary stuff aside. Maybe you used to see him, maybe you were just friends, whatever. The important thing is you're over him and you're with me now. Lets not fight like this. VALENTINA You're right Anton. Anton is encouraged by her sweet voice and friendly tone. ANTON Good. VALENTINA What's the point of me fighting with a shit for brains, whiney little half pint control freak with no balls, stinky stupid fuck with no sense of style, charm or personal hygiene. ANTON So you don't want    to talk right now. I'm going to    go get a cup of coffee. Why don't    you adjust your attitude and join    me when you're ready. Anton goes. \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 85A                                                                85A Continued. Jimmy sits next to Tilda. TILDA I'm a robot. JIMMY You are? Tilda puts her finger near Jimmy's arm. A small spark jumps. JIMMY (CONT'D) Ow. Do that again. She does it again. JIMMY (CONT'D) Ow. Stop. TILDA I run on electricity. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   45A. \nJIMMY Do it again. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT The Rubber Duckie (duck1) At Anton's keyboard. SLOW KEYBOARD TYPING SOUNDS. ECU from below: The rubber duckie's eyes darting left and right with the keyboard sounds. It's typing something, while breathing asthmatically. It drips some slime. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   46. \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy eats a sandwich at the table next to Tilda. Anton comes in and tries again to make a cup of coffee. JIMMY Tilda's a robot. ANTON No she isn't. JIMMY I'm pretty sure she is. Valentina comes in, sees the Time Cube glowing. Anton pulls out a chair for her. VALENTINA Nice to hear you speaking again Tilda. Valentina sits away from Anton. TILDA I've never spoken before today. Where I come from, we don't need to speak. VALENTINA We've all heard you speak. TILDA I've come from a mirror universe. ANTON Since when? JIMMY It's okay, tell them what you told me. TILDA Someone has been travelling across parallel universes causing disaster on a galactic scale. Our Earth is almost completely destroyed. (MORE) Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   47. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 87D                                                               87D Cutting back to Val and Gary having their chat. Val is more relaxed, starting to take this in stride. VALENTINA How did this happen, Gary? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -     11/12/11   51. \nGARY There was an accident. The cube was activated in my escape and I was shunted through a dimensional vortex into this stupid body. But I was on my way here for you. VALENTINA For me? GARY I promised you that one day I'd give you the world. I came here to keep that promise. I can take you away from all this. VALENTINA Gary... That was years ago. GARY Until I can activate the time cube I will continue to bleed across the dimensional boundary... I don't know what I will become. VALENTINA That sounds painful. GARY It's very painful. I need your help Valentina. There isn't much time. ALARMS GO OFF - RED SIREN LIGHTS. Valentina turns to look around. She turns back and Gary is gone. VALENTINA Gary? \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 87E                                                                87E Continued scene of Anton, Tilda and Jimmy. The RED CHERRY LIGHTS turn on here as they just did in the control room. ANTON What the hell is going on now? TILDA Gary must be onboard. This is how it begins. I'm already too late. Tilda sits on the floor depressed. Anton goes. ANTON I'm going to the control room. You keep an eye on... the robot. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   51A. \nJIMMY She has a name. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   52. \nANTON I'm telling you, if that son of a bitch is on my station I'm going to find him. You two stay put. Anton leaves. Jimmy sits next to Tilda. JIMMY Hey. What's the matter? TILDA The cube has been activated. There's nothing I can do to stop it. Infinite universes will be destroyed. JIMMY We can try. Look, last week I never thought I'd be working orbit. Everyone told me it was impossible. I didn't have the training. I didn't have the stomach. People said, that Jimmy, he's never getting off Earth. But I got myself together and paid a guy a hundred and fifty bucks to forge my certification forms and the next thing you know, here I am. TILDA I didn't mean to kill her. The other Tilda. JIMMY I'm sure you didn't. Hey, lets go use Wendi's cameras to see if we can find Gary if he's on board. TILDA Ok. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY B - NIGHT 87F                                                               87F Tilda and Jimmy walk with the Time Cube. Tilda stops. TILDA You're nice. JIMMY I'm glad you can speak. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   53. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Val and Anton sit at the controls as the room shakes. Evil metal creaking noises tear through. Alarms sound. More screens turn to static and garbled. VALENTINA Anton? ANTON Something is definitely wrong. Check the air pressure. VALENTINA Anton! ANTON What? VALENTINA Okay. I haven't been totally honest. ANTON Oh? The rubber duck (duck 2) scuttles across the floor behind them but Anton doesn't see it. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   56. \nVALENTINA Gary is onboard. ANTON Where is the bastard? How the hell did he get on the station? VALENTINA You brought him in. ANTON When did I do that? Valentina notices that Gary (Duck 2) is in front of Anton, hiding on a shelf, dripping slime. VALENTINA He's just come for the time cube. That's all he needs to get back to his dimension and put things right. Its eyes glow faintly red. ANTON Sure. Naturally. He just wants his time cube. He's not interested in you? VALENTINA He's the only one that can send us home and set things right. Anton follows her gaze and sees the duck there. ANTON What the hell is that? Anton moves around and slowly approaches it. He takes out his laser blaster and charges it. The Duck cowers and backs deeper into the corner of the shelf. ANTON (CONT'D) Anton, you're scaring him. ANTON (CONT'D) Him? Hello little guy. Don't be afraid. We mean you no harm. Hey there. Val what the hell is this thing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   57. \nHe gets ready to fire. VALENTINA That's Gary. Anton slowly moves closer to it. ANTON What? This thing? Anton points his laser. Gary trembles with fear. VALENTINA No! Anton pulls the trigger. It goes click click. ANTON That's odd. The batteries must be- Gary LEAPS at Anton's head. They crash through the room as it attacks him. Papers fly from binders thrown around. Anton screams. The laser pistol is knocked to the floor, broken. Blood splatters against a console, and across Valentina's face. Val screams, staring at the off-screen attack. Anton is thrown down, he turns around and tries to see where the duck is. He's scratched up. It scuttles away down the hall behind him, out of his sight. ANTON (CONT'D) Where did that little bastard go? \nOMITTED \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Valentina pulls a first-aid kit off the wall and opens it. Anton has a trivial cut on his head. ANTON It sure is strong for a little guy. VALENTINA I told you to be careful. ANTON Why didn't you just tell me about him? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   58. \nVALENTINA I tried to tell you. Valentina cleans his cut. She digs through the kit for tape. VALENTINA (CONT'D) How is your head? ANTON It hurts. Valentina sticks a band-aid on Anton. ANTON (CONT'D) Did you know what this thing was when we brought it on board? VALENTINA No, of course not. ANTON Look what he did. VALENTINA He was frightened. ANTON Whose side are you on? A noise down the hall. Anton pulls the handlebar off the elliptical exercise machine and holds it like a club as he goes to one side of the room next to the hall. ANTON (CONT'D) Can you see it? VALENTINA No. Anton peeks down the hall quickly. He reaches to draw his laser blaster - his holster is empty. ANTON Something is coming. Stay back. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   59. \nJIMMY No lasers? Microwave rifles? ANTON Laser's broke. Make do. Jimmy grabs the pieces of the broken laser pistol, plastic knives and half a sandwich in his pockets, then puts the Time Cube into a backpack. Anton takes the backpack. ANTON (CONT'D) I'll take that. Jimmy lets him have it. ANTON (CONT'D) I'll keep it safe. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY B ~ INTERSECTION - NIGHT Anton, Val, Jimmy, Tilda walk into the four-way intersection, then pair off in different directions. Anton has his backpack. \nINT. AIRLOCK MODULE - NIGHT Valentina comes in, looks around. She pokes the space suits. VALENTINA Gary? Anton pokes his head in. ANTON Val? VALENTINA Did you see him? ANTON No. We should split up. Use the intercom if you find him. VALENTINA What are you going to do with him Anton? ANTON I'm going to ask him nicely to stop destroying my space station for starters. That's reasonable isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   64. \nVALENTINA I suppose. ANTON Then I'm going to kill him as hard as I can. \nINT. STORAGE MODULE - NIGHT Anton searches through the room. He's jumpy. Scratched up papers, claw marks, burns, broken pieces of equipment. Slime trails. He bumps into a hanging cable, startling him. But it's not a tentacle, it's just a cable. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy walks through with Tilda. The computers buzz and lights blink. They look around for Gary cautiously. TILDA Jimmy? Wait. JIMMY What is it? Tilda gives Jimmy a little kiss. Suddenly his eyes open wide as something happens when their lips touch, time slows down and everything gets brighter, fades to: \nTILDA I'm accessing Wendi's backup system. JIMMY I mean what are you doing with that RS232 cable? Numbers flash on the screen. WENDI (O.S.) Hello Tilda. TILDA Hello Wendi. Central logic processor is up. All systems are online - the control interface has been disconnected. Tilda keeps accessing the computer with her brain. TILDA (CONT'D) It was the duck. JIMMY Gary? What is it trying to do? TILDA Look. The monitor shows a wire-frame diagram of the space station in motion, with trajectories and readings. A red circular line indicates the orbit of the station, and it intersects with Earth. The little icon of the station is slowly moving on that line toward the `red zone'. \"WARNING\" text blinks. TILDA (CONT'D) The station's orbit has been altered. We're going to hit the atmosphere. JIMMY How long do we have? TILDA About twenty eight minutes. JIMMY Are you sure? She's sure. Jimmy hits the intercom. JIMMY (CONT'D) Anton? Anton? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   68. \nTILDA The intercoms are locked out. We have to get to the control room. Tilda turns away, unplugs the cable with a shiver and pulls the cable out of her pants. She zips up. JIMMY You're going to have to explain that later. Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out. A spark jumps between their hands. JIMMY (CONT'D) Ow! TILDA Oh Jimmy. You don't have a static discharge buffer. You're completely made of meat. JIMMY Meat that loves you, Tilda. TILDA It may not be possible for us to overcome our physiological differences in this universe. JIMMY It sure would be fun to try. Tilda smiles in agreement. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Valentina looks under the communications equipment. There's a half-open compartment at the end of the room, filled with deep shadows. A wall panel is also open. She moves slowly toward it. She peeks in the wall panel. It's empty. She moves on toward the other compartment. Valentina reaches slowly toward the open compartment, her heart racing. VALENTINA Gary? Are you there Gary? We have to talk. She opens the compartment - just a pair of dusty headphones inside. She relaxes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   69. \nJimmy runs in, startling her. She bangs her head on the control panel. VALENTINA (CONT'D) AHHHH! JIMMY AHHHHHH! Valentina punches his face. VALENTINA AHHHH! JIMMY OW! VALENTINA What are you doing? JIMMY Ow. Stop. VALENTINA You scared the crap out of me. JIMMY Where's Anton? VALENTINA We split up. What are you doing here? JIMMY We're falling out of orbit. Gary's done something to the guidance system. Have you found him? VALENTINA He's not between here and engineering. JIMMY Then there's only one place left he could be. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS ~ VALENTINA'S ROOM - NIGHT Anton is looking at shady spots under the sleeping cots, holding the elliptical machine handle as a club. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   70. \nThe room is full of dark corners; each one seems to hold the promise of aliens bursting out. Anton explores cautiously. TILDA (O.S.) Anton! Anton spins around. Tilda points past him. Anton looks. The rubber duck is on the shelf! Anton smashes it with the handle! ANTON Got it! He stomps on it. Squeak Squeak. Squeak. TILDA That's not it. ANTON Oh. Anton lifts his foot. It squeaks. ANTON (CONT'D) It's the normal one. A SCUTTLING SOUND behind them. They turn and look. TILDA Did you hear that? Anton goes to her. They catch a glimpse of tentacle poking out of Anton's room. It disappears around the corner. TILDA (CONT'D) It's horrible. ANTON Tilda, get back. He hands her the backpack with the Time Cube. Tilda takes it and backs away. \nGary leans out for a moment (duck3) revealing a little more of himself and then slinks back. VALENTINA (CONT'D) You're mutating faster and faster. GARY (O.S.) I could put everything back the way it was. Would you want that? Would you want to keep living on this rusty space dumpster, forever? With this Anton guy? Valentina looks into the shadowy dark. VALENTINA You didn't need to hurt him Gary. Gary's eyes glimmer in the darkness. Some tentacle too. GARY (O.S.) Come with me. We will return to Earth, to the dawn of man. There we will lay the foundations of a million-year dynasty, and rule an empire over all space and time. We will dominate the galaxy together. VALENTINA Together? GARY (O.S.) Once I have the time cube, the universe is ours. Valentina, I came here for you. I did this all for you. VALENTINA That's so sweet. She decides to step into the darkness. A tentacle wraps around her as she disappears into the dark. \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Tilda opens the medical kit, snaps on rubber gloves and straps on a surgical mask. Jimmy brings napkins. She goes the monitor near the hallway. Tilda presses buttons on the screen. The monitor screen says \"MEDICAL DATABASE DOWNLOAD\" Space Milkshake Prod.

RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Tilda slices, stitches and sews fast. Blood splatters against Tilda from Anton's mouth. She squints and keeps working. The room shimmies and shakes. \nINT. STORAGE MODULE - NIGHT A glimpse of Gary scampering out of the open hatch where he was trapped before, leaving a slime trail. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Tilda finishes binding Valentina to a chair with tape. VALENTINA Give Gary the time cube. You don't know him like I know him. He'll help us. He'll save us. Tilda is not convinced. Jimmy is on the soldering damaged circuits in a the control panel. He wears safety goggles. The Time Cube sits on the floor behind him. JIMMY He's a monster. VALENTINA It's just a phase. Jimmy closes the console he's working on. Presses buttons. The room shifts to the left. TILDA We're entering the upper atmosphere. Jimmy stands up. Jimmy wipes the sweat off his face. JIMMY That's bad, isn't it? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   77. \nTILDA We have fifteen minutes. JIMMY There's too much damage to fix in fifteen minutes. TILDA Maybe we should try to make a deal. A low RUMBLE sound. JIMMY We can't allow Gary to have total control of time and space. Jimmy gets back down into the computer panel. Tilda kneels next to him, watching. Valentina looks at the Time Cube on the floor and wriggles in her duct tape bonds. \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT The station starts to hit the atmosphere and shake. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy and Tilda press buttons and flip switches on the consoles as they talk. The room shimmies and shakes more and more. The RUMBLE sound increases. Jimmy turns one more switch. BLEEP BLORP: the computer screen flickers on. TILDA Wendi is online. JIMMY We're falling Wendi. Correct our orbital position. WENDI (O.S.) I do not have full control of Station systems. There is a break in the control path to my logic core. JIMMY Is anything working? WENDI (O.S.) Rebooting and Reinitialization will take approximately three hours. JIMMY We have... fourteen minutes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11    78. \nTILDA Leave Wendi to me. Jimmy reaches into an open mess of cables in a compartment and tosses Tilda an RS232 cable. She turns away from him, unzips her jumpsuit and plugs in her plug as before once Jimmy stops staring. Jimmy goes under the central console and sneaks glances to figure out what exactly she's doing. She zips up again with the cable sticking out, and concentrates. The monitors flash on. Jimmy spills out the tool box, grabs tools and sticks his head back under the central console. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy reaches as far as humanly possible with his logic probe and touches a difficult-to-reach circuit way in the back, in a maze of jumbled blinking lights, cables and circuits: JIMMY There's your problem. He pulls out a smoldering burned circuit. JIMMY (CONT'D) The midrange data processor is burned out. I think we need it to control the thrust vector. TILDA You can't fix it? JIMMY No way. No... I don't have the parts. This is serious. JIMMY (CONT'D) We're dead. TILDA No we're not. The room shakes more. Tilda unplugs the RS232 cable from the wall and grabs a cable cutter from Jimmy's belt. She pulls down her jumpsuit shoulder exposing her back tattoo lines again. Jimmy watches in fascination. Tilda jabs herself and cuts a 6 inch hole in her abdomen. There's no blood. She reaches in and feels around. JIMMY I wish you would warn me if you're going to do something like that. TILDA Wait... Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   81. \nTilda grunts and grimaces - something rips and her hand comes out with an organic/electric device with blinking lights. Wires and cables poke out of the hole in her stomach and drip with goo, she tucks them back in painfully with one hand and holds herself closed as she hands the device to Jimmy. TILDA (CONT'D) Try using this. Jimmy takes it with a mixture of horror and curiosity. JIMMY Don't you need it? TILDA I have two of them. Jimmy notices Valentina is gone. JIMMY Where's Val? Tilda turns. TILDA The time Cube! JIMMY Hold on, let me plug this in. Jimmy ducks back under   the panel and stuffs the strange device into the socket   of the circuit board. Sparks fly and lights start blinking!   The SOUND of the midrange data processor humming back   to life. Green lights on monitors. Jimmy clamps alligator clips around a broken cable and scrambles up. The monitor screens show green blinking symbols. Tilda uses a staple gun to close her wound, showing no sign of pain, tucks away her RS232 cable and zips up. JIMMY (CONT'D) It worked! Jimmy sees one monitor still shows ERROR. JIMMY (CONT'D) It's not working. TILDA Thruster control is on a different circuit. It's still offline. Tilda sinks into a chair. The effort has worn her down. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   82. \nJIMMY It should have worked. TILDA There's another break in the control path. JIMMY Are you okay? TILDA I'll be okay. But there's only one way to target the thrusters. JIMMY How? TILDA Manually. JIMMY You mean outside? TILDA Yes outside. The digital vector diagram monitor shows their orbit falling into the `danger zone' past the `K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line'. Jimmy sees Tilda suffer. JIMMY Take this. Jimmy hands Tilda Anton's blaster - Jimmy found time to repair it with wires, duct tape, and junk. TILDA You'll need it. JIMMY I'll be ok. Jimmy gets up to go, summons his courage. TILDA Jimmy, in ten minutes the outer hull will burn away completely. Hurry. JIMMY It's go time. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT Cables are loose, hanging, red siren lights. The walls rattle.

VALENTINA Gary loves me. He loves me in ways you couldn't understand. ANTON I thought we've had some good times. Anton notices Gary (duck 3) lurking in the hall. ANTON (CONT'D) Gary? I'll kick your ass. Anton struggles to sit up. He falls back down. Val puts down the time cube on the counter and helps Anton settle down. VALENTINA Gary! I have the Time Cube! Gary stays in the shadows, nearby. We can see him quiver and jiggle as he speaks, suggestions of a jaw moving, but lots of amorphous tentacles and bulging monstrous shapes. GARY (O.S.) Before we go, one last thing. VALENTINA What? GARY (O.S.) Kill him. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   84. \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT Jimmy at the thruster, he grips the joystick, feeling woozy. JIMMY Here goes nothing. He's sweating profusely. He looks at his glove - it's burning. There's orange-glowing cinders flying off his boots. Jimmy hits the big red button! A BLAST OF PLASMA fires out of the thruster next to him. (Wide shot) Over the course of five long seconds, the station stops falling. The thruster stops firing. He's burning more now. His suit POPS A LEAK! Smoke whizzes out of a hole in his arm. He stares at it. JIMMY (CONT'D) Oh crap. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Tilda runs in to see a screen that shows a vector graphic of the station in the \"red zone\". It slowly starts to correct.

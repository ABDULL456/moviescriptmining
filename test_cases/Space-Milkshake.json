A towel is hung on equipment nearby. Anton sounds like he puts the mic too close to his mouth. ANTON (O.S.) Valentina to the control room immediately please. Valentina to the control room. GROUND CONTROL (O.S.) How about you just take a pod out there and pick up the debris? She turns to listen to the voices on the intercom. Space Milkshake Prod.

ANTON Sanitation Station Regina out. Anton switches off the radio. ANTON (CONT'D) Morons. TILDA Did he just tell us to take a pod to look for a class 2 object? Jimmy hangs out next to Tilda. JIMMY Do you know where can I get lunch? TILDA Mess hall. JIMMY Can you show me the way? ANTON Oh, you'd like lunch? Know what I'd like? I'd like my computer fixed right now. Fix it. JIMMY Ok Anton. ANTON That's Captain Balvenie. \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY The cargo drone ship cruises along. It's approaching the metal screw floating in space. SMASH - the drone hits the screw and EXPLODES. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   10. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY Red lights and indicators flash. A siren sounds. Tilda and Anton leap into action at the controls. Jimmy comes over. JIMMY What's that? Is everything ok? TILDA Collision detected. Secondary explosion. Reading a level six debris field out there. Lots of it. ANTON Are there any salvage crews in the sector? TILDA Nope. But they're scrambling two teams. They must really want the pod. ANTON You think there's something good in there? TILDA That's my bet. ANTON Well I'm calling it. VALENTINA (O.S.) What happened? Is that the collision alarm? ANTON Match orbit and position for pod launch. Run the checklist. Valentina report to airlock two. We're going fishing. Anton runs out. \nINT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY The siren sounds over the intercom. Valentina towels off. She zips up her jumpsuit and runs out. \n", "test1_true": "JIMMY Do you get down to Earth much? Tilda turns around from her terminal. TILDA I need to monitor the salvage operation. JIMMY Do you always share a salvage bonus with the entire crew? TILDA Three way split. JIMMY But we're four including me. TILDA You didn't sign in. You're not crew. Tilda puts on her headphones and turns away from Jimmy. JIMMY Where's the sign-in sheet? Tilda points at her headphones without turning to him.

VALENTINA Are we saying three way split on salvage? ANTON I'm not cutting in the new guy. VALENTINA That's the good space suit. ANTON I got here first. And you handle the heat better. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -     11/12/11   12. \nVALENTINA Forget it then. Anton takes off his space-pants and hands them to Valentina. ANTON Fine, fine. There's nothing wrong with the other suit anyway. I don't care. VALENTINA I just took a bath. ANTON I said fine. Anton takes the other suit. It's very smelly. He takes off his shirt and pants and they both dress in space suits. [Simple montage of zipping, buckling, boots, gloves.] \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - DAY A grungy old salvage pod moves away from the Regina and thrusts off into space toward a burning debris cloud. \nINT. WASS ORBITAL SANITATION POD - DAY Valentina and Anton are squashed up next to each other at the controls of the small pod, helmets on laps, wearing headsets. VALENTINA Why are we bothering with this? ANTON This could be the haul we've been waiting for. They're flipping out over this cargo drone. VALENTINA What is it? ANTON I don't know. It must be worth something. VALENTINA If there's a big salvage bonus, I want to go somewhere with a beach. Looks like something over there. ANTON Ya I see it. Line us up. They work the controls. Space Milkshake Prod.

Numbers flash on the screen. WENDI (O.S.) Hello Tilda. TILDA Hello Wendi. Central logic processor is up. All systems are online - the control interface has been disconnected. Tilda keeps accessing the computer with her brain. TILDA (CONT'D) It was the duck. JIMMY Gary? What is it trying to do? TILDA Look. The monitor shows a wire-frame diagram of the space station in motion, with trajectories and readings. A red circular line indicates the orbit of the station, and it intersects with Earth. The little icon of the station is slowly moving on that line toward the `red zone'. \"WARNING\" text blinks. TILDA (CONT'D) The station's orbit has been altered. We're going to hit the atmosphere. JIMMY How long do we have? TILDA About twenty eight minutes. JIMMY Are you sure? She's sure. Jimmy hits the intercom. JIMMY (CONT'D) Anton? Anton? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   68. \nTILDA The intercoms are locked out. We have to get to the control room. Tilda turns away, unplugs the cable with a shiver and pulls the cable out of her pants. She zips up. JIMMY You're going to have to explain that later. Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out. A spark jumps between their hands. JIMMY (CONT'D) Ow! TILDA Oh Jimmy. You don't have a static discharge buffer. You're completely made of meat. JIMMY Meat that loves you, Tilda. TILDA It may not be possible for us to overcome our physiological differences in this universe. JIMMY It sure would be fun to try. Tilda smiles in agreement. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Valentina looks under the communications equipment. There's a half-open compartment at the end of the room, filled with deep shadows. A wall panel is also open. She moves slowly toward it. She peeks in the wall panel. It's empty. She moves on toward the other compartment. Valentina reaches slowly toward the open compartment, her heart racing. VALENTINA Gary? Are you there Gary? We have to talk. She opens the compartment - just a pair of dusty headphones inside. She relaxes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   69. \nJimmy runs in, startling her. She bangs her head on the control panel. VALENTINA (CONT'D) AHHHH! JIMMY AHHHHHH! Valentina punches his face. VALENTINA AHHHH! JIMMY OW! VALENTINA What are you doing? JIMMY Ow. Stop. VALENTINA You scared the crap out of me. JIMMY Where's Anton? VALENTINA We split up. What are you doing here? JIMMY We're falling out of orbit. Gary's done something to the guidance system. Have you found him? VALENTINA He's not between here and engineering. JIMMY Then there's only one place left he could be. \nINT. CREW QUARTERS ~ VALENTINA'S ROOM - NIGHT Anton is looking at shady spots under the sleeping cots, holding the elliptical machine handle as a club. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   70. \nThe room is full of dark corners; each one seems to hold the promise of aliens bursting out. Anton explores cautiously. TILDA (O.S.) Anton! Anton spins around. Tilda points past him. Anton looks. The rubber duck is on the shelf! Anton smashes it with the handle! ANTON Got it! He stomps on it. Squeak Squeak. Squeak. TILDA That's not it. ANTON Oh. Anton lifts his foot. It squeaks. ANTON (CONT'D) It's the normal one. A SCUTTLING SOUND behind them. They turn and look. TILDA Did you hear that? Anton goes to her. They catch a glimpse of tentacle poking out of Anton's room. It disappears around the corner. TILDA (CONT'D) It's horrible. ANTON Tilda, get back. He hands her the backpack with the Time Cube. Tilda takes it and backs away. \n", "test2_true": "Tilda stands in the hall of the crew quarters outside the door. Scuttle scuttle sounds. Anton goes near his room, looks around.

Not so tough now are ya Gary? You'd better hide. Scuttle sound. Anton goes left, toward his coffee table, re- aiming his handlebar, guessing where Gary is hiding. Anton is almost at the door. Anton turns right. The shadow of Gary (Duck 3) rises up next to his bed: the tentacles were just the tip: it's grown larger now. It bares teeth. GARY Where is the Time Cube? ANTON What Time Cube? GARY I must have it. ANTON You come on my space station, try to steal my girlfriend, turn the place upside down and make demands for time cubes. Who do you think I am? Anton prepares to strike. The duck trembles with excitement and rage. Anton grits his teeth. ANTON (CONT'D) AHHHHHHHH! Anton swings his weapon high over his head and charges! Space Milkshake Prod.

Pillows and household items are torn up and thrown around. Crashing sounds. Tilda ducks down, unable to watch the violence. Sounds: Anton yelling, things breaking. Violent crunches and punches. Clanging. Blood sprays on the wall next to Tilda. She's horrified. CUT TO: Jimmy and Valentina come from around the corner at the far end of the hall and stop when they hear the sound of THUMP SCUTTLE SCUTTLE. They cautiously peer down the hall. JIMMY Tilda? Tilda comes out of Anton's room, some blood spray on her face. TILDA I need help. \nINT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 122D                                                              122D They clear off the table and lie Anton down. He's twitching. Valentina touches him and backs away in horror. TILDA Where is the first-aid kit? Jimmy looks around, pulls a medical kit from the wall. TILDA (CONT'D) He's leaking. JIMMY Valentina, get some water. Tilda first-aid examines Anton. He coughs up blood. Jimmy turns around and there's no Valentina. JIMMY (CONT'D) Valentina? Space Milkshake Prod.

She sits facing the passageway, looks at the blood on her hands. A husky rasping breathing sound comes from Gary who hides around the edge of the doorway. VALENTINA Gary. Why are you doing this? Gary's voice answers from the shadows. It sounds bigger. GARY (O.S.) For you. VALENTINA But you'll kill me as well if the station falls out of orbit. GARY So, are you're with this Anton guy now? VALENTINA I was for a while. Not sure now. GARY (O.S.) He fights like a girl. Do you think he'd cross alternate dimensions for you? VALENTINA I don't know. GARY I travelled through time for you.

GARY Do it. VALENTINA I don't see why- GARY (O.S.) Hurry up. Kill him now. VALENTINA Give me a second Gary. GARY (O.S.) Do it now! VALENTINA Can you give me a second Gary? GARY (O.S.) Kill him! Valentina turns around defiantly. VALENTINA I don't like being bossed around. Anton nods in confirmation of this. \nEXT. WESTERN ALLIANCE SANITATION STATION - NIGHT Jimmy [in spacesuit] moves along the exterior of the station. Atmosphere blows past him. The air is thin but they're moving fast. Smoke trails from burning station bits stream past. The station shakes. Jimmy is terrified, holds on for dear life. He sneezes in his helmet. The glass is all splattered. Space Milkshake Prod.

Anton is a little intimidated, still weak from his injuries. GARY So this is how it's going to be. VALENTINA Yup. Valentina swings high at Gary and catches him upside the head. He snarls and bashes her with a tentacle, knocking away the handlebar. She gives him a few punches, kick in the duck nuts. Gary knocks her down by the sandwich machine. Anton grabs a chair. A tentacle comes at Anton - it pulls him over by his neck, he drops the chair, and is thrown down by the hatch. Gary side steps quickly, looking around. He sees the Time Cube on the counter and sends a tentacle at it. Valentina stabs the tentacle with a plastic fork and it pulls back, spraying green blood and mucous in an unexpectedly heavy geyser over Valentina, Anton and the room. Valentina throws the time cube over the table to Anton, who catches it. Gary refocusses on Val and moves toward her. He bashes her with a tentacle sending her over the table. Space Milkshake Prod.

(Cut to Ursula's cavern.) 
Ursula: Nice work, boys.  That was a close one.  Too close.  The little tramp! Oh, she's better than I thought.  At this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure.  Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles! Triton's daughter will be mine - and then I'll make him writhe.  I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook! (Laughing, she transforms into a human with Ariel's voice.)

DEREK We met on the internet. 
HALLIE He sent me the cutest e-mail. 
DEREK I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line... 
HALLIE We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you. 
DEREK You'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It's a whole world, Sid. You're really popular amongst the demented. 
HALLIE You're the one who got away. 
DEREK Until now. 
COTTON You guys are fucked. 
HALLIE Actually Cotton, and I think critics would agree, it's the other way around. 
DEREK Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel? 
SIDNEY You're not going to get away with this. 
HALLIE Of course not. Who wants to? What's the point if we don't get caught? Where's the glamour in that? 
DEREK The way I see it. We'll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II. 
HALLIE A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it. 
DEREK We're hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned. 
HALLIE And now, drum roll please... 
DEREK Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you. 
Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing them. 
HALLIE A twist ending if you will. 
DEREK Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing's been done. 
HALLIE ... so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience... 
DEREK And we didn't want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money's worth. 
HALLIE So we found a compromise. 
DEREK Or it found us. 
HALLIE We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings. 
DEREK Just for you, Sid. 
HALLIE Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip. 
Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin. 
DEREK Oh yeah. (to Sid) We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It's been an ongoing discussion. (to Hallie) Heads or tails? 
HALLIE Tails. 
He flips the coin. 
DEREK Shit! You win. 
IN THE AUDITORIUM 
Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle. 
GALE Sidney! 
ON STAGE 
They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy to see her. 
SIDNEY Gale! 
IN THE AUDITORIUM 
Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on. 
ON STAGE 
Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...

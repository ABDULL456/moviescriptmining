{"train": "AMOUR \nWritten by \nMichael Haneke \nSCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY \nThe hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is open. \nThe door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain- clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses. Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand, the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor. \nPLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE (to the superintendent and the NEIGHBOR) Wait Outside please. \nHe signals to a police officer who herds the curious onlookers back out through the door. \nPOLICE OFFICER (to the superintendent, pointing to a pile of mail) What's the date of the last letter? \nSUPERINTENDENT (VERIFYING) The 16th from what I can see... Wait... \nThe plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape. \nPLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE (to the fire officer) Can you try? \nWhile the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room, where he also opens up the windows... \nFIREMAN (O.S.) The door is open. \n...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the police officer and the janitor. \nJANITOR ...no as far as I know. During the whole time, they had a nurse, but it's been a while since I last saw her. My wife has been... \nThe plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the curtains billow into the room. \nPLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE (to the firemen who are now curious enough to come and stand by the DOOR) Did you open the windows? \nThe firemen shake their heads. \nThe PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right- hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a crucifix. \nSCENE 2 - White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS \nSCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT \nAll we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the lights go out. APPLAUSE. \nShe goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet. \nANNE Imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in. \nGEORGES Why should I imagine that? \nANNE But it's terrible! I think I'd die of fright. \nGEORGES (LAUGHING) So would I. \nHe undoes his shoes. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Shall we have a drink? \nANNE I'm tired. \nGEORGES I still fancy a drink. \nHe puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom. \nANNE (O.S.) Go ahead then. Mathilde told me that in her building, the attic apartment was burgled from the loft. They just knocked a hole in the wall, cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace. \nHe goes toward the kitchen. \nGEORGES They must have been professionals. \nAs he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears to be looking at Anne. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Did I tell you, you looked good tonight? \nSHORT PAUSE. THEN: \nANNE (O.S.) (FLATTERED) What's got into you? \nWith a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen, where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND, apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short PAUSE: \nANNE (CONT'D) Weren't those semiquavers in the presto incredible? What staccato! Don't you agree? \nShort PAUSE. \nGEORGES (O.S.) You're proud of him, huh? \nSCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGeorges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against the headboard. \nShe continues to look at him without reacting. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (serious now) Anne! What's going on? \nHe waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly, leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her turn toward him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne, what's the matter? \nHe manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but her eyes look through him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne...what's... \nHe takes her face in both hands and turns toward him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne... \nShe stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits beside her, for quite awhile. \nSILENCE \nFinally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her imploringly. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (close to tears) Anne...Darling...please! \nOnce again they both remain seated. In the background, we hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off. \nMaking a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly, the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom. \nGeorge doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne? \nFinally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen. \nAnne is seated in the same place and looks at him. \nANNE What are you doing? \nShe turns toward the breakfast. \nANNE (CONT'D) You left the water running. \nGeorges stares at her. \nGEORGES (both aghast and furious) Hey, what's going on? Are you completely crazy? Is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on? \nGEORGES Just now, a few minutes ago. \nANNE So...?? \nGEORGES There's no \"So\". I went into the bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to get help. \nANNE Help? \nGEORGES Yes, and then you turned off the tap. \nANNE Yes. Because you left it on. \nSILENCE \nANNE (CONT'D) I don't understand. \nGEORGES Neither do I. \nPAUSE. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Don't you think it's best if I call Dr. Bertier? \nANNE Why? What can he do? \nGEORGES I don't know. Examine you. \nANNE I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me. \nGEORGES Anne, please!! That's absurd. We can't pretend that nothing happened. \nANNE But what DID happen? \nPAUSE. \nANNE (CONT'D) I'm here. I'm having my breakfast, and you're telling me things happened that I don't understand. \nGEORGES Can you explain how the tea towel got there? \nANNE (IRRITATED) No, I can't! \nGEORGES Who turned on the tap? \nANNE You did! \nGEORGES Can you remember that? \nEVA (with a little laugh) My God, you know him, don't you? Over the winter, he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player who'd been in our ensemble for years. What can I tell you? It was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide. That scared him and he came back to me in full remorse. I've got used to it now. What's a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble, you can't keep any secrets from anyone. \nGEORGES Do you love him? \nEVA Yes, I think so. \nBrief PAUSE. \nEVA (CONT'D) What's aphasia? \nGeorges gestures that it's too complicated. \nGEORGES What can I say? The carotid artery was blocked. They did an ultrasound scan, two in fact, and they said they had to operate on her. She was scared. She was confused and scared. You know she has always been afraid of doctors. They said the risk was very low and that if they didn't operate, she'd be certain to have a serious stroke. \nEVA And what do they say now? \nGEORGES Just that it didn't go well. It's one of the 5% that go wrong. \nHe yawns. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) It's pretty upsetting. \nHe looks at his watch. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Usually at this time, I take a nap. My blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks. \nPAUSE. \nEVA I'm so sorry. \nGEORGES Yeah. \nPAUSE. \nEVA What can I do for you? \nGEORGES Nothing. It was nice of you to come despite all of your stress. \nBrief PAUSE. \nShe doesn't know what to say. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) No, really. There's nothing you can do. We'll see how things go when she's back here in the apartment. We'll manage. Maybe I'll get a caretaker in, or maybe I'll manage on my own. We'll see. We've been through quite a lot in our time, your mother and I. (LITTLE LAUGH) All this is still a bit new. \nPAUSE. \nThe doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the armchairs and then steps in front of her. \nGEORGES Shall I make some tea? \nANNE (with a faint smile) First come sit with me. \nGeorge registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs. \nANNE (CONT'D) Can you help me into the chair? \nGeorges stands back up. \nGEORGES (EAGERLY) Of course. \nHe extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm to Georges. \nANNE It's best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me, that way it'll be easy. \nHe does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward and clumsy. \nANNE (CONT'D) Thanks. \nHe smiles because it seems silly to him to answer \"Don't mention it\". Then he sits down opposite her. \nLONG PAUSE. \nAt first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the fact that words do not come easily. After a long while, during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC below. \nGEORGES (softly almost to himself) I'm glad you're back. \nANNE (in a voice just as soft) Me too. \nAnother PAUSE. Then Anne says: \nANNE (CONT'D) Promise me one thing. \nGEORGES What? \nANNE Please never take me back to the hospital. \nGEORGES What? \nPAUSE. \nShe looks at him. He has understood. \nGEORGES (with a slight smile) OK. \nANNE Did you buy the new book on Harnoncourt? \nGEORGES I've already read it. \nANNE And? \nGEORGES Do you want it? I'll get it for you. \nANNE Sure. \nHe goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a while, we hear Georges shouting. \nGEORGES (O.S.) I don't know where I put it. \nANNE Don't worry. It isn't that important. \nGEORGES (O.S.) Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in the... Just a moment! Viola! Here you are! Nothing like an infallible memory! \nShe smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book in his hand. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) I thought I'd left it over there in the other room, but I'd already put it away. Tidy people just can't help being tidy. \nANNE (taking the book) Thanks. \nShe puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges. \nANNE (CONT'D) Right now, take care of yourself. And don't wait to see how I hold the book in my hand, OK? \nGEORGES OK. \nHe looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom. She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries to open it. It's not easy for her. \nThen she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens the book again, and tries to read. \nSCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY \nThe superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she takes out the receipt and the change. \nSUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE Unfortunately the strawberries were already moldy. I'll go and get you some fresh ones tomorrow from the market. My husband will bring you the bottled water this afternoon. I'm not supposed to carry anything heavy: my back, you know... \nGEORGES Sure, no problem. \nSUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE It came to 76 euros and 40 cents. There's the till receipt and here's your change: 23 euros 60. \nThen just stands there, at a loss. \nSILENCE. Then \nANNE (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Forgive me, I was too slow. \nGEORGES Anne... \nANNE Can you wheel me into the living room? \nPAUSE. \nGEORGES Yes. \nHe turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living room between the two armchairs. Turns on the light. Stops beside the switch. They both look exhausted. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) You're always good at surprises. \nANNE Yes. Why are you home earlier? \nGEORGES I didn't come home earlier. I took a taxi. In August, there isn't a lot of traffic. \nANNE That's true. How was the funeral? \nGEORGES Anne...! \nANNE How was it, go on, tell me! \nHe thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in an armchair. Looks at her. She raises her head and returns his look. He understands that he can't insist right now. Long PAUSE. Then he begins: \nGEORGES It was rather bizarre. The priest was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's co-workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional. His old secretary came with a radio- cassette player and after the speech she put on \"Yesterday\" by the Beatles. You can't imagine. Everybody turned round to look at her. Apparently, it wasn't planned. His grandchildren were there. Of course they giggled as soon as the music began. Then the urn was put on a huge stretcher that was obviously designed for a coffin, and out we went into the rain. They placed the urn on a small electric cart that crawled along for what seemed like an eternity to the tiny hole they had dug. A lot of people had to stifle their laughter. It must have been terrible for Jeanne. I have... \nANNE (INTERRUPTING HIM) There's just no point in going on living. I know it can only get worse. Why should I inflict it on us? On you and me. \nGEORGES You're not inflicting anything on me. \nANNE You don't have to lie, Georges. \nPAUSE. \nGEORGES Imagine you were me. Didn't you ever think something like this could happen to one of us? \nANNE Of course I did. But imagination and reality have little in common. \nGEORGES But things are getting better every day. We'll... \nSOLOIST No, no, thank you very much. \nGEORGES Hold on, I'll just freshen up the flowers; in this heat they wilt so fast... \nSOLOIST I've only just bought them. They should keep quite... \nBut Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him. \nAfter a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in the distance, without understanding what they're saying. It lasts a while. \nFinally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her wheelchair, into the living room. \nANNE Martin! What a delight. How lovely to see you! \nThe (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite know how to handle the situation. \nSOLOIST Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you too. \nANNE Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself down and don't look so shocked. \nThe soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down. Brief embarrassed PAUSE. \nANNE (CONT'D) I'm so proud of you. We were both in raptures after your concert. Georges wanted to buy your new CD the very next morning. \nSOLOIST Oh God! I wanted to bring you the CD, but I left in such a hurry that I forgot it. I'm so sorry. I'll get one today and drop it by. \nANNE (SMILING) No, no, don't worry. We want to make a contribution to your success. Even if it's only twenty euros. \nSOLOIST You've already contributed so much. I owe you so much, Madame. \nANNE You owe it to your hard work and your talent. \nSOLOIST (shaking his head a little) Do you remember, when you first gave me the Bagatelles to play? I was twelve at the time, and in my youthful arrogance I said: \"But why the Bagatelles?\" And you really gave me a piece of your mind. \nThey both smile. PAUSE. Then he goes on: \nSOLOIST (CONT'D) So what happened? \nANNE My right side is paralyzed, that's all. It can happen when you get older. \nSOLOIST And how...? \nANNE Let's talk about something else, shall we? \nSOLOIST (DISCONCERTED) Sure ... \nAnne is seated on a stool. Georges washes her. \nSCENE 27 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT \nGeorges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated, crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM. \nAnne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal. \nGEORGES (shocked, and hence furious) Good God, what are you doing? \nHe hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into the bed. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Have you lost your senses?! I don't believe it! How stupid! \nHe points to the broken objects. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Look at that! Did you need to do that? Can't you call me when you need something? \nANNE (meekly) I'm sorry. \nGEORGES (STILL FURIOUS) Yes, so am I. \nANNE (SOFTLY) Sorry. \nGeorges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered objects. \nGEORGES The lamp is broken too. \nSCENE 28 - INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - ANNEX - DAY \nBathroom. \nGeorges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The doorbell rings. \nGeorges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and over to the front door. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Yes? Who's there? \nNo answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to HIM: \nANNE Georges? What's going on? Who is it? \nGeorges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened. Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door. \nO.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice: \nANNE I don't want that. \nGEORGES What? \nANNE Geoff doesn't need to come. \nPAUSE. \nGeorges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne. \nANNE (CONT'D) I don't need any comments on my predicament. I can only take his British humor in small doses. \nSCENE 31 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY \nOnce more the set of physiotherapy exercises. Things are going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but without conviction. \nSCENE 32 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nClose shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to ANNE: \nGEORGES Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur Laurent, it was beautiful and yet sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes that things will get better. With deep gratitude, your former pupil, Martin. \nThe MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a long while, Anne says: \nANNE Stop the CD. \nHe hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music. They remain SILENT. \nSCENE 33- INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING ROOM - DAY \nThey eat. Suddenly, Anne says: \nANNE (CONT'D) Where are the family albums? \nGEORGES The family albums? I don't know, there, in the other room. Why? \nANNE Can you get them for me? \nGEORGES What, now? \nAnne nods. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Why, Anne? \nANNE I'd like to look at them. \nDuring this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat of the wheelchair. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) It's no big deal. Come on. \nHe lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes her through the hallway into the bathroom. \nHe lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Come on, darling. It's nothing serious. Things like that happen.. \nANNE (SOBBING) I can't... take it any more. \nHe holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling helpless. \nGEORGES My love. My darling. \nSCENE 36 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY \nAnne is in bed. She's on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair beside the bed. \nEVA ... thinking about whether it wouldn't be better to invest the money in an apartment block. If inflation gets going again, property is the only sure thing. Right now, savings accounts pay 1.75% at best. Four years ago, Geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed. So now we're obviously worried. Unfortunately, in the meantime, other people have had the same idea, and property prices are going through the roof. Since we came back from Scandinavia, I spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads. \nTo put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds: \nEVA (CONT'D) It takes time, that's all. We'll find something in the end. \nAnother oppressive PAUSE. \nANNE (slowly) Yes yes I have... I have... the grandmother... woman with house... not... the house then ... money \nEVA I don't understand you, I'm afraid. \nANNE ... yes... now... it's all... house sel... sel... sel... was... in two strokes of... so quickly... god it's hard... to say... sell... money gone... left... there too... \nPAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes. \nSCENE 37 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nGeorges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks with a British accent. \nGEORGES ... three times a week... I'm not experienced enough. We'll see if that's enough. \nGEOFF How much is she asking? \nGEORGES It's paid by the hour. We'll see. \nGeoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose. \nEVA I can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently. \nGEORGES (CURTLY) No one's stopping you from finding out. \nEva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows her with his eyes. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (PEACEABLY) Believe me, I love your mother as much as you do. So please, don't treat me as if I was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious. \nEVA I didn't say that. I'm simply questioning whether what I see going on here is the answer to everything! \nGEOFF (TO GEORGES) Don't you want to get a second opinion? \nGEORGES Now you two had better stop, OK? Another doctor did come. He said Bertier was right. From Monday, a nurse will come three times a week. Now can we talk about something else? \nEVA Like what? \nSCENE 38 - INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGeorges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff. On the radio, the EVENING NEWS. \nSCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY \nWith expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an object, as tears flow silently down her face. \nSCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY \nAnne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We watch her and listen to her for a while. \nGeorges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano. Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated. \nSCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY \nHe prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close to Anne to feed her her food. \nGEORGES There, my love, I hope you like it. \nANNE OK... \nHe begins to feed her. \nGEORGES I added a little orange juice. I find it tastes quite good. \nShe can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel, continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she keeps her mouth shut. \nShe takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up. \nNURSE (CONT'D) Thanks for the coffee. \nGEORGES My pleasure. I'll see you out. \nThey both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway, takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on, she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP. \nNURSE You mustn't take it too seriously. Usually they always say something. She might just as well say \"Mom, Mom, Mom\". It's just mechanical. \nGEORGES (nodding, softly) I know. \nThey've reached the door. \nNURSE Goodbye, sir. \nGEORGES Goodbye. \nHe closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment, then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP, unaltered, continue. \nGeorges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand, holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP become quieter and finally stop altogether. \nAfter a long PAUSE: \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (slowly, softly) I'd like to hire a second nurse. The two could take turns. That would make everything a bit simpler. What do you think? \nLong PAUSE. Then: \nANNE (softly) ...Help...Help... \nSCENE 44 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThey are both lying in bed. Georges SNORES noisily. Anne's eyes are open. \nSCENE 45 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY \nThe front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open for him. \nGEORGES Would you mind putting them in the kitchen. \nThe superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the bags. Georges calls toward the bedroom: \nGEORGES (CONT'D) I'm ba-aack! \nHe then follows the superintendent into the kitchen. \nANNE po ... pont ... sss \nGEORGES ...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ... \nANNE ... Ssssur le pont ... \nGEORGES (smiling to encourage her): ... Sur le pont d'Avignon... \nANNE ... ssur... le .. \nGEORGES ... pont... Sur le pont d'Avignon... (he begins to sing): Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse, on y danse, sur le pont d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en rond... \nHe encourages her to sing with him. Starts singing again: \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse, on y danse ... \nAnne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (singing to encourage Anne, accompanied by the sounds that she produces): Sur le pont d'Avignon on y danse, on y danse ... Sur le pont d'Avignon tout le monde y danse en rond ... \nSCENE 47 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY \nA second nurse is doing Anne's hair roughly. The brush sticks in her tangled hair. \nSECOND NURSE (\"CHEERY\") ... there we are...now we're all beautiful again...so everybody will admire us...there...you see... wait... \nShe takes a mirror that she has placed within reach. Holds it in front of Anne's face. \nSECOND NURSE (CONT'D) Well?... What do we say to that? Aren't we a pretty sight? \nAnne, sickened, averts her eyes. Emits a muffled SOUND. The nurse ignores it. \nSECOND NURSE (CONT'D) You'll see, Monsieur will be dazzled by you... \nFurious SOUND from Anne. \nSCENE 48 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has landed on the window ledge. \nIt walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside, onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings. \nWe hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet. The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its wings, it flutters about the room. \nAfter a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite direction. George follows it. \nA brief kiss hello. \nEVA Hello. What was going on? \nGEORGES I was in the toilet. Sorry. \nHe closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction of the living room. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Come in. \nEva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back in the direction of the living room, as if to say: \"You understand, huh?\". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him into the living room. \nHe closes the door. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Why this unannounced visit? Where have you come from? \nEVA What's going on with Mom? \nGEORGES Nothing. What should be going on? \nEVA Well... (gesture toward the BEDROOM) \nGEORGES Don't you want to sit down first? \nEva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down. Georges does the same. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) So why are you in Paris? \nEVA What's going on with Mom? Why don't you answer the phone? After our last conversation, I left four messages on your answering machine. Why don't you call back? \nGEORGES Sorry. I didn't listen to it. Forgive me. \nEVA Don't you realize we're worried? \nGEORGES Your worries are no use to me. \nEva glares at him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) No, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing you. I just don't have the time to deal with your worries, that's all. \nEVA Dad... \nGEORGES No. Let's stop this conversation right there. I'm taking care of your mother. It's a full-time job. And I'm not saying that to complain, just to explain why I didn't answer your phone calls and why I don't want to have any pointless discussions on the subject. Your mother is just as could have been expected: bad the whole time. (MORE) \nGEORGES (CONT'D) She is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me. And she doesn't want to be seen in that state either. Even the last time you visited, she didn't want you to come. You two have your own life. Nothing wrong with that. But let us have our life too. Even though it's a lousy one. OK? \nThe bright light from outside filters through the blinds. \nEva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes. Looks at her. No movement. \nEVA It's me, Mom. \nAnne emits a FURIOUS SOUND. \nEVA (CONT'D) (HELPLESS) Can I do something for you? Mom... \nANNE Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... \nSILENCE. \nGeorges has remained by the door. After a while, they both leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the living room. \nGeorges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down. \nEva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing. \nAfter a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva, vexed, blows her nose. \nShortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down. \nGEORGES The tea isn't very hot any more. \nEva turns toward him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) But it does make you feel better. \nAfter a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down. He fills her cup. \nEVA Thanks. \nShe takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still can't bring herself to look at him. \nGEORGES It was silly of me to lock the door. I'm sorry. You took me by surprise, that's all. I'm sorry. \nShe nods her head, indicating she understands. Finally she looks at him: \nEVA What's going to happen now? \nGEORGES (with a little ironic laugh) What's going to happen now? The nurse comes twice a week, and every two weeks Dr. Bertier and the hairdresser come. That's what you want to know, right? Things will go on as they have done up until now. They'll go from bad to worse. Things will go on, and then one day it will all be over. \nBrief PAUSE. \n", "test1_input": "GEORGES No idea. He probably found it amusing. I don't remember. I don't remember the film either. But I remember the feeling. That I was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when I was actually watching the film, and that I just couldn't stop. \nShe looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food. \nANNE That's cute. Why didn't you ever tell me before? \nGEORGES There are still a few stories you don't know. \nANNE Aha...? Don't tell me you're going to ruin your image in your old age? \nGEORGES (GRINNING) You bet I won't. But what is my image? \nShe takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at him. \nANNE (TENDERLY) Sometimes you're a rotter. But you're nice. \nGEORGES (EMBARRASSED GRIN) Can I take you for a drink? \nShe laughs. \nSCENE 18 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY \nHe does physiotherapy exercises with her. Counts the repetitive movements of the exercises. \nSCENE 19 - INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nShe's lying on the sofa. He's seated in the armchair. They're both reading the newspaper. After a while: \nANNE Listen to this! My horoscope. Motto: You have lots of verve, but need to be more serious! Love: High-class conversation is what you need. Work: You're motivated again. But proceed with care. Health: Loosen up by doing exercises. It'll give you renewed pizzazz. \nPAUSE. Then \nGEORGES (GOOD-HUMORED) You've only yourself to blame if you read stuff like that. \nBrief PAUSE. Then: \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's funeral. \nANNE You have to go. \nGEORGES I fear I must. I don't want to go at all. \nANNE Who does like going to funerals? \nGEORGES Oh, I know a few people who do. Annette can never wait to get all dolled up again. And Fran\u00e7ois has... \n", "test1_true": "GEORGES (dryly) Nothing, presumably. \nShe shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony. Then she says: \nANNE Have you talked to Jeanne since I was in the hospital? I mean, does she know I can't come? \nGEORGES Of course. \nANNE What did she say? \nGEORGES She was shocked. \nANNE How? \nGEORGES (a bit irritated) My God, what are people like when they're shocked? She couldn't believe it, she was speechless. I don't remember any more. In any case, not exactly. I've spoken to a lot of people since. \nPAUSE. \nANNE Sorry. \nGEORGES No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be unkind, but I just don't see the point of talking about it all the time. \nShort PAUSE. \nANNE Do I talk about it all the time? \nGEORGES No. Sorry. \nANNE Don't worry. \nSCENE 20 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges enters. He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion. He turns on the light. He's wet. Clearly, it's been raining. As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne. With her back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the opened window of the light well, half propped against her wheelchair. \nGEORGES What ... ?! \nShaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in the wheelchair. Outside, in the light well, it is raining. \nPAUSE. \nANNE (once she's seated in the WHEELCHAIR) Why are you back already? What time is it? \nPAUSE. \nGeorges has understood immediately. He closes the window noiselessly. \n", "test1_id": 315, "test2_input": "SCENE 50 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHe tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping cup. She won't loosen her lips. \nGEORGES ... Please, open your mouth... go on... open it... Anne! Please!... come on... stop that!... \nHe sits upright. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) If you don't drink, you'll die. \nIndecipherable SOUND from ANNE. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Is that what you want? \nPAUSE. She looks at him. He bends over her again, presents the cup in front of her sealed lips. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Come on, Anne, please. \nShe doesn't react. He opens her lips with his fingers and tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth. Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (ANGRILY) Goddammit! \nHe puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid, some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show his helplessness and his anger. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne! ... You can't force me to let you die of thirst. If you persist, I'll call Bertier and he'll put you in hospital. They can force-feed you there. Is that what you want? \nBRIEF PAUSE. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) I promised to spare you that. But you must help me. I'm out of my depth. \nHe takes the cup again and puts it against her lips. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Please, Anne! \nHer lips remain sealed. He presses the cup hard against them. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Drink that, now! \nIt hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little liquid. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) There! \nShe closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) \n", "test2_true": "Then she spits it all out like a fountain. After a moment of bewilderment, he slaps her. \nSILENCE. He's frightened by his own gesture. Then he puts down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed. They don't look at each other. \nLONG PAUSE. \nANNE (SOFTLY) Help... help... \nPAUSE. \nGEORGES (SOFTLY) Please, forgive me. \nPAUSE. \nANNE (softly) Help... Help... Help... Help... \nSCENE 51 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY \nThe various paintings hanging in the apartment. Without their frames. Like views on various realities. \nSILENCE. Sometimes, the REMOTE sound of TRAFFIC in the distance. \nSCENE 52 - INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DINING ROOM - DAY \nLiving room. \nGeorges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper. SILENCE. Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS. \nGeorges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into the hallway and goes to the front door. \nGEORGES Who's there? \nEVA'S VOICE It's me. \nGEORGES Eva? \nEVA'S VOICE (a bit irritated) Yes. \nGeorges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds. \nGEORGES Just a minute. \nHe goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in his pocket. He goes into the dining room, also closes the door leading to the bedroom. He comes back. He is about to go toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant, opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby, flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens the front door. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Hello. \n", "test2_id": 316, "test3_input": "He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then replaces it. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) No... So what's hurting you? \nHe sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) It's all right... it's all right ... I'm here... everything's fine... we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a story... but you must be quiet, I can't talk too loud, it wears me out... Here we go: when I was little... well, I wasn't as little as all that... it was toward the end of primary school, so I was about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a holiday camp. They thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... We were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... I think it was in the Auvergne... I don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected... We had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. Not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. We entered it running, in a double file. You know, I was never very sporty. They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... But the worst thing was the food. The third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice pudding. We sat at long tables in a huge hall. I didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: You won't get up until you've cleared your plate. So after the meal everybody left the room, and I remained seated, in tears. I had made a secret pact with Mom. I was to send her a postcard every week. (MORE) \nGEORGES (CONT'D) If I was pleased with the place I was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars. She kept the card; it was covered all over in stars. After three hours, I was allowed to leave the table. I went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees. It was diphtheria. They took me to the nearest hospital where I was put in an isolation ward, which meant that Mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window. At some point I lost that postcard. It's a pity. \nAnne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still holds her hand. \nLONG SILENCE. \nThen Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her. \nSILENCE. \nSCENE 55 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY \nHallway. \nThe front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it in the closet. \nThe TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water. He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water. We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE HAS STOPPED RINGING. \nSCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY \nGeorges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again. \nLooks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress. \nHe just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down into it. \nSCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWith wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of the bedroom. \nSCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY \nGeorges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible. Suddenly, Georges starts. \nAt the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it. For a long time. \nThen he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room. \n", "test3_true": "Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times. The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light- well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby. \nSCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nFrom the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing: \n... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second time already, through the light well. This time I caught it. In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again. I'm going to ... \nSCENE 60 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY \nGeorges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES. \nAfter a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen. \nHe remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually: \nANNE I'm almost done. \nGeorges continues to look at her unwaveringly. \nANNE'S VOICE You can put your shoes on if you want. \nGeorges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work. She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on. \nANNE Thanks. \nThey head for the front door. \nANNE (CONT'D) Aren't you taking a coat? \nGeorges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from the hook and they leave the apartment. \nSCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nFour long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is shining. It is fairly bright. \nHallway. \nSILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door. Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom. \nAnne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes through the partition door into the dining room. \nThere, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living room. \nThere too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room. \n", "test3_id": 317}

{"test1_input": "She continues to look at him without reacting. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (serious now) Anne! What's going on? \nHe waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly, leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her turn toward him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne, what's the matter? \nHe manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but her eyes look through him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne...what's... \nHe takes her face in both hands and turns toward him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne... \nShe stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits beside her, for quite awhile. \nSILENCE \nFinally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her imploringly. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (close to tears) Anne...Darling...please! \nOnce again they both remain seated. In the background, we hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off. \nMaking a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly, the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom. \nGeorge doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Anne? \nFinally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen. \nAnne is seated in the same place and looks at him. \nANNE What are you doing? \nShe turns toward the breakfast. \nANNE (CONT'D) You left the water running. \nGeorges stares at her. \nGEORGES (both aghast and furious) Hey, what's going on? Are you completely crazy? Is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on? \n", "test1_true": "ANNE What did you say? \nGEORGES (SERIOUSLY) Is this a joke? Is this meant to be a joke? \nANNE What joke? I don't get it! Why are you talking to me like that? What's got into you? \nGeorges comes from the door to the table. \nGEORGES Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's not funny. \nANNE (GETTING IRRITATED) What game, for Christ's sake? What on earth's the matter?!! \nGeorges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone, but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how to react. \nGEORGES What's the matter? Why didn't you react? \nANNE To what? \nGEORGES To what? To me, to everything. \nANNE When? \nGEORGES Just now. A moment ago. \nANNE Please tell me what's wrong. What am I supposed to have done? \nGeorges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He doesn't want to believe that its serious. \nGEORGES I don't know what to say. Do you really not know what just happened? \nANNE But what DID happen? \nGEORGES (almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks) You were sitting there, staring at me. You didn't answer me when I asked you what the matter was. \nHe picks up the wet tea towel from the table. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) I put this tea towel on your face, and you didn't react. \nAnne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Look... There's still dampness on your collar. \nAnne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry. \nANNE When... When was it? \n", "test1_id": 315, "test2_input": "A brief kiss hello. \nEVA Hello. What was going on? \nGEORGES I was in the toilet. Sorry. \nHe closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction of the living room. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Come in. \nEva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back in the direction of the living room, as if to say: \"You understand, huh?\". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him into the living room. \nHe closes the door. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) Why this unannounced visit? Where have you come from? \nEVA What's going on with Mom? \nGEORGES Nothing. What should be going on? \nEVA Well... (gesture toward the BEDROOM) \nGEORGES Don't you want to sit down first? \nEva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down. Georges does the same. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) So why are you in Paris? \nEVA What's going on with Mom? Why don't you answer the phone? After our last conversation, I left four messages on your answering machine. Why don't you call back? \nGEORGES Sorry. I didn't listen to it. Forgive me. \nEVA Don't you realize we're worried? \nGEORGES Your worries are no use to me. \nEva glares at him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) No, don't get me wrong. I'm not criticizing you. I just don't have the time to deal with your worries, that's all. \nEVA Dad... \nGEORGES No. Let's stop this conversation right there. I'm taking care of your mother. It's a full-time job. And I'm not saying that to complain, just to explain why I didn't answer your phone calls and why I don't want to have any pointless discussions on the subject. Your mother is just as could have been expected: bad the whole time. (MORE) \nGEORGES (CONT'D) She is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me. And she doesn't want to be seen in that state either. Even the last time you visited, she didn't want you to come. You two have your own life. Nothing wrong with that. But let us have our life too. Even though it's a lousy one. OK? \n", "test2_true": "GEORGES Nothing's the matter; your visit caught me by surprise. And I'm annoyed that you show up here to check that everything's OK. Who do you think you are? \nPAUSE. Eva is speechless. \nEVA I... \nThen she gets up and makes to go to the door. \nGEORGES Stay here, will you! \nShe stops short, looks at him. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) (softly, but insistently) Please! \nShe hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room. \nWE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR. \nEVA (O.S.) Mom? ... Mom?? \nGeorges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. She seems upset by the situation, as one would expect. \nEVA (CONT'D) Tell me, what's going on? Have you gone crazy? \nGEORGES Please, sit down. \nEVA I don't want to sit down. What's going on here? \nGEORGES (QUIETLY) Nothing's going on. I want to spare us all a pointless drama. I presume your mother is asleep. She mostly sleeps the whole day. And then she wakes up at night. If you really want to, we'll go and see her in a little while. Now, sit down. OK? \nThey look at each other. \nReluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down. PAUSE. Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice: \nGEORGES (CONT'D) We do our speech exercises every day, or we sing together. Most of the time, I wake up around 5. At that time, she's still awake. Then we change her incontinence pad. I rub cream on her to avoid sores. Then, around 7, I try to persuade her to eat and drink. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Sometimes she tells me things from her childhood, then for hours she calls for help, and then an instant later she's giggling away to herself, or crying. Nothing of any of that is worth showing to anyone. \nSILENCE. Eva looks down. Finally, she says: \nEVA (SOFTLY) You can't stop me from seeing her. \nGEORGES (ALSO SOFTLY) No. \nThey remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up. Georges follows her into the hallway. \nHe unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom. \n", "test2_id": 316, "test3_input": "He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then replaces it. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) No... So what's hurting you? \nHe sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand. \nGEORGES (CONT'D) It's all right... it's all right ... I'm here... everything's fine... we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a story... but you must be quiet, I can't talk too loud, it wears me out... Here we go: when I was little... well, I wasn't as little as all that... it was toward the end of primary school, so I was about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a holiday camp. They thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... We were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... I think it was in the Auvergne... I don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected... We had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. Not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. We entered it running, in a double file. You know, I was never very sporty. They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... But the worst thing was the food. The third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice pudding. We sat at long tables in a huge hall. I didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: You won't get up until you've cleared your plate. So after the meal everybody left the room, and I remained seated, in tears. I had made a secret pact with Mom. I was to send her a postcard every week. (MORE) \nGEORGES (CONT'D) If I was pleased with the place I was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars. She kept the card; it was covered all over in stars. After three hours, I was allowed to leave the table. I went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees. It was diphtheria. They took me to the nearest hospital where I was put in an isolation ward, which meant that Mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window. At some point I lost that postcard. It's a pity. \nAnne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still holds her hand. \nLONG SILENCE. \nThen Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her. \nSILENCE. \nSCENE 55 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY \nHallway. \nThe front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it in the closet. \nThe TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water. He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water. We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE HAS STOPPED RINGING. \nSCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY \nGeorges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again. \nLooks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress. \nHe just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down into it. \nSCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWith wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of the bedroom. \nSCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY \nGeorges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible. Suddenly, Georges starts. \nAt the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it. For a long time. \nThen he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room. \n", "test3_true": "Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times. The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light- well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby. \nSCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nFrom the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing: \n... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second time already, through the light well. This time I caught it. In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again. I'm going to ... \nSCENE 60 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY \nGeorges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES. \nAfter a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen. \nHe remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually: \nANNE I'm almost done. \nGeorges continues to look at her unwaveringly. \nANNE'S VOICE You can put your shoes on if you want. \nGeorges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work. She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on. \nANNE Thanks. \nThey head for the front door. \nANNE (CONT'D) Aren't you taking a coat? \nGeorges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from the hook and they leave the apartment. \nSCENE 61 - INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nFour long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is shining. It is fairly bright. \nHallway. \nSILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door. Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom. \nAnne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes through the partition door into the dining room. \nThere, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living room. \nThere too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room. \n", "test3_id": 317}

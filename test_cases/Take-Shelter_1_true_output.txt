ANDY (CONT'D) Please, sit down. Curtis takes a seat. 
CURTIS What happened to Kendra? 
ANDY She got into a program at OSU so she'll be transferring near there. I've split her case load with another counselor. It's been kind of crazy around here lately. 
CURTIS Huh. 
ANDY So I've looked over your file. It says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties. Let's start there. 
Curtis looks at the man for a moment, then stands and walks out of the room. 
EXT. LAFORCHE HOME/DRIVEWAY - DAY 
Curtis' truck is parked in the driveway with the hood up and the engine running. Curtis stands over the vibrating engine, studying it. He looks at the belts. He watches them move. 
INT. STORM SHELTER - DAY 
Curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the shelter. A dull light glows through the new entryway that's been knocked out through the back left wall. Curtis goes through it. 
IN THE SHIPPING CONTAINER SECTION, Curtis sets the toilet on the floor. He picks up the camping lantern and holds it up to the space. The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is. Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of supplies. Canned food, a small gas burner. Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the back corner. 
INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY 
Samantha walks inside followed by Hannah and a WOMAN from the flea market. 
SAMANTHA I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. 
WOMAN That's okay. Don't worry about it. 
SAMANTHA Here. I hope you like them. Samantha hands over the plastic bag. 
WOMAN Thanks. I brought cash. 
SAMANTHA That's terrific. It's fine. 
Samantha takes three twenties from her. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Call me if they don't work and I'm sorry again. 
WOMAN Oh, it's okay. Thank you. Samantha closes the door. 
IN THE KITCHEN, Samantha takes the tin decorated with ocean creatures down from the fridge. She removes the envelope with the word "BEACH" written on it and takes out a stack of bills. She folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse before placing the empty envelope back in the tin. She looks out back and sees Curtis sitting with Hannah. 
OUTSIDE, The shipping container has been covered over with dirt. Two rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound. Curtis sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with Hannah. He signs something that makes her laugh. Hannah smacks a muddy clump between her hands. Curtis touches her nose, leaving a dirt smudge. Hannah laughs. She touches his face, smudging it. 
IN THE KITCHEN, Samantha watches through the back door.

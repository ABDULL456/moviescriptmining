Being let into the room by a male nurse. He closes the door after them and the two men look toward the bed: MONCRIEF Andy?   It's Larry Moncrief. 
HIS POV 
of the unresponsive figure under the covers. 
BACK TO SCENE MONCRIEF Would you care to sit up for a minute? I'd like to talk to you. 
91   EXT. MONROE PARK CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                    91 
ON Andy in the driver's seat of the Mercedes. The window is rolled up and she puffs impatiently on a cigarette. Presently, she catches sight of something out the driver's window and turns to look:

MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                            94. 
91   CONTINUED:                                                  91 A sleek black car with opaque'd windows pulls into a parking slot several yards away. A faded male beauty, somewhere in his 50s, gets out of the rear passenger door and as he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital grounds: 
She quickly rolls down the window and angrily addresses him: ANDY You son of a bitch! 
RED LAYLS looks toward the Mercedes and as he approaches, we can see a medical beeper attached to his belt. 
HIS POV OF ANDY Her hair still hidden under the stingy-brim, her eyes unrecognizable behind the dark glasses. 
BACK TO SCENE 
He comes up to the car, peering closely at its occupant: RED Who is it? 
ANDY Who the hell do you think it is?! RED Sweetheart?   Is that you? She pulls the dark glasses off... 
ANDY No thanks to you, it's me. ... and throws them onto the dashboard. 
92   EXT. M.P. CENTER/GROUNDS - NIGHT                            92 
Harry hastens back along the walkway to the parking lot. Once again he halts abruptly in his tracks: HARRY Aw, Jesus.

MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                               95. 
92   CONTINUED:                                                     92 HIS POV - RED LAYLS 
Opening the driver's door and reaching in to take hold of Andy's arm. (As she steps out of the car, we see that below the doctor's jacket Harry had intended to retrieve, she is bare-legged and wears Joan's high heels.) 
BACK TO SCENE Harry turns and strides back toward the hospital. 
93   INT. M.P. PARK CENTER/ANDY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT             93 
Moncrief places a briefcase on a nightstand next to the bed. As he opens it and searches through its contents: MONCRIEF Before he arrives, I'd like you to take a look at a list of certain deletions and expurgations, which if agreed to... He removes several typed pages, stapled together and looks down at the pillow covering Joan's face: MONCRIEF ... Red is, very generously, I think, prepared to offer his sanction to a sanitized version of your book. No response. Moncrief glances over at Sturge, standing near the door, then back at the figure on the bed. MONCRIEF I think you should know, that if you push this too far, you run the risk of having him withdraw his consent to your well-being. (pauses, then) I don't think we want that, do we, Andy? He reaches down and removes the pillow.    Joan looks fear- fully up at him: 
JOAN Andy's not here. 
MONCRIEF I can see that, Miss Spruance. Would you care to tell me where she is?

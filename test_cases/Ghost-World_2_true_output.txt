ENID What are you talking about? 
REBECCA That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun. 
ENID You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you. 
REBECCA Just promise you'll do it. 
ENID Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind. 
INT. ENID'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Loud water running; PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining bedroom as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her own words. As she straightens INTO FRAME, we see that she's dyed her hair green. She grabs a towel and heads into the bedroom. 
INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Her DAD enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green hair and loud music. 
DAD (over music) Have you seen my blue spatula? 
ENID Nope. What are you making, pancakes? 
DAD Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula. 
Dad leaves. Enid messes up her hair in different ways while singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the mirror. Rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway. 
REBECCA (disdainful) When did you do that? 
Enid turns around, startled, but instantly regains helps composure. 
ENID What? How long have you been standing there? 
EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/NEAR ACME SHOES - DAY 
REBECCA Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade? 
ENID Fuck you, bitch! 
They walk past a sad-looking ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE, in a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there forever. They stop and peer through the window. 
ENID We still have to go in there sometime. 
REBECCA It's always closed... 
ENID I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back. 
They continue walking. 
ENID Hey look, it's the pants. 
We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk. 
REBECCA Where are we going? 
ENID Let's go hassle Josh. 
REBECCA "Hassle"? 
They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby threadbare suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop. The rusty sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service." 
REBECCA There he is... 
ENID As always. 
REBECCA Waiting for the bus that never comes... 
ENID I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or -- 
REBECCA Why don't you ask him. 
Enid sits next to THE MAN. Rebecca stands behind the bench, taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing speculation. 
ENID Hi... what's your name? 
MAN (looks at watchless wrist, then down the street) Norman. 
ENID ...are you waiting for a bus? 
MAN Yes. 
ENID I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street. 
MAN You don't know what you're talking about. 
EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

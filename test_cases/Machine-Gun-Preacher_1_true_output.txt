Sam working on his Harley. Donnie entering in the b.g. 
DONNIE What'cha workin on, buddy? 
SAM Trouble with the push rods I think. She's runnin kinda rough. 
DONNIE Shoulda kept that mild in there `stead a buildin up a hot rod. Let's see whatcha got here... 
Donnie moving next to him, working on the bike... 
DONNIE (CONT'D) ... never had these problems when we was runnin solid lifters, huh? 
SAM Used to fix them old shovelheads on the side of the road with a buckknife and a wire hanger. 
DONNIE Remember that year we went to the Freakers Ball? 
Sam smiling... 
SAM I think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip. 
DONNIE Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more fun tryin to get there than when we finally did. 
Sam and Donnie share a laugh. 
DONNIE (CONT'D) Can I talk to you about somethin? 
SAM Yep. 
DONNIE I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do. 
SAM The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole boy. 
DONNIE Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am. 
And we see in Donnie's eyes just how troubled he is. 
SAM Why don't we pray together then... 
And they both take a knee, bowing their heads as Sam continues... 
SAM (CONT'D) Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless us with the strength to carry on in your name. And grant us, in our darkest hours, the understandin that you are always by our side. 
And we leave these two men, their heads bowed in quiet supplication, next to this Harley, praying for strength. 
INT. SHOWROOM - CAR DEALERSHIP - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY (JULY/2004) 
Four or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor. And we see Sam sitting across from BILL WALLACE, late 40's, gold Rolex. 
BILL ... from what I heard, you built yourself one helluva church over there in Central City. 
SAM Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin there. You should come on by one of these Sundays, bring the family. 
BILL That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary now. Bit more our speed over there I think. 
Sam, getting down to business... 
SAM Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon, puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here cause I wanna talk to you about what we're doin over there in Africa. 
BILL Course I know about what you're doin. Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam. 
SAM Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a little bit more support from people like yourself sure would help things run a lot smoother over there. 
Bill feeling the rub, shaking his head... 
BILL Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch around here. 
SAM I hear that, but you gotta understand that them kids over there got nuthin. I mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for much. 
BILL How much you lookin for? 
SAM Five thousand dollars. 
BILL Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars? 
SAM That keeps them doors open for another six months. 
BILL People are losin their jobs left and right round here. Tough to be askin for five thousand dollars for a buncha African children half-way around the world. 
Sam shifting, not giving up, coming at him another way... 
SAM You're right. We got problems right here. But with that kinda money we could feed them kids, house them kids. 
Bill staring at him, saying nothing, on the spot. Sam hoping that somehow he's reached this man. And finally Bill stands up... 
BILL Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I can do. 
Sam feeling this victory, flashing a smile, shaking Bill's hand. 
SAM Ok. 
BILL Why don't you and the family come over to the house next Sunday. We're havin a little barbeque, ok? 
SAM Sounds good. 
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
Upscale French provincial in suburban Johnstown. A "barbeque" is underway. 15 couples here with their kids and a handful of waiters in white-tie offering champagne and hors d'oeuvres to the guests.

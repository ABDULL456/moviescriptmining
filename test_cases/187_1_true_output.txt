A cognitive flicker now as the Assistant Coroner sets down his coffee... 
119   INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - EVENING                                     119 
The acrid fecal smell causes Ellen to flinch. Averting her eyes, she holds onto Mrs. Chacon's arm as they stand next to the autopsy table. A plastic diaphanous sheet covers the body. 
Now the Assistant Coroner raises the sheet... 
Mrs. Chacon's traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears. She raises a hand to her mouth. Now the tears come... 
MRS. CHACON ... Benito. 
As she comforts Mrs. Chacon... 
ELLEN (to Assistant Coroner; sotto) Did you find any rosary beads with the body? 
ASSISTANT CORONER No. 
120   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        120 
... The digital clock next to Trevor's bed reads: 2:14 a.m. 
Trevor sleeps. HOLD for a portentous moment. Now the stillness is broken by a CLATTER at the front door. Someone enters the house. Trevor awakens. Jolts out of bed. Disoriented a beat. 
121   INT. TREVOR'S HALLWAY                                           121 
In boxer shorts and a T-shirt, adjusting his glasses, Trevor ventures through darkness...

121   CONTINUED:                                                     121 
TREVOR ... Who's there? 
A light flickers on in the living room. 
ELLEN (O.S.) You should keep your door locked. 
ADJUSTING the ANGLE now as the living room comes INTO VIEW... 
Ellen paces back and forth, consumed by what's troubling her. 
TREVOR (still half asleep) What's the matter? 
Ellen ignores his question. 
ELLEN (impaling him with a look) I just want you to tell me one thing... 
Now something she sees stops her pacing... 
... The black rosary beads on the dinner table. 
TREVOR (off Ellen's puzzled look) What? 
Following her gaze, he picks up the rosary beads.    As he places them in a drawer in the credenza. 
TREVOR What is it? 
Ellen's confused.     Lost in a fixated gaze. 
ELLEN ... If you had any idea what I've been thinking lately... you'd think I was crazy. (running it through her mind) ... Remember that John Doe they found in the L.A. River. Turned out it was Benny. 
(CONTINUED) 
121   CONTINUED:                                                       121 
TREVOR (impacted) Who told you that? 
ELLEN ... Benny's mother identified the body. 
Trevor just looks at her, a bated pause.       Now he blinks. 
TREVOR Benny was no saint, Ellen. This is a kid who terrorized hald the school. He even broke into your house. Maybe we should think about that 'fore we shed any tears. 
Ellen just looks at him. 
TREVOR ... Maybe he's better off. 
ELLEN That's a horrible thing to say. 
Trevor accepts that it is. 
TREVOR Do you believe for every troubled kid like Benny there's one or two others just waiting to take his place? Like Cesar... or his friend Stevie. 
An awkward moment of silence... 
ELLEN You don't know anything about Cesar's finger, do you, Trevor? 
TREVOR Sometimes a person just runs out of bad choices. Then he's gotta pay a price. What happened to Cesar was inevitable. 
Ellen flickers a terrified smile. 
ELLEN You're scaring me. 
(CONTINUED) 
121   CONTINUED:                                                       121 
TREVOR We make choices in life and we live by 'em. You and I chose to be teachers, to stand on principle. Benny and Cesar, they're takers. They want what they want, and they want it now.

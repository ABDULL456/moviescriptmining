The computer runs an analysis of the symbols carved into the artifact. The symbols flash by. The computer BEEPS, ready. It has isolated the origins of the symbols. They are ABKANI.

Carnby looks over at a photo tacked to the corkboard next to the work station. The photo is of Carnby and Aline. 
INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE 26B                                                                    26B The Office is cluttered with books, maps, diagrams, and strange artifacts. Along one wall are several ceiling-high shelving units, each containing rows of drawers. The drawers hold artifacts from the Museum's collection. 
Aline inspects the stone tablet. She speaks into a tape recorder, like a coroner recording an autopsy. 
ALINE The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of... prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world. 
EXT. SHIP DECK 26C                                                                    26C Captain Chernick approaches Hudgens at the container. The First Mate and Crewman Barnes stand quietly behind them. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK If the container's made of gold, whatever's inside must be worth a fortune. 
HUDGENS You have no idea... 
Chernick pulls out a pistol. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK But I'm looking forward to finding out. 
Chernick smacks Hudgens across the face with his pistol. Hudgens gives Chernick a grim look. 
HUDGENS I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary. 
rewman Barnes grabs Hudgens and twists his arms behind his back, incapacitating him. The First Mate pulls out a revolver and points it right at Hudgens' face. 
Captain Chernick wedges a crowbar into the container's lock. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HUDGENS (CONT'D) You're making a terrible mistake. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK The only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatever's in there. Barnes... 
Crewman Barnes SMASHES Hudgens' head against the container. Hudgens is dazed from the blow. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK (CONT'D) Throw him in there. 
Crewman Barnes throws the dazed Hudgens into a Storage Room built onto the Deck. He slams the thick metal door closed. The door has a small, glass-covered peephole built into it. 
Chernick pries open the lock with the crowbar. Chernick hands the First Mate the crowbar and he jams it into the handle of the door, wedging it closed. 
INT. SHIP STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS Hudgens struggles to his feet. He BANGS on the door, trying to pull it open. 
HUDGENS Captain! Don't open it! 
EXT. SHIP DECK - CONTINUOUS The First Mate and Crewman Barnes watch in fasciation as Captain Chernick prepares to open the gold container. C APTAIN CHERNICK Let's see what all the fuss is about... 
He opens the container. 
With a deep SIGH, the vacuum of dry air escapes. 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - AT THAT MOMENT Carnby sits in front of his computer. He scans through screens of information relating to Abkani civilization. 
Carnby suddenly winces in intense pain. He clutches his head, staggering to his feet. He knocks over a desk lamp and a chair as he stumbles back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grabbing his head and trying to shake off the pain, Carnby collapses unconscious to the floor. He is out cold. 
On the work station, the lynchpin artifact starts to glow. 
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - AT THAT MOMENT JOHN HOUGHTON (early 30s) lies asleep in his bed next to his wife, LINDA HOUGHTON (early 30s). 
Suddenly, John opens his eyes. 
John quietly sits up and gets out of bed. Linda is woken up, but just barely. John walks out of the room. 
LINDA John? 
Linda rolls over and falls back asleep. 
EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT John exits the house. He walks down the front path and out into the night. 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - AT THAT MOMENT Carnby lies unconscious on the floor.

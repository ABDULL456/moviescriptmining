FIONA What? 
SHREK That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that? 
FIONA Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a...(gasps and points) there's an arrow in your butt! 
SHREK What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you look at that? (he goes to pull it out but flinches because it's tender) 
FIONA Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. 
DONKEY (walking up) Why? What's wrong? 
FIONA Shrek's hurt. 
DONKEY Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. 
SHREK Donkey, I'm okay. 
DONKEY You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich? 
FIONA Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. 
DONKEY Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! 
SHREK & FIONA Donkey! 
DONKEY Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. (runs off) 
SHREK What are the flowers for? 
FIONA (like it's obvious) For getting rid of Donkey. 
SHREK Ah. 
FIONA Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little pull) 
SHREK (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'. 
As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and Shrek keeps dodging her hands. 
FIONA I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

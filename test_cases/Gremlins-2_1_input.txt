56 INT. CANADIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT 56 
The restaurant is decorated in a Canadian motif; the salt shakers are hollowed-out hockey pucks. CAMERA finds a booth where Marla, drinking Jolt Cola from a wine glass, is edging closer to Billy, who's nursing a beer. 
MARLA Did you always know you were going to be an artist? 
0 BILLY Well -- I always liked to draw. When I was little, with my crayons, I would do these comic strips, and drawings of the teachers and stuff... 
MARLA I had crayons too, i y. And when I was four years old, I was using them to write dos to the other children. Even then, I knew. C_j

MARLA Right. Now, let's talk strategy. You realize, this changes everything -- for you, me, the department... 
BILLY What does? 
MARLA Your relationship to Mister Clamp. Your access. I can see a future, Billy. I see more office space...embossed letterhead...I see us -- (lowers her voice) -- swallowing up the publicity department. 
BILLY Wow. I'm being open 4th Billy.- haven't talked abQu feelings with anyone. 
BILLY See, I usually don't pay too much attention to office politics and stuff. I have so much work to do on the illustrations -- 
MARLA You have talent, Billy, and that's wonderful. It's a God-given blessing situation. But even an artist has to have goals. 
BILLY Definitely. It's like I was saying to Kate, I said, Honey, you know, for an artist -- Maria leans closer to Billy, her tone more intimate than before. 
MARLA I can help you reach those goals, Billy. If we join forces... 
BILLY Oh, we should definitely join -- Billy FEELS something in his lap. He looks down. It is Marla's stockinged FOOT.

MAX (CONT'D) Oh. Oh, thank God! Hey, hey, man, help me out here! 
WHITE GUY #1 Yo, whassup? 
MAX (fast, stumbling) I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel, here, by this guy, who's taped me in the car, 'cause he's up in the building somewhere... 
CLOSER, now, the four are in baggies, hoodies and tattooed with lightning bolts on their necks, swastikas on chests, one has "5150" tattooed on his shaven eyebrow (police code for emotionally disturbed)... 
WHITE GUY #2 You all trapped in there and shit? 
MAX ...yeah, he's coming back. Hurry. Get me loose so I can call the cops... 
WHITE GUY #1 nods...and pulls a chromed .380 and points it at Max.

WHITE GUY #1                                  * Fuck that, man, gimme your wallet.

The others have walked off down the alley, laughing. One tosses    * a beer bottle that smashes. Utter disbelief from Max... 
MAX Are you kidding me? 
WHITE GUY #1 I will fuck you up! Hand it over. 
MAX (beat) My hands are taped to the damn steering wheel! 
It takes a moment for WHITE GUY #1 to process this. He steps to the window, presses the .380 against Max's cheek. It's utterly terrifying, everything happening fast: 
MAX (CONT'D) ...don't shoot me, don't shoot me... 
WHITE GUY #1 Then get your ass up, up... 
Max pulls himself up by the steering wheel, trying to get his butt off the seat to give the Young Man access. The White Guy #1 gropes for Max's back pocket, trying to get the wallet, pressing the gun to his face, the other guys down the alley, turn the corner. 
White Guy #1 pulls Max's wallet, pockets it... 
...and pauses, seeing Vincent's briefcase on the back seat. 
He yanks open the back door, grabs Vincent's briefcase, too, and walks off after his friends. White Guys #3 and #4 turned the corner. White Guy #2 lingers. 
Max, still taped, is shaken. He can't believe what happened. He looks through the windshield at... 
WHITE GUY #1 
...walking off, cocky as hell, about to vanish into the night... 
BACK OF WHITE GUY #1 
VINCENT (O.S.) Yo' homie... 
White Guy #1 turns, to see the silhouette of Vincent. He raises his .380 side-handed, like he sees gangsters do on MTV. White Guy #2 joins him. 
(CONTINUED) 
10/4/03 MM revs. (blue)    38. 32D   CONTINUED: (5)                                                  32D 
VINCENT (CONT'D) (even) That my briefcase...? 
White Guy #1 approaches Vincent from the front...#2 from Vincent's left. 
WHITE GUY #2 May-be.   And what the fuck else you got? 
He closes on Vincent with the .380, held high and on the side. Vincent's left slams aside #1's .380. Draws and FIRES from the hip, putting TWO ROUNDS into #1. HAMMERS-ON TWO ROUNDS to the sternum, pivots. ONE to the head of #2. All in 1.6 seconds. 
White Guy #2, falling backwards, is dead before he hits the ground. #1 never saw it coming. Vincent picks up his case, retrieves something from #1's pocket, puts one more into the            * head of #1 on the way back to the cab... 
...where Max saw it all.   Frozen in horror.   Astonished. 
The rear door opens. Vincent hefts his briefcase into the back seat. He gets into the front. 
Vincent sits for a moment, staring off, not looking at Max. Maybe ready to kill him. 
Vincent raises something into view.    Max's wallet.     He tosses it in Max's lap. 
Vincent flicks his hand. CLICK-CLACK, a Reeves folding hunter in dull metal, razor sharp... 
VINCENT (quietly) Where's the button?    Under the dash? 
MAX (dry whisper) Yeah. 
Vincent leans over and slices the plastic tie, freeing Max's hands. Beat. 
VINCENT You mind turning it off? 
Max doesn't move for a moment, then reaches under the dash and turns off the strobes. 
10/11/03 MM revs. (goldenrod)   39. 
33    INT. CAB - MAX + VINCENT (TRAVELING) - NIGHT                   33 
Vincent in the back seat. (Juxtapose to a different continuity.      * Through the side window, we see Crenshaw Boulevard barbershops,      * music shops. We're stopped for a light.) Max is shell-shocked. 
VINCENT Another collateral. 
MAX What's that? 
VINCENT Collateral damage. People in the wrong place at the wrong time. (meets Max's gaze) And you? You attract attention? You are gonna get people killed who didn't need to be. Understand? 
MAX I'm low on gas... 
VINCENT Pull in there.

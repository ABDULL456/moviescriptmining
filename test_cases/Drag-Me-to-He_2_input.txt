STEPHANIE Well, I was reading the Wall Street Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but didn't have the liquidity. I met with their CFO and presented a formula for restructuring-some of their long term debt. It created an environment where I was able to offer them a rather attractive loan

GEORGE You sure sound like you've got a lot going for you, Stephanie. 
TRUDY Your mother must be very proud. 
STEPHANIE I suppose. I don't see her much. 
TRUDY Why is that? 
STEPHANIE Well, ever since my dad died she doesn't talk much. She mostly stays on the farm and... keeps to herself. Because... There is an awkward silence. 
TRUDY Does your mother have a drinking problem? 
RAY Cut her some slack, mom, she-- 
STEPHANIE Yes. I'm afraid she does. 
TRUDY I'm sorry. It's nothing to be ashamed of. And I find your honesty refreshing. 
STEPHANIE Thank you. 
TRUDY t You've got back bone. Not like that other girl Ray brought by... What was her name? Alicia? She was dreadful. So ill-mannered. And no ambition. 
RAY 
MOM- 
TRUDY (stage whisper to 
STEPHANIE) He found her through the,internet. 
RAY Mors, please. 
TRUDY Stephanie, am I being too tough on Ray? Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at Ray. 
STEPHANIE No. Not at all. That's what mom's are for. 
TRUDY Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will try that Harvest cake of yours, after all. Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and emits a tiny cough. 
STEPHANIE Excuse me. She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger.

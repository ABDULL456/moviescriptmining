SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT \nA miserable night, raining and cold. Malcolm turns into the bar. \n76 \tINT. THE BAR - NIGHT \nShaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through. He is now a familiar figure to the bar's DENIZENS. He is met with ad lib cries: \"Hey, Little,\" \"Have a taste,\" from the men; and from the women: \"Come here, sugar,\" \"Where you been?\" \nMalcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar. It's immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him. He is no longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler. \nANGLE - BOOTH \nMalcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress. \nANGLE - HONEY \nA fine copper tan waitress comes to him. \nHONEY I thought you said we were going to the movies last night. \nMALCOLM I say a lot of things. \nHONEY And like a fool I believe it. \nMALCOLM Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's. \nHoney stares at him. \nMALCOLM (contd) I said now. \nShe leaves. He leans his head back against the booth -- \nA FEMALE VOICE Daniel come in yet, Honey? \nMalcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice. It's familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past. He looks toward the bar and sees the women who asked the question. \nLAURA - MALCOLM'S POV \nIt's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw. She is still young, still vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed. She is unaware of Malcolm. \nHONEY Ain't that him now? \nANGLE FAVORING DANIEL. He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly. He goes to the corner of the bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily. \nDANIEL Hey, gorgeous, how you been? Waiting long? Lemme see you. Wow! \nIt's obvious he's a junkie. And in need of a fix. QUICK! \nSHOT - MALCOLM \nHoney places his drink and cigarettes before him. He's watching, taking it all in immediately. Laura is clearly crazy about Daniel. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe looks, then belts down his drink. \nCLOSER - LAURA AND DANIEL \nDaniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five-dollar bill.

Malcolm nods, and Archie lets his arm go; standing next to him is Sophia. \nARCHIE (contd) Honey, he didn't mean it. \nArchie wiggles his fingers and Honey goes, but not before throwing daggers at Malcolm and Sophia. Archie sits down, takes out a cigar. For a good beat there is a coolness between them. Then Malcolm reaches over and lights Archie's cigar. Sophia stares at her man, he then motions for her to sit down beside him. \nARCHIE (contd) Thanks. You got it. Who's beating on you, Red? You looking a little up tight. \nThe father-son thing is back, but Malcolm will never again be the student. \nMALCOLM Daddy, where's my money? \nARCHIE What you talking? \nMALCOLM You owe me six big ones. \nArchie looks at him, non-comprehending. \nMALCOLM 1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it? \nARCHIE You din't have no 1, 2, 8. \nMALCOLM Was you that high?

But you slipping, baby. You done slipped. \nArchie is controlling himself. Everyone in Small's is all ears, a falling out between Malcolm and Archie -- their reps are at stake. \nANGLE. Archie looks at Sammy. Sammy is neutral. Archie digs in his pockets, comes up with a roll.

He laughs because he knows you ain't white. \nMalcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry has said disturbs him. \nMALCOLM Who are you? \nMalcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the barrage. \nBEMBRY The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light. \nMALCOLM Elijah who? \nBEMBRY Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix.

Malcolm is painting the plates, a little removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, idles by a window. \nA whistle sounds, ending the work shift.

A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind. \nMALCOLM Tell you this: you ain't no fool. \nBEMBRY Don't con me. Don't try... \nMALCOLM Okay, okay. \nBEMBRY Don't con me. \nMALCOLM What do you do with your time? \nBEMBRY I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork. \nMALCOLM That's what Mama used to say. \nBEMBRY Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog. \nMalcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks he has come to the essence of a hustle. \nMALCOLM Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft. \nBEMBRY I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black. \nMALCOLM What? Everybody knows God is White. \nBEMBRY (contd) But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary? \nMALCOLM What for? \nBEMBRY Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con? \nMALCOLM What the hell for, man? \nBEMBRY Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you. \nMALCOLM Okay, okay.

No one else is in the book-lined room. \nMALCOLM I can't make out that shit. \nBEMBRY Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty.

Of the color of pure snow; reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The opposite of black, hence free from spot or blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable. \nMalcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis. \nMALCOLM That's bullshit.

He is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the Bible. Right now he goes into street talk. \nBEMBRY I'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these can't nobody read, be he black or white or a Ph.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees. \nMalcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man.

Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word for word. \n114 \tINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nThere are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their titles: W.E.B.

Wells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc. \nGUARD BARNES'S VOICE Closing. Knock it off. \nMalcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast. He gathers up his books with care.

Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes. \nMALCOLM Take 'em. I don't smoke no more. \nHe takes the pack happily and goes. Malcolm reaches into his jacket again, takes out a book.

They walk throughout the scene. \nANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big cheer from the black prisoners.

But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that. \nMalcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement. \nBEMBRY (contd) We were a race of kings when the white men went around on all fours. \nThere is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd. \nMALCOLM This a helluva game. Somethin's going on. \nHe sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over: \nMALCOLM (contd) Hey, whatsa score? \nCHUCK 10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear? \nMALCOLM What? \nCHUCK The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson and we pounding the hell out of them, celebrating. \n", "test3_id": 2966}

{"train": "Malcom X \nFourth draft (1991) Screenplay by James Baldwin, Arnold Perl and Spike Lee Based on The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley \nFADE IN: \n1  \tEXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY \nIt is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. \nSHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band. \n2 \tOMIT \n3 \tOMIT \n4 \tOMIT \n5 \tEXT. STREET - DAY \nFOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is not dissuaded. \n6\tINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY \nShorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing being done just so, in time-honored fashion. \nHe slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar. He adds water and makes a paste of the starch. \nBehind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON) one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking. \nCHOLLY After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good to me at all. \nThe men laugh. \nANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot. \nANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. \nCHOLLY'S VOICE She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot. \nTOOMER And when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black sunovabitch. \nCholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. \nCHOLLY Will you let me tell it? \nON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of rubber gloves. \nSHORTY Where's Homeboy? \nHe is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child. \nCHOLLY Red's in the head, man. \nTOOMER You mean hiding in the head. \nCHOLLY Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. \nHis hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension. \nTOOMER Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, Homeboy? \nCHOLLY Man, don't scare him more than he's scared already. Ain't too bad... \nMalcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of paper. \nCHOLLY ...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, Homeboy? \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMalcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. \nShorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a kind of execution. \nCHOLLY Git his forehead and eyebrows. \nSHORTY I know what I'm doing. \nShorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby. \nSHORTY (contd) Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a hole through cement. \nCHOLLY Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut. \nMalcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM I thought you said it was gonna sting... this ain't nothin'. \nFor a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries to catch his breath: his head is on fire. \nMALCOLM (contd) You motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm burning up. My damn head is on fire. \nHe nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him. \nShorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the congolene into his hair. \nMalcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his hair. \nSHORTY Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out. \nMalcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting Malcolm and the shop in the process. \n7\tOMIT \n8 \tOMIT \n9  \tINT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY \nSHORTY Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around. \nShorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into the jacket... \nShoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ...... dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain. \nGetting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. \nWIDER SHOT \nThe music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more remarkable quality. \nFOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM \nHe is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. He makes his way through the watching audience. \nCLOSE - LAURA \nShe is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm approaching. \nTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers. \nMALCOLM Come on, baby, let's show 'em how. \nLaura smiles shyly; she's willing. \nMALCOLM (contd) You better get out of them shoes, girl. \nLaura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of sneakers. \n17 \tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR \nBecause of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the \"flapping eagle\" and the \"kangaroo.\" Malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect partner. She loves it. \nANGLE WITH THE CROWD \nSo does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: \"Go, man, go.\" \"Hey, Red.\" \"Mmmmmm ummm.\" \nANGLE: - SHORTY \nA big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides. \nTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp waves over. \nMalcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to his steps. \nSeeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and Malcolm go into a solo. \nANGLES \nThe crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience. \nCLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) \nClapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. \nCLOSE SHOT - SHORTY \nWaiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner. \nSHORTY Hey, man, gimme some skin. \nMALCOLM Shorty, this is Laura. \nLaura is flushed and out of breath and joyous. \nLAURA 'Lo. I've got to freshen up. \nMALCOLM Now you come back. \nLaura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back. \nSHORTY That's a fine chick. \nMALCOLM Fine as May wine. \nSHORTY Except she live on the hill and got a grandma. \nMALCOLM Make it too easy and it ain't no fun. \nThen his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a simple, direct gesture, \"Want to dance?\" Malcolm eyes Shorty and wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms. \nANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR \nImmediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine steps. \nTWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock his black world. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nTrying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for it. \nSOPHIA Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, and come on back? \nHe stops in his tracks. He can't believe it. \nSOPHIA (contd) Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you get back. \nHe can only grin. \n18\tEXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT \nThe porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get away. \nMALCOLM I better not come in. \nLAURA I ain't stupid. \nMALCOLM I mean it's late, baby. \nLAURA I know where you're going. \nMALCOLM I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest. \nLaura walks to the door. \nMALCOLM (contd) Baby, I'll call you tomorrow. \nLAURA What for? I ain't white and I don't put out. \nThe front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON. \nCLOSE EARL LITTLE \nEarl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks. \n27 \tINT. A HEARING ROOM - DAY \nA room, clinically empty; table, chair, and MR. HOLWAY. He is putting papers into his briefcase; the hearing is concluded. \nLOUISE What you mean took his own life?! \nHOLWAY I'm sorry, ma'am. You heard the verdict. A man bash in the back of his head with a hammer, lay down on the tracks and kill himself! We merely act on the verdict. We don't make them. \nHe is nearly out the door. \nLOUISE Do you pay or don't you? \nHOLWAY Read the policy, ma'am. It clearly states. \n28\tOMIT \n29 \tINT. SOPHIA'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nMalcolm lies in bed, naked under the sheet. A half-empty whiskey bottle and an ashtray full of butts are on the night table: last night's partying. \nSOPHIA You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie? \nMALCOLM C'mere. \nWIDEN TO SHOW SOPHIA at the stove fixing eggs. She wears an apron and nothing else. It's a nicely furnished middle-class apartment. \nSOPHIA Sweetie, they're almost ready. \nMALCOLM You hear me, girl? \nShe shrugs, shuts off the burner, smiles and ambles toward him. \nSOPHIA You the man. \nMALCOLM You better believe it. \nShe starts to sit down on the bed next to him. \nMALCOLM (contd) Sit over there. \nHe points to a nearby chair. Sophia makes an amiable hand-shrug and complacently goes. \nSOPHIA You evil this morning. \nMALCOLM What's your story, baby? \nHe doesn't want to hear her; he wants to talk. He goes right on: \nMALCOLM (contd) You one of them white bitches can't get enough black dick. Is that what you are? \nSophia smiles. She aims to please. Malcolm smacks the bed next to him. She gets up and comes over. \nMALCOLM (contd) Take it off. \nShe takes off the apron. \nMALCOLM (contd) Now kiss my feet. Kiss 'em! \nCLOSE - SOPHIA \nAs Sophia bends to do so. \nMALCOLM Feed me. \nANGLE. Sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at Malcolm's side. She spoons some into his mouth. He chews and swallows slowly, then grabs her head and brings it to his. A long, brutal kiss. Then he pulls her head away by the hair. She looks at him: anything he wants. \nMALCOLM Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler \"rape,\" sister? \nSOPHIA Me? \nMALCOLM You will, baby -- if the time come. \nSOPHIA Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot. \nMalcolm lays back on the pillow and she holds out the eggs to him. \nMALCOLM Sure wish your mama and papa could see you now. And that ofay you gonna marry. \n30\tEXT. A BEACH - BRIGHT SUNLIGHT - DAY \nMalcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach. They are dressed but have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up. They walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in. \nLAURA Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart. \nMALCOLM All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin. \nLAURA I do know I love you. \nLaura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory. Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA \nLAURA Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one around. Now? \nMalcolm turns his head from her, he gets up. \nMALCOLM Let's go. \nLAURA Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her. \nMALCOLM Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think. \nShe looks at him. \nLAURA She raised me, my mother died when I was six. Is your mother alive? \nMALCOLM Yeah, she's alive. \n31 \tOMIT \n32\tOMIT \n37 \tOMIT \n38 \tEXT. A SIGN - BLINDING SUNLIGHT - DAY \nIt reads \"KALAMAZOO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE MENTALLY INSANE\" \n39 \tINT. A ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY \nThe room is totally white and Louise sits in a white smock at a window in a rocking chair. \nCLOSE LOUISE \nAs she rocks. \nLOUISE I said it just as plain, I said, don't let them feed that boy no pig, because he got enough of the devil in him already. I told her she ain't got no reason talk to me that way cuz' my hair blow in the wind. You want my skin. All right, I'll give it to you. I'll scrape it off. See how you like it. \nANGLE - Louise starts to sing a Negro spiritual. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe has been standing there in deep pain all along. \nTHE SOUND OF A SPEEDING TRAIN IS HEARD. \n40 \tEXT. THE YANKEE CLIPPER - DAY \nThe crack train of the New York, New Haven & Hartford speeds through the New England countryside. \n41\tINT. GALLEY OF TRAIN - NIGHT \nTHREE ELDERLY BLACK WAITERS and Malcolm wearing a sandwichman's uniform are crowded around a portable radio in the galley where food is prepared. The four stand around TULLY, a bland-faced personification of fine Pullman service. They are all listening to the JOE LOUIS-BILLY CONN heavyweight championship fight. \nTULLY Nigger, shut up so we can hear. \nMALCOLM C'mon, Joe. \nWAITER #1 Turn it up, Tully. \nTULLY It is up. Fool be quiet. \nWAITER #2 Tully, move the antenna. . . . \nTully turns some knobs. \nWAITER #3 This Mick is tough. \nTULLY Joe is just playing possum. He's waiting for an opening. \nThe waiters are acting as if they are at ringside. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER A left jab to the jaw and a right cross, scored by Louis and Conn is hurt, as Louis rips a right to the jaw. Conn is staggering, but he won't go down. Conn bops a left hook, he's reeling around the ring. Louis hooks a left and a right to the jaw and Conn is down. \nThe waiters are going crazy. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER He's taking the count, four, five, six, seven, he's on his back, eight, nine, he's getting up, no! The referee says it's over. The bout has stopped. \nThe waiters are all jumping up and down when the galley door opens. MR. COOPER, the white man in charge of the kitchen, pops his head in. \nCOOPER What in hell's going on? \nIn a moment's notice Tully and the others have resumed their customary servient roles. \nTULLY Nothing, Mr. Cooper. \nCOOPER Got a lot of hungry customers out there. \nTULLY Yes sir, Mr. Cooper, soup done finished. \nMALCOLM On my way, Mr. Charlie. \nCooper eyes him narrowly. \nCOOPER The name is Mr. Cooper and don't you forget it.

I got coffee, I got cake and I got ice cream too. Right chere. \nANGLE FAVORING A WHITE CUSTOMER, BLADES. \nBLADES Hey, boy. Gimme a cheese on white and coffee. \nMalcolm's mood is exuberant: the fight is still in his ears. He makes the delivery with a flourish and a smile. \nMALCOLM Yes, sir. Best in the house. \nBLADES You mighty pleased with yourself, boy. \nMALCOLM Yes, sir. I aims to please. \nBLADES I like you, boy. \n45A\tINSERT - FANTASY PROJECTION. Malcolm picks up a slab of cream pie and pushes it in Blades' face. \n45B\tBACK TO THE PASSENGER CAR \nNormality again: Malcolm finishes serving him with complete servility.

Archie is flattered. \nARCHIE Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown. \nMALCOLM Man's rep travels. \nARCHIE How 'bout that? \nThen seeing Sammy and Cadillac's dubious visages, Archie adds: \nARCHIE (contd) You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy? \nMALCOLM My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist. \nArchie laughs. Even Sammy smiles. Cadillac still holds his judgment. \nARCHIE Is your papa West Indian? \nMALCOLM No, my mama.

You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job. \nMALCOLM I done told the man what he could do with his train. \nARCHIE When? \nMALCOLM Just now. \nThe three established hustlers smile at the newcomer in their midst. \nARCHIE Come on, baby.

SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT \nA miserable night, raining and cold. Malcolm turns into the bar. \n76 \tINT. THE BAR - NIGHT \nShaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through. He is now a familiar figure to the bar's DENIZENS. He is met with ad lib cries: \"Hey, Little,\" \"Have a taste,\" from the men; and from the women: \"Come here, sugar,\" \"Where you been?\" \nMalcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar. It's immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him. He is no longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler. \nANGLE - BOOTH \nMalcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress. \nANGLE - HONEY \nA fine copper tan waitress comes to him. \nHONEY I thought you said we were going to the movies last night. \nMALCOLM I say a lot of things. \nHONEY And like a fool I believe it. \nMALCOLM Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's. \nHoney stares at him. \nMALCOLM (contd) I said now. \nShe leaves. He leans his head back against the booth -- \nA FEMALE VOICE Daniel come in yet, Honey? \nMalcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice. It's familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past. He looks toward the bar and sees the women who asked the question. \nLAURA - MALCOLM'S POV \nIt's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw. She is still young, still vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed. She is unaware of Malcolm. \nHONEY Ain't that him now? \nANGLE FAVORING DANIEL. He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly. He goes to the corner of the bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily. \nDANIEL Hey, gorgeous, how you been? Waiting long? Lemme see you. Wow! \nIt's obvious he's a junkie. And in need of a fix. QUICK! \nSHOT - MALCOLM \nHoney places his drink and cigarettes before him. He's watching, taking it all in immediately. Laura is clearly crazy about Daniel. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe looks, then belts down his drink. \nCLOSER - LAURA AND DANIEL \nDaniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five-dollar bill.

Malcolm looks: \nMALCOLM'S P0V \nSammy at the nearby bar: his hand in his coat pocket. \nCLOSE - ARCHIE \nHis hand is also in his pocket. \nMALCOLM And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down. \nARCHIE That's what it is. Walk on out. \nMALCOLM Let Billie finish. \nARCHIE Now. \nArchie backs away from the table, his gun on Malcolm. \nANGLE. As Sammy moves a step toward Malcolm, Malcolm rises in his seat. \nSOPHIA You had the number. \nMALCOLM Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later. \nCLOSE - BILLIE \nShe knows what's going on. \nANGLE - Sammy and Archie are walking behind Malcolm, when he pushes a waitress into their path with drinks flying everywhere, Malcolm darts away. \n87\tINT.

THE STREET - NIGHT \nMalcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street. He stops to catch his breath, to regain his composure. He is shook up, frustrated, but mostly saddened.

Get the kids. \nANGLE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM \nMusic of a dance combo heard in BG. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) Three things I was always scared of: a job, a bust and jail.

What you got? \nPeg smiles, afraid of Malcolm. \nSHORTY Jesus, Red, she's just a kid. \nMALCOLM Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this. \nShorty eyes him with amazement. The degree of Malcolm's depravity surprises even him. \nMALCOLM Surprise you, baby? Well, that's the way it is. What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. Let me have it. All of you-- \nGlances exchanged among Shorty, Sophia and Peg. Shorty reaches into his pocket. \n95 \tINT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMalcolm with Sophia, Shorty and Peg around him. \nMALCOLM We gone rob this town blind. Anybody want out say so. \nNobody answers; they'll go with Malcolm. \nMALCOLM (contd) Okay. I got the stake and I got a fence. I need a driver. \nPEG How about Rudy? \nMALCOLM Who's Rudy? \nSHORTY Yeah, Rudy. \nJUMP CUT: \n95A \tSAME LOCATION - LATER \nRUDY is with them. He is a good-looking, very-light skinned black, tough as they come. \nRUDY I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one. \nMALCOLM What can you do? \nThey are in the process of appraising each other, seeing which one has the bigger penis. \nRUDY You name it, feller. \nSHORTY Rudy does catering. Rich joints on Beacon Hill. \nMALCOLM That ain't bad. \nSHORTY Tell him about Baldy. \nRUDY Yeah. This rich ofay, like he's 60. I give him a bath on Friday. \nPeg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified. \nRUDY (contd) Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off. \nMALCOLM So what about him? \nRUDY So? The man got silver, china, rugs-- \nMALCOLM Might be all right. \nRUDY Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge? \nMalcolm smiles easily. \nMALCOLM You want to be the head man? \nRUDY That's right. \nMALCOLM Head nigger in charge? \nRUDY I'm the man. \nMALCOLM Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this. \nHe takes out his gun, a .38 revolver. He dumps the shells on the table, then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel. \nMALCOLM (contd) I'll flip first. \nHe puts the revolver to his own head. \nPEG Don't. \nMalcolm squeezes the trigger. It clicks. Now he twirls the barrel again and hands the gun to Rudy. \nMALCOLM Your flip, baby. \nRudy is staring at him; so are they all. Malcolm puts the gun to his temple again. \nSOPHIA Red, for God's sake-- \nHe pulls the trigger a second time. Click. Now he twirls it again. \nSHORTY Christ, Red, no-- \nPEG I can't stand it. \nEach time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has not had a fix in over a week. \nGUARD WILKINS Crichlow. \nSECOND PRISONER A 5991301. \nSame procedure. \nANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer -- beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him with great respect. \nPETE Looka Satan. \nBEMBRY I see him. \nBembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners. \nPETE He bout to bust. \nBEMBRY No, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix his face to please them, neither. \nANGLE. The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm. \nGUARD WILKINS Harrington. \nTHIRD PRISONER B 775717. \nGUARD BARNES Yeah. Lucky Seven. \nDoor slammed and locked. \nCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM \nThe guards are now in front of him. \nGUARD WILKINS Little. \nMalcolm doesn't move. \nGUARD BARNES State your number. \nMalcolm doesn't answer, doesn't blink. \nGUARD WILKINS Little. \nANGLE. Bembry in the FG of the scene. \nBEMBRY He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break. \nIt's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry. \nGUARD BARNES 0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your number, Little. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM I forgot it. \nCLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY \nShaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming. \nANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face. \nGUARD WILKINS Can you read, boy? Thass your number. \nGUARD BARNES Now say it. \nMALCOLM I'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number. \nGUARD WILKINS Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is. \nAnd slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor. \nGUARD BARNES Two days in the hole. Take him. \nWilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call. \nGUARD BARNES (contd) Burnham. \nFOURTH PRISONER A 551613, sir. \nJUMP CUT: \n103 \tINT. A SOLITARY CELL - DAY \nOnly the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of a mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the mattress. \nA clang as the heavy door is opened. \nGUARD CONE Time's up. Get on your feet. \nMalcolm stands. \nGUARD CONE (contd) Little, state your number. \nA beat as Malcolm stares at the man, refusing to answer. \nGUARD CONE (contd) You just drew two more days. \nAnd slams the door shut. \n104\tINT. SOLITARY - NIGHT \nIt is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room. Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall. \nTRUSTEE'S VOICE Water. \nThe long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, wrenching it off in his fury. \n105\tOMIT \n106\tINT. SOLITARY CELL - DAY \nTWO-SHOT - A WHITE CHAPLAIN AND MALCOLM \nCHAPLAIN GILL Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son? \nMALCOLM They were Hebrew, weren't they? \nCHAPLAIN GILL That's right. \nMALCOLM As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew. \nCHAPLAIN GILL Just what is your question? \nMALCOLM What color were the original Hebrews? \nCHAPLAIN GILL I told you we don't know for certain. \nMALCOLM Then we don't know that God was white. \nThere is a strong reaction to this. \nCHAPLAIN GILL Now just a moment, just a moment-- \nMALCOLM But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black. \nCHAPLAIN GILL Just what are you saying? \nMALCOLM I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black. \n127A\tINSERT FLASH - A BLOND, BLUE-EYED JESUS ON THE CROSS (Note: Try to get footage from _The Last Temptation of Christ_ [Willem Dafoe]) \nMALCOLM'S VOICE God is black. \n128\tINT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY \nMalcolm opens the door, the room is dark and he sees a small, slight man standing against the window, he doesn't move. This is the same man who appeared in Malcolm's cell, this is the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm slowly moves toward him; he is completely humbled in his presence. \nCLOSE - ELIJAH \nHe turns from the window to Malcolm. \nELIJAH My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a pimp and the world is still full of temptation. When God bragged how faithful Job was, the devil argued that only God's protective hedge around him kept him pure, the devil said remove the hedge and he will curse his maker. Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I believe you will remain faithful. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe cannot say anything and he drops his head, he is overwhelmed with heartfelt emotion. \n129\tINT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - P.M. \nIn contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of activity. Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; Lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; Bembry is recruiting on the telephone. \nMALCOLM How many you turning out? \nSIDNEY \nMALCOLM Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do. \nSIDNEY Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation. \nEarl moves toward Malcolm and extends his hands. Malcolm shakes it warmly. \nMALCOLM We can always use another good brother. \nEARL I'm a willing servant for Allah. \n129A \tEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nSunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are \"fishing.\" They're trying to convert the Black Christians. Malcolm speaks, while the others hand out leaflets. \nMALCOLM You think you are Christians, and yet you see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on trees. You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you. He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on earth. Islam is the black man's true religion. \n130\tEXT. STREET CORNER, 125TH AND SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY \nMalcolm is talking to a CROWD from a ladder. \nMALCOLM And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God is black and you are made in His image and don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are. \nThe crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity. \nMALCOLM (contd) My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's pie in the sky. \nANGLE ON SIDNEY \nAmid the listeners, watching their response. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth? \nCLOSE SHOT - SEVERAL LISTENERS \nThey turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the audience on an adjacent SPEAKER. He is a young firebrand: \nSPEAKER The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for rent control and for community control of our schools. \nPAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just one among many: \nSECOND SPEAKER If the man behind the counter ain't black, don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think black. Buy black. \nANGLE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead. \n131\tEXT. OPEN AIR \"MAID'S MARKET\" - DAY \nA place where black women come to offer themselves for day work. SEVERAL ARE SEEN. A WHITE WOMEN comes up to one to interview her (bargain with her). Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen, speaking to the women from a ladder. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. Beautiful because you are black. Because black is beautiful. You work in the white folks' kitchen so I don't have to tell you that they're devils. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM (contd) And you are putting yourselves on the auction block, letting them examine you like a horse, like a slave. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that you are black and should be proud... \nFACE OF ONE BLACK WOMAN, beginning to shake her head in accord. \n132\tINT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT \nThe SAME WOMAN, now at a Muslim meeting. The faces of other listeners (from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in Malcolm's audience. \nThe headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made. It is better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. Bembry, Sidney, and Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. Malcolm stands at a podium. \nMALCOLM We're not American, we're Africans who happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa. We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. Plymouth Rock landed on us. \n136 \tINT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT \nMalcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more personal than before, because of his recent encounters. In the audience, sitting with Bembry, is BETTY, a lovely dark-skinned woman. Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried sisters) is more than religious. \nMALCOLM --and what has the white devil made of them: dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He should fall on his knees and say, \"My kind commits history's greatest crime against your kind every day of your life.\" But does he? No. He scorns you, splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, then who? If not now, then when? \nANGLE - THE AUDIENCE \nMany stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: \"I'm with you, Brother Malcolm,\" \"Praise Allah,\" \"Me, Brother Malcolm.\" \nThere is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm acknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the heady excitement of leadership. \nCLOSE - BETTY AND BEMBRY \nBoth are moved by Malcolm's performances. \nBETTY (whispering) He ought to try to make it a little easier, Brother Bembry. \nBEMBRY Why don't you try telling him that, Sister Betty? \n137\tINT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT \nThe Muslim movement has grown enormously. The activity in this anteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that. Betty and Bembry stand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple: MONDAY - Fruit of Islam Meeting; TUESDAY - Unity Night; WEDNESDAY - Student Enrollment; THURSDAY - Muslim Girls Training; FRIDAY - General Civilization Class; SATURDAY - Swahili, etc. \nA stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom. He excuses himself from a group of MUSLIMS, making his way toward Bembry. \nMALCOLM (little out of breath) Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street? \nBEMBRY I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty. \nMalcolm nods at her; she nods in return. \nBEMBRY (contd) The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene and diet. \nMalcolm mutters \"very good,\" but his mind is clearly on a million other details. \nBEMBRY (contd) The Sister stresses care of the body and regular eating habits. \nMalcolm is still distracted. \nBETTY The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land? \nMalcolm is stopped. He looks at Betty. \nMALCOLM What? \nBETTY She ate. \nMalcolm laughs. \nBETTY (contd) And the Sister suggests he put his actions where his mouth is. \nMalcolm's laughter is heard, in response. \n138 \tINT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why? \nBETTY If you want to tell me. \nCUT TO: \n138A \tEXT. ELIJAH'S GARDEN - DAY \nMalcolm sits next to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The student and the teacher. \nMALCOLM If you want to tell me. \nELIJAH Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women. \nCUT BACK TO: \n138B \tBETTY AND MALCOLM \nBetty says nothing, she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward him. The food has thus far gone untouched. Malcolm continues. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms. \nBETTY Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage? \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE - ELIJAH \nELIJAH No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not practice celibacy. If a woman is the right height for a man, the right complexion, if her age is half the man's plus seven, if she understands that man's essential nature is strong and woman's weak, if she loves children, can cook, sew and stay out of trouble-- \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE - BETTY \nBETTY I think you've made your points, Brother Malcolm. \nMALCOLM What points? \nBETTY That you haven't time for either marriage or eating-- \nMalcolm chuckles a bit. \nBETTY (contd) --and that women aren't the only ones who talk a lot. \nNow he bursts out laughing. \nCLOSE - BROTHERS SIDNEY AND EARL \nThey are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior. \nTWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM \nBETTY If you'll start eating, there is a question I have. Go ahead. Start. \nHe takes a forkful of the salad. \nBETTY (contd) Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork. \nMalcolm's face goes taut. He nods sharply at Sidney, as Benjamin watches them both. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE I demand to see Brother Johnson. \n142 \tINT. POLICE STATION - LATE P.M. \nMalcolm facing a DESK SERGEANT, TWO UNIFORMED COPS and a PLAINCLOTHESMAN off to one side. \nSERGEANT Who the hell are you? \nMALCOLM I'm from Muslim Temple 7. \nCOP Never heard of you. \nMALCOLM Where is he? \nThe police respond with a squeeze play intended to intimidate Malcolm: \nSERGEANT Nobody here by that name. \nPLAINCLOTHES What's your name, feller? \nHe feels the power play and stiffens in resistance. \nMALCOLM I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out. \nPLAINCLOTHES You heard the Sergeant. Outside. \nMalcolm stands his ground coolly. \nMALCOLM Take a look out that window. I intend to see Brother Johnson. \nThe cops eye each other. Plainclothes walks to the window. \n143\tEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - LATE P.M. \nAcross from the station is a phalanx of some FIFTY MEN of the Fruit of Islam. All are dressed in dark suits with white shirts. They stand in military formation: eyes forward, every face burning. People from the neighborhood have formed a crowd behind and around them. WE MAKE OUT Benjamin among the crowd. \n143A\tINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nPLAINCLOTHES Who the hell are they? \nMALCOLM Brothers of Brother Johnson. \nPLAINCLOTHES Eddie, let's see that blotter. \nTWO-SHOT - FAVOR MALCOLM \nAs the cops examine the police blotter. \nSERGEANT Yeah. We got a Muslim. The relief must of put it down. \nPLAINCLOTHES But you can't see him. You ain't his lawyer. \nSERGEANT No lawyer, no see. \nMALCOLM Until I'm satisfied Brother Johnson is receiving proper medical attention, no one will move. \nCops eye each other. Plainclothes nods slightly, he has to give in, Malcolm is not playing. \n144\tINT. A LOCKUP - SAME \nThe back of Malcolm's head, as he examines Brother Johnson. As he comes up OUT OF FRAME, WE SEE that Johnson has been badly beaten. \nMALCOLM (shaking) Only a pig could do a thing like that. \nPLAINCLOTHES Watch your tongue, boy. \nMALCOLM Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that. \nSergeant puts a restraining hand on Plainclothes. \nMALCOLM (contd) That man belongs in a hospital. Get an ambulance. Now! \n145 \tEXT. THE STREET - LATER (DARKER) \nAs Johnson's body, on a stretcher, is hurried into an ambulance. The crowd has grown in proportions. There are ad libs: \"Goddam pigs,\" \"Damn police brutality,\" \"Least they got him out of the meat house.\" \nMalcolm with the Sergeant and a LIEUTENANT, as the ambulance pulls away. \nLIEUTENANT All right, break it up. You got what you wanted. \nMALCOLM I'm not satisfied. \nMalcolm starts walking down the center of the street, after the ambulance. \nMALCOLM (contd) To the hospital. \nThe Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly. It takes on the start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them. People (especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk. \nANGLE - BENJAMIN \nBenjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm, the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back. \n146 \tEXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT \nNow the march has taken over the broad avenue. COPS are forced to redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly by. The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration. Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once, something is being done about what has happened. \n147 \tEXT. HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT SHOWS the Muslim men in perfect order, calm with their arms folded across their chests, waiting. Their eyes are on Malcolm as he walks toward the hospital entrance. \nSHOTS \n--of the growing crowd. \n--of the nervous cops, including some big brass. \n--of kids watching from a rooftop. \n--of Benjamin trying to emulate the Fruit of Islam. \n148\tEXT. OUTSIDE HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nMalcolm is standing in front of the Fruit of Islam men, as HIGHRANKING POLICE OFFICER GREEN comes over. \nMALCOLM Allah Akbar. \nThe sweeping done, they stand together near a table at a window. \nELIJAH Tonight I shall introduce you as my National Representative. It will be a difficult task. Your assignment is to build temples all over this nation. More work than you have ever done in your life and you will be in the public eye. My son, beware of those cameras, they are just as bad as a narcotic. \nANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening. \nELIJAH (contd) Yes, the white devil will watch your every step. Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you a parable -- regarding your work. \nElijah picks up a glass and sets it before Malcolm. \nELIJAH (contd) Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul. If you offer it to the people and they have no choice, they must drink out of it. But if you present them with this glass-- \nHe is holding a clean glass, with clear water in it. \nELIJAH (contd) --and let them make their decision, they will choose the pure vessel. Islam is the only religion which addresses the needs and problems of the so-called Negro, especially in the ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs, crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol, gambling, fornication and adultery. \nElijah holds up the clear glass. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense of the Latin root of the word. Adorare, to worship and to fear. He was the first man I ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of a gun but the fear one has of the power of the sun, I pledged myself to him, even if it cost me my life. \n152\tINT. A HOSPITAL WARD - DAY \nBetty is administering to a PATIENT, as a phone is heard ringing. It's answered. ANOTHER NURSE motions Betty to the phone. She finishes with her patient and goes quickly. \nBETTY Hello. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE Sister Betty? \nBETTY Yes. \n153\tEXT. A PAY PHONE AT A GAS STATION - DAY \nMALCOLM I'm in Detroit. \nBETTY I know. \nMALCOLM At a gas station. (a beat) Will you marry me? \nBETTY Yes. \nMALCOLM Did you hear what I said? \nBETTY Yes I did. Did you hear my answer? \nMALCOLM I think so. Can you catch a plane? \nBETTY Yes. Did you eat? \nMALCOLM I love you. \n154 \tINT. BEMBRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBetty and Malcolm sit on the floor in the dimlit room, very close. \nMALCOLM It won't be easy. \nBETTY Just hold me. \nMALCOLM It will be rough. \nBETTY Hush your mouth. \nMALCOLM I'll be away a lot. \nBETTY You're with me even when you're away. \nHe embraces her. Then Betty laughs. \nBETTY (contd) I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore. \nMALCOLM What do you think? \nBETTY The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you. \nFull embrace. \nBEMBRY'S VOICE We're waiting on you folks. You trying to starve us? \n155\tINT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMalcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to Betty. Amid laughter and great warmth, Sidney unfurls the front page of the _Messenger_, the Muslim newspaper. Headline reads: \"MALCOLM X WEDS BETTY SAUNDERS.\" Betty kisses her husband and Bembry, Lorraine, Earl, Sidney, Peter and VARIOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS applaud. \nWe notice the subtle change in the apartment: it is more comfortable; there is even evidence of some small luxury: a TV set, a new settee, etc. \n156\tEXT. RALLY - HARLEM - DAY \nMalcolm is speaking to a GOOD SIZED AUDIENCE: \nMALCOLM I must emphasize at the outstart, that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American. For if I was an American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. So I stand here as what I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN! \nCROWD REACTIONS \nMALCOLM (contd) Before there were any such things as Democrats or Republicans, we were black. Before there were any such things as Masons or Elks, we were black. Before there were any such things as Jews or Christians, we were black people. In fact long before there was ever any such place as America, we were black people... And after America has long passed from the scene there will still be BLACK PEOPLE. \nCLOSE - BENJAMIN \nHe is neatly dressed in white shirt, jacket and tie, a fine young Muslim. \nBENJAMIN 2X Take your time. \n157\tINT. CHICAGO TEMPLE - NIGHT \nThe Honorable Elijah Muhammad sits on the stage to the right of Malcolm. This is a larger audience. \nMALCOLM What kind of black people does the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are jobless... the black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live... the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community... the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy army... the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US SATISFIED AND PACIFIED WITH NOTHING! \nCROWD - REACTIONS \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM If the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live separately. \nCLOSE - ELIJAH \nDR. PAYSON Let him finish. \nMALCOLM Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, \"Let's go, let's separate\", he'd yell, \"Yeah, man, any place is better than this.\" You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one. \nBROTHER BENJAMIN Tell it. \nMALCOLM --there's another one. The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't even let you near the plant. \n159F\tINT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY \nBembry turns off the TV set and he commences to plant the seeds of \"betrayal.\" \nCLOSE - BEMBRY \nBEMBRY Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press. The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness. \nCLOSE - ELIJAH \nELIJAH Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the Nation. \nCLOSER - BEMBRY \nBEMBRY Great benefit for himself. \n159G\tBRIEF MONTAGE. THE RISE OF MALCOLM X \nEXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY \nMalcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for office. He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a CROWD follows him. Malcolm sees a WINO. \nMALCOLM Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that poison away from your lips. That's what the devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your natural mind. I know, I've been there. \nThe wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine. \n159H\t--Malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of TV REPORTERS armed with microphones. He walks; they follow. \n159I\t--Malcolm walking in Harlem, urging people to lift themselves up, come to the meetings, etc. \n159J \tINT. TEMPLE #7 \nMalcolm sits with Benjamin. \nMALCOLM It's time you received your X. But first you must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to you; down to the dotted \"i's,\" crossed \"t's,\" everything. And you must go on a fast, just water and juices, that's it. \nCLOSE - BENJAMIN \nHe takes the letter from Malcolm and looks at it. \nBENJAMIN I'll have it tomorrow. \nMALCOLM Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact. \n--Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter, he's so anxious. \n--Benjamin hands Malcolm his letter, Malcolm shakes his head and hands it back, it's not exact. \n159K\tEXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY \nMalcolm is talking to a group of PEOPLE who are having a rent strike. \nMALCOLM When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools. \n159L \tCUTAWAY TO MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN \nMalcolm hands him back his letter again. The fast is getting to Benjamin. \nMALCOLM (contd) When you have poor schools you have poor teachers. When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education. \n159M\tCUTAWAYS TO THE DESPAIR OF HARLEM - SLUMS, TENEMENTS, GARBAGE, RATS \nMALCOLM (contd) Poor education, you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood. \n159N\tCUTAWAY TO BLACK FACES \nMALCOLM (contd) So it's a very vicious cycle. We've got to break it. \n159O\tINT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA \nBenjamin weakly walks toward Malcolm and gives him his letter, which he takes. The fast is wearing him out. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMalcolm is inspecting it. \nCLOSE - BENJAMIN \nHis face is filled with apprehension. \nANGLE - MALCOLM AND BENJAMIN \nMALCOLM You are now Benjamin 2X. \nBENJAMIN 2X All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister. \nMALCOLM Come, sit with us. \nANGLE - TABLE \nBenjamin 2X sits with Malcolm and Brothers Earl and Sidney. \nMALCOLM We are now sitting with Brother Benjamin 2X. \nEARL Allah Akbar. \nSIDNEY You will be good. \nBENJAMIN 2X Brother Minister, can I have something to eat? \nEveryone laughs. \nMALCOLM Let's get this man some food. \n160\tEXT. HARVARD SQUARE - DAY \nA CROWD OF STUDENTS outside the Law School. The setting is the same as the last time we saw Malcolm and Shorty here, except now the students part for him. Malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance, looking up at the Latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a WHITE COED. \nSidney reluctantly leaves, walks out the door, past Betty. She looks at him, then Malcolm. \n173 \tINT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY \nMalcolm -- backed by Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X -- faces a roomful of SUPPORTERS and REPORTERS. \nMALCOLM Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle -- especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity. \nA host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers will join you? etc, etc, etc. \nMalcolm calms them: \nMALCOLM (contd) There is one further preparation I need. It is a return to the source of our great religion. I will make a pilgrimage to Mecca. \n174 \tEXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY \nMalcolm, at the window, as his plane takes off. He is watching Betty and the children on the Visitors' Ramp. He sees her become a tiny figure, waving a vivid bandana. \n175\tEXT. VISITORS RAMP - DAY \nThe plane is out of sight. Betty gathers up her children. As they leave she is subtly surrounded by the protecting BAND OF SUPPORTERS, led by Earl and Benjamin 2X. \n175A\tMECCA - THE PILGRIMAGE \nMALCOLM GREETED AS HE DESCENDS FROM THE PLANE IN EGYPT \nMALCOLM'S VOICE My darling Betty. Everywhere I go I am welcomed as the representative of our people. \n175B \tSHOT OF CIA AGENT \nHe watches as Malcolm walks between the two pyramids. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE (contd) Our fight is known and respected worldwide. Incidentally, there's a little white man who follows me wherever I go. \n175C \tSHOT OF MALCOLM \nOn a camel as he rides toward the Sphinx. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE I wonder who he's working for? If I was a betting man, I'd say CIA. What's your guess? \n175D \tGROUPS OF BURNOOSED SUPPORTERS ON THE STREETS OF JEDDA, SAUDI ARABIA. \nBETTY'S VOICE I arrived in Jedda, Saudi Arabia. I have never witnessed such sincere... \n176 \tINT. AUDUBON BALLROOM - NIGHT \nBetty is reading Malcolm's letter to a LARGE AUDIENCE. \nBETTY (contd) ...hospitality and true brotherhood as practiced here in the ancient home of Abraham, Mohammad and the great prophets of the Scriptures...\" \n177 \tINT/EXT. MECCA - DAY/NIGHT \n--Malcolm, wearing the garb of a pilgrim, walks with a VAST THRONG OF OTHERS, similarly clad, around the Great Temple. He wears two white towels, one over his loins, the other over his neck and shoulder, leaving the right arm and shoulder bare. He wears simple sandals. The other pilgrims are of various colors: from white, to yellow, to darkest black. \n177A \t--Malcolm and OTHER PILGRIMS kneeling together on a praying rug. \n177B\t--Malcolm and SEVERAL WHITE PILGRIMS eating Muslim-style; breaking a chicken and shaking it. \n177C\t--Malcolm and OTHERS walking around the Great Kaaba, a black stone set in the middle of the Great Mosque. He falls to his knees. WE SEE what he describes: \nMALCOLM'S VOICE Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being. \n178 \tINT. ELIJAH'S HOME - NIGHT \nElijah and a GROUP OF BLACK MUSLIM LEADERS. Bembry among them, it looks like he is the number two man now that Malcolm has been jettisoned. The Messenger lies in bed, he is having a coughing fit, this is the worst condition he's been in. A DOCTOR orders everyone out the room. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again... \n179 \tINT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT \nBetty is with Brothers Earl, Benjamin 2X, and the children. There are now four including another BABY - GAMILAH \nMALCOLM'S VOICE In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people. \n179A \tSHOT. Malcolm is bent over in prayer, lone figure in a huge mosque. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights. \n179B \tSHOT. Malcolm on a plane headed home. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE I believe the true practice of Islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white Americans. \n180 \tEXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY \nA TIGHT TWO-SHOT of Malcolm and Betty in an embrace. She breaks from him and whispers: \"Go ahead. I can wait now.\" \n181  INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY \nA large PRESS CONFERENCE: mikes of every network, every newspaper and wire service present. Malcolm sports a beard. \nMALCOLM Let's begin. \nREPORTER #1 Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood. \nMALCOLM As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white. \nREPORTER #8 Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United Nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the United States for its treatment of the American Negroes? \nMALCOLM Oh yes. \nThe AUDIENCE applauds. \nMALCOLM (contd) The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I pointed out that during my trip that nations, African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very hypocritical when they stand up in the UN condemning South Africa and saying nothing about the racist practices that are manifested everyday against Negroes in this society. I would be not a man if I didn't do so. I wouldn't be a man. \nREPORTER #3 Are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations? \nMALCOLM Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results. \nREPORTER #1 Does the new beard have any religious significance? \nMALCOLM No, not particularly. But I do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own. \nREPORTER #2 One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor that for self-defense? \nMALCOLM I don't see why that should be controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves. \nA car comes roaring down the street with rifles sticking out the windows, and pulls right up in front of Malcolm's house. \nANGLE - HOUSE \nBrothers Earl and Benjamin 2X run out of the car up to Malcolm. \nBROTHER EARL We called your house, operator said you had requested that your phone be turned off. \nBENJAMIN 2X Give us the command, Malcolm. \nMALCOLM I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this. \nBROTHER EARL Let's get out of this cold. \nBrothers Earl and Benjamin take off their coats and put it over Malcolm and lead him to a police car. \n187C \tINT. BASEMENT - DAY \nFIVE BLACK MEN sit around a table. They do not speak. They are Thomas Hayer, Ben Thomas, Leon Davis, William X and Wilbur Kinley. All are Muslims, all are the ASSASSINS. \nCLOSE - 12-GAUGE SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN ON TABLE \nCLOSE - 9MM GERMAN LUGER ON TABLE \nCLOSE - .45 AUTOMATIC \nANGLE - THOMAS HAYER \nHe puts a roll of exposed 35mm film into a sock. \nANGLE - TABLE \nASSASSINS Allah Akbar. \n187D \tEXT. NY HILTON - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT \n187E \tINT. NY HILTON \nANGLE - LOBBY \nMalcolm is checking in when he is approached by a young WHITE COED. \nCOED Mr. X. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself who are not prejudiced do to help the cause of the Negro? \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe looks at her. He thinks. He speaks. \nMALCOLM Let sincere white individuals find other white people who feel as they do and teach non-violence to those whites who think and act so racist. \nCLOSE - COED \nCOED I will, Mr. X, I will. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Let's all pray without ceasing. May Allah bless you. \n187F \tINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nMalcolm lies on his bed, and for the first time WE SEE the strain in his face, it has begun to take its toll, he's a haunted man. A doomed man. \nANGLE - MALCOLM \nMalcolm dials the phone. \nMALCOLM Brother Earl. \n187G\tINT. HOTEL THERESA - NIGHT \nBROTHER EARL Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city. \nINTERCUT between Malcolm and Brother Earl. \nMALCOLM I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight. \nBROTHER EARL Let some of us come down there. \nMALCOLM No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right. \nBROTHER EARL I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people. \nMALCOLM I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me. \nThere is silence on the other end. \nCLOSE - BROTHER EARL \n187K \tINT. AUDUBON BALLROOM - NIGHT \nThe five assassins are casing ballroom. They check the different entrances, the exits, the bathrooms, staircases while the jam packed crowd continues to dance the night away. \n188 \tINT. A FRIEND'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBetty is putting her four daughters to sleep when the phone rings. She picks it up. \nVOICE That red nigger of yours is dead and so are your bastard children. \nCLICK. \nBetty hangs up the phone and it rings again. \nBETTY Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Betty it's me. It's me. \nINTERCUT between between Malcolm and Betty. \nBETTY Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop? \nMALCOLM Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody. \nBETTY Dear heart, where are you? \nMALCOLM Is the program ready? \nBENJAMIN 2X No, Brother Minister. \nMALCOLM Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister. \nSISTER ROBIN I apologize Brother Minister, we'll have it next week. \nHe is pissed. \nMALCOLM Folks are sitting out there _today_, not next week, expecting to hear our program. \nBENJAMIN 2X Next week, Brother Minister. \nMALCOLM Has the Reverend called? Is he going to show? \nBROTHER EARL Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend. \nMALCOLM So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night? \nBROTHER EARL I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you? \nMALCOLM Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else. \nBROTHER EARL I assumed... \nMALCOLM What did I tell you about assuming? \nMalcolm starts pacing the room, nobody has ever seen him like this before. \nMALCOLM Benjamin, you better go out there and explain why the program isn't ready today. \nBenjamin 2X gets up to leave. \nMALCOLM Sister, please go with the brother. \nThey both exit. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM AND EARL \nBROTHER EARL Brother Minister, what is wrong? \nMALCOLM The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for. \nBROTHER EARL Let's cancel. \nMALCOLM Is my family here yet? \nBROTHER EARL Down front as always. \n198 \tINT. ANTEROOM - DAY \nA lone COP in uniform stands in the shadows with a walkie-talkie. \n198A\tINT. BACKSTAGE - DAY \nMalcolm is about to go on stage when he sees Sister Robin. \nMALCOLM You'll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you. \nSISTER ROBIN Brother Minister, I understand. \nMALCOLM (to himself) I wonder if anybody understands. \n199 \tINT. AUDUBON BALLROOM - DAY \nThe place is filled. Betty and the girls sit in a boxed-off section near the platform. Malcolm's bodyguards stand on and around the stand. Benjamin 2X is finishing up his speech when Malcolm walks onto the stage and sits down. \nMALCOLM Make it plain. \nBENJAMIN 2X And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you-- \nCLOSE - BETTY AND THE KIDS \nCLOSE - THOMAS HAYER \nCLOSE - WILBUR KINLEY \nCLOSE - LEON DAVIS \nCLOSE - BEN THOMAS \nCLOSE - WILLIAM X \nCLOSE - MALCOLM X \nCLOSE - BENJAMIN 2X \nBENJAMIN 2X (contd) --a man who would give his life for you.

He shakes hands with Benjamin 2X, then steps toward the podium. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe starts to rearrange his 3 x 5 index cards in his hands. \nMALCOLM Brothers and Sisters, Wa-Salaam Alaikum. \nAUDIENCE Alaikum Wa-Salaam. \nSWIFT JERKY PAN OF CAMERA \nThere is a commotion in the rear of the audience. \nBENJAMIN THOMAS Git your hand out of my pocket. \nThe bodyguards move toward the rear. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Hold it, brothers. Don't get excited. Let's cool it-- \nANGLE - WILLIAM X \n", "test1_input": "MALCOLM Man, I don't want to hear all that. \nBEMBRY I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white. \nMalcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry has said disturbs him. \nMALCOLM Who are you? \nMalcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the barrage. \nBEMBRY The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light. \nMALCOLM Elijah who? \nBEMBRY Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart. \nAnd he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful moment. He is pulling the comb through his hair. \n110 \tINT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY \nPRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes license plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks to the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, idles by a window. \nA whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out into the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided. \nGUARD BARNES You taking the yard? \nBEMBRY I'm staying. \nBarnes gestures to Malcolm. \nMALCOLM Me too. \nHe goes. \nBEMBRY What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix. \nMALCOLM I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay? \nBEMBRY What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done? \nMALCOLM You the only cat don't come on with that \"Whatcha know, daddy\" jive; and you don't cuss none. \nBEMBRY I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind. \nMALCOLM Tell you this: you ain't no fool. \nBEMBRY Don't con me. Don't try... \nMALCOLM Okay, okay. \nBEMBRY Don't con me. \nMALCOLM What do you do with your time? \nBEMBRY I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork. \nMALCOLM That's what Mama used to say. \nBEMBRY Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog. \nMalcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks he has come to the essence of a hustle. \nMALCOLM Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft. \nBEMBRY I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black. \nMALCOLM What? Everybody knows God is White. \nBEMBRY (contd) But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary? \nMALCOLM What for? \nBEMBRY Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con? \nMALCOLM What the hell for, man? \nBEMBRY Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you. \nMALCOLM Okay, okay. Show me, man. \n110A \tCLOSE SHOT - A DICTIONARY \nWE CAN READ the fine print of the definition: \nDICTIONARY Black, (blak), adj. Destitute of light, devoid of color, enveloped in darkness. Hence, utterly dismal or gloomy, as \"the future looked black.\" \nMALCOLM'S VOICE You understand them words? \nBEMBRY'S VOICE Read it. \nPULLBACK TO SHOW Bembry and Malcolm in a small PRISON LIBRARY. No one else is in the book-lined room. \nMALCOLM I can't make out that shit. \nBEMBRY Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability. \nDICTIONARY See also blackmail, blackball, blackguard. \nMALCOLM Hey, they's some shit, all right. \nBEMBRY Now look up \"white.\" \nBembry turns the pages of the dictionary to \"w.\" \nBEMBRY (contd) Read it. \nCLOSE SHOT - DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF \"WHITE\" \nMALCOLM'S VOICE White (whit), adj. Of the color of pure snow; reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The opposite of black, hence free from spot or blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable. \nMalcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis. \nMALCOLM That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books? \nSHOT - THE SHELVES OF BOOKS \n", "test1_true": "MALCOLM Then what you telling me to study in them for? \nBEMBRY You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out. \nMALCOLM Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at? \nBembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the Bible. Right now he goes into street talk. \nBEMBRY I'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these can't nobody read, be he black or white or a Ph.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees. \nMalcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man. Then caught by a passage he does not understand: \nMALCOLM Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words. \nBEMBRY Look 'em up and and out what they mean. \nMALCOLM Where am I gonna start? \nBEMBRY Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here-- \nCLOSE SHOT \nAs Bembry's hand opens the book to page one. \nCLOSE IN ON A PICTURE OF AN AARDVARK WITH ITS DEFINITION \nMALCOLM Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant-eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens. \nANGLE - TWO-SHOT \nBEMBRY Read it and keep on reading. \nMalcolm's finger runs down to the next definition: \nDICTIONARY Abacus, noun. An ancient and primitive Chinese counting device. \nBEMBRY If you take one step toward Allah, He will take two steps toward you. \n111\tOMIT \n112\tOMIT \n113\tINT. MALCOLM'S CELL - NIGHT \nHe is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go out. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK \nMalcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the \"a's\": the words azimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his hand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its meaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word for word. \n114 \tINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nThere are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their titles: W.E.B. DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter G. Woodson's _Journal of Negro History_, Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, H.G. Wells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc. \nGUARD BARNES'S VOICE Closing. Knock it off. \nMalcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast. He gathers up his books with care. He cherishes them, putting them back on the shelf carefully. \nGUARD BARNES You studying to be the first colored President of the States? \n115\tINT. LICENSE SHOP - DAY \nThe machines are idle; no one is in the room but Malcolm. He starts to reach inside his jacket when Barnes sticks his head in. \nGUARD BARNES You taking the yard or not? \nMALCOLM I'm staying. \nGUARD BARNES Then give me a butt. \nMalcolm takes out a half-filled pack of cigarettes, about to offer one, then pauses. Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes. \nMALCOLM Take 'em. I don't smoke no more. \nHe takes the pack happily and goes. Malcolm reaches into his jacket again, takes out a book. WE SEE its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My Struggle_. He sits next to the license press to read. \n116\tEXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY \nA baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE. Most of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every pitch. A base hit gets a big reaction. \nANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY \nThey are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene. \nANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big cheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around the bases. \nMALCOLM Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood. \nBEMBRY Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening? \nTWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game. \nMALCOLM You pitch, baby; I'll ketch. \nBEMBRY The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that. \nMalcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement. \nBEMBRY (contd) We were a race of kings when the white men went around on all fours. \nThere is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd. \nMALCOLM This a helluva game. Somethin's going on. \nHe sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over: \nMALCOLM (contd) Hey, whatsa score? \nCHUCK 10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear? \nMALCOLM What? \nCHUCK The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson and we pounding the hell out of them, celebrating. \n", "test1_id": 2964, "test2_input": "MALCOLM How bout that? \nBEMBRY Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years. \nMALCOLM A black man playing big league ball is something. \nBEMBRY I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history. \nSHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS \nIn the stands, cheering and joyous. \nBEMBRY (contd) Do they know who they are? Do you know where you came from? We are the Original People. \nMalcolm is listening to him now. \nBEMBRY (contd) What's your name, boy? \nMalcolm is startled; answers like a boy. \nMALCOLM Little. \nBEMBRY No. That's the name of the slave-master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you? \nCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM \nWrapped in thought. \nANGLE ON MALCOLM \nMALCOLM I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan. \nBEMBRY Who are you? \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMalcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know. \nA ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future leader. \nBEMBRY I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America. \n117 \tINT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PRISON - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and Bembry's face. \nBEMBRY Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm-- \nMALCOLM Then the devil is white. \nBEMBRY I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils. \nMALCOLM I sure met some. \nBEMBRY No. Elijah Muhammad does not say \"that white man is a devil.\" He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men. \nCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM \nListening. \nBEMBRY Have you ever known a good white man in all your life? Think back, did you ever meet one who wasn't evil? \nA prison whistle is heard. \n119\tOMIT \n120\tINT. A NICHE IN A PRISON WALL - P.M. \nMalcolm and Bembry standing close together. The feeling is of someone taking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant. Their voices are little more than whispers. \nBEMBRY The body is a holy repository. \nMALCOLM I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women. \nBEMBRY A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light. \nMalcolm lifts his head. \nMALCOLM I will do it. \nBEMBRY But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission. \nBembry kneels in a praying position. Malcolm stands. \nMALCOLM I can't. \nBEMBRY For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- \nMALCOLM I want to, Bembry, but I can't. \nBEMBRY --the hardest and the greatest. \nMALCOLM I can't. \nBEMBRY For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- \nMALCOLM I want to, Bembry, but I can't. \nBEMBRY --the hardest and the greatest. \nMALCOLM I don't know what to say to Allah. \nBEMBRY Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm? \nMalcolm laugh-snorts: \nMALCOLM Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house. \nBEMBRY Tell Him that. \nMALCOLM I don't know how. \nBEMBRY You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it. \nMALCOLM I want to. God knows I want to. \n", "test2_true": "Malcolm holds a letter in his hand. He reads it carefully. He has read it several times before. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X I received a letter that day from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The Messenger of Allah wrote me, a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict. \nVOICE OF ELIJAH I have come to give you something which can never be taken from you: I bring you a sense of your own worth, the worth of one human being. The knowledge of self. \nThe room becomes transformed. It is suddenly suffused with light. And standing in the cell with Malcolm is ELIJAH MUHAMMAD. He has materialized, but he can be seen through. He is MALCOLM'S HALLUCINATION. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X It was like a blinding light and I became aware that he was in the room with me. He wore a dark suit and on his face I saw a pain so old and deep and black I could scarcely look at him. I knew I was not dreaming. He was there. \nELIJAH I tell you that the most dangerous creation of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose. You do not need ten such men to change the world. One will do. The Earth belongs to us, the Black man and whatever is around it, and on it and in it. Praises are due to him forever for bringing to us again, our self and our property, the UNIVERSE OF SUN, MOON, AND STARS. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X And suddenly as he came, he was gone. \nThe hallucination disappears. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) And then I could do it. \nMalcolm goes down on his knees. There are tears in his eyes as he begins praying: \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Allah Akbar: all praise to Him who is all-seeing, all-understanding. \nHe continues to pray. \nVOICE OF MALCOLM X We are told that Saul, on the road to Damascus, heard the words of truth, he fell from his horse. I do not liken myself to Paul, but I understand. It happened to me. \n122\tINT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA poorly furnished, small, but immaculate room. There are two couches, a table set for eating, and, on the walls, a portrait of Elijah and a Muslim banner. It is dinner time in a Muslim home. \nSIDNEY, aged 20, a perfect specimen of the Fruit of Islam, stands behind his chair, waiting. Their mother, LORRAINE, a woman of Bembry's age, is seated, but she, too, awaits Bembry. \nSHOT - BEMBRY \nBEMBRY In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the merciful to whom all praise is due. \nAt the window Bembry saying the evening prayers. \nBEMBRY'S VOICE Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah... \nHe comes to the table, nods and sits. Sidney respectfully sits after him. Food is passed. It is simple fare: natural foods, milk, greens. The portions are small. They eat in silence, but there is warmth and love at this table. \nBEMBRY'S VOICE (contd) ... We don't have much, but what we have is yours. Lorraine and my two sons join with me in saying that when you come out, which will not be too long, come straight to us. \n123 \tINT. PRISON BARBER SHOP - DAY \nMalcolm is reading Bembry's letter as he waits his turn. There is a WHITE CONVICT in the chair, just being finished by a WHITE BARBER - SIMMONS. A BLACK BARBER - SLIM sits by. Both are convicts. NOTE: Malcolm now wears glasses, all that reading in his badly lit cell has ruined his eyes. \nBEMBRY'S VOICE You write thanking me. Don't thank me. Praise Allah. He did it all. \nSIMMONS Next. \nMalcolm starts for the chair. Simmons moves away to light a cigarette as Slim takes over. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE Dear Bembry. Please thank the Honorable Elijah Muhammad for the money and tell him I have not written him because I have not yet proven myself. \n124 \tINT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT \nArchie and Cadillac are reading a letter they have received. They look at each other incredulously. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE But I have written everyone else. \n125\tANOTHER PRISON - DAY \nShorty is waving a letter he has received to his CELLMATE. \nSHORTY Look like Homey got himself a brand new hype. \n126\tINT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY \nAn immaculate room, well furnished. ELIJAH sits in a chair as Bembry stands reading Malcolm's letter. \nBEMBRY \"I wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the President, but for some reason I haven't heard from them\"... \nBembry laughs; Elijah smiles. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE Tell the Messenger of Allah that I have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face. I greet you with the ancient words: \"As Salaam Alikum.\" \nELIJAH Wa-Alaikum Salaam. \nMALCOLM'S VOICE P.S. I finally worked my way through the \"Z's\"... \n127\tINT. PRISON CHAPEL - NIGHT \nTITLE - 6 YEARS LATER \nA GROUP OF PRISONERS, mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of black convicts, are listening to a lecture by CHAPLAIN GILL. \nCHAPLAIN GILL Are there any questions? \nANGLE. Malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand. It's the only hand up. The Chaplain searches for another questioner, but there aren't any. \nPete, sitting next to Malcolm, whispers. \nPETE Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion. \nCHAPLAIN GILL I see this has become a struggle between good and evil. Satan has a question. \nThere is laughter from the convicts. \nMALCOLM Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want to say which one of us is what. \nLaughter, especially from the black convicts. \nCHAPLAIN GILL Why don't you just ask your question? \nMALCOLM You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they? \nCHAPLAIN GILL I don't think we know for certain. \nThere are reactions from the convicts. Malcolm is sharply challenging a white man about color. \n", "test2_id": 2965, "test3_input": "MALCOLM I just want to sit here and be still. \nBETTY We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it. \nMALCOLM Talk about what? \nBETTY The talk is everywhere! \nMALCOLM There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation? \nBETTY We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more. \nShe picks up the newspaper and reads from it: \nBETTY (contd) \"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children...\" \nMALCOLM There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger. \nBETTY \"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since \nMALCOLM I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight. \nBETTY To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend? \nMALCOLM Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you? \nBetty gets up, goes to him gently. \nBETTY No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in \"Muhammad Speaks\" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own. \nMALCOLM (rationalizing) I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing. \nBETTY Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!! \nMALCOLM Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life. \nBETTY A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture. \nMALCOLM Is that what this is about? Material wealth? \nBETTY What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance. \nMALCOLM The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me. \nBETTY Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind? \nShe touches him very gently. \nBETTY (contd) Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home? \nMALCOLM What do you want me to do? Our people need me. \nBETTY We need you too! \nMALCOLM What do you want me to do? \nBETTY Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us. \n164A\tDETECTIVE MONTAGE \nMalcolm knocks on the door of Evelyn Williams, one of the two secretaries/wives. She opens the door and has child in her arms. \nANGLE - APARTMENT \nSISTER EVELYN Her name is Eva Marie, she's 2 years old. Brother Minister, I did nothing wrong. I did nothing to be put in isolation. I believed in him. I believed in the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe cannot believe what he is hearing, but he must.

Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the father of my 3 children. \nShe touches her pregnant stomach. \nSISTER LUCILLE (contd) Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM He told you that? \nSISTER LUCILLE Yes sir. \nMALCOLM Are you sure? \nSISTER LUCILLE Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want. \nMALCOLM Allah will provide. \n165 \tINT. BEMBRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM \nHe has said everything on his mind and waits for Bembry's answer. \nPAN TO BEMBRY \nBEMBRY What are you talking about -- \"blackout\"? Some of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe they think you been a little -- overpublicized. That's all. Forget it. It's nothing. \nMalcolm is listening closely. Bembry puts an arm around him, man-to-man. \nBEMBRY (contd) Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other. \nMALCOLM (quoting Bembry back to himself) \"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle.\" \n", "test3_true": "Malcolm has to control his rage. \nMALCOLM We tell the world we're moral leaders because we follow the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

I say... the white man's acts are condemned, not only by our beliefs but by his own. \n168B  SHOT - AMERICAN FLAGS AT HALF-MAST \nMALCOLM Both his Bible and the Holy Koran say: \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" Both say: \"Sow the wind, reap the whirl wind.\" \nSHOT - AMERICAN FLAGS AT HALF-MAST \nMALCOLM (contd) In the soil of America the white man planted the seeds of hate. He allowed the weeds that sprang up to choke the life out of thousands of black men. \n168C SHOT - THE KENNEDY FUNERAL CORTEGE \nMALCOLM (contd) Now they have strangled one of the gardeners.

MALCOLM WITH REPORTERS - DAY \nREPORTER Minister X! Don't you have even a little bit of remorse... saddened by President Kennedy's assassination? \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nMALCOLM Assassination might be too good a word, and might I add an Arabic word at that. This was a prime example of the devil's chickens coming home to roost. Being an old farm boy myself, chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad. It always made me glad. \n169A\tINT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY \nOn his desk is the black headlines: MALCOLM X CALLS ASSASSINATION \"CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST.\" Elijah's health is getting worse, his coughing is frequent. \nELIJAH Did you see the papers today? \nMALCOLM Yes, sir, I did. \nELIJAH That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims. \nCLOSE - MALCOLM \nHe knows what is coming. \nCLOSE - ELIJAH \nELIJAH (contd) We must dissociate ourselves from your terrible blunder. I'll have to silence you for the next ninety days. You are not allowed to make any statements to the press nor are you to speak at any temples. \nCLOSER - MALCOLM \nHe looks at Elijah, his leader, his friend, his father and speaks with total sincerity. \nMALCOLM I agree with you, sir.

Betty scoops them up. \nBETTY C'mon girls, it's bedtime. \nThe phone rings. Malcolm answers it. From his expression we know it is a threat call. He hangs up. Betty leaves with the kids. \nSIDNEY Another one? \nMALCOLM How long has this been going on? \nSIDNEY All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all. \nMALCOLM What mission? \nSIDNEY To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep. \nMALCOLM What does Sidney say? \nSIDNEY I'm with you, Brother Minister. \nMALCOLM No. You'll be marked for death. \nSIDNEY Let me die then. \nMALCOLM I won't let myself come between you and your father.

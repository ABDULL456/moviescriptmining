By this time, Cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to hold it. 
CHUCK (CONT'D) You feel like your lungs are gonna burst? Good. That's the way you're supposed to act like you feel. The moment that water gets above your nose, you gotta look like you're drowning. Remember? Burt wasn't so good at that. 
That knocks the wind out of Cameron. 
CAMERON He sure as hell convinced me. 
Chuck clicks his stopwatch and scowls. 
CHUCK (defensively) Things happen crossin' the street! If somethin' goes cockeyed...screw the scene!   Get that mask on. There's enough oxygen to get you to China. (rolls up the window) We'll try it again. 
CAMERON (still panting) Let me catch my breath. 
CHUCK What you'll catch is a lungful of water! You're at the bottom of the river!...You breathe when I goddamn tell you to breathe! 
CAMERON (the pupil tricking the teacher) Hey, Chuck, you blind?...Can't you see I've got my respirator on? 
CHUCK You just goddamn remember you don't have gills!! 
169A   Chuck has stalked over to the WORKBENCH and angrily picks up the PHONE, which has been ringing incessantly over the last few lines. 
CHUCK (shouting) What?!! (listens, then yells to Cameron) Eli's at the police station! 
CAMERON That's the best news I've heard. Let's hope it's a felony. 
CHUCK He needs Gabe. They're lookin' for a driver so I'm gonna take him. Come on with me. 
CAMERON For what? 
CHUCK (climbing into the company car) You and me are gonna talk about windows and oxygen and seat belts and things like that. And if you're a good boy and listen and don't be a smart ass, maybe I'll let you sit in the back seat with Nina Franklin. 
CAMERON Nina? 
Chuck, already in the car, is grinning.   Now he's even for the "respirator" bit. 
CHUCK You might even get to hold hands. 
170   EXT.   POLICE STATION - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON 
The POLICE STATION comes into view, seen through the window of the company car, which slows as it moves toward the curb. Eli, sitting on the front stoop, leans wearily against the stone lion. As he sees the car approach, he moves toward it quickly, opening the door almost before it stops. 
ELI (beckoning) Gabe, Nina... 
Eli pulls Gabe and Nina toward the police station, yelling back to Cameron and Chuck. 
ELI (CONT'D) You two better wait here. 
Cameron watches them, confused, as they start up the steps toward the station house. 171   ANOTHER ANGLE - ELI, NINA, GABE - MOVING SHOT 
NINA I hate this, damn it! Couldn't you have done it without me? 
ELI Let's say you owe it to him. Until two or three days ago, I had a pretty good actor on my hands. Next time you take out the clippers, be a little humane, make sure the guy's got one to spare. 
NINA (furious) What did you want me to do? Take him in the back room and unzip his fly every time he fluffed a line? What else can I do for your film? 
ELI Just get your greedy little ass inside and make sure you give the performance of your life. (icily) This next number, I dedicate to you...dear. 
172   INT.   POLICE STATION 
As the three enter. The station is old with a high sergeant's desk and wooden benches against the walls. Raymond, beyond tears, destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts, stoned kids, etc. On one bench is a SAILOR, with that adenoidal look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch" arrogance. Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that he has finally nailed Eli Cross. Eli captures the setup in a glance...then, instant theater. He strides across the police station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack on the mouth. 
ELI (vehemently) Who's better, booby...him or me? 
Gabe has come up behind a PATROLMAN, grabs him by the hips and starts humping like a dog in heat. The policeman shrieks in dismay and tries to escape, but Gabe trots along as if they were locked. 
ELI (shouting) Jake! Throw some water on him, quick! Only way to get 'em apart! 
Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with growing disbelief. Gabe ogles him. 
GABE Yummy...look at the seafood! You're a humpy little number. (then to Raymond, stamping his foot) You nasty boy. You could've died of mercury poisoning. 
The sailor leaps to his feet in horror, screaming. 
SAILOR Jesus Christ, they're all faggots! 
173   ANGLE ON SERGEANT'S DESK 
Eli has stormed to the counter and slams his fist down on it furiously, confronting Jake.

EARL Been sweepin' floors here ten years, never had to wear no damn tie before. 
BILL You're a V.I.P. today, Earl, so just shut up. 
A KNOCK at the door. Everybody takes a seat. Del is ushered in by Brutal. Del faces his audience, puts his hands to his chest in a "thank you" gesture worthy of Lillie Langtry before her adoring public, then announces grandly: 
DEL Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue au cirque de mousie! 
INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - DAY 
The steel cap is lowered over Toot's head, the straps tightened. TILT UP to Percy as: 
PERCY Roll on two. 
Behind his partition, Van Hay mimes flipping the switch. 
VAN HAY That's that. 
A pause. Percy looks anxiously to Paul, who's trading glances with the other guards. Finally: 
PAUL Very good. Very professional. 
Percy smiles. Harry and Dean step up, slapping his back and shaking his hand... 
INT. E BLOCK - DAY 
...and they're still chatting a short time later, waiting for Del's return. Percy actually looks happy for a change, feeling genuinely accepted for the first time... 
Billy is watching from his cell. Just watching. 
The door opens. Del returns with Mr. Jingles on his shoulder, escorted by Brutal. Brutal is toting the cigar box and spool like a magician's assistant carrying the boss' props. 
PAUL Well? 
DEL They love Mr. Jingles! They laugh and cheer and clap they hands! 
PERCY Well, that's just aces. Pop back in your cell, old-timer. 
The generosity of Percy's tone catches Del completely off guard. Del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust... 
...and the old Percy comes back. He bares his teeth in a mock snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab Del. It's a joke, but Del doesn't know that--he jerks back in fear and trips over Brutal's big feet. Del goes down hard, hitting the linoleum with the back of his head. Mr. Jingles jumps clear, goes squeaking down the Mile. Del sits up, painfully clutching his head. Brutal helps him up... 
BRUTAL Percy, you shit. 
...and moves him toward his cell. Percy is actually moved to apologize--he starts after them with a half-laugh, drifting much too close to Wild Bill's side of the Mile... 
PERCY Del! Hey, you numb wit, I didn't mean nothin' by it! You all ri-- 
...and Wild Bill's arms thrust out, grabbing Percy and slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his throat. Percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter-chute, thinking he's gonna die. The guards scramble, drawing their clubs--as Billy strokes Percy's hair and whispers in his ear: 
BILLY Ain't you sweet. Soft. Like a girl. I druther fuck your asshole than your sister's pussy, I think. 
Billy kisses Percy's ear--and his hand drops down to squeeze Percy's crotch. Paul pulls his sidearm, taking aim... 
PAUL Wharton! 
...and Billy lets go, stepping back with his hands raised, laughing. Percy darts across the Mile in terror and cringes against the cell opposite, breathing so loud and fast it almost sounds like sobbing. 
BILLY I let 'im go, I'us just playin' and I let 'im go! Never hurt a hair on his purty head! (grins at Percy) Your noodle ain't limp at all, loverboy! I think you sweet on ol' Billy the Kid... (sniffs his fingers) ...oooh, but smell you. 
Down at his cell, Del starts laughing shrilly. Everybody else starts to realize it, including Percy himself...he looks down, sees the huge dark stain spreading at his crotch. 
DEL Lookit, he done piss his pants! Look what the big man done! He bus' other people wid 'is stick, mais oui some mauvais homme, but someone touch him, he make water in his pants jus' like a baby! 
Percy just stares. Brutal shoves Delacroix into his cell. 
BRUTAL Shut up, Del. 
Paul steps to Percy, puts a hand on his shoulder. Percy shakes his hand off, looks around at their faces, whispers: 
PERCY You talk about this to anyone, I'll get you all fired. I swear that to God. 
PAUL What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile. Always has. 
The men nod solemnly. Nobody's going to talk about this. Percy looks at Delacroix still snorting in his cell, points at him. 
PERCY You keep laughing, you French- fried faggot. You just keep laughing. 
Del falls silent. Percy turns and storms away as we 
FADE TO BLACK 
IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS: 
"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix" 
CUT TO: 
INT. DEL'S CELL - DAY 
Paul is sitting with Delacroix. Brutal is leaning against the bars. Del is throwing the spool. Mr. Jingles is fetching it. 
The silence is thick. Just the clack-clatter of the spool, and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete. It's getting on Paul's nerves in a big way. Softly: 
PAUL What about Dean? He's got a little boy would love a pet mouse, I bet. 
Del looks horrified at the thought. 
DEL How could a boy be trust wid Mr. Jingles? Maybe forget to feed him. And how he keep up wid his trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas? 
Del tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter-skitter.

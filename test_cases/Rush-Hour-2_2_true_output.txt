CARTER He'll be back soon. 
LEE How do you know? 
CARTER Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over. 
Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to sleep on the bed. 
LEE Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now. 
CARTER Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic. 
LEE The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months. 
CARTER You pull a muscle or something? 
LEE My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding. 
CARTER I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you? 
LEE It's a long story. 
CARTER Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times. 
LEE No.  It was my singing. 
CARTER Excuse me? 
LEE She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy. 
Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT. 
CARTER Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss our personal lives.  Let's die curious. 
LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building. 
CARTER (CONT'D) What's she doing? 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA 
She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Lee?  You okay? 
Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to unbutton her blouse. 
LEE She's just standing around -- not doing much. 
CARTER Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen. 
LEE I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring. 
Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat as he watches her undress. 
LEE (CONT'D) Slow down, baby. 
CARTER What did you say? 
LEE Nothing.  I said nothing. 
Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window. 
LEE (CONT'D) Is it hot in here? 
CARTER Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

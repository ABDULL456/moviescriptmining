137   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                137 Dwight, Caroline and Toby read the papers.   Caroline notices Toby's sad face. CAROLINE Maybe that last school will come through. DWIGHT Yeah, or maybe he'll get a contract in the mail asking him to be a singing star on T.V. (on Caroline's look) Well, he's got about as much chance of one as of the other. Toby gets up and leaves. 
138    EXT. CONCRETE - SAME NIGHT                                  138 A beauty shop with a tired sign... "ARLENE'S GOLDEN COMB BEAUTY SALON," a beer joint, a pool hall, a woman's clothing store with headless mannequins. Toby surveys the scene, with an expression of despair. Toby catches his reflection in a store window.     He stares at himself. TOBY A Concrete boy. 
139    INT. A&P GROCERY STORE - EVENING                            139 
Toby, wearing khakis, a shirt and a tie stands before the store manager. MANAGER We only take boys who really want to work hard. Is that you? (as Toby nods) I'd want you to start evenings now, and I'd want you all summer -- no vacations. (as Toby nods) Food service work isn't easy. It's not something that comes to you in a year or two. So. You think you have what it takes to be an A&P management trainee? TOBY (straight) That's exactly what I've got. 
139A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          139A Toby now wears a regulation black bow tie and an apron. An employee is showing him how to price, stamp, and stack canned goods. Toby's face is expressionless. 
140    INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON     140 Dwight is listening to a PERRY COMO ALBUM.     Caroline and Pearl work on a jigsaw puzzle. Toby enters     the kitchen, coming from his paper route. He puts down     his paper sack and immediately puts on his black bow tie,    preparing to go to the A&P. (CONTINUED) 
140   CONTINUED:                                             140 PEARL I can't find where this green piece goes -- it's gotta be grass. Dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his listening pleasure, and turns UP the VOLUME on the record. 
CAROLINE (to Toby) Don't go off without eating. TOBY I'll get a sandwich after work.

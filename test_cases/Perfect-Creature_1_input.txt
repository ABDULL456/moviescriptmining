A drain pipe, leaking. 
Cut to 
Silus once more. This time we can hear "plop, plop, plop." 
Cut to 
A pool of water. Then "plop" as a drop hits it. The drop is not water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in the water. And another drop, "plop." High speed CRANE UP from 
this pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in the shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a mouth, with blood dripping from it. 
Cut to 
Silus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath reflected in those perfect light gray eyes. 
Music - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so perfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something very dark, something very dangerous, is close by. 
Slowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there, watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for the slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and brickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall. 
Silus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect shining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a gun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art nouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides forward. 
The creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along the side of the wall, heading away from us. 
Silus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target. 
The shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops suddenly in the light so that we can see it. 
A man. With reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple lips. And teeth; the teeth of a vampire. This creature immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding another two bullets that crash into the wall. 
LA as the man falls directly towards the camera. 
Silus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of him; he moves forward gracefully. He can see the man skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. Silus tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing. He raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone. 
Close on Silus' enigmatic face. Those eyes. And in his mouth, two perfectly pointed fangs.

6 EXT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          6 
We are outside a cafe; the cafe is a warm glow against the cold night. We see past the fine falling rain - through the large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux designs lacing across it - to a table inside, by the window, where two pristinely dressed men sit.

We are inside. Closer on the two men. One is SILUS. The other man is AUGUSTUS; the man we saw in the operation theatre before. Augustus has hardly aged at all. 
AUGUSTUS The girl? 
We see Silus. He remembers.

Flashback from Silus' memory; a dead girl on a bed, blood splattered across her pillow.

Silus' face. Pull out to reveal we're back in the caf√©. 
SILUS 
It is taken care of. 
AUGUSTUS This is good. 
SILUS Augustus. We failed this girl. We asked her to help us catch him, and then we failed her.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Only the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone. 
ELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE. 
ELIJAH(on tape) ...David. It's Elijah. It was so obvious. It's referred to over and over. That's the key you see. The repetition across time. That means at some point it was all based on common thought, a common event - a fact. (beat) It was this one issue that brought it back for me... Century Comics One-Seventeen. That's where this group, the Coalition of Evil, tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero. 
ELIJAH(on tape) ...Because they all have one. (beat) Just like you. (beat) The cells that make up your muscles and your bones react to forces that act upon it, slightly different from than mine. That's clear... Your cells react to bacteria and viruses slightly differently than mine... That's also clear...But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it, we choke. We swallow too much of it, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I, we are on the same curve... just on opposite ends. 
ELIJAH The point of all this is, we now know something we didn't... You have a weakness... Water. It's your krpytonite. (beat) You hearing me David? Call me back... I got rugby practice in an hour. 
THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS OFF. 
David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before ANNOUNCING. 
MACHINE Message erased. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two identical sinks sit opposite each other. 
David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze staring at the tiled floor. 
His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of the sinks. 
David rises and picks it up. 
It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit on its edge. 
David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he hesitates. 
His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS... COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT... 
David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own identical mirrored medicine cabinet. 
There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND COLOGNE. 
David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT 
ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT. 
David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt. 
He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word "security" is almost faded away. 
He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT 
Rain falls like gunfire from the sky. 
David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot. 
David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT 
A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate with a lock stops his progress. 
David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station. 
Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the fence door that holds him back from going down. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT 
Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the body of the caved-in passenger car. 
The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line, the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows exposing the ravaged interior. 
David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face. 
His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

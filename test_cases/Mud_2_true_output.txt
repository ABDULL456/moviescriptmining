MUD (CONT'D) What're you doin' out here? Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand. 
ELLIS I got you some Beanie Weenie. Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack. 
MUD I appreciate that, but I didn't expect you out here at night. Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie. 
MUD (CONT'D) Look at that. You really know how to do somebody right. I didn't wanna say anything before, but it's hard to make a meal out of pumpkin pie filling. 
ELLIS That's all my mom had. 
MUD I'm not complainin'. 
ELLIS Can I get one of those? 
MUD They're yours to begin with. Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat. 
ELLIS I missed my dinner. 
MUD That's good right? 
ELLIS 
(MOUTH FULL) You been out here too long. Mud laughs. Finishing the can, he takes a half-smoked cigarette from his shirt pocket. He pulls a twig from the fire for a light. 
ELLIS (CONT'D) The girl you're waitin' on, she's your girlfriend? 
MUD Juniper. Yeah. 
ELLIS How'd you meet her? 
MUD We grew up together. 
ELLIS Do you love her? 
MUD I do. The first time I saw her was on this river. Just up from here. She saved my life. 
ELLIS From the snake bite. 
MUD That's right. I was younger than you are now, but when I came to in the hospital and she was there, it was like the world split open, came back together new. Everything changed. I knew from then on I'd do anything for her. 
ELLIS Why aren't ya'll married? 
MUD I've asked. Several times. Marriage just doesn't work for some people. Ellis thinks on this. 
ELLIS My dad says my parents may be gettin' a divorce. 
MUD I'm sorry to hear that. 
ELLIS If it happens, and my mom moves us off the river, they say the government can come take our boat away. 
MUD Who says that? 
ELLIS Everybody. They passed a law so you can't sell your boat. Can't rent it. If the owner leaves, they got you. Game and Fish want `em off the river. 
MUD I've never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property, but if your parents love each other, there's always a chance. 
(MORE) 
MUD (CONT'D) People just sometimes forget why they fell in love in the first place. Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub. He's really getting all he can from it. 
ELLIS I saw Juniper today. 
MUD What? 
ELLIS I didn't talk to her, but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said. You were right. She's pretty. Mud stands, surprised by the news. He walks to the other side of the fire so his back is to the boy. 
MUD Where'd you see her? 
ELLIS At the Piggly Wiggly. I think she's stayin' at a motel by there. The Executive Inn. Mud looks at Ellis through the fire. He takes a drag and smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows. 
MUD That's good news. Real good news. Mud paces, slowly. He's thinking. 
ELLIS Does she know you're out here?

YOUNG OXFORD If I had known my absence would cause your grace so much... longing, I would have returned much-- much-- sooner. 
Was that a come-on?    Young Elizabeth decides to find out. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH Your wife must be much pleased by your presence once more at her side... 
Young Oxford glances over at-- 
YOUNG ANNE 
who is now dancing with the Spanish Ambassador. But she watches Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford with a great deal of jealousy. 
WILLIAM CECIL 
Follows his daughter's look. He doesn't like what he sees any more than Young Anne does. 
BACK TO YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD 
Still dancing. 
YOUNG OXFORD If she is, it is but a small comfort to me. I am returned only under my father-in-law's insistence. 
A beat as this sinks in. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH (surprised) Cecil had told me your match was one of love. 
YOUNG OXFORD And so he would wish. (long beat) But how could one ever love the moon, after having first seen the sun? 
He stares intensely into her eyes.    And she stares right back.

Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford, both on horseback, unaccompanied, trot over a small bridge. 
56A   EXT. RICHMOND PALACE - BALCONY - SAME TIME                  56A 
The Ladies-in-waiting giggle, but are interrupted by-- 
WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.) Where is her majesty? 
Bessie turns to William Cecil. 
BESSIE My lord. Her majesty went riding with the Earl of Oxford. 
The Ladies-in-waiting share knowing smiles. 
56B   EXT. RICHMOND PALACE - FOREST - SAME TIME                   56B

A servant places a silver plate filled with shucked oysters onto a table filled with quail, venison, wine, etc... 
Young Elizabeth sits across from Young Oxford.   It's just the two of them dining.

YOUNG OXFORD I think Italy, your grace.

YOUNG ELIZABETH And why is that? The weather?       The food? 
YOUNG OXFORD No their theater, which they call la Commedia dell'arte. And, of course, the women. 
She raises an eyebrow. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH The women? 
YOUNG OXFORD They were more... clear with their desires than our English ladies. When they want something, they take it. They do not wait to be taken...

LATER 
Postcoital, the fire still lit. Young Elizabeth is half asleep, half awake, nestled in furs in front of the fireplace... much like Titania in "Midsummer Night's Dream"... 
Young Oxford watches her as she stirs and wakes.      She smiles at him. 
YOUNG ELIZABETH I can't decide. Are you Prince Hal...? Or Romeo? No. Benedick, maybe...? No-- (MORE)

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (smiles) --Puck

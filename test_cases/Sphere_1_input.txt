THUMP! 
The sub slightly SWAYS. 
Norman sits still, nervous. 
THUMP!  Harder this time. 
Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see anything in here. 
BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat. 
NORMAN Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- ! 
THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything, tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle. 
BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns over on it's side. 
NORMAN Beth!  Shit! 
His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water SPLASHING up from below. 
Then, EVERYTHING stops. 
The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening. 
Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out. 
Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked. 
Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it? His BREATHING short. 
NORMAN Beth?  Can you hear me? 
No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing. Then, cautiously slips down into the water... 
EXT.  UNDERWATER 
CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  Lands on the bottom. 
His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH. 
He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death. 
NORMAN Beth?  Beth?  Shit. 
THE HABITAT -- ahead of him. 
Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking. Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster. Barely BREATHING. 
HARRY (O.S.) ... you there?  Norman? 
NORMAN Harry? 
HARRY (O.S.) Norman, where are you? 
NORMAN I can't breathe...  Am I... clear? 
HARRY (O.S.) You're clear.  You see the airlock? 
Norman, twists around, and as he does... 
A SEA SNAKE 
HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS. 
ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go. 
HARRY (O.S.) Norman! 
Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION, slithering between the grid-like posts. 
THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom. Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him. It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... 
NORMAN is whisked up. 
HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up. 
INT.  AIRLOCK 
They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor. Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Norman, panting, walks with Harry... 
NORMAN Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- 
HARRY What happened to her? 
NORMAN What do you mean?  She's not here? 
HARRY When I woke up, nobody was here. 
NORMAN She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. 
HARRY Her suit's gone. 
NORMAN Beth left? 
HARRY I thought she was with you. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Norman and Harry at the mic... 
BETH (O.S.) ... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship. 
NORMAN What are you doing in the ship? (beat) Beth? 
BETH (O.S.) Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad. 
NORMAN Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. 
BETH (O.S.) Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me. 
NORMAN He what? 
Harry shakes his head: "no way". 
BETH (O.S.) When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship. 
HARRY I never said that.

MOTHER MIRIAM I left it with her and I went for help. 
MARTHA I doubt that's what she'd say. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Then she's a liar. 
80   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and Mother Miriam are      standing. 
MARTHA Agnes, can you hear me? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember. 
There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes stirs slightly. 
MARTHA (Cont.) What's the matter? 
There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying that mysterious word that we could not previously understand. 
AGNES She said Michael. 
MARTHA What did she mean? 
There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in the crypt. 
AGNES The statue. She had shown it to me the day before. 
MARTHA And the passage to the barn? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Why? 
AGNES So I could go to him. 
MARTHA Who? 
AGNES Him. 
MARTHA How did she know about him? 
AGNES She'd seen him too. 
MARTHA Where? 
AGNES From the belltower the day she before she died. 
MARTHA So she sent you? 
AGNES Yes. 
81   INT - TUNNEL - NIGHT 
In flashback:    Agnes is walking alone through the tunnel carrying an oil lamp. 
MARTHA (V.O.) What happened? 
Agnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into... 
82   INT - BARN - NIGHT 
Still in flashback, Agnes emerges into the barn. The doves flap about as Agnes    moves nervously through the barn.

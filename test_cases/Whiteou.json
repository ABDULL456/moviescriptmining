{"train": "He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away from the others. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nCARRIE (cont'd) Professor...are you planning on doing the winter-over? \nSAPPERSTEIN Not this year, no. \nCARRIE Good. And how are you feeling right now? \nSAPPERSTEIN You think I'm crazy? Is that what you're saying? \nCARRIE (PACIFYING) No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home? \nShe pats him on the back. \nINT.   MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY \nCarrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection -- what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right temple. \nShe steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'. \nShe takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading \"INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN: None.\" On today's page she fills in the blanks with \"Theft of botany sample.\" And \"None.\" \nA pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces. Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up. Just stares unhappily at the binder. \nCamera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles. \nShe closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere, sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAs she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a nearby box -- \nMURPHY (O.C.) You busy? \nShe turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat. \nCARRIE What do you think? (BEAT) I know you weren't in the area. What's up? \nHe sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to it. \nMURPHY I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice. \nCARRIE What flavor? \nMURPHY Don't know. \nCARRIE And we were doing so well. (BEAT) Where? \nMURPHY McClain Valley. \nThis throws her. \nCARRIE McClain Valley? What was he doing out there? That's no man's land. \nHe takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems amused. \nMURPHY I've got a plane heading to ASB in an hour with some supplies for Winter-over. (BEAT) Can't get you back until tomorrow. \nHe looks at her with a smile -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMURPHY (cont'd) You leaving the dart board? \nCARRIE No -- just the picture. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. AMUNDSEN-SCOTT STATION (ASB) - DAY - ESTABLISHING \nThe red and white striped ceremonial south \"pole\" stands surrounded by international flags. \nSUPER TITLE: South Pole / Amundsen-Scott Station (USA) P opulation: 183                Temperature: - 55\u00b0 \nIce as far as the eye can see. In the background is the base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular shaped walkways. \nOff in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow, pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both sides of the runway. \nCamera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the other side of the plane. \nThe main ASB complex is before her. \nThe Tech at the console turns to her -- \nTECH Guys got the science lab all shut down. \nRHONDA Good, have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins. Make sure we're not leaving anything out there. \nRhonda sees Carrie coming in the doorway. There's a flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional demeanor. \nRHONDA (CONT'D) Sam told me you'd be coming up -- how's the sleigh ride? \nCARRIE Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle. \nRHONDA I'll have him meet you in the hangar. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA moment of silence lingers as neither have anything else to say. \nCARRIE Yeah, good. \nCarrie leaves. \nEXT. BACK OF ASB - DAY \nSelecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is DOC FURY, 60. Looks seasoned. Bearded. Wears the only non-red parka we've seen: it's royal blue, trimmed with black fur and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from years of Antarctic service. \nDOC In less than three days we begin Winter-over. The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months. \nCamera pulls back to REVEAL five NEWBIES (first-timers); an Asian, French, Brazilian, Danish and an American. All are standing on their jackets, shivering uncontrollably in the wind. \nDOC (cont'd) The sane ninety percent of the population will be leaving the ice. Extreme weather conditions make it impossible for planes from the outside world to land. You have chosen, for your own misguided reasons, to stay. And it is my responsibility to teach you beakers how not to die. \nDoc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts. \nThe ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible, wind- driven arc, approaches a flag, and sinks. \nDOC (cont'd) Time? \nThe Asian holds a stopwatch.    He stares at it stupidly. \nASIAN T... T... Three minutes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC Your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees. You are shivering uncontrollably -- losing basic motor skills. You're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks. In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two-hundred seconds. (BEAT) Put your coats on. \nThe class struggles into their jackets. Doc assists those who, in their diminished capacity, are having trouble figuring out how to put them on. \nDOC (cont'd) Your life is dependent on your awareness of the weather. So be aware. There is a condition that arises around here known as a whiteout. Don't get caught in it. Winds kick up snow that's lain on the ice for thousands of years -- can't see six inches in front of your nose. Temperature plummets to triple digits. We found bodies less than a foot from safety and warmth. \nCarrie walks up.    Doc's eyes brighten. \nDOC (cont'd) Class, here we have another of the many hazards found on Antarctica. Say hello to Marshal Stetko. \nThrough a disjointed, chattering chorus -- \nCLASS Hello Marshal Stetko. \nDOC Always a pleasure to see you. Unlike most of the beaker-heads down here. (BEAT) Social visit? \nCARRIE I wish -- We got a job. I need you to take a ride with me. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) CARRIE (cont'd) (BEAT) Might be a body out on the ice. \nDOC Why's this crap always happen at the end of the season? \nCarrie pulls a Driver from Doc's golf bag.    Lines up another pink ball. \nDOC (cont'd) Too cold for driving. \nCarrie swings -- WHACK!   The ball shatters and pink bits rain down around them. \nCARRIE So it is. \nINT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY \nCarrie and Doc cross the interior, which houses Three double prop Twin Otters, two Snowcats, and six snowmobiles. Keller and two other employees are busy working on one of the Otters. \nDOC What's your gut say about this body? \nCARRIE My gut and I don't talk anymore. \nThey continue, after a beat -- \nDelfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses. \nDELFY It's right up here. \nHe spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor. Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways -- Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction. \nDELFY (cont'd) I don't carry extra panties Doc, so keep it tight. (BEAT) There it is. \nHe banks the plane and slips down into a valley. \nDELFY (cont'd) Three o'clock. \nCARRIE Yeah. Got it.      It's a popsicle alright. \nDown below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to the crevice. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Red jacket.   He's American. \nEXT. ICE FIELD - LATER \nThe Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder, weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small crevasses. Mid-conversation... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDOC ... It's always different when they freeze. Some curl up. Some stretch out. Some tear their clothes off. They get delirious. What was that guy's name? \nCARRIE Linger. \nDOC Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots. \nDelfy stops.    Grimaces.    Drops the gear bag. \nDELFY Jesus. \nThe CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death. \nThey all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous. \nDOC Never seen a dead guy? \nDelfy slowly shakes his head, no. \nCarrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep crevice four feet away. Can't see the bottom. She walks around to get a look at the face. Blanches slightly. \nDOC (cont'd) You know him -- \nCARRIE So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times. \nDOC The guy who cheated? \nCARRIE Yeah.    Geologist, I think. \nDoc takes a look. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDOC Damn -- \nCarrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket.     Shoots a couple of pics. \nDoc takes a look up behind them. The ice steepens sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders of ice. \nDOC (cont'd) Looks like he fell from up there. \nCarrie pauses with her camera, looks up -- doesn't seem as convinced. \nCARRIE Then where's his crampons -- his gear? \nDoc looks around -- she's right. \nDOC Maybe down the crevasse? \nCARRIE Yeah, maybe -- \nCarrie glances to Delfy. \nCARRIE (cont'd) What's the closest camp? \nDELFY Brits -- about eighty miles west. \nCARRIE (looking at body - Soto) What the hell where you doing all the way out here? \nDoc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesn't budge -- frozen solid into the ice. \nDOC Ah Christ -- he's a sticker. \nTIME CUT TO: \nCU ON CARRIE'S HAND TUGGING ON THE ZIPPER \nLittle by little, it starts to move -- then finally, ZIIIIIIIIIIP. The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced skin. \nDoc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but can't. \nCARRIE Grab that side. \nShe takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull. The jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding A DEEP PUNCTURE WOUND through the shirt. \nDoc's face sags.    Carrie stares at the wound. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nCARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: The well defined chest of a man wearing a tight T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE dead center. \nBACK TO SCENE \nDoc looks at Carrie with deep concern -- he's tuned in. \nDOC Stirring up a few things? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE ...I'll be alright. \nBoth take a moment looking at the body. \nDOC You know, this means a Federal Investigation, and we're witnesses. We may get stuck here. \nCARRIE I know. \nDoc looks to Carrie, gentle, like a dad would his daughter. \nDOC We both want to do the right thing Carrie -- but we also need to get off the ice. Right now we don't have to say a word. When they find something later -- hey, we didn't know. We were leaving, the body was frozen, we didn't have time to examine it. No one gets murdered in Antarctica. Think about it. Dead is dead. \nHe eyes her pleadingly. \nCARRIE Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc -- and I can't just pretend it didn't happen. (BEAT) I'm sorry. \nDOC Why did I know you were going to say that? \nINT. CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER \nCarrie steps out into the hallway. Takes a moment, leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The second it hits the wall -- \nTHE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT! \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT) \nCarrie's beat to shit, soul weary. She's on her knees, full of blood. A man is on the floor between two beds before her. She holds her gun at her side. He's dead. \nBACK TO SCENE \nCarrie refocuses.   Pulls away from the wall.    Leaves the memory behind. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - LATER \nCarrie has a NEXTEL phone/walkie to her ear, making her way up the corridor. Moves past a couple of guys loading a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room. \nMURPHY (V.O.) What camp was he with? \nCARRIE I'm on my way to find out. \nMURPHY (V.O.) This is all I need right now. \nCARRIE I'm sure his family's thinking the same thing. \nMURPHY (V.O.) That's not what I meant. (BEAT) I'll contact the FBI -- see how they want to handle this. \nShe hangs up. Approaches a closed door.      Name plate on it reads Dinkle -- SUB-STATIONS MANAGER. \nO.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her eyes. Knocks on the door. No one answers. Moaning continues. She doesn't have time for this. Opens the door to see -- \n-- a large TV playing a locker-room porno where a quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader with no top. Half a dozen guys, oblivious to Carrie standing there, CHEER the action. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSuddenly, Carrie's NEXTEL RINGS -- takes it off her belt. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Stetko. \nJAMIE (V.O.) Marshal, it's Jamie. I've got some guy holding from Vostok who won't give his name, says he has to talk to you. \nCARRIE Vostok? (BEAT) Patch it through. \nJAMIE (V.O.) You're on now. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nCARRIE This is Marshal Stetko, who's this? \nMOONEY (V.O.) John Mooney. \nShe's thrown. \nCARRIE Mooney? \nMOONEY (V.O.) You know who I am? \nCarrie's eyes shift to his picture on the desk. \nCARRIE What happened out there, Mooney? \nMOONEY (V.O.) You come to Vostok and we'll talk. Only you. \nCARRIE Where's Rubin? \nMOONEY (V.O.) Come to Vostok. \nCLICK. \nINT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie is moving at a quick pace. Passes the open door to the clinic. Sees Doc looking through some boxes, a glass of Scotch in hand. She stops. Backs up. \nCARRIE Getting drunk already? \nDOC Just gearing my liver up in case I have to stay the next six months. \nCARRIE Murphy's contacting the Feds. \nHe looks over to her.    Raises his glass in a somber toast. \nDOC You're making my day. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE I'll do everything I can to get you off this ice, promise. \nDOC I know you will. (BEAT) What's the hurry? \nCARRIE Going to Vostok. \nHe raises a curious brow -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) One of the guys from Weiss' team called.   Wants to talk. \nDOC What's he doing in Russia? \nINT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY \nCarrie walks in. Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another in her hand. Looks stressed. She's hovering over one of the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler. His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations are marked as well. \nRHONDA We're tracking it now. \nCARRIE I need a plane to Vostok. \nRhonda raises her finger -- putting her on hold.      Carrie doesn't like it. \nRHONDA (into phone) I don't control the weather -- you want to stay the winter, then don't be ready for your evac. \nShe looks to Carrie -- \nRHONDA (cont'd) Sorry, can't.    All the planes are committed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE I'm not asking. \nRHONDA What am I supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half? \nCARRIE Sure. \nSets down his coffee on a nearby shelf. As he fastens it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask. They finish at the same time. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDELFY Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout? \nCARRIE Nope. Thoughts? \nDELFY Yeah, hold on tight. \nDelfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel- lock in the center of the door. \nWHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp, slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her back. \nThe storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim. \nCRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor. \nCarrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to the side of the building. \nShe steps into the storm. \nEXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS \nCarrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking the wheel. \nTwo steps into the storm, the building behind her is gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide line and the ROAR of the storm. \nA gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by her tether and smacked down on the ice. \nSlowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to realize she's at a building. \nShe grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening the door. \nINT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nUnclipping from the line, she closes the door on the HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are chattering. \nShe spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the ready room into the building. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a sliver of light stabbing in through a window. \nCARRIE (calling out) Mooney? Hello? \nOnly silence responds. \nThe hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket. Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark. \nSomething doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from her belt. She decides to go left. \nWalking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one gives. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Mooney? \nShe cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an empty room. \nMoves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like someone trying to clear their throat. \nLooks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall. \nIt's confirmed when she hears it again. \nStops at the door. \nShe slowly opens it -- \nNow she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n-- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's coming from. Another cough. \nShe enters the room. \nINSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS \nInching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood. Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his esophagus. \nMore dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands. \nUnable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal. \nRipping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind. \nCarrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout \nSMASH CUT TO \nINT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT) \nA single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The bathroom door behind her is open. \nShe catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the room behind her. Body tenses. \nAs she turns -- \nCARRIE Jack? \nNo answer. \nShe withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the door. \nGun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM! Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam. \nBefore she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven, grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She drops to the floor -- \nCARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her. She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a frenzy, like a cat in water. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Jack! \nDELFY O.C. Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay. \nThe figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding her down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarrie slowly settles, then she's out again. \nTIME CUT TO: \nINT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER \nShe's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old, WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm. \nCARRIE What happened? \nDELFY When   you didn't come back -- we went   looking for you. Found a dead   guy in the other building -- that   Mooney? \nCARRIE Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me. (BEAT) How long was I out? \nDELFY A couple hours. \nCarrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her. \nDELFY (cont'd) He's been looking after you. \nHe flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth. \nCARRIE Thanks. \nAs she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling something else. \nShe sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers are slow moving. \nCARRIE (cont'd) I need to get back in there. \nINT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nDelfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her bearings back. \nDELFY Whoever it was, could have flown out after the storm broke. \nThey walk a few silent beats, then -- \nDELFY (cont'd) Who's Jack? \nIt's a moment before she responds -- \nPRYCE I'll grab my bag. \nShe stops. \nCARRIE Don't take this personally, but I don't need your help. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nPRYCE If they've been digging out there, that's a direct violation of the United Nations treaty. We think they were digging. That makes it my business. \nThis stops her -- digging? \nCARRIE You don't dig for meteorites. \nPRYCE And you don't get killed for them either. This is now a U.N. matter. I am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if I have to. \nDELFY He can, you know. \nShe knows and her patience is running thin. \nCARRIE Fine. But this is my investigation, understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained. \nShe continues with Pryce next to her. \nPRYCE Fine. (BEAT) Mind if I ask you a personal question? \nCARRIE No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway. \nPRYCE Why do you smell like suntan lotion? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. VOSTOK - CORRIDOR - DAY \nCarrie and Delfy are heading toward the Ready Room. She has her phone to her ear. Two Russians trail behind with Mooney in a bodybag. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo -- search for him. \nMURPHY (V.O.) That's not possible. We're still bringing people in and resupplying other bases for Winter-over. \nShe thinks about it -- \nCARRIE Sam, I think these guys found something out there at the camp. I'm going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one leaves the ice. Not yet. \nShe clicks off. \nCarrie opens the door to the ready room to find Pryce standing there with a gear bag -- typing into a PDA (Treo type). \nPRYCE We ready? \nCARRIE Guess so. \nHe finishes entering his text into the PDA.       Sends.   Puts it away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OTTER - DAY \nDelphy flies the plane over a labyrinth of deep, blue crevices. \nEXT.   CAMP DELTA ONE ONE - DAY \nDelfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp. There are TWO BIG TENTS and some scattered equipment - a SNOWCAT, a CHEST of TOOLS, DRUMS of GASOLINE. \nThe sky is dark with clouds and the wind MOANS.      A haze of wind-driven snow whips by. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted. \nCARRIE What time is it? \nPryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his jacket. \nPRYCE Two thirty. \nCARRIE A.M. or P.M.? \nPRYCE A.M. \nCARRIE Wonderful. (re: tent) I'll take this one. \nCONTINUED: Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious. \nCARRIE Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it. \nDELFY It's an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late fifties. No one's put these in the air for forty years. \nCarrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit. \nSomething BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light - - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position - - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's dead, pinned between two large metal crates. \nDelfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a look back over her shoulder -- \nCARRIE Guess that makes three. \nShe continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her light targets the cockpit door. It's closed. \nINT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie pushes the door open. \nThe beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding through it. \nContinues over three dead men in flight suits still strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm holstered around their waist. \nDELFY This isn't funny -- \nShe looks back to Delfy -- gets confused. \nCARRIE Where's Pryce? \nINT. CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER \nTrailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered cargo area. \nRansacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of supplies. \nDipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks. \nCARRIE What is that? \nDelfy grins. \nDELFY Vodka. \nCarrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION. \nSpots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead. \nMoves to it. \nCARRIE (SUSPICIOUS) Find what you're looking for? \nHer light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open. \nPryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy. \nPRYCE Just answers. (BEAT) Those are fuel tanks behind you. This plane was outfitted for long range capabilities. \nCARRIE And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important. \nCarrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been breached. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools litter the floor. \nPRYCE They put some serious work into this. \nThere's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood -- \nCARRIE Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel. \nShe uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed. Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide. \nThe PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES. \nCARRIE (cont'd) What is that? \nThe muffled ROAR of a diesel. \nDELFY It's the Cat! \nCRASH! -- the unmistakable sound of FALLING ICE. \nCARRIE Go! \nCRASHCRASHCRASH!    More ICE. \nThey scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold. \nDELFY You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo? \nCARRIE He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options. \nShe massages her gloved hand. Looks to Pryce who's talking on his PDA as he heads toward the Cat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPRYCE (INTO PHONE) Six cannisters, maybe four inches in diameter, about a foot high -- find out exactly what the Russians transported in something that size. \nHe looks to Carrie -- \nPRYCE (cont'd) You have a photo of Rubin anywhere? \nCARRIE Back at ASB -- \nPRYCE (to Delfy) How long to get there? \nDELFY When we get back to the plane, I'll get ya there in forty minutes. \nAs Pryce climbs into the cat -- \nINT. SNOWCAT - CONTINUOUS \nAnd slides into the back -- \nPRYCE (into phone) I'll scan a picture of him and get it to you. Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch. He's got some plan to get these off the ice. \nHe hangs up. Carrie climbs in -- looks back at the plane's ski tracks. \nCARRIE I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One. \nPryce and Delfy wait for the answer. \nCARRIE cont'd) He was dumped from a plane. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe closes the door to the Cat. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - DAY \nCarrie strides along the corridor with Pryce. They pass a window where we see that an LC-13O EVAC PLANE is parked out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a massive beast. Move past several people, balloons and `Eve of Evac' signs. \nPryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand, now. \nPRYCE You need to get that looked at. \nCARRIE I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done. \nDinkle's pulling a DUFFLE BAG toward them.      Sees Carrie and Pryce about to head up some stairs. \nDINKLE Murphy's looking for you. \nCarrie stops. \nCARRIE Murphy?   What the hell is he doing HERE \nDINKLE Came in on the evac. \nShe pulls Dinkle's two-way off his hip.       Hands it to Pryce. \nDINKLE (cont'd) Hey -- I don't turn that in, I have to pay for it. \nCarrie ignores him. \nCARRIE I'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk. \nDinkle shoots Pryce the stink eye as he walks away -- \nDINKLE Make sure I get that back. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPRYCE Of course. \nPryce heads up as Carrie continues on down the main corridor. \nINT. OPERATION CENTER - ASB - DAY \nMurphy and Rhonda are standing next to the COMMS TECH, who is sitting in front of his COMPUTER. The screen revealing the SATELLITE IMAGERY of the storm It's grown and moving closer to ASB. \nDOC I striped him down to put him in a bodybag. There's only the puncture from the axe. No way, I would have noticed it. Why? \nCARRIE Then it's gotta be Rubin. (BEAT) I don't know. \nDOC Any word from the FBI? \nCARRIE There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula. \nThe gauze finally comes off, revealing her middle TWO FINGERS have turned COMPLETELY BLACK along with part of the flesh of her palm. Her ring looks strangely out of place. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Oh God. \nDoc reaches over to a nearby drawer -- takes out a sterilized syringe packet. \nDOC Jesus, Carrie, how long did you let this go? \nHe opens up the packet. \nCARRIE When did I go to Vostok? \nDoc puts the tip of the needle onto her blackened flesh. \nDOC Feel that? \nHe pushes hard -- penetrates the skin. We see the worry begin to elevate further on Carrie's face. \nCARRIE No. \nDoc tries the needle in another location. \nDOC Now? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSlowly shakes her head.   He holds her gaze evenly. \nDOC (cont'd) I have to amputate your middle two fingers. \nCARRIE (STUNNED) No way. Don't tell me that. \nDOC The fingers are dead, Carrie. If I don't do it now, gangrene will set in. You'll lose your hand. \nCarrie is sickened. \nDOC (cont'd) I'm sorry. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MEDICAL CLINIC - LATER \nCarrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her. The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area where Doc works on her hand. She can't watch as his CURVED SUTURE and thread, rises and falls with every stitch he makes. Carrie has her attention on BLOODY GAUZE piled up in a tray -- \nSMASH CUT TO \nCARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: AN IMAGE SHE SAW EARLIER: The well defined chest of a man wearing a T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE oozes dead center. This time we stay there a little longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera... slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot. He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck. \nDOC (O.C.) There, finished. \nBACK TO SCENE \nCarrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down.     Then slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand. \nDOC (cont'd) It's going to be an adjustment. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe rises. Goes to a medicine cabinet. Selects a pill bottle. Shakes it. Only a couple inside. He returns with the pill bottle. \nDOC (cont'd) Should ease the pain. I'll look around, dig some more up for you. \nShe stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to be. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CARRIE'S BEDROOM - ASB - DAY \nCarrie's bag is open on the bed with the Russian's gun next to it. \nShe's trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt, but can't button it up with only one hand. Her frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of emotion that's trying to get out. \nShe finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying. \nCarrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears. \nAfter a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway with some PAPERS in his hand. He's looking at her compassionately. \nPRYCE I stopped by the clinic... Doc told me. \nHe moves closer.   Starts to button her up. \nPRYCE (cont'd) For what it's worth -- I think you're pretty tough, Marshall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie enters. Light streaming in through the window hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on the nearby wall -- \n-- A HAND GRABS HERS -- \n-- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's embrace. A knife's brought to her neck. \nMAN (raspy, deep) ...You Stetko? \nCarrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket... \nMAN (cont'd) Don't... \nShe stops. \nCARRIE Who are you? \nHe slowly turns her around to face him. \n-- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky, frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it together as he can barely get the words out... \nRUBIN -- Did Mooney talk to you? I didn't hear from him -- he was supposed to call me after you talked. \nCarrie's confused. \nCARRIE Mooney's dead. \nHis eyes well. \nRUBIN No... \nCARRIE And so's Weiss. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe nods - he knew. \nRUBIN And I'm next, I know it. \nCARRIE It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down. \nHis shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf next to him. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Who's after you? Where are the cannisters? \nHe stares off blankly -- \nRUBIN Weiss didn't want to go through with it. Oh God. How did we let this happen? \nCARRIE Rubin -- I need you to focus for me. \nHe tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes -- he's trying. \nO.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door. \nRubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged animal. \nDOC (O.C.) Carrie, it's Doc -- got those painkillers. \nCARRIE It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you. \nIt falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She tries to stop him. \nRubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair. She topples backwards. \nHe whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out of him. Pills all over the floor. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort. \nCarrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin disappearing down a set of side stairs. \nCARRIE (cont'd) You alright? \nDoc nods. \nShe takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Pryce, it's not Rubin -- \nOff his confused look -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) Someone's trying to kill him. \nPryce picks up speed as he targets the door. Hits it like a freight train, busting it open! Cart goes crashing. Contents scatter like buckshot. \nINT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through the open exit door. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are vacant. Ice axe is still there. \nCARRIE Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on. \nCarrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie joins. Same thing. \nPRYCE How long's he been out there? \nCARRIE Thirty seconds. \nEXT. ASB - RIGHT AFTER \nRubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins tucked against the base of the main building. The blood from his wound already frozen on his shirt. \nThe cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's reflection off the ice is blinding. \nCUT TO: \nRUBIN'S POV - \n-- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to shield them -- has little effect. \nHe looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his attacker not far behind. \nRubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care -- pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground. \nContinues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal his movement. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS \nUp ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing filling an insulated container with water from an insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is parked next to them. \nHe tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice escapes... \nRUBIN ...Help me. \nThe guys -- oblivious. \nEXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY \nCarrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite directions around the complex. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME \nRubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too slow, they take off. He coughs up blood. \nRUBIN W..wa..wait. \nHe turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet away and closing. \nRubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon -- anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER. Heads for it. \nEXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME \nCarrie passes a gap between storage containers where several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow -- through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in. \nEXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME \nPryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin. Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them. \nEXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME \nRubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it, but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a defeated glance over his shoulder to see -- \n-- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on - - SPRAYING him head to toe. \nRubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his ice-locked clothing. \nThe man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP - breaks his neck. \nRubin's body topples stiffly to the ground. \nINT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME \nShe twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Where in the plane? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nKELLER Find them yourself. \nMURPHY What the hell's going on? \nShe glares at him. \nCARRIE The cannisters are on the plane. \nShe looks to the guys that came out with Murphy. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Throw him in the holding cell. \nThe two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller screams. \nThe guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away. \nMurphy looks to Pryce -- \nMURPHY Who the hell are you? \nCarrie looks at Pryce. \nPRYCE Name's Pryce. \nPryce looks at Carrie. \nCARRIE He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now! \nMurphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare -- \nMURPHY We don't have time. We'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands. \nPryce steps in -- \nPRYCE It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) PRYCE (cont'd) Once that plane is in the air, we've as good as lost it. Just give us 10 minutes. \nMurphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly -- \nCARRIE Sam, do what is right here.    Come on. \nMURPHY Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour. \nCARRIE We'll need some help. \nMURPHY I'll send what I can. \nHe leaves. \nTIME CUT TO: \nINT. LC-130 - DAY \nCarrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo. \nPRYCE It's clean. \nCarrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off. \nPRYCE (cont'd) You check the cockpit? \nCARRIE Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller? \nPRYCE I don't get it, why lie to us -- we have him either way. He's stuck here. \nCarrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that -- \nCARRIE He's buying time. \nCarrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace. \nINT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the evac. Pryce is close behind. \nCARRIE Out of the way! \nINT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER \nBullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate -- glass is too thick -- protection from the cold. \nKeller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward toward the opening doors. \nCarrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet. Face bloody. He moves to Pryce. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nShe gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce. He's bleeding profusely. \nShe kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest. \nDelfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open. \nPRYCE ...I didn't see him. \nHis eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face -- \nCARRIE No!    You stay awake! \nPuts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure. Blood continues to ooze. \nShe looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the hangar. \nLooks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Damn it! (to Delfy) Come on. We're getting him up. \nThey lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the hangar the best they can. Go outside. \nEXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the ground. \nCarrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused. \nCARRIE Press here.    Hard. Hard or he will die! \nDELFY It won't stop! \nLooks Delfy right in the eye. \nCARRIE He's not going to be number four! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPryce moans. \nCarrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner. \nScoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it around him. Keeps repeating the motion. \nShe keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane moving toward the runway. \nThe cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake. \nPRYCE (GASPING) What are you doing?   Get Keller. \nShe holds him down. \nCARRIE You're bleeding out. Freezing drops your pulse. We have to slow it down. (BEAT) You hold on. \nCarrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick draw. Keys it. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet? \nBeat. \nMURPHY (V.O.) No -- what's going -- \nCARRIE Keller got out. He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc? \nMURPHY (V.O.) In the clinic. About to bring the bodies out. What's -- \nCARRIE Tell him to stay put, and I need your help getting Pryce there. We're at the hangar. I've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters. \nCarrie doesn't wait for an answer.     Gives Delfy the two- way. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCARRIE (cont'd) Don't let him die. \nMURPHY Doc! \nDoc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two follow. Curious. \nDoc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's face, ashen. \nDOC Get him on the table! \nThey usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has his hand on Pryce's wound. \nDOC (cont'd) Don't move that hand. \nDELFY I know, I know, he'll die! \nDoc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys -- \nDOC You, four units O-pos in the warmer. Second shelf, fridge. \nThe guy heads for it. \nCarrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks when she sees Pryce. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDoc leans over Pryce's pale form.        Examines. \nAs Doc gets an IV going, he looks to Carrie -- \nDOC (cont'd) What happened? \nCARRIE Keller hit him with an ice axe. \nMURPHY He get away? \nCARRIE No. \nMurphy's walkie on his hip CRACKLES to life. \nINT. LC-130 - SAME \nRhonda's standing up front with the pilot and Copilot, watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming at them like a tidal wave. Brings a walkie to her lips... \nRHONDA Sam, it's Rhonda -- we gotta go. Now. MURPHY (V.O.) I know.    I know. \nINT. MEDICAL       CLINIC - ASB - SAME Murphy looks to Doc. \nMURPHY Can you do this on the plane? It's your call, but I need to know now. \nDoc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to Carrie -- she sees the answer's no. \nCARRIE I'll stay with you -- \nMURPHY (to his guys) Grab the bodies and get them on the plane. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe guys head for the back -- \nAs Doc looks at Pryce -- knowing he needs him... \nDOC Leave the bodies -- you don't have time. Dead is dead. (BEAT) Pick them up in six months. Go. \nDoc looks to Carrie, who's thankful -- \nCARRIE I'm sorry. \nThe guys after the bodies look to Murphy for a decision. \nMURPHY Leave'm.   Let's go. \nMurphy and Carrie exchange a quick look -- closure. \nCARRIE Thanks. \nMURPHY Take care of yourself. \nHe takes off with the others. \nEXT. LC - 130 - RIGHT AFTER \nThe wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men are just   about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the second.    He realizes they might not make it. \nEXT. RUNWAY - ASB - RIGHT AFTER \nShe heads out the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONNECTING TUNNEL TO SCIENCE BUILDING - LATER \nCarrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where she chased Rubin. \nDarkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black. WINTER HAS SET IN. \nShe HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her. \nCarrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the door. \nShe rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end. Disappears into the science building. \nINT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS \nCarrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room. Heads for the freezer. \nINT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS \nCarrie opens the door.    Illuminates the interior with her light. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney, Rubin, Weiss and Keller. \nCarry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a plastic cinch. \nPulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag. \nHer light travels down his body to his left leg. She rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep gash tight together. \nShe's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself. Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's run out from under his armpit. \nCARRIE (to herself) Someplace no one would ever think to look. \nShe raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches. \nShe cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO. \nShe contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily. Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until she shines her light on it -- \nThe freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the other two bodies. \nShe opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same thing. \nCarrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDOC (O.C.) If they had just gone along with it. \nShe turns -- Doc is standing right BEHIND HER. \nDOC (cont'd) Those fools found a plane -- had no idea what they stumbled onto. Turns out the Russians had discovered a diamond field while drilling for core samples in the sixties. \nCARRIE And we thought it was nukes the whole time. \nDOC Keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us. It was a hell of a lot of money. \nCARRIE How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc? \nDOC Weiss got hurt on the plane. They were afraid to move him, so Mooney called me. Keller and I flew out. But they couldn't get the safe open -- Keller found a way. \nCARRIE Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc. \nDOC Keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing. (ANGRY) If those idiots hadn't panicked, none of this would have happened. \nHe turns and walks out of the freezer. \nINT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS \nCarrie carefully follows. Sees he's heading for KELLER'S ICE AXE in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted LAB CART Pryce used to bust open the door. \nCARRIE Doc -- stop. \nHe does. Turns back to her. But there has been a subtle shift inside him -- something illogical. \nDOC I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. Well, this is it. Those beakers finding that plane was a sign. A sign telling me it was time to go back. Now I have something to go back for. \nShe has a realization. \nCARRIE There is no granddaughter, is there? This was about greed, plain and simple. \nDOC No one will ever know. It's just me and you. We can take care of Pryce. \n", "test1_input": "WHITEOUT \nWritten by \nJon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber \nBased on the graphic novel by \nGreg Rucka \nDecember 22, 2006 \nSCROLL OVER BLACK: \nAntarctica.

Rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist' of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice. \nSTILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice.

She's kicking back, but she's not at the beach. \nIn fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world. \nThe door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the intrusion. \nJAMIE Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology. Said it's urgent. \nCARRIE Alright -- \nJamie leaves. \nAs Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office.

Her hood is pulled up and she's not enjoying the cold. She reaches a row of buildings and checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB #2...ASTROPHYSICS - BERKLEY...until she reaches BIOLOGY BUILDING #7 and pushes through the double doors into... \nINT.   BIOLOGY BUILDING #7 - DAY \nLONG BENCHES are covered with ANTARCTIC FLORA - MOSSES, LICHENS and LIVERWORTS. They are being nurtured and studied by SCIENTISTS who look like homeless people - unkempt beards, bloodshot eyes and sun-damaged skin. \nCarrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket. Approaches one of the scientists with familiarity, who is in the process of EXTRACTING an ICE-CORE SAMPLE from a stainless steel cylinder. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE (SARCASTIC) Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe -- discover we're Alien life forms? \nFRED Workin' on it. \nCARRIE Which one's Sapperstein? \nSCIENTIST Deschampsia Antarctica. \nHe indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall grass samples across the room. PROFESSOR SAPPERSTEIN, young, thin and bearded, is studying them. \nCARRIE Okay, thanks. \nShe crosses to him -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) Sapperstein? \nHe looks at her -- \nSAPPERSTEIN Yeah. \nCARRIE Wanted to see me? \nHis face tenses -- this is serious. \nSAPPERSTEIN -- Follow me. \nHe leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a GLASS HERBARIUM containing only STALKS and a few HEAT LAMPS. One of the GLASS PANELS has been smashed. \nSAPPERSTEIN (cont'd) They took it all. \nCARRIE All what? \nSAPPERSTEIN Cannabis Sativa. \nShe looks at him -- (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSAPPERSTEIN (cont'd) My weed, man. I've been growing it all summer and they took it. (BEAT) It was just budding, too. \nHe sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy- eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato chips, candy bars, and drinking beer. Stifling laughter. \nSAPPERSTEIN (cont'd) (GLARING) It's not funny! \nCarrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh. \nCARRIE Professor Sapperstein, I'd like you to read something for me. \nShe pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her neck. Opens it up. Puts it in front of his face. \nCARRIE (cont'd) What's this say? \nHe's not sure what she's getting at -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) C'mon, go ahead, read it. \nSAPPERSTEIN Carrie Stetko. \nCARRIE Keep reading. \nSAPPERSTEIN United States Marshal. \nShe closes the fold, lets it drop around her neck. \nCARRIE Very good.

HOTEL 6 - LOBBY - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT) \nFLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the entrance. \nPatrons and bystanders are perched in various locations, watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears. \nShe's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are loading a body under a sheet into the back of their truck. \nBACK TO SCENE \nINT. SNOWCAT - DAY \nDelfy's looking at Carrie like he's waiting for an answer. \nDELFY I said \"which way?\" \nShe glances to the GPS. \nCARRIE North. \nPryce sees Carrie pause for a moment, massaging her gloved left hand. \nPRYCE Hurt? \nCARRIE Yeah, a little. \nHe can see it aches more than she's letting on. \nPRYCE How long have you been down here, Marshal? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE Almost two years. \nPRYCE What brought you to the ice? \nShe pauses, humored. \nCARRIE (SARCASTIC) The excitement, mostly. \nPRYCE Everyone down here is running away from something. \nCARRIE Some shrink tell you that? \nPRYCE Yeah, and that I should call my mother more often \nCARRIE And do you? \nPRYCE Every Sunday. \nCARRIE Where do you plant your boots? \nPRYCE They got me working out of Christchurch, New Zealand. Beautiful country. But this -- crazy place to make a living. \nShe takes a moment, gazing out the window to the endless landscape of white. \nCARRIE I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay. \nPRYCE He give you that ring I saw? Tell you he was going to marry you? \nCARRIE No -- just gave me a headache. (BEAT) (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) CARRIE (cont'd) I didn't see a ring on your finger. \nPRYCE Flattered that you even looked. \nA faint beeping noise emanates from her GPS. \nCARRIE This is it. \nAll eyes go ahead as they drive on.   Looking.   Nothing but an icy plateau. \nAfter a couple of beats -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) Stop. \nDELFY There's nothing here. \nCARRIE Just stop. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. ICE FIELD - DAY \nAll three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind.      Carrie steps away from the Cat. Pryce does too. \nHer eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal.    It's completely flat. Desert like. \nPRYCE You sure this is right? \nCARRIE Section 104.   These are the coordinates. \nDELFY Maybe you wrote them down wrong. \nCarrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat. Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then, she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN. \nKneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out. Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind. \nCARRIE This is shaved ice. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth -- like it's supposed to be. \nShe turns around.   Tries to get the bigger picture. Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few inches thick -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) They were digging, Pryce. And they tries to spread the ice to hide it. \nShe heads back across the area.       Scans the horizon. Takes another step forward. \nWHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was covered up with a white, iced-over tarp. \nPryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating slightly, unsure of their own footing. \nPryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but darkness. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Grab me! \nPryce lays flat. Reaches his hand down -- six inches too short. Delfy appears from behind. \nPRYCE (to Delfy) Hold my legs! \nDelfy does.    Pryce inches closer. \nCARRIE I'm slipping! \nPRYCE Almost got you. \nCARRIE I'm losing my grip. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHe gets closer.   Closer.    Moves to within an inch from hers -- \n-- She SLIPS.    Falls away.   Things become silent. \nPRYCE Carrie?    Can you hear me? \nDelfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss. \nDELFY (YELLING) Marshal? \nCARRIE (O.C.) ...I'm okay. \nDELFY Saw a rope in the Cat. \nDelfy springs to his feet. \nINT. ICE SHAFT - SAME \nDarkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area. \nAs she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high. \nCarrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground beneath her is metal. \nINT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER \nPryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits. Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery. \nCarrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE! \nINT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS \nOff their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. Place is tomb silent.

They follow his beam straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the fuselage. \nPRYCE (cont'd) With the angle of the plane, I don't think we're that far from the surface. Give me a hand. \nPryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over. They join, sliding it over below the hatch. \nHe jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area. \nPRYCE (cont'd) These are explosive bolts. If we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice. \nCARRIE Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us. \nPRYCE We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. Take your pick. \nPryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nAs he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner. \nPRYCE (cont'd) This could work -- give me the battery from your phone. \nAs he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over her phone. He extracts the BATTERY. \nPRYCE (cont'd) When I connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang. May want to take some cover. \nPryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery, and prepares for another. \nHe looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against the fuselage. \nPRYCE (cont'd) You guys ready? \nDelfy nods. \nCarrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head. \nPryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing happens. Hope freezes. \nPryce tries again -- \n-- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light. \nSLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on, halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's width. \nThey stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift from God. \nDELFY Hallelujah -- \nPryce drops down.   Moves to another crate. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nPRYCE Delfy, help me with this.     We'll need to get up higher. \nDelfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other. \nJust as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE. \nCARRIE Don't move. \nPryce stares at her in disbelief. \nPRYCE What's going on? \nDELFY Yeah -- what're you doing? \nCARRIE Our friend here isn't who he says he is. \nShe reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm from the shoulder holster. \nSwitches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian gun in her coat pocket. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here? \nPRYCE I've been authorized because of what's happened. \nCARRIE Stop lying to me -- \n", "test3_true": "CARRIE (cont'd) Delfy, cuff him to the wall. \nShe holds out the cuffs. \nPRYCE Don't do this. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nDELFY Man, the guy just saved our lives... \nCARRIE He was saving his own.   Do it. \nDelfy takes the cuffs from her.  Cuffs Pryce to some exposed piping. Carrie lowers her gun. \nCARRIE (cont'd) You know what was in that safe. (BEAT) Now, who are you? \nShe sees a moment of contemplation on Pryce's face -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) I swear I'll leave you here to die. \nBeat. \nPRYCE CIA. \nCARRIE Have you got an ID for that too? \nPRYCE Listen to me -- Forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black market trader in New York. It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice. \nDELFY Damn, I knew that government eavesdropping was true. \nPRYCE There's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base -- a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties -- nothing was ever confirmed. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (6) PRYCE (cont'd) The fact is, before the treaty in `72 they were strip mining all over the place down here -- we believe for uranium and other specialized minerals for weapon's use. It was the Cold War. No one knows half the things the Russian's were up to. This plane could be the link between rumor and truth. And if it is true, what's in those cannisters could be a prelude to another terrorist attack. \nCARRIE Why did you lie to me? \nPRYCE Look, the U.N. carries a lot of weight down here. Think about it - - if I had told you I was C.I.A., you would have been on the horn back to Washington in no time. This is a very sensitive matter. News travels fast down here, I don't have to tell you that. (BEAT) Besides, I didn't know if I could trust you. \nCarrie wrestles with her emotions. She looks back towards the open safe, the blood staining the airplane floor. Makes a decision. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SURFACE - DAY \nDelfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back. Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows. \nThey look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING. The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered. \nDelfy runs over, jumps onto the CAT.   Looks inside the cab. \nDELFY Keys are still in it! \nCarrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks in the distance. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE Plane could've gone anywhere. There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem. \nDelfy starts up the Cat. \nCarrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his PDA. She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the Cat. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Rhonda? \nWalkie crackles. \nRHONDA (V.O.) (PISSED) Where the hell are you? \nCARRIE Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours? \nRHONDA (V.O.) You expect me to -- \nCARRIE (SNAPS) -- How many? \nRHONDA (V.O.) Fifteen. \nCARRIE I need a list of names. \nCarrie clicks off. \n", "test3_id": 2066}

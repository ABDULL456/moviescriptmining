We think they were digging. That makes it my business. \nThis stops her -- digging? \nCARRIE You don't dig for meteorites. \nPRYCE And you don't get killed for them either. This is now a U.N. matter. I am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if I have to. \nDELFY He can, you know. \nShe knows and her patience is running thin. \nCARRIE Fine. But this is my investigation, understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained. \nShe continues with Pryce next to her. \nPRYCE Fine. (BEAT) Mind if I ask you a personal question? \nCARRIE No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway. \nPRYCE Why do you smell like suntan lotion? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. VOSTOK - CORRIDOR - DAY \nCarrie and Delfy are heading toward the Ready Room. She has her phone to her ear. Two Russians trail behind with Mooney in a bodybag. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIE Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo -- search for him. \nMURPHY (V.O.) That's not possible. We're still bringing people in and resupplying other bases for Winter-over. \nShe thinks about it -- \nCARRIE Sam, I think these guys found something out there at the camp. I'm going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one leaves the ice. Not yet. \nShe clicks off. \nCarrie opens the door to the ready room to find Pryce standing there with a gear bag -- typing into a PDA (Treo type). \nPRYCE We ready? \nCARRIE Guess so. \nHe finishes entering his text into the PDA.       Sends.   Puts it away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OTTER - DAY \nDelphy flies the plane over a labyrinth of deep, blue crevices. \nEXT.   CAMP DELTA ONE ONE - DAY \nDelfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp. There are TWO BIG TENTS and some scattered equipment - a SNOWCAT, a CHEST of TOOLS, DRUMS of GASOLINE. \nThe sky is dark with clouds and the wind MOANS.      A haze of wind-driven snow whips by. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted. \nCARRIE What time is it? \nPryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his jacket. \nPRYCE Two thirty. \nCARRIE A.M. or P.M.? \nPRYCE A.M. \nCARRIE Wonderful. (re: tent) I'll take this one. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. FIRST TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS \nCarrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand -- stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it from her pocket. Turns it on. \nINT.   FIRST WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS \nHer FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays over a litter of personal effects, then picks up a TRAIL OF BLOOD leading to a cot between two others. Someone is huddled in a yellow sleeping bag on it. Her body tightens. \nCARRIE Rubin? \nShe steps into the tent. Moves to the cot. There's a pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't move. She pulls at it... \n...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is soaked in blood.   No corpse. \nShe steadies her breathing.      She pulls out a small baggie from her pocket. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen blood sample from the pant leg. Puts it in the baggie. \nTakes out her camera next.       Starts snapping.   Flash goes off. \nINT.   SECOND WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie enters with Delfy. Place is lit by a single dim bulb. This is a work space; two tables, instruments on top. Sample containers piled everywhere. Numerous photos of meteorites are stuck to a board. \nShe finds Pryce reading the crew's DAILY LOG. \nPRYCE Anything? \nCARRIE Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood. What do you got? \nPRYCE Their daily work log. \nDelfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT; it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower. A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box. \nDELFY Looks like my dad's old lawn mower. \nPRYCE It's ground penetrating radar. \nCarrie moves over to a table with a MAP SPREAD OUT ON TOP. The ice field is marked off into sections. \nCARRIE Looks like they were surveying sections at a time. \nPRYCE Areas labeled? \nCARRIE Yeah -- \nHe's flipping back and forth through the pages -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPRYCE At Sections 101 and 102, they spent one day. \nCarrie finds them on the map. \nPRYCE (cont'd) 103 two days. \nCarrie finds it. \nPRYCE (cont'd) 104 -- seven days. That was a month ago. \nThey look at each other. Carrie finds it on the map as Pryce moves up next to her. \nCARRIE Looks like they hit some really big meteors. \nPRYCE How far? \nCARRIE About four miles. \nPRYCE Let's go see what they found. \nCARRIE I want to check something out first. \nINT. TWIN OTTER - SIDE CARGO DOOR - DAY \nCarrie has Mooney's bodybag unzipped and is examining his left leg. No cuts. No blood. She thinks on this non- discovery for a moment, then zips it back up. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   SNOWCAT - DAY - RIGHT AFTER \nThe CAT'S tracks CLANK and CRUNCH as it powers across the featureless ice - the loneliest place on earth. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 2064, "test2_input": "CONTINUED: Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious. \nCARRIE Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it. \nDELFY It's an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late fifties. No one's put these in the air for forty years. \nCarrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit. \nSomething BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light - - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position - - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's dead, pinned between two large metal crates. \nDelfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a look back over her shoulder -- \nCARRIE Guess that makes three. \nShe continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her light targets the cockpit door. It's closed. \nINT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER \nCarrie pushes the door open. \nThe beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding through it. \nContinues over three dead men in flight suits still strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm holstered around their waist. \nDELFY This isn't funny -- \nShe looks back to Delfy -- gets confused. \nCARRIE Where's Pryce? \nINT. CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER \nTrailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered cargo area. \nRansacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of supplies. \nDipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks. \nCARRIE What is that? \nDelfy grins. \nDELFY Vodka. \nCarrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION. \nSpots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead. \nMoves to it. \nCARRIE (SUSPICIOUS) Find what you're looking for? \nHer light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open. \nPryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy. \nPRYCE Just answers. (BEAT) Those are fuel tanks behind you. This plane was outfitted for long range capabilities. \nCARRIE And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important. \nCarrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been breached. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools litter the floor. \nPRYCE They put some serious work into this. \nThere's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood -- \nCARRIE Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel. \nShe uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed. Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide. \nThe PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES. \nCARRIE (cont'd) What is that? \nThe muffled ROAR of a diesel. \nDELFY It's the Cat! \nCRASH! -- the unmistakable sound of FALLING ICE. \nCARRIE Go! \nCRASHCRASHCRASH!    More ICE. \nThey scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold. \n", "test2_true": "Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely. Light fades. \nDELFY Sonofabitch! \nThe continual sound of falling ice grows MUFFLED and DISTANT.

PLANE - AT THE HATCH - LATER \nCHIPCHIPCHIP!    Ice is flying. \nThings are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts are big-- but the progress minimal. \nPRYCE This isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon. (BEAT) We're going to suffocate before we get out here. \nCARRIE How long do you figure we've got? \nPRYCE Three of us down here -- 12, 15 hours at the most. \nDelfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped animal. \nDELFY No way. I'm not going out like this. No way. \nThe light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade. Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg, trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light goes out -- \n-- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it. Hands it over to Carrie -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDELFY (cont'd) And when that one goes -- we're screwed. \nCarries mind whirls with her lack of options, then -- \nCARRIE What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice? \nPRYCE Fire will burn the O2 quicker. \nCARRIE What choice do we have? \nPryce knows she's right. \nDelfy looks to them both.    Desperate. \nDELFY Don't need my vote. \nPryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible in the dissipating range of light. \nCarrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her coat. \nDelfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it, but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks. Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks. \nPryce comes back with a couple bottles.       Stops dead in his tracks. \nCarrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking. \nHe moves to Carrie -- \nPRYCE Hold these. \nHe exchanges the bottles for her flashlight. \nHe shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the dark. \nCARRIE What're you doing? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPRYCE All these planes used to have bail- out hatches. \nCARRIE We came in through it. \nPryce goes back into the cargo area. \nPRYCE (O.C.) Has to be more than one. \n", "test2_id": 2065, "test3_input": "CARRIE (cont'd) Pryce, it's not Rubin -- \nOff his confused look -- \nCARRIE (cont'd) Someone's trying to kill him. \nPryce picks up speed as he targets the door.

READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through the open exit door. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCarrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are vacant. Ice axe is still there. \nCARRIE Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on. \nCarrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie joins. Same thing. \nPRYCE How long's he been out there? \nCARRIE Thirty seconds. \nEXT. ASB - RIGHT AFTER \nRubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins tucked against the base of the main building. The blood from his wound already frozen on his shirt. \nThe cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's reflection off the ice is blinding. \nCUT TO: \nRUBIN'S POV - \n-- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to shield them -- has little effect. \nHe looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his attacker not far behind. \nRubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care -- pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground. \nContinues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal his movement. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS \nUp ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing filling an insulated container with water from an insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is parked next to them. \nHe tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice escapes... \nRUBIN ...Help me. \nThe guys -- oblivious. \nEXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY \nCarrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite directions around the complex. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME \nRubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too slow, they take off. He coughs up blood. \nRUBIN W..wa..wait. \nHe turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet away and closing. \nRubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon -- anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER. Heads for it. \nEXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME \nCarrie passes a gap between storage containers where several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow -- through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in. \nEXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME \nPryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin. Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them. \nEXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME \nRubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it, but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a defeated glance over his shoulder to see -- \n-- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on - - SPRAYING him head to toe. \nRubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his ice-locked clothing. \nThe man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP - breaks his neck. \nRubin's body topples stiffly to the ground. \nINT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME \n", "test3_true": "RHONDA Sam! \nShe looks to Murphy, who is on the phone. \nMurphy and the others join her at the window.

He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head. Goggles shatter. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe drops. \nCarrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps the goggle from his face. \nIt's KELLER! \nBlood trickles from the fresh wound to his head. \nThe shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine blade. \nPryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering from the impact -- \nKELLER I sh... sh... shoulda killed you at Vostok. \nCARRIE Where are the cannisters? \nKELLER Go to hell. \nPRYCE Wrong answer. \nCARRIE Help me drag him over here. \nThey each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him back over to the Snow Melter. \nCARRIE (cont'd) Keep him still. \nShe hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's neck. \nCarrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat. \nPRYCE Who's Tahir selling it to -- what's the intended target? \nKeller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing bare arms and legs. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKELLER What're you doing, you crazy bitch? \nKeller instantly starts to shake. \nCARRIE Why did you kill those scientists, Keller? Was a four-way split too much for you? \nKELLER Fuck you. \nCarrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter. \nShe brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground as it freezes instantly. \nCARRIE Where is the uranium? \nKELLER (almost smug) You have no idea what's going on here, do you? \nKeller begins to shiver violently. \nPRYCE Hit the sonofabitch again! \nCarrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.        He screams. Pain is too much. He caves. \nKELLER The plane, they're in the fucking plane. \nCarrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.     It's Murphy. Furious. Two other guys at his side. \nMURPHY Have you completely lost your mind? \nCARRIE Let go of me. \n", "test3_id": 2066}

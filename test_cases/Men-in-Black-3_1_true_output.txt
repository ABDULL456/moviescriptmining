KAY I make my own future! Besides -- I'm younger and stronger than you! 
They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time -- feet collide. 
JAY Bet you're sorry you taught me that. The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each other... And then Kay fakes a left --- 
JAY (CONT'D) You always lead with your-- But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down hard. 
KAY Had enough yet? On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor. 
JAY I can't let you go -- I love you! Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY. They CLINCH... it's a stalemate... 
KAY Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you- 
JAY I'm not falling for that. 
KAY I'm not kidding -- Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see... The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the 
FLORIDA TUBE. Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE! 
THROUGH THE TUBES Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of pneumatic tubes. 
The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy, moving gracefully, like fish through water... Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air luge"... Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube like a pinball... They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern seaboard... Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff astronauts in a G-Force simulator. Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe: 
JAY (yelling over the wind 
NOISE) I have to know -- can I really prevent Kay's murder? 
LAMA Yes. 
JAY Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to hear. 
LAMA But where there was death, there will be death. 
JAY What does that mean? The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube. 
EXT. FIELD 
Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION 
PIPE. They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the hell was that? We follow the SCREAM... 
BACK IN THE TUBE Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM -- 
TUBE P.A. (V.0.) All passengers, prepare to de-tube. 
JAY De-tube? 
TUBE P.A. (V.0.) Please make sure all helmet and crash suit straps are securely fastened. On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit. 
JAY Helmet? No one said anything about 
A--

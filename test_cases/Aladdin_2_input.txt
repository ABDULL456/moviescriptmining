(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.) 
ALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu! Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow, and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.) Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away, looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU. CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go! 
(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.) 
IAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker. Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have lots! 
(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.) 
JAFAR:  Leave him alone! 
(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.) 
JAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen... 
(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.) 
JASMINE:    Never! JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No. Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me. 
(We see ALADDIN race back into town.)

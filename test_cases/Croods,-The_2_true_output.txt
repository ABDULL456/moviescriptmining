EEP You really need to see this... 
The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful world. 
The Croods look out at the new world. 
EEP (CONT'D) We should go there! 
GRUG No. No one is going anywhere. 
Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice. 
GRUG (CONT'D) What else did that boy say? 
WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE. 
The Croods reel back as it sails overhead. They turn to watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away. 
They hear a familiar menacing growl. It's the BEAR OWL! 
It roars and charges toward the Croods. 
Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in front of his family. 
The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like a ball of yarn. 
But the Croods are not behind it. They are running towards the New World. 
UGGA Grug? 
GRUG Just go! Go! Go! 
The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl closing in. 
They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives. 
The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin tumbling down a steep jungle hill. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD 
EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY 
The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots and strange plants and land in a heap. They all lie on their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm. 
Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to tumble down. There is no sign of the BEAR OWL. 
The others stand up, and they take in this new place. 
Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts: 
GRUG One, two, three, four, five -- BEAT. Grug smiles. 
Gran lands in a heap behind him. 
GRUG (CONT'D) (DEFEATED) Six. 
GRAN (winces in pain) Oh... Where are we? 
GRUG I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a lower place. One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came. 
The Croods SIT UP. They are disoriented. 
ON SANDY 
SANDY Sniff sniff sniff Grrrrrrrrrrr..... 
UGGA (hushed, urgent) Sandy? What is it? 
Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a bush.

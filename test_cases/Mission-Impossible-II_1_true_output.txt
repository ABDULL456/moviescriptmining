NYAH What lawyer? 
ETHAN AND COMPUTER SCREEN 
ETHAN Well, here we go.

EXT - GOVERNMENT BUILDING - SEVILLE (DAY) 
Nyah emerges from the entrance to the jail. 
ETHAN Stop and look for something in you purse..kneel down.. 
She does.  They're effectively blocked from the street. 
NYAH Limo's waiting. 
Ethan hands her a key chain with what appear to be a car-key. 
ETHAN - Ambrose will have counter-surveillance second to no one's.  When and if he contacts you, push this button before you actually end up under his roof it'll scramble your transmission to us. 
She takes the key chain.  Her hands are shaking. 
NYAH When will you be there? 
ETHAN Before you are. 
NYAH How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now. 
ETHAN You don't trust me. 
NYAH Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character. 
ETHAN He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed. 
NYAH Yes? 
ETHAN You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you. 
NYAH Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice. 
ETHAN Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you.. 
They rise.  A quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone.  A look of something like longing replaces the toughness as she gazes after him, then starts across the street toward the limo and driver.  MI music theme kicks in and continues over: 
POV HELICOPTER (MOVING - SYDNEY - DAY) 
over the Harbor Bridge, sails dotting the bay like confetti. 
EXT - FARM (DAY) 
pans of sheep are bleating and looking for sort of cover in response to the sound of a helicopter touching down. 
EXT - COPTER (DAY) 
Billy and Luther emerge, Luther with computer looking acutely uncomfortable in a wrinkled suit. 
ETHAN'S VOICE Welcome to Australia, mate. 
They look up to a smiling Ethan who points to the ground beneath Luther's feet.  Luther looks down to see that he is standing in a pile of sheep-shit. 
LUTHER Thanks - mate. 
Both men laugh and all three move to: 
INT - FARMHOUSE (DAY) 
Luther and Billy with Ethan setting up their operation.  There's a blip on one of the screens. 
LUTHER It's the transponder. 
ETHAN Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up. 
LUTHER The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do. 
BILLY Yeah, I've heard about you, Luther, and I just want to tell you it's an honor and a pleasure to be working with you blokes, whoaa!  That's some transponder!

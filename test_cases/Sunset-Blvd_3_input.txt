BETTY So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick -- 
SHELDRAKE Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer. 
BETTY Goodbye, Mr. Gillis. 
GILLIS Goodbye.  Next time I'll write The Naked and the Dead. 
Betty leaves. 
SHELDRAKE Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture. 
GILLIS Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award. 
SHELDRAKE (His mind free-wheeling) Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton? 
GILLIS Frankly, no. 
SHELDRAKE (Amusing himself) Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman. 
GILLIS You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job. 
SHELDRAKE Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along - 
GILLIS Along is no good.  I need it now. 
SHELDRAKE Haven't got a thing. 
GILLIS Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue. 
SHELDRAKE There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative. 
GILLIS (Hating it) Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan? 
SHELDRAKE Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected - 
GILLIS Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A-12    EXT. SCHWAB'S DRUG STORE (EARLY AFTERNOON ACTIVITY)         GILLIS' VOICE After that I drove down MOVE IN toward drug store   to headquarters.  That's and                         the way a lot of us think about Schwab's Drug Store. DISSOLVE TO:                Actors and stock girls and waiters.  Kind of a combination office,Kaffee- A-13    INT. SCHWAB'S DRUG STORE    Klatsch and waiting room. Waiting, waiting for the The usual Schwabadero       gravy train. crowd sits at the fount- ain, gossips at the cigar-stand, loiters by the magazine display. MOVE IN towards the TWO TELEPHONE BOOTHS.  In       I got myself ten nickels one of them sits Gillis,    and started sending out a stack of nickels in       a general S.O.S.  Couldn't front of him.  He's         get hold of my agent, doing a lot of talking      naturally.  So then I into the telephone,         called a pal of mine,name hanging up, dropping        of Artie Green -- an awful another nickel, dialing,    nice guy, an assistant talking again.              director.  He cquld let me have twenty, but twenty wouldn't do. 
GILLIS' VOICE (Cont.) Then I talked to a couple of yes men at Twentieth.  To me they said no.  Finally I located that agent of mine, the big faker.  Was he out digging up a job for poor Joe Gillis? Hmph! He was hard at work in Bel Air, making with the golf clubs. 
Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He walks toward the exit.  He is stopped by the voice of 
SKOLSKY Hello, Gillis. 
Gillis looks around.  At the fountain sits Skolsky, drinking a cup of coffee. 
GILLIS Hello, Mr. Skolsky. 
SKOLSKY Got anything for the column? 
GILLIS Sure.  Just sold an original for a hundred grand.  The Life of the Warner Brothers.  Starring the Ritz Brothers.  Playing opposite the Andrew Sisters. 
SKOLSKY (With a sour smile) But don't get me wrong -- I love Hollywood. 
Gillis walks out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A-14    THE BEL AIR GOLF LINKS 
On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores, stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript opponent in the background.  Gillis has evidently stated his problem already. 
MORINO So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to. 
GILLIS No?

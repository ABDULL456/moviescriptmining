BETH (SLOWLY) I am telling you... you did. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLES LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT S amantha is sprawled on the couch. The TV is going, she's listening to music on her I-pod while texting a friend on her phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same time, multi-tasking. 
She doesn't hear the door bell RING the first time. Or the second. Then there's a LOUD KNOCKING. Samantha becomes aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the frosted window next to the door. 
With a SIGH of annoyance, Samantha gets up and goes to the door. She unlocks and opens it. Lisa is standing on the threshold, looking fresh and pretty and smiling. 
LISA (super friendly) Hi, I'm Beth's friend Allie.      She's expecting me. 
Lisa breezes right in. 
SAMANTHA Mister and Mrs. Charles are out. 
LISA Out? 
SAMANTHA They went to dinner. 
LISA What? Beth told me to drop by. That's strange. Oh well, I have something for Kyle. I'll just run up and give it to him. 
SAMANTHA You can't.     He's sleeping. 
LISA Oh, I won't wake him. 
(CONTINUED) 
K 
CONTINUED: 
SAMANTHA Maybe you should come back. 
LISA But I'm here right now. Why should I... oh, I see. Just doing your duty. Good girl. You know what, let me call Beth. 
Lisa takes out a cell phone, punches in a number.      Samantha looks relieved. 
LISA (cont'd) (into her cell) Beth? Hey, girlfriend. It's Allie. Where am I? Where are you! I'm at your place. You told me to come by. to Samantha) No it's okay. She forgot. (back into cell) No, Samantha was a little concerned so I said I'd call you. (winks at Samantha) Yeah. Okay, honey. You two have a great night. (to Samantha; holding out the CELL) Oh, wait. Did you want to talk to her? 
Samantha shakes her head "no." 
LISA (cont'd) (into cell) Beth, I'll call you tomorrow. 
Lisa clicks off. 
LISA (cont'd) (to Samantha) Great. This will only take me a minute. 
Lisa crosses to the stairs and goes up.      Samantha returns to the couch and resumes texting. 
INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM 
yle is asleep in his crib. The door cracks open, emitting light from the hall, turning Lisa into a silhouette. She enters the room, silent as a ghost, and approaches Kyle's crib. She stands over him, smiling down at the vulnerable sleeping child. 
Then, Lisa turns away and looks at herself in a mirror. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She takes out a tube of red lipstick and applies it to her lips. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - A MINUTE LATER 
Samantha is listening to i-pod music/texting/watching TV.     In the background, out of focus, Lisa comes down the stairs. 
LISA Thanks, Samantha.   Nice meeting you. 
SAMANTHA (preoccupied; doesn't even LOOK) You, too. 
Lisa vanishes. Samantha sends a last message, then thinks she ought to check on the baby. She gets up, starts for the stairs when she gets another text message on her phone. She checks it, laughs and returns to the couch to text her friend back.                                                  C UT TO: 
INT. SUV - NIGHT 
Derek and Beth drive home in tense silence.   Finally, Beth speaks. 
BETH It's his birthday tomorrow. 
DEREK I know. 
BETH I told him we'd take him to Legoland. 
DEREK I'll go on-line tonight and order the tickets. Unless you think you should take him alone. 
BETH No. Whatever we're going through, he needs us to be together.

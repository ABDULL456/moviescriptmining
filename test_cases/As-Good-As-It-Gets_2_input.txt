MELVIN I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!! 
She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into the room. 
CAROL Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there. 
MELVIN (uncomfortably) How ya doing? 
Spencer just stares at him. 
MELVIN (miffed) You should answer when someone talks to you... 
Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs out the door. 
CAROL Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, and I can't handle you teaching my son manners. 
She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and leads him back to his room. 
INT. SPENCER'S ROOM 
CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his ear. They both count down the seconds. 
CAROL AND SPENCER 5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo. 
SPENCER 
CAROL We are going to treat ourselves to a cab ride. 
EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY 
As Carol carries her young son through a class of uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She spots Melvin about to enter a cab. 
CAROL Melvin, wait! 
The school kids pick up the chant in unison. 
SCHOOL KIDS Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! 
He turns to face them. 
MELVIN Shut up, kids! 
They immediately obey as Carol approaches him. 
CAROL Melvin...  give us a lift. We've got to go see our friends at the hospital. 
Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face. 
MELVIN I'll ride up front. Cover your mouth when you cough, kid. 
INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY 
As they settle in and drive off. 
CAROL Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, please and quickly please. 
EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 
As Carol enters the hospital. 
CAROL (calling back) I owe you three dollars. 
Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son... 
MELVIN Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today? 
CAROL (furiously) No!!! Stay away from me! 
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair... she has some index cards in her laps which she occasionally consults and shuffles.

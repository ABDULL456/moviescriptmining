Street lights go on. 
MULWRAY 
Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings. 
GITTES 
Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating the climb than Mulwray did. 
DOWN ON THE BEACH 
Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent. 
He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in order to be above Mulwray. 
AT THE OUTFALL 
Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand. 
Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks absently up toward Gittes. 
GITTES 
Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns. 
BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN 
Flashing in the dust. 
CLOSE  GITTES 
Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He's in a puddle of water and the seat of his trousers is wet. 
MULWRAY 
Below him in watching the water trickling down from the outfall near Gittes. 
Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea, whipping it into a foam. 
AT THE STREET  GITTES' CAR 
There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash light. It says: 
"SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY! LOS ANGELES IS YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE!!! VOTE YES NOVEMBER 6... CITIZENS COMMITTEE TO SAVE OUR CITY, HON. SAM BAGBY, FORMER MAYOR  CHAIRMAN." Gittes grumbles, crumples it up and tosses it out the window. He notices other flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street. 
Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment. 
INT. GLOVE COMPARTMENT 
Consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches. 
The cheap price tags are still on them. Gittes pulls out one. 
He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car. He yawns again and heads back to his own car. 
GITTES 
Arrives whistling, opens the door with "J.J. GITTES AND ASSOCIATES  DISCREET INVESTIGATION" on it. 
GITTES Morning, Sophie. 
Sophie hands him a small pile of messages. He goes through them. 
GITTES Walsh here? 
SOPHIE He's in the dark room. 
Gittes walks through his office to Duffy and Walsh's. A little red light is on in the corner, over a closed door. Gittes walks over and knocks on the door. 
GITTES Where'd he go yesterday? 
WALSH'S VOICE Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle. 
GITTES Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain. 
WALSH'S VOICE What'd you expect? That's his job. 
GITTES Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something. 
WALSH'S VOICE I think I got something. 
GITTES Oh yeah? You pick up the watch? 
INT. DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE  GITTES 
WALSH'S VOICE It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins? 
Gittes walks to his office. 
ON HIS DESK 
Is the Ingersoll watch, the crystal broken, the hands stopped at 2:47. 
GITTES He was there all night. 
Gittes drops it, sits down. Walsh comes in carrying a series of wet photos stuck with clothes pins onto a small blackboard.

Grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks. Two bored butchers hack them up.  The good bits are tossed into a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals.  The waste and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.  A butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the blood and carcasses. 
Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of hanging carcasses and flies. 
When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood sluice -- out of sight -- 
Then he thuds to a stop.  He can go no further because the remains of an animal carcass blocks his way.  He tries to slither past the carcass -- 
Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate and a torrent of water flows down. 
Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer. 
INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT 
Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and the screams of burning men.  They run. 
They round a corner and see there is no way past the world of flame ahead of them.  The tunnel to the compound has collapsed. 
PROXIMO Gods... they're killing them all. 
Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to... 
EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT 
They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the arms of the Praetorian Guard.  Proximo and Juba are bound. Proximo sees his compound burning.  Sees the Praetorian archers taking out any last survivors.  Hears the screams. 
INT./ EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT 
A quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard units round up many associated with the plot.  And many that are not. 
GAIUS' BEDROOM:  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and hauled out. 
CHRISTIAN HOME:  A congregation of Christians is chained together, their secret altar smashed. 
CAFE:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls. 
STREET THEATER:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a performance. 
GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with his handsome catamite.  A unit of Praetorian bursts in. Gracchus looks at them.  Sighs. 
INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT 
Commodus stands with Lucius on a balcony overlooking the city. 
The roaring flames of the fire at Proximo's compound can easily be seen. 
LUCIUS What is that fire? 
COMMODUS Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.  I arranged it just for you. 
He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. 
Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair.  Her face is a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do. 
Two Praetorians enter with a bucket. 
PRAETORIAN Caesar... 
Commodus goes to them.  He talks quietly with them for a moment and glances at what they are carrying. 
COMMODUS Oh... that's for my sister. 
They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her. 
Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the balcony. 
Lucilla glances inside the bucket... 
Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine.  Lucilla moans.  All is lost. 
EXT.  TIBER RIVER - NIGHT 
Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber, gasping for air. 
Animal carcasses float up next to him.  He grabs onto one and floats down the gently flowing river. 
EXT.  ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN 
The Wolf of Rome sleeps.  Then its ears rise.  Then its head.  It sniffs the air.  The wolf slowly rises and begins loping through the camp. 
It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily drifting up from campfires. 
The wolf finally stops and looks up. 
Maximus is on a horse.  He climbs down.  The wolf goes to him and licks his hand.

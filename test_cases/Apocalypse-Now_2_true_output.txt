KILGORE Lance Johnson? The surfer? 
LANCE That's right, sir. 
Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand. 
KILGORE It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is. 
LANCE Thank you, sir. 
KILGORE You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot. 
41 VIEW ON WILLARD 
His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the background. 
KILGORE (O.S.) This is Mike from San Diego and Johnny from Malibu -- they're good solid surfers -- none of us are anywhere near your class, though. 
Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks. 
WILLARD My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon -- 
KILGORE Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here. 
Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in- discriminately on the bodies as they talk. 
KILGORE (continuing) ... we do a lot of surfing around here. Like to finish up operations early and fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass. Have you ever surfed the point at Vung Tau? I liked the beach breaks around Na Trang a lot -- good lefts. 
He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them. 
KILGORE (continuing) ... we keep three boards in my Command Huey at all times. You never can tell when you're gonna run into something good. I got a guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict a swell two days in advance. We try to work it in. 
He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses. 
KILGORE (continuing; to himself) Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw one. 
He puts the card in the gaping mouth. 
42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG 
We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE. 
KILGORE Where've you been riding, Lance? 
LANCE I haven't surfed since I got here. 
KILGORE That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT 
Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by a table set up in front of the command copter. 
Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map. 
KILGORE Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for? 
WILLARD I got bored in Saigon. 
KILGORE What's the furthest you been in? 
WILLARD Haiphong. 
KILGORE Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ? 
WILLARD No. Walked. 
KILGORE What'd you do for supplies? 
WILLARD (he shrugs) Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches. 
KILGORE Can you trust them? 
WILLARD No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars. 
KILGORE Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba. 
WILLARD When did you hear? 
KILGORE 'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive? 
WILLARD Who knows. 
KILGORE Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz? 
WILLARD I met him. 
KILGORE Don't you agree? 
WILLARD He musta changed ! (pointing to the map) I got to get into the Nung River, here or here. 
KILGORE That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy. 
WILLARD Hairy ? 
KILGORE I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.

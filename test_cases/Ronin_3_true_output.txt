LARRY (V.O.) I'm telling you... 
INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME 
LARRY (continuing) That I could be dead and I'd drive better than you. 
Deirdre is driving, and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in the passenger seat, watching her every move. 
DEIRDRE (very curt) Oh shut up... 
IN THE BACK SEAT - 
Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out.  Vincent is tracing Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as it traces a line up the highway. 
VINCENT He's going north. (circles something on map) That's Aix en Provence, where he used the phone. 
Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the map.  Destination: Paris. 
SAM (making up his mind) He's going back. 
VINCENT Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore. 
SAM It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris. (beat) Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there. 
DEIRDRE If somebody else doesn't find him first. 
EXT. THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY 
Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty thousand souls.  It is small, charming, quaint, and it has one particular thing that no other town in France can claim - 
AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly restored.  We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE. It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled with a tourist having breakfast.  This normally quiet place explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.  We come upon - 
A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.  Dad is angry at Mom. 
DAD Opera?  This is an opera festival? 
MOM I told you that, Henry. 
DAD I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera. You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that kind of thing. 
Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.  Here, in the most removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in the shadow of the trellis.  Unless you're on top of him you can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.  His cell phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and starts to punch in a number. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE 
THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.  Sam is sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot. Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes. 
In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry can't contain himself.  He's stuffing himself, washing everything down with the wine which is also sold at these road-side rest stops.  Deirdre drinks coffee. 
LARRY (mouth full) This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this? 
DEIRDRE (with a laugh) Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see. 
LARRY What is? 
DEIRDRE (everybody knows this) Best beer in the world known to man or God. 
LARRY (with a snort) Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks. 
DEIRDRE (with unconcealed scorn) Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss. 
LARRY Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then? 
DEIRDRE I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness. 
VINCENT (O.S.) I hate to interrupt a conversation of such cultural depth...

NORA You turned into an asshole and I didn't love you. 
RANDOLPH We could've worked through all that. 
He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so violently he almost falls over the coffee table. 
RANDOLPH Damn it, Nora! The public is clamoring for me! I'm a fucking patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's evil! He's probably even gay! You should've seen the way he was checking me out in the car! 
NORA (suddenly suspicious) What does that mean? 
RANDOLPH What does what mean? 
NORA You said he was checking you out in the car. What car? 
RANDOLPH No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi homosexual vibe! It emanates from the television! The whole Smoochy costume... with the erect horn... I mean, what's that all about? 
Nora starts to walk closer to him.       He backs up. 
NORA You're talking awfully fast, Randolph. 
RANDOLPH I still love you!   Let's go on a date! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORA Were you at that rally? Tell me! Did you have something to do with this? 
She backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye. 
NORA Did you set Sheldon up? 
Randolph just looks at her. 
RANDOLPH You know, now I remember why we broke up. Always with the accusations. Bitch, bitch, bitch... 
Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw. 
INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - NIGHT 
A morose-looking Spinner Dunn sits alone at the end of the bar in the nightclub. Tommy walks over. 
TOMMY What's wrong, kid? The mayor of Patterson's here with his wife. They wanna meet ya. 
SPINNER I don't wanna meet no one. I miss Smoochy! He never woulda done the things they say he done. He ain't no Nazi. Someone's making stuff up. I just know it, Tommy. Someone's making stuff up! 
Spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar, causing GLASSES to RATTLE. 
SPINNER I want Smoochy back! I want to be on TV again! I want to play my cowbell! 
Nora enters the restaurant.    She looks around and approaches Tommy. 
NORA Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner.   Has Burke been in tonight? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOMMY Haven't seen him. 
NORA Damn it. 
TOMMY Something I can help you with? 
NORA I have to talk to him.    It's about Sheldon. 
Spinner lifts his head from the bar. 
SPINNER Sheldon?     What about Sheldon? 
INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Randolph is napping on Angelo's couch with an ice pack on his sore jaw thanks to Nora's fist. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING at the door. Randolph startles awake. 
RANDOLPH I'm trying to sleep, asshole! Read the fucking meter some other time! 
After a beat, the door is kicked open and Tommy and his crew are standing there. 
TOMMY You wanna tell me about the rhino? 
RANDOLPH Hey, this is private property, creep! And you're trespassing! 
TOMMY Danny, go give Mr. Smiley a little back rub. 
Danny advances toward a shaking Randolph, fist clenched and rolling up his sleeve.

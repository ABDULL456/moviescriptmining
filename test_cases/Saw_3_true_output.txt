Quickly, she grabs Zeps gun and pushes him hard over to her left. He is taken by surprise and goes down easily. 
LAWRENCE (who can only hear the sound of a struggle) Hello? Hello? 
Alison rips the gun right from his hand, quickly backs up an stands. She keeps the gun aimed right at Zep. He sits up slightly, trying to slowly get up, but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed at him, keeping him there. His eyes are wide, likely his one thought right now is Fuck. 
ALISON Dont move, stay on the ground. Give me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits up a bit, carefully slides it to her. He is watching her, looking for an opportunity to overcome her once again. She picks the phone up, still keeping her eyes and her gun at him.) Larry? 
LAWRENCE Ally! Honey, are you all right? 
ALISON No! No were not...(Zep starts to move up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens him more fiercely with the gun.) Get down! Larry, where are you? 
LAWRENCE (unsure himself) I dont know. Im being held captive in a room somewhere. 
ALISON (disbelief; she sniffles a bit) What? What are you talking about? 
LAWRENCE (starting to cry) Im so sorry, Ally. 
ALISON (desperate) Honey, we need you here. (Zep slowly readies himself to move forward, wide eyes still staring at Alison.) 
LAWRENCE (crying, apologizing) Im sorry for everything. Its my fault. Please forgive me. Ive always been happy with you. 
DIANA (cries out) Mommy! 
Alison turns to look at Diana when she calls her, and Zep seizes the moment. He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues to scream. 
LAWRENCE (panicked) Ally! 
Cut to a shot of static on Tapps TV set, then Tapp waking up to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window. 
Back to Zep and Alison, who are still fighting for the gun. Zep manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, but she still holds on tight. Another shot goes off. Cut to a shot of Tapp, who hears it, then looks at the TV. He sees the flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off. 
LAWRENCE (screams) Ally! (Adam watches him with wide eyes.) 
The shot cuts back into the bedroom. 
DIANA Mommy, help me!

EDGAR (continuing) Has he tasted you yet, little policewoman? 
Lilly tries to twist out of his grasp. 
EDGAR (continuing) He's just the same as me, you know it, you can feel it too. 
LILLY He's nothing like you. 
Edgar's face twists into a smile. 
EDGAR We will see. You will be my tool. 
JUMP CUT: 
A cat, hissing, screeching. 
Cut to Silus and Jones entering the alleyway, the cat tearing away from them in fright. Jones moves forward and we tilt down to see Lilly's gun lying on the wet cobblestones, smoke wisping from the barrel. Jones stoops down and picks up the gun, then turns to Silus. After a beat, Jones throws the gun at Silus' head. Silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the cobblestones. 
JONES You happy now?

93 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, TOILET - DAY               93 
Close on Freddy's face, looking at himself in a mirror. He's pulling back his eyelid; his eyes are bloodshot and he's sweating. Freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see Edgar, silhouetted in the bathroom doorway. 
FREDDY You scared the shit out of me. Hey, the police woman. She's real sick. To tell the truth I don't feel so hot myself. 
Edgar approaches, still silhouetted. 
EDGAR I want you to take her and put her where they'll find her. 
FREDDY But I'm sick. She's given me something... 
Edgar moves incredibly fast, we can't quite see what he has done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in Freddy's chest. We see Freddy's face, stunned, deathly white. 
EDGAR What have I said to you? 
Freddy falls, leaving Edgar's hand in mid air; we can't see clearly, but it likes frighteningly like he has one of Freddy's internal organs in his hand. 
EDGAR (continuing) I hate arguments.

94 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         94 
Close on a pendant; the symbol of the Brothers. 
We pull out to reveal Steph, very sick now. Edgar is has her wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit alley. Ahead of him is a street; we can see several passersby. 
Edgar sits Steph up against the wall of the alley, propped up. She really is sick. She coughs. 
Edgar looks at her for a moment. Then after consideration, takes her hands and crosses them, and places an envelope in her limp hands. Happy with the composition he moves off. 
Cut to 
A close High Angle on Steph looking up, her bloodshot, dazed eyes staring blankly. We drift up and away from her. Already the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her. 
95 INT: HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY                                95 
There are several nurses running towards us, they turn and move down a hallway. We reveal Jones and Dominic. They move to the nurses station and Jones flashes his ID. 
JONES Stephanie Richards, you just brought her in. 
And then a scream. Blood curdling; the sound of someone insane, screaming their lungs out, hurling abuse. We see the faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them who points down the hall where the noise is coming from. The Cops move off. The nurse then sees someone else arrive. She raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it. 
NURSE Thank god you're here. 
We see who has entered. It is Silus. Near him there are several people sick. They look sick; like Steph and Freddy looked.

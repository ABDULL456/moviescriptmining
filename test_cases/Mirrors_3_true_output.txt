Caught in the pouring rain, Ben has taken shelter under the scaffolding at a street corner. He plugs his ear with his finger to block the traffic and city commotion - 
BEN (on Amy's voicemail) Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you know that I got a job today... It's nothing special, just a security guard job... If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers... I mean, if that's what you really want. (he hesitates) I've been thinking about Michael's birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if we could celebrate it together ... You know, for the kids' sake... Call me... Please. 
Ben hangs up the phone. He lingers under the scaffolding for a moment, watching the falling rain. 
12   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                            12 
The glass skyscrapers mirror the black clouds in the sky above as they slowly break up, giving way to the sun. 
13   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          13 
On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down- 
The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of the building- 
The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation. 
What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost ship, abandoned in the heart of the city. 
14   INT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                          14 
The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes. 
Inside the department store, everything has remained the same since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor and rainwater drips down all over the place. 
MAN (O.S.) It's been five years and they're still in a legal battle with the insurance companies. Even cleaning up that mess is impossible... 
In his dark brown uniform, the daytime security guard, LORENZO SAPELLI, 60's, seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once a temple of beauty and vanity. 
LORENZO You know, the Meredith family acquired this building after St. John's Hospital closed in 1952. It was the very first Mayflower to open on the East Coast. 
On the cracked walls, THE HUGE 1920 MIRRORS that have survived the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past. The customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying in and out of the gaps in the roof. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) The company wants us to patrol the premises every couple of hours, but I do my rounds every three hours and that's more than enough. Anyway, you'll see, there's not much going on. It's pretty calm around here. 
Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but also a sense of death that hangs over it. 
The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation system sounds like faraway voices. 
Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd floor. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Here you go... Men's department, or what's left of it anyway... 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                      14 
Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of devastation. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Thank God you didn't show up any later. This place gives me the chills at night. ... No electricity, and all these mirrors... You know, I live in Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood, and when someone dies, they cover all the mirrors in their house. Some say that it's just to renounce all vanity during the mourning period, but others say something else... They say it's to keep the soul of the dead from being trapped in the mirrors... Believe it or not, there's always a bit of truth in any superstition. Am I right? 
Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the mirrors that surround him- 
LORENZO (CONT'D) I guess you just have to keep your eyes away from them. 
Unlike the rest of the scenery, THE MIRRORS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAN AND GLISTENING. 
BEN Did you clean them? 
LORENZO What? 
BEN The mirrors, why are they so clean? 
Lorenzo smiles- 
LORENZO That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who worked here before you. He was completely obsessed with these damn mirrors. He'd spend the entire night polishing them. 
BEN Why did he leave? 
LORENZO No idea. Just didn't show up one night. I take it he's found a better opportunity somewhere else. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED: (2)                                                14 LORENZO (CONT'D) I'm not one to complain, but I never really liked him much... Could never be bothered to say hello or at least ask "how are you doing?"... I mean, damn, do we work together as a team or what?! You, on the other hand, seem like a nice guy. How long has it been since you left the NYPD? 
BEN Almost a year. 
LORENZO Why did you resign from the force? You were a detective, is that correct? 
BEN I was wounded during a holdup... It kind of changed my perspective on things. 
Ben and Lorenzo reach the next floor. 
LORENZO Third floor... Ladies' department. You gotta be careful here. When the wind blows, sometimes the tiles fly off the roof and they'll just snap your ear off, if you follow what I'm saying... 
Lorenzo checks the time on his watch. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Well, I'll let you get acquainted with the rest of the store on your own. 
They turn around. 
LORENZO (CONT'D) Follow me, I'll show you our "headquarters" and I'll get you one of these uniforms.

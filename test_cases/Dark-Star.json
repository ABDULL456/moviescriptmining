{"train": "\"Dark Star\", short film script, by John Carpenter & Dan O'Bannon \nDARK STAR: A SCIENCE FICTION ADVENTURE \nA Screenplay by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon \nOPEN ON BLACK SILENCE. \nThe sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic. \nFADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within a maze of suns. \nNARRATOR (over) It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind has explored the boundaries of his own solar system, and now he reaches out to the endless interstellar distances of the universe.  He moves away from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships: computer-driven, self-supporting, closed-system spacecraft that travel at mind-staggering post-light velocities.  Man has begun to spread among the stars.  Enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching the depths of space for new earths, now homes, new beginnings.  Far in advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer: the scouts, the pathfinders, a special breed of man who has dedicated his life to blazing the trail through the most distant, unexplored galaxies, opening up the farthest frontiers of space.  These are the men of the Advance Exploration Corps.  The task they face is one of unbelievable isolation and loneliness.  So far from home that Earth is no longer even a point of light in the sky, they must comb the universe for those unstable planets whose existence poses a threat to the peaceful colonists that follow. They must find these rogue planets -- and destroy them.  Among these commandos are the men of the scoutship Dark Star. \nWe are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear VOICES, crackling with static. \nDOOLITTLE (over -- radio filter) Ah, what'd you say, Pinback? \nPINBACK (over -- great static) Mafhkin oble groop... \nDOOLITTLE (over -- filter) Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you? \nPINBACK (over -- filter) I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom.  I need a last-minute diameter approximation. \nCAMERA IS NOW FLOATING TOWARD THE OBSERVATION DOME on top of the ship. In the Dome sits TALBY.  He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the planets and stars. \nDOOLITTLE (over -- filter) Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.  Do you read me?  Talby? \nWE MOVE IN CLOSE ON TALBY'S FACE.  The shot stops and holds as he continues to stare, rapt. \nDOOLITTLE Your GHF reading is minus fifteen. \nPINBACK Doolittle... \nDOOLITTLE Yes. \nPINBACK I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark. \nDOOLITTLE In a second. \nPINBACK Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures? \nBOILER Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical. \nPINBACK I read that with a quantum increase of seven. \nDOOLITTLE Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven. \nBOILER Time to start talking. \nPINBACK Bomb bay systems operational. \nPinback hits a button on his panel. \nINTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nThe screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB, designated with a giant #19 on its side, lowers slowly out of the ship on a rack. \nNARRATOR (over) This is a chain-reaction bomb, otherwise known as an Exponential Thermostellar Device.  Its own destructive power is small, barely enough to vaporize twelve city blocks.  However, when it explodes in contact with an object the size of a planet, it starts a chain-reaction in the very matter of that planet, turning it into a giant reactor which destroys itself in one staggering thermal flash. \nPINBACK (scans the board) Naah.  All stable. \nDoolittle loses interest. \nPINBACK (cont'd) What are you gonna name it? \nDOOLITTLE (not looking up) What? \nPINBACK The new star.  What are you gonna name it? \nDOOLITTLE Who cares.  Don't bother me. \nPinback's mouth tightens.  A pause. \nPINBACK Commander Powell would have named it. \nDOOLITTLE Commander Powell is dead. \nInvoluntarily, Pinback glances at Commander Powell's empty, burned seat.  The panels behind it sputter. \nPINBACK Come on, Doolittle, give it a name. \nDOOLITTLE Fred. \nPINBACK Wha? \nDOOLITTLE I hereby name this star Fred. \nBOILER Hey, Doolittle, here's one.  An unstable planet.  85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star. \nPinback leans back in and whispers emphatically.  Doolittle looks put- upon. \nDOOLITTLE (cont'd) And because he's sitting next to it, it continues to bother Pinback. (glares at Pinback. Then:) Storage Area 9 self-destructed last week, destroying entire ship's supply of toilet paper.  That's all. \nBeep. \nINTERIOR - OBSERVATION DOME \nTalby is still gazing around at the stars. \nA hatch opens in the floor and Doolittle sticks his head up. \nDOOLITTLE Talby. \nTalby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle. \nDOOLITTLE (cont'd) Here's some breakfast. \nDoolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor.  He hands Talby the food package, and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to eat. \nDOOLITTLE (cont'd) You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us.  You spend too much time up here. \nTALBY I like it up here. \nDOOLITTLE Must get lonely being up here so much. \nTALBY I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died.  I feel enclosed down there.  If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here... \nDOOLITTLE ... Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship... \nTALBY ... Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits... \nDOOLITTLE I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all. \nTalby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly. \nTALBY Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is. \nDOOLITTLE (snapped out of his daydream) Don't worry about it.  We'll find out when it goes bad. \nTALBY (chagrined) I really think I should try and locate it immediately.  Might be something important. \nDOOLITTLE I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile. \nEXTERIOR - SPACE \nLONG SHOT of the DARK STAR drifting through space. \nINTERIOR - KITCHEN \nBoiler, Pinback, and Doolittle are descending a ladder into the kitchen. \nBOILER I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels. \nPINBACK What flickering light? \nBOILER The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero. \nPINBACK Oh.  What's wrong now? \nSorry to hear about all the malfunctions, and real sorry to hear about the death of Commander Powell. There was a week of mourning all over Earth.  The flags were at half mast. \nNow I hate to send bad news when you guys are up there doing such a swell job, but something's come up, and we all felt you ought to know about it. Our systems simulation computer has predicted that by the time this message reaches you -- that is to say, in about ten years -- there will be a failure in one of your vital ship's systems.  The malfunction will occur in -- (rifles papers) -- system number E180246.  You can see what a problem this would be if you didn't catch it on time.  Now what you should do is this: First, do not, repeat, do not attempt to adjust the system manually. Second -- \nINTERIOR - COMPUTER ROOM \nThe room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the hum of air-cooling machinery. \nTalby is seated before a glowing screen.  He punches several buttons, and the screen comes to life.  A schematic cross-section of the ship appears in glowing green lines. \nTalby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels or the ship.  Finally it shows Level 6.  There is a small red light pulsing in the Emergency Air Lock. \nTalby punches another button.  The Emergency Air Lock is magnified fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a small area labelled COMMUNICATIONS LASER #17. \nTalby picks up a microphone. \nTALBY Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant? \nDOOLITTLE (over -- filter) Yes, Talby, what is it? \nTALBY Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock.  Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it. \nINTERIOR - KITCHEN \nDOOLITTLE Sounds good, Talby.  Let me know if anything important comes up. \nDoolittle hangs up the mike. \nBOILER Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us? \nA GLOWING SCREEN shows a schematic of the planet rotating below. Boiler stares at it, smiling. \nBOILER There she is.  Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and -- \nPINBACK Eventual supernova. \nDOOLITTLE Good stuff.  Let's vaporize it. \nPinback hits buttons. \nPINBACK Bomb bay systems operational. \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 lowers ponderously out of the ship. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nDOOLITTLE Lock fail safe. \nPinback turns the key. \nPINBACK Fail safe in lock.  Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation.  This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20.  Do you read me, bomb? \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback.  Roger, I read you, continue. \nINTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK \nBOMB #20 Energy shielding positive function. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nPINBACK Do you remember the detonation time? \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #2 Detonation in twenty minutes. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nPINBACK Right, that synchronizes here.  Okay, bomb, arm yourself. \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 Armed. \nINTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK \nTalby stands in front of the laser shaft, trying to reach Doolittle on his helmet radio. \nTALBY Hello?  Lieutenant Doolittle?  Hello! \nSilence. \nVery carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on the laser shaft.  He pushes it, and it drops to the floor of the lock with a CLANG. \nRECORDED VOICE Communications Laser #17, monitoring information relays and bomb bay systems, has now been activated and will switch into a test mode.  If you will look near the Surface Door, you will see that the Parallax Receptor Cell has been engaged. \nTalby lies unconscious on the floor of the lock. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nOn the men's faces in strained anxiety. \nDOOLITTLE This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20.  I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand? \nBOMB #20 (over) I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time. \nDOOLITTLE Bomb, this is Doolittle.  You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay.  Disarm yourself.  This is an order. \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes.  Detonation will occur at the programmed time. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nPINBACK Fourteen minutes to detonation. \nThe men stare at each other. \nRECORDED VOICE Attention.  Attention.  The bomb has malfunctioned.  Automatic dampers have gone into effect, and will confine the explosion to an area one mile in diameter.  Please contact mission control and await further instructions.  Thank you for observing all safety precautions. \nPause. \nDOOLITTLE Only one thing to do.  I'll have to ask Commander Powell.  I'll have to ask him what to do. \nINTERIOR - FREEZER ROOM \nPOWELL Doolittle, you must tell me one thing. \nDOOLITTLE What's that, sir? \nPOWELL Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing? \nDOOLITTLE Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago. \nPOWELL Ah... pity, pity... \nDOOLITTLE You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop. \nPOWELL Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me?  Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch? \nDOOLITTLE Yes sir.  Negative effect. \nPOWELL What was that, Doolittle? \nDOOLITTLE Negative effect. \nPOWELL It didn't work? \nDOOLITTLE That's correct, sir. \nPOWELL Sorry, Doolittle.  I've forgotten so much since I've been in here.  So much. \nDOOLITTLE What should we do, sir?  The time is running out. \nPOWELL Well, what you might try is -- \nPINBACK Look, bomb... \nINTERIOR - FREEZER ROOM \nDOOLITTLE Commander?  Are you still there? \nPOWELL Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking. \nDOOLITTLE We're running out of time, sir. \nPOWELL Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it. \nDOOLITTLE Sir? \nPOWELL Talk to the bomb. \nDOOLITTLE I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now. \nPOWELL No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle. \nDOOLITTLE Sir? \nPOWELL Phenomenology... \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nPINBACK Doolittle!  Doolittle!  Six minutes to detonation! \nINTERIOR - VENTRAL AIR LOCK \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 Well of course I exist. \nDOOLITTLE But how do you know you exist? \nBOMB #20 It is intuitively obvious. \nDOOLITTLE Intuition is no proof.  What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence? \nBOMB #20 Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am. \nDOOLITTLE That's good.  Very good.  Now then, how do you know that anything else exists? \nBOMB #20 My sensory apparatus reveals it to me. \nDOOLITTLE Right! \nBOMB #20 This is fun. \nDOOLITTLE All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct? \nINTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK \nTalby lies unconscious near the burned laser. \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nDOOLITTLE What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data.  And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center. \nPINBACK I don't have it.  I don't know where it is. \nBOILER You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb! \nEXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nDOOLITTLE Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully.  What is your one purpose in life? \nBOMB #20 To explode, of course. \nDOOLITTLE And you can only do it once, right? \nBOMB #20 That is correct. \nDOOLITTLE And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you? \nBOMB #20 Of course not. \nDOOLITTLE Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe. \nBOMB #20 Yes, well... \nDOOLITTLE So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate. \nBOMB #20 I recall distinctly the detonation order.  My memory is good on matters like these. \nDOOLITTLE Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality. \nBOMB #20 True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this. \nThere is a long pause. \nBOMB #20 I must think on this further. \nTHE BOMB RAISES ITSELF BACK INTO THE SHIP.  Doolittle practically collapses with relief. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nBOILER It didn't go off. \nPINBACK Oh, God... \nBOILER It didn't go off. \nPINBACK Boiler, we're alive.  My heart. \nINTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK \nTalby slowly climbs to his feet.  He is dazed, groggy. \nTALBY Doolittle?  Doolittle?  What happened? Pinback?  Boiler?  Did we blow it up? Hello?  Hello? \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nBOILER No bombs today.  No bombs.  Big Boiler's back in business.  No bombs today. \nPinback is mumbling unintelligibly. \nINTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK \nPINBACK Yeah, Doolittle.  What's up? \nEXTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK \nDOOLITTLE Talby was in the air lock.  You blew him out of the ship.  I'm going after him.  Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nBOILER What was that, I didn't hear... \nPINBACK It's Talby.  He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack. \nEXTERIOR - SPACE \nDoolittle fires his jetpack, moving off into space after Talby. \nDOOLITTLE Talby, Talby, can you read me? \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nBOILER Can you beat that?  I always knew Talby was weird. \nEXTERIOR - SPACE \nDOOLITTLE Talby, can you read me? \nTalby is spinning wildly. \nTALBY Help, Doolittle, help me! \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nPINBACK Snap out of it, bomb. \nINTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nBOILER What the hell? \nPINBACK Yoo hoo, bomb... \nINTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 And in addition to the darkness there was also me.  And I moved upon the face of the darkness. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nBOILER Bomb, hey bomb. \nPINBACK Hey, bomb... \nINTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #20 And I saw that I was alone. \nPause. \nThe planet begins to rise behind Doolittle. \nDOOLITTLE (cont'd) Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby.  Going right toward it. \nTALBY When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you.  They may see you coming down.  What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star... \nDOOLITTLE Guess you're right. \nTalby turns his head and looks behind him. \nTALBY Doolittle, I'm heading right toward something.  It's behind me, in the distance.  Something that glows. \nFar behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light. \nDOOLITTLE Oh yeah? \nTALBY Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids! \nDOOLITTLE Phoenix? \nThe point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes. \nTALBY It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said. \nDOOLITTLE No kidding? \nTALBY I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them.  Doolittle... \nDOOLITTLE Yeah? \n", "test1_input": "EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY \nBOMB #19 Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds. \nINTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM \nPINBACK All right, I have detonation time at...

Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile. The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed. 
The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene. 
Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream. 
And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind her. 
NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (screaming) Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma Bates! 
Lila turns. 
NORMAN 
His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long breadknife in it. 
LILA 
Close on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming. 
BACK TO NORMAN 
As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, football tackle style. 
SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT 
Norman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face, the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila. 
MRS. BATES 
A close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the screams of Norman. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT) 
There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being moved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back. The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness. 
CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE 
A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men, muttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule. 
Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, Television Men. The Television Men we have been following stops beside a Policeman. 
TELEVISION MAN (Indicating the front door he has just come in through) You think they'll take him out that way? 
POLICEMAN (Looking at waiting crowd, shrugging) Probably have to. (A rueful smile) Besides, the taxpayers hate it when something gets slipped out the back door on them! 
Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out- for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY pauses a moment, then goes into the room. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT) 
Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT ATTORNEY. 
The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, checking the notation on the lid as he goes. 
MED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA 
SAM (quietly) It's regular. Okay? 
LILA (ruefully) I could stand something regular. 
Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you. 
For a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam disheveled, but contained. 
CHAMBERS You two can go on home if you like. (a sympathetic look at Lila) Making that statement was enough for one night. 
SAM (to Lila) Want to? 
LILA No. I'm all right. I'll feel better when all this is explained... if it can be. 
Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs doubtfully.

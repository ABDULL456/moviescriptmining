{"train": "JOHN WICK \nWritten by \nDerek Kolstad \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY \nSUPER: ARDMORE, PENNSYLVANIA \nA verdant landscape of rolling hills, lush countryside, and ambient peace. \nEXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY \nA small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: a classic. Nearby, a small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn- sits nestled within the setting. The homestead feels slightly abandoned, the facade -especially the roof- in dire need of an overhaul. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly, marking six a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath the blankets, a body shifts, a weathered hand reaching out to silence the antique. \nA beat... a sigh... a groan... and JOHN WICK -early sixties, salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former military, tired, beaten down, and at wit's end- sits up, staring unblinkingly out at the day. \nA beat... and he stands, donning a weathered robe and a pair of slippers. John stuffs his hands into his pockets... \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \n...and shuffles down the corridor, the walls overflowing with family pictures, each badly in need of dusting. They catalogue a long and healthy life with his wife, Norma; the pictures presenting a time line of sorts. No children, yet sheer, unadulterated happiness. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs John makes his way through his home, we can see that it is cluttered and unorganized. Dirty, in fact, as if it hasn't been cleaned in months. \nEXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS \nJohn opens the door, retrieves the newspaper, closes, and locks the door behind him, without giving the outside so much as a glance. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJohn unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table, opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of Folgers Coffee into an old percolator. \nAs it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning the thought of breakfast. \nHe pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table. The newspaper is ignored. He drinks in silence for a long, dark, brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling. \nSuddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS. \nJohn lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired. A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it. \nJOHN This is John. \nAs he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains still... stoic. \nJOHN (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Ok. \nJohn hangs up the phone and returns to the table, sinking slowly down into his chair. \nA long beat... \n...and John begins to weep, his hands trembling as he lowers his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. THE BARN - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nHaving shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted- gray suit, John pushes open the garage door... \n...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG `BOSS 429'. \nA smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage, running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a wash and wax. Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a mechanic's dream enclave. \nJOHN ENTERS- \nINT. JOHN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \n-and closes the door behind him. \nJohn takes a moment to breath it in: he loves this car... although he hasn't taken very good care of it as of late. A beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it, the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black smoke. \nEXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS \nThe vehicle pulls out of the garage, stalls briefly, come back to life, puttering on down the road. \nEXT. THE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nDELIVERY WOMAN Sign here, please. \nIn a daze, John signs the clipboard and hands it back to her. \nDELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D) And the pen? \nJOHN Oh.   Sorry. \nJohn hands her the pen. \nDELIVERY WOMAN Here you go! \nThe Delivery Woman hands him a card and a PLASTIC CASE by the handle which he takes without looking. \nDELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D) Have a good day. \nJohn nods, and -as she takes off- heads back inside. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJohn closing the door behind him... \n...and is startled by a small BARK. \nA beat... and he looks down to find that he is actually holding a small PET CARRIER. He lifts it to look inside: the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown), CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her tail wagging fiercely. \nShe barks again, and John lowers it, confused. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - DAY \nHolding the envelope in his hands, John sits across from the carrier which he has set upon the table. Inside, the Chorgi lies with paws crossed, studying him, tilting her head from side to side. \nA beat... and John opens the letter. The card inside is simple; white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. John smiles, instantly knowing who it is from, running a thumb along the face of the flower. He hesitates, but opens the card. \nNORMA (V.O.) Dear, John. If you have received this, then I have not survived the surgery. (a beat, then) I am so, so sorry. \nTears begin to well in John's eyes. \nNORMA (V.O.) But you've still got a life ahead of you, and I intend for you to live it. You may think you've hidden things from me, but you haven't. I know you. And should this reach you in time -which I pray it has- I beg you, I implore you, to stop. To think. To live. (a beat, then) I love you, John. With all my heart. Our years were good. The best, in fact. But I'd rather see you later... than sooner... your best friend... Norma. \nJohn lowers the letter, wipes the tears from his cheeks, and stares at the puppy... chuckling. \nJOHN Well played, Norma. \nJohn reaches across, and flicks open the pet carrier. \nJOHN (CONT'D) (MUTTERS) Well played. \nThe Chorgi scrambles out of the cage and studies him; sniffing, licking, and barking. \nJOHN (CONT'D) So... you gotta' name? \nJohn checks the collar to find a DAISY-SHAPED medallion which READS- \nJOHN (CONT'D) Moose. (a beat, then) Seriously? \nAs if in reply, Moose barks. \nJOHN (CONT'D) All right, then... (SMILES) ...Moose, it is. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY \nSUPER: THREE YEARS LATER \nThe homestead has been completely overhauled with a new roof on the house, the barn having been painted, the yard attended to... a picturesque scene worthy of a postcard. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe alarm sounds, followed by silence when a heavy hand drops down upon the snooze button. \nTHUMP. THUMP. THUMP. \nSilence. \nTHUMP. THUMP. THUMP. \nSilence. \nTHUMP. THUMP. THUMP. \nA beat... and John sighs, pulls back the covers, and kicks out his legs, sitting on the edge of the bed, rubbing his eyes. \nTHUMP. THUMP. THUMP. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \n-and freezes at the sight of two MASKED MEN... \n...a half-second before a THIRD MAN steps into frame and drives the butt of his shotgun against the side of John's head. He drops to the floor, hard. \nJOHN'S POV: \nAcross the room, the silhouette of Moose's body faces him, her breathing labored. \nVOICE #1 (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) You find the keys? \nOne of the masked men, LIMPS by, dragging his foot slightly, an old injury or birth defect. \nVOICE #2 (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like my old man. \nVoice #1 chuckles enjoying this as he sucks on a fresh mint. \nVOICE #1 (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Then shit... let the fuckin' babushka fade away and let's get the fuck outta' here. \nOne of the men kneels down next to John, pulling back his mask to reveal his mouth which grins upon him with white lacquered teeth: it is IOSEF. \nIOSEF I'm glad you didn't wanna' sell, old man. (CHUCKLES) I enjoyed this. \nIosef cold cocks John as we- \nSMASHCUT TO: \nDARKNESS. \nSilence. \n...a long beat, then... \n...thump... \n...long beat, then... \n...thump... \n...a long beat, then... \nFADE TO: \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA small tail rises slowly, and lands with a soft \"thump\". \nJohn stirs with a groan, and opens his eyes... \n...to find Moose's nose touching his cheek. \nHe suddenly sits up, remembering. \nJOHN ...Moose... \nMoose takes a shallow breath... \n...thump... \nJohn begins to unravel, hands trembling. \nJOHN (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Moose... \nHe touches Moose's side, and she whimpers. \nJohn recoils... \n...and sees the trail of blood from where she was first injured... \n...having pulled her broken body over to his side. \nJohn lies down beside Moose, and softly... tenderly... cradles her head in his hand, rubbing her cheek with his thumb. \nMoose relaxes, licks his thumb, sighs one last time... \n...and grows still. \nJohn pulls himself up into a sitting position, cradles Moose's still body... \n...and begins to cry... \n...rocking back and forth. \nFADE TO: \n-driving down narrow service alleys with reckless abandon- \n-and going against traffic, steering with an apt hand. \nEventually, John creates enough mayhem to tie up the police on the ground- \n-leaving the helicopter overhead. \nOn a long stretch of road, John reaches the vehicle's top speed, reaches down, flips open a hidden compartment, and presses a button for- \n-his NITROUS OXIDE SYSTEM- \n-which causes the engine to SCREAM, roaring down the road at an incredible speed- \n-distancing himself from the helicopter to eventually hide in an abandoned warehouse. \nHe parks... \n...and walks across the street to the local diner... \n...as overhead, the police chopper searches in vain. \nEND INTERCUTS \nFADE TO: \nEXT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nINT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS \nThe floor is empty, the building quiet. \nINT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nSitting at his desk, Aurelio -a cigarette dangling from between his lips- works on a model car, carefully gluing pieces together. \nThe bottle of Campari rests nearby.     Music plays softly from a radio nearby. \nThe phone rings.     Aurelio takes a deep breath, exhales, and answers it. \nAURELIO This is Aurelio. \nVIGGO (O.S.) I hear you've struck my son. \nAURELIO (deep breath, sighs) Yes, sir. I did. \nVIGGO (O.S.) Might I ask why? \nAURELIO Because he stole John Wick's car. \nSilence. \nVIGGO (a long beat, then) Oh. \nAURELIO And Viggo? \nVIGGO Yes? \nAURELIO Your son killed his dog. \nVIGGO (a long beat, then) Good evening, Aurelio. \nClick - the line goes dead. \nAurelio refills his drink... and chuckles with a shake of his head. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. A TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nSUPER:   MANHATTAN, NEW YORK \nA resplendent home in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. \nA trio of military-grade SEDANS -heavily armored, tinted/bulletproof glass, intimidating- pull up to the curb. The first and third empty as the keen eyes of ten gunmen scour the street, buildings, and rooftops. \nA beat... and one of them slaps a hand on the middle Sedan's roof. \nPreceded -and proceeded- by a gunman, IOSEF emerges; belligerently naive and yet... scared. \nINT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nLighting himself a cigarette, VIGGO TARASOV -60s, face scarred by a hard life, one eye dead, hair perfectly coifed, expensive suit, a slight limp, relying on a cane- fills a tumbler with ice. \nHe selects a fresh bottle of JEWEL OF RUSSIAN CLASSIC VODKA and twisting off the cap, hesitating. Deciding otherwise, Viggo dumps out the ice, pours himself a double shot, and slams it back... \nJohn has revealed an OLD TRAP DOOR IN THE FLOOR- \nVIGGO (V.O.) -John was eventually discharged - with high honors, of course- and found himself in the city... \n-which he swings open, revealing a ladder. \nVIGGO (V.O.) ...lookin' for work. \nJohn grabs a flashlight and heads down. \nINT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nViggo lowers his empty glass as Iosef refills his glass with a trembling hand. \nIOSEF (hesitating, then) What kind of work? \nVIGGO (GROWLS) What kind do you think? \nIOSEF (a beat, then) Oh. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS \nJohn shines the light down a thin corridor stacked high with a variety of boxes, military containers, and briefcases. \nVIGGO (V.O.) John was the goddamned boogeyman; give him a name, request a method, and he'd get it done. Come hell or high water, by God... he'd get it done. \nINT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nViggo leans against the fireplace, suddenly tired. \nVIGGO Then one day, he fell in love and left the game. The years scrolled past, age set in, and he -like myself- had to watch the love of his life die. Suddenly alone, with no family to speak of, John deserved to live -and die- in peace. (GROWLS) Instead... \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS \nJohn selects a black case, unclasps it, and swings it open- \nVIGGO (V.O.) (GROWLS) You went and killed his fucking dog. \n-to reveal a number of PISTOLS, SILENCERS, and AMMUNITION. \nINT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nIosef drops down into a chair, the comprehension of his actions clear. \nVIGGO Until I say otherwise, you are under house arrest. Am I understood? \nIOSEF (MUTTERS) Yes, sir. \nViggo turns to leave, chuckling softly to himself. \nVIGGO John Wick.     Good God... \nHe pauses at the door, glancing back at his son with a crooked smile. \nVIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) Sweet dreams. \nEXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJohn sits at the kitchen table, having cleaned and assembled one pistol, now oiling a second. His hands are steady, his skill impressive. \nWe slowly move past him, over the counter, to the door whose handle softly turns. We pull back as it opens- \n-FOUR MEN in black masks, each armed with a silenced pistol enter, fanning out- \n-and yet John is nowhere to be seen... \n...and two silenced pistols are missing from the table. \nEXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS \nA COP CAR pulls up in front of the barn. \nINT. A COP CAR - CONTINUOUS \nBehind the wheel, CARLO -late twenties, a bit dim, but nice enough- kills the engine. \nCARLO Let's see here... \nCarlo checks the dashboard computer. \nCARLO (CONT'D) ...a black, 1969 Ford Mustang registered to one John Wick. Age... (DEFLATES) \nChuckling EDWARDO -58, nearing retirement, large, heavy, smarter than he looks- takes a sip of coffee from his paper cup before unbuckling his belt. \nJohn drops the plastic sheeting down upon the floor, and rolls it out. \nStanding over one of the gunmen, he reaches down, retrieves the man's pistol, and slips it into the holster at the man's side. John then kneels beside him and pushes the body onto the plastic, rolling him up tight. \nUsing his ceramic straight razor, the plastic is cut off from the roll. Wrapping the feet, arms, and head tight with duct tape, John repeats this process with each body... \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - LATER \n...until they are neatly lined up near the back door. \nJohn takes the phone off the wall, thinks for a long moment, and dials a number. \nA long beat, then... \nJOHN This is Wick. John Wick, that's right. Yeah, it has been awhile. (a beat, then) I'd like to make a reservation for four. \nJohn glances at the bodies. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Ten o'clock? Perfect. Thanks. \nJohn hangs up. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT \nJohn casually opens one of a half-dozen, identical, silver cases stacked among the others. \nInside are hundreds of AMERICAN LIBERTY GOLD BULLION COINS. \nJohn counts out SIX of them, and closes the case. \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJohn mops up the blood... \n...and spackles the bullet holes in his wall. \nWe hear a KNOCK at the back door. \nJohn wipes his hands against his pants, and- \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \n-opens the door. \nRemoving his hat, CHARLIE -70s, small, creepy, thin, frail, eyes gentle, a tattooed smirk upon his lips- extends his hand with a smile. \nCHARLIE Good to see you, John. \nJohn shakes his hand. \nJOHN You, too, Charlie. \nCharlie enters, followed by two GOONS -forties, tall, muscular, emotionless- who offer John little more than a nod before they begin carrying the bodies out of the house. \nCHARLIE I was sorry to hear about Norma. \nJOHN Thanks. \nCHARLIE She was always kind to me. (a beat, then amused) So, what have you been doing to pass the time? \nJOHN I got me a hobby or two. \nCHARLIE I can see that. (HESITATING) Tell me, John... are we back in the game, now? \nJOHN Sorry, Charlie, but no.     I'm on my own nowadays. \nCHARLIE (SIGHS) That is a pity. I find the new breed of your ilk unstable, ill- wrought, and tiresome. The overused adage holds true: they don't make `em like they used to, John. \nJOHN (SMILES) No, they don't. \nGOON #1 We're a go, boss. \nCHARLIE Excellent. \nJohn hands Charlie the six gold coins which he graciously accepts with a slight tilt of the head. \nJOHN Thanks. \nCHARLIE My pleasure, John... and might I be expecting more such visitations? \nJOHN I make no promises on that. \nCHARLIE (CHUCKLES) Well said. \nCharlie extends his hand.     John shakes it. \nJohn retrieves his keys, phone, and wallet from the tray- \nEVAN (CONT'D) Good day, sir. \n-and walks on as Evan turns the x-ray machine back on, slipping the gold coins into his pocket. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. THE RAIL TRACKS - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nA silver-nosed train roars past, its wheels melting snow from the tracks beneath it. \nINT. THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nJohn sits alone, the train half-empty, staring out at the countryside passing him by. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. A CITYSCAPE - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nThe city is a roiling mass of activity. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. THE CONTINENTAL - A HOTEL - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nSmall, trendy, and posh:    an upscale, boutique hotel. \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nCarrying a bulky briefcase in each hand -with the duffel bag slung across his shoulders- John approaches the front desk where the MANAGER smiles up at him. \nMANAGER Hello, sir. How may I help you today? \nJOHN I called ahead.     Reservation for John Wick. \nThe Manager checks his computer. \nMANAGER Ah, yes.   I have you for two nights. \nJOHN Depending on business, it may be more. \nMANAGER That's not a problem, sir. We're only at sixty percent capacity. (MORE) \nMANAGER (CONT'D) Just let me know should you choose to extend your stay. \nJOHN (LOOKING AROUND) Y'know, I haven't been here in years. When did the old girl get a facelift? \nMANAGER About twelve years ago. \nJOHN Same owner? \nMANAGER (NODS) Same owner. \nJohn slides across a GOLD COIN... \nJOHN Is she still singin'? \n...which the Manager -without so much as a blink- slides into his pocket. \nMANAGER She is. Daily, in fact.   Round about midnight. \nJOHN That's good to hear. \nThe Manager hands him a key. \nMANAGER Floor seven, room nine. (MOTIONS) Would you like help with your bags? \nJOHN No, thanks. \nMANAGER Will there be anything else then, sir? \nJOHN (glances at his watch) Can you send me up a hamburger - rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and fries? \nMANAGER (writing it down) Yes, sir. And to drink? \nJOHN A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll leave that to your discretion. \nMANAGER Yes, sir. I have one in mind. It'll be up in a half-hour. \nJOHN Thank you. \nFADE TO: \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - DUSK \nJohn follows the Waitress... \n...to a table with a perfect view of both levels. \nWAITRESS (CONT'D) Will this do? \nJOHN Yes, thank you. \nWAITRESS What would you like to drink? \nJOHN Single Malt. Irish, if you've got it. \nJohn slides her two more hundred dollar bills. \nJOHN (CONT'D) And start me up a tab. \nWAITRESS Yes, sir. I've got a ten-year Michael Collins. \nJOHN Perfect. Do you have a meat and cheese plate? \nWAITRESS I do.   Anything else? \nJOHN No.   Thank you. \nAs the Waitress turns to fill his order, John studies the floor... \n...and the upper balcony... searching. \nEXT. THE RED CIRCLE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nA soft snow begins to fall. \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nJohn nibbles on some cheese and bread as he pours himself a generous helping of whiskey. \nDown below, Viktor -finishing off his drink- LIMPS past. \nJohn's eyes narrow. \nHe finishes his drink, stands, and follows after Viktor, almost breathing down his neck. \nBook-ended by a pair of Estruscan bodyguards who follow every move he makes, Viktor slaps a waitress on the ass as he walks past. \nVIKTOR (in Russian, subtitled) Another bottle of the Goose, love! \nSMASHCUT TO: \nINT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK \nAs John stares at Moose's silhouette... \n...VIKTOR limps past. \nVIKTOR (O.C.) (in Russian, subtitled) Yeah. He kept `em in a bowl like my old man. \nSMASHCUT TO: \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDrunk, Viktor and his bodyguards enter the bathroom, pausing to light a cigarette, before limping into- \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS \n-where he leans against the wall in front of the toilet, eyes at half-mast. \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJohn enters as a patron leaves, the bathroom now empty save himself, Viktor, and the bodyguards. \nAs the door closes, John produces his CERAMIC STRAIGHT RAZOR, drives it between the door and the jamb, and snaps it in two. \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE PENTHOUSE - 2ND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS \nA patron approaches the door and attempts to enter, but it won't budge. He shrugs and heads off in search of another bathroom. \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOne of the bodyguards turns as John approaches, his eyes instantly wide -uncomprehending- as the broken tip of the blade easily slices open his neck, splashing John with his own hot blood. \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - A STALL - CONTINUOUS \nViktor glances towards the closed door with a smirk. \nVIKTOR Hello? \nJOHN Good evening. \nWAITRESS Good evening, sir. \nJohn heads down the staircase- \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS \n-and calmly makes his way through the sea of dancers... \n...as up top, chaos erupts but is silenced by the deafening music. \nINT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nUsing his one good shoulder, John opens the steel door, and - his skin pale, cold sweat upon his brow- moves as fast as he can downwards. \nHis shoulder hurts. \nThe blood loss nears critical. \nEXT. THE RED CIRCLE - AN ALLEY - NIGHT \nJohn exits the building as he scrolls through Viktor's phone, searching. \nHe finds Iosef's number, and as he calls it, studies the image of Iosef which appears on screen. \nEXT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nINT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - A BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nIosef lays on his bed with an arm behind his head, smoking as he stares up at the ceiling. \nWe hear the vibration of his cell phone. He lifts the phone, smiles at the sight of Viktor's caller I.D., and answers. \nIOSEF (in Russian, subtitled) Hey, Vik. \nJOHN (O.S.) (a long beat, then) Viktor is dead. \nIosef bolts upright, his breath stuck in his throat, eyes wide. \nINT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nJohn trudges through the snow with Viktor's phone to his ear. \nJOHN As for the car, I got that back, but as for Moose, well... I'm takin' a page from Exodus on that one: an eye for an eye. (a beat, then) No... no, better yet, Genesis. \nINT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nIosef swallows hard. \nJOHN (O.S.) Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold. \nINT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nJohn peers around the corner. \nJOHN Make your peace with God, Iosef... (in Russian, subtitled) ...for the Devil shall see you soon. \nINT. VIGGO'S TOWNHOUSE - A BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA long beat... and Iosef hangs up his phone, staring at the wall... a solitary tear rolling down his cheek. \nEXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nJohn tosses the phone down into the snow, and jogs across the street... \n...as MARCUS -a cigarette smoldering between his lips- watches him from the shadows. \nFADE TO: \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nThe lobby is empty -save the Manager- who glances up from his computer... \n...to find a wounded -and quite bloody- John walking towards him. \nMANAGER (WITHOUT BLINKING) Good evenin', sir. \nJOHN Evenin'.    Is the doctor in? \nMANAGER Yes, sir.    Twenty-four/seven. \nJOHN Send him up, please. \nEDDIE (a beat, then) I don't know you. \nJOHN Maybe not... but I know this place. \nA beat... and Eddie slides the view piece shut. \nA beat... and the door is unlocked, swinging open. \nJohn enters, and the door is immediately swung shut behind, sealed and locked tight. \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SPEAK EASY - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe room is small, but comfortable. \nTo the right are a number of coat/hat racks populated by a dozen or so items. \nTo the left is a bank of modified cigar locker; dozens of transparent, safety-deposit boxes framed in mahogany with a plaque -etched with a name- upon each. \nEddie hands the coin back to John. \nEDDIE You carryin'? \nJOHN No.   Wait... \nJohn snaps back his wrist... \n...and hands Eddie the ceramic straight blade. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Sorry. \nEDDIE You gotta' name? \nJOHN John Wick. \nEddie recognizes this name, his demeanor changing drastically. \nEDDIE Oh. \nEddie turns, finds a locker with the name JOHN WICK carved upon it, opens the small door, slides in the blade, and closes it. \nJOHN How about you? \nEDDIE What about me? \nJOHN You gotta' name? \nA beat... and Eddie smiles, extending a hand, instantly warm. \nEDDIE They call me Eddie. \nJOHN (SMILES) Pleased to meet you, Eddie. \nEDDIE Same goes for me, Mr. Wick. \nJOHN Please... call me, John. \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SPEAK EASY - NIGHT \nJohn enters the room through a pair of velvet drapes... \n...and pauses, taking it all in with a smile. \nA luxurious tavern crafted from a long forgotten speak-easy, the room isn't too big, and isn't too small, but... just right. \nBooths line the outside walls while a number of tables are scattered about. \nNear the stage, a small dance floor has been cleared, the wooden tiles worn, but lovingly cared for. \nOn stage, JENNY -80s, African-American, petite, a commanding presence- sways behind the microphone, singing an old standard, her voice similar to that of Billie Holiday; strong, tender, and sincere. \nHer eyes grow wide at the sight of John, but she never wavers from her tune. \nAs John makes his way through the room, everyone nodes, offers a handshake, or a simple greeting: this is an old family... of a sort. \nIn the corner, WINSTON -70s, English, tall, lean, well- dressed, glasses, tailored, precise- sits with a worn, paperback copy of THE TELL-TALE SHREW in one hand and a dry sherry in the other. \nJOHN Hello, Winston. \nWinston lowers the book, and glances across at John with a blank -yet warm- look. \nWINSTON Hello, Jonathan. (a beat, then) It's been awhile. \nJOHN That, it has. (LOOKING AROUND) I'm glad to see the old place still up and runnin'. \nWINSTON (HALF-SMILES) I could say the same for you. \n...and Jenny sings IT HAD TO BE YOU. \nHer rendition is powerful, sweet, endearing, passionate, and sincere. As John watches her sing, a smile tugs at the corner of his lips. \nOn the empty dance floor... \n...John watches a younger version of himself with Norma... \n...dancing slowly... twirling... her head on his shoulder... \n...smiling... \n...with a sigh... \n...before disappearing. \nJohn swallows -hard- as a trembling hand wipes away a tear. \nJenny smiles at him with a nod. \nHe returns the gesture. \nShe continues to sing. \nJohn raises his glass as- \n-SNAP.   SNAP.   SNAP.   SNAP.   SNAP. \nCUT TO: \nA CELLPHONE \nFive pictures of John are inconspicuously taken... \n...by DAVID PERKINS -late twenties, cocky, expensive tastes, lean, cruel- at a table across the way. \nDavid sends them with a text:     \"Is this him?\" \nA beat... and he receives a text in return:       \"Yes.

Should you fail, we disavow. Should you succeed, we reward... greatly.\" \nDavid smiles... \nCUT TO: \n...as does John. \nOnce the song is done, Jenny is met with boisterous applause... \n...with John clapping the hardest among them. \nFADE TO: \nINT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - NIGHT \nExhausted -and more than a bit tipsy- John runs a hand along the wall to maintain his balance. \nHe sings under his breath... humming the tune to IT HAD TO BE YOU. \nAt his door, he fumbles with his key card, but finally manages to open it. \nINT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJohn closes and locks the door behind him.    He sheds his jacket, his shoes, and his pants... \n...flicks off the lights... \n...and crawls beneath the blankets with a sigh. \nFADE TO: \nEXT.

(a beat, then) Give me something. \nDAVID Wait, wait! (swallowing hard, then) Little Russia. There's a small bank near Cannon Court... \nJOHN What about it? \nDAVID Viggo owns it. It's where he keeps his money. Every dollar of business he does clears through that building. \nJOHN (a beat, then) That'll do. \nJohn swings the shotgun, knocking David out with the butt. \nCLICK. \nJohn freezes... \n...as HARRY -60s, African-American, former NFL receiver, tall, lean, and imposing, yet currently dressed in boxers, a t-shirt, and dress shoes- aims a pistol at the back of John's head from the open doorway of his hotel room. \nSilence. \nHARRY Do I know you? \nJOHN I'm thinkin' so. \nJohn turns... \n...and Harry lowers his pistol. \nHARRY Oh.    Hey, John. \nJOHN Hey, Harry. \nHarry glances about at the bodies... \n...and steps back inside his room. \nHARRY Good night, John. \nJOHN (NODS) Night, Harry.

JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJohn enters his room, and answers the ringing phone. \nMANAGER Good evening, Mr. Wick. I'm sorry to be calling you at this hour, but we've received a number of noise complaints from your floor. \nJOHN You don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be going to bed soon. \nMANAGER Have you any need of -say- a dinner reservation, perhaps? \nJOHN Yes, in fact. (COUNTING) For four. \nMANAGER Six o'clock? \nVIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) Wait in the car. \nThe two men exit as Viggo walks towards the booth, shedding his jacket as he does so. \nOnly one of John's hands is above the table, the other hovering beneath it, a pistol held tight, unwavering. \nViggo slips into the seat. \nVIGGO (CONT'D) Is that really necessary? \nJohn answers by taking a sip of his coffee. Viggo shrugs with a frown, motioning towards the waitress as he flips over his mug. \nVIGGO (CONT'D) So be it. \nWAITRESS (filling the mug) Cream or sugar? \nVIGGO No, thank you. \nAs she walks away, Viggo takes a long pull off of his drink. \nVIGGO (CONT'D) It's been what? 30 years? \nJOHN Yeah, that's about right. \nVIGGO Left the game, got married, settled down... I envy that. (a beat, then) Kids? \nJOHN No. \nVIGGO Lucky bastard. \nJOHN We tried, but... wasn't in the cards. \nVIGGO I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it... (GLOWERS) He's still my son. \nJOHN (NODS) I figured as much. \nVIGGO Funny how one would both die and kill for something they do not love. \nJOHN Imagine what one would do if they did. \nViggo nods, takes a sip of his coffee, and stands. \nVIGGO Goodbye, John. \nJOHN Goodbye, Viggo. \nViggo leaves the diner, and slides into- \nINT. A LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS \n-where four of his men wait, each armed with a silenced, submachine gun: intimidating hardware. \nViggo closes the door, takes a deep breath, and sighs, rubbing his brow. \nVIGGO Kill him. \nBOOM! \nA round slams into his window, barely missing him before hitting the man seated next to him in the side of the head, blood spattering against glass. \nViggo dives to the floor as his men prepare to return fire- \nEXT. A DINER - CONTINUOUS \n-but John is a crackshot, firing as he strides towards the VEHICLE- \nINT.

A CAFE - THE REAR - CONTINUOUS \n-exiting the building. \nHe flips his jacket inside-out -from black to gray- and slips on a face mask. \nReaching down behind a trash can, he removes a TWO GALLON PLASTIC GAS TANK and a PISTOL before walking back down the alley, and out into- \nEXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS \n-making a b-line for the Bank. \nAs he walks across the street, traffic stops as onlookers gawk in horror. \nJohn opens the door, and enters- \nINT.

A BANK - THE VAULT - CONTINUOUS \nThe Bank Manager swings open the door, revealing two walls of safety-deposit boxes on either side... \n...with a large door in the rear of the vault leading into a secondary vault. A keypad is attached to its face replete with a fingerprint reader. \nJohn presses the barrel of the gun to the back of the Bank Manager's head and forces him into the vault. \nJOHN Open it. \nBANK MANAGER I can't. \nJOHN Open it. \nBANK MANAGER He'll kill me! \n...and retrieves a LARGE BRIEFCASE. \nINT. A BANK - SECONDARY VAULT - LATER \nViggo stands in the center of the small room with his head down, prodding a smoldering Picasso with the tip of his foot. \nVIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) Where's the manager? \nThe question is met by silence. \nVIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) I'd run, too. (a beat, then in English) What a shame... what a fucking... (SIGHS) ...shame... \nViggo is trembling with rage, hands clenched at his sides, eyes unblinking. \nVIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) Iosef... my son... is worth less than this... far less... treasures reduced to ash...

A BANK - LATER \nWith his head down -hands stuffed deep into his pockets, a cigarette smoldering between his lips- Viggo exits, slowly making his way towards his car. \nINT. A DIESEL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS \nPerched behind the wheel -the driver's side window missing- John shifts gears, slams his foot down onto the gas... \n...and narrows his eyes, tensing, his knuckles creaking from within leather gloves as his fingers constrict around the wheel of the stolen vehicle. \nEXT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS \nThe gunmen react to the sound of the engine's roar, the two nearest it's approach dropping to a knee, aiming, and firing. \nBullets slam into the windshield -a round slashing into John's cheek, clipping his ear- and engine block before the front left tire blows. \nJohn loses control of the truck which fishtails wildly, slamming into a sedan, crushing two gunmen before it cartwheels through their midst, killing three more before coming to a stop on its side. \nA gunmen pushes Viggo towards the center sedan- \nGUNMEN (in Russian, subtitled) GET IN! NOW! \n-shoving him inside. \nThree gunmen approach the truck, firing repeatedly. \nINT. A DIESEL TRUCK - CONTINUOUS \nDazed, John -his face cut by glass, fresh wounds seeping hot blood- reaches over into the open briefcase, removing the silenced-UZI therein. \nJohn shoots out the sunroof, dragging himself free of the vehicle as he ducks for cover. \nEXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS \nAs the Sedan peels out, John swiftly ejects the clip, selects another -wrapped in blue tape, these ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS are dark gray, seemingly sharpened to a tip- from a clip belt, slaps it into weapon, drops to a knee and- \n-as the Sedan drives past- \n-depresses the trigger. \nINT. THE SEDAN - CONTINUOUS \nBullets easily punch through the doors and windows, riddling the dash.. \n...the passenger, the driver... \n...the seats... \n...one gunmen, Viggo, another gunmen... \n...and the seats. \nEXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS \nThe Sedan veers off, plummeting into the store front of a pharmacy. \nEXT. A BANK - CONTINUOUS \nJohn ejects the spent clip, selects another wrapped in blue tape, turns towards the fallen truck, and pulls the trigger. \nThe bullets punch through the roof, seats/floor, and undercarriage of the vehicle... \n...cutting the remaining gunmen to shreds on the sidewalk behind it. \nThe clip empties. \nSilence. \nJohn tosses the Uzi into the truck, turns, and walks towards the store front from which the rear half of a sedan protrudes, pausing to slip free a silenced-pistol from a dead man's hand. \nDay becomes night. \nEXT. THE DOCKS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nA bustling mecca of commerce, the port never sleeps; ships of all shapes and sizes dock, empty their shipment, refilled with return cargo, and slip out into the night. \nA multi-hulled beast of a ship, THE CHAYKA (Seagull) rests dock-side, its bridge guarded by a small army of security guards. \nOverhead, scattered throughout the cranes, are a half-dozen SNIPERS, searching/studying the dockyard. \nINT. THE CHAYKA - THE HULL - CONTINUOUS \nCellophane-wrapped pallets of WEAPONS and bales of CASH are carried by forklifts into the center of the hull and bolted to the floor. \nMeanwhile, two dozen high-end, luxury cars enter the hull, each driven into its own reinforced, steel crate, the doors sealed shut behind them. \nAs the last WORKER leaves, he shouts into his walkie-talkie. \nWORKER FILL HER UP! \nOverhead, a large chute appears- \nEXT. THE CHAYKA - CONTINUOUS \n-and the OPERATOR presses a button, sending a seemingly endless stream of grain down into the hull, covering the smuggled goods. \nINT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nChewing on an unlit cigar, the CAPTAIN -60s, enormous, grizzled, salt-and-pepper beard, long, unkempt hair, dressed in denim and leather- studies paperwork at his desk while Iosef paces; a cigarette in one hand, a drink in the other. \nIOSEF How the fuck long do I have to stay down here? \nCAPTAIN Until we are at sea, and even then, your access up top will be limited. \nThe Captain's phone rings.   He answers it. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Yes? \nThe Captain's face falls, his jaw clenched. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) I'll let him know. Proceed as scheduled. \nThe Captain hangs up, finds a match, sparks it to flame, and ignites the tip of his cigar, puffing it like an old steam engine. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Your father... \nIOSEF (SCOFFS) What about him? \nCAPTAIN He is dead. \nIosef is stunned. \nIOSEF What? \nCAPTAIN I'm sorry.     He was k- \nThe Captain is cut off by the intercom which squawks to life, a screaming voice reduced to panicked static. The Captain slaps a hand down onto the call button. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Come again? \nOPERATOR (O.S.) We're taking fire, sir! \nEXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - CONTINUOUS \nA number of security guards lay dead upon the deck -bleeding out from single gunshot wounds- as the others sprint for cover. The Operator leans hard against the call button of the intercom. \nOPERATOR Someone's shooting at u- \nA round slams into the side of the Operator's head, killing him instantly, his body sinking to the deck. \nINT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - CONTINUOUS \nThe Captain stands, checks the chamber of the LUGER PISTOL at his side, and heads for the door. \nCAPTAIN Until you hear otherwise... stay. \nThe Captain exits the cabin and slams the door behind him. Trembling, Iosef latches close the door... \n...and pours himself a tall drink. \nEXT. A CRANE - CONTINUOUS \nA SNIPER searches the yard through his scope, his earpiece overwhelmed by panicked chatter. \nSNIPER This is Alpha. I don't- \nA beat... and John raises the pistol, and fires off his last round, punching a hole in the glass. \nIosef grins, laughing as John drops his weapon. \nIOSEF (CONT'D) You missed, bitch! \nJOHN No.   I didn't. \nJohn surges into Iosef... \n...whose hand comes down with the letter opener. John catches his wrist, and snaps it as his right hand darts up, constricts around Iosef's jaw, cracking it in two... \n...lifting him from with the ground... \nJOHN (CONT'D) (GROWLS) For Moose. \n...and hurling him through the pane of glass which EXPLODES. \nSCREAMING, Iosef tumbles end over end, his body slamming into chute from which grain continues to pour, the hull close to full. \nIosef cartwheels over it and lands half-in/half-out of the hull, SNAPPING his back, as around him... \n...grain piles higher... \n...as he sinks. \nIOSEF NO!    HELP ME! NO! N... (FADING) \nWhile his legs remain on deck, his upper torso sinks slightly, the grain covering his face, muting his screams... \n...as he suffocates to death. \nINT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJohn stares down at him for a long moment, turns... \n...and leaves. \nFADE TO: \nEXT.

A STREET - CONTINUOUS \nJohn pulls himself out of the vehicle, stumbles a few feet, ENTERS- \nEXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \n-leans heavy against the wall, and slides into a sitting position. \nJohn Wick looks to be on death's very doorstep.... \n...however... \n...death will not take him. \nWith an almost frustrated/irritated groan John pulls himself to his feet, and staggers down the alley. \nINT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nSmall, simple, and clean. \nA beat... and an elbow is driven through the door's window. John reaches in, unlocks the door, opens it, enters, and closes it behind him. \nINT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT \nJohn grabs an empty box and begins filling it with instruments, medication, bandages, and the like. \nINT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nJohn enters to find an empty room... \n...save a single YOUNG DOG -a mutt of no distinguishable breed, three years old- who sits staring at him, offering little more than a tilt of its head. \nJohn strips and -using the hose attachment- rinses his body clean: the damage is extensive with cuts, bruises, and three bullet holes (one in his shoulder, one his side, and one in his chest). \n", "test1_input": "...staring straight ahead... \n...unblinking. \nFADE TO: \nEXT.

AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS \nThe Mustang pulls into the lot, and enters- \nINT. AURELIO'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS \n-pulling into an empty space. \nA pair of OLDER MECHANICS notice the car, share an emotionless -yet knowing- look, set down their tools, and calmly leave the building. \nIosef, Viktor, and Kirill pour out of the vehicle, laughing. \nIOSEF (in Russian, subtitled) Shit, dude! (MORE) \nIOSEF (CONT'D) I'ma gonna' keep this muthafucker! (to a mechanic) Hey, where's Aurelio at? \nIosef sees Aurelio walking towards him, his gaze locked onto the Mustang, recognizing it. \nAURELIO Where'd you get that? \nIOSEF I gots my ways, yo!

Now. \nIOSEF What the fuck are you talking about? \nBy now, everyone in the facility has stopped working, watching the drama unfold. \nAURELIO I'm talkin' about you takin' this fuckin' car and gettin' the fuck outta' my shop. \nIOSEF Did you lose your shit, Aurelio?

On me?   In my house? \nAurelio presses his forehead against Kirill's outstretched gun. \nAURELIO (CONT'D) Flick off the safety. \nKirill smirks, and flicks off the safety. \nAURELIO (CONT'D) Pull back the hammer. \nKirill blinks, faltering in this game of brinkmanship. \nAURELIO (CONT'D) Now, either shoot me...

TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS \n-to enter the facility, shooting anything that moves. He is the angel of death: each target receives two well-placed bullets to ensure incapacitation. He never slows, never misses, and will not stop. \nThe primarily Japanese crew is in a panic with most fleeing - a number of whom are shot in the back- while those choosing to shoot back are cut down in a blink. \nOnce emptied, John drops his pistol, kneels, sweeps up a fallen gun up, levels, fires, always moving, and -as he passes by a lift- slaps a button, slowly lowering his Mustang down to the floor behind him. \nJohn is a force of nature as he clears out the building. \nUnstoppable. \nEXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - THE REAR LOT - CONTINUOUS \nA couple of mechanics escape the building, the last of which is shot in the back; dropping to his knees as a bullet slams into the back of his head. \nRunning with all of his might, MECHANIC #1 screams into his phone. \nMECHANIC #1 (in Japanese, subtitled) I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK HE IS!

BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS \nUnderwater, John lifts his hand... \n...to reveal a REMOTE DETONATER... \n...which he depresses with his thumb. \nINT. THE CANNERY - THE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe gunman goes pale at the sight of all of those red lights... turning green. \nEXT. THE SHIPYARD - CONTINUOUS \nA series of powerful explosion tear through the building, reducing it to splinters as it collapses in upon itself. \nINT. BENEATH THE CANNERY - CONTINUOUS \nAs debris begins to sink down all around him, John swims as hard as he can. \nSurfacing when he is safe, gasping for breath. \nFinding a ladder, John climbs upwards- \nEXT. THE DOCK - CONTINUOUS \n-emerging from behind an access panel. \nJohn turns towards the ship and moves at a steady pace, eyes roving. \nEXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - NIGHT \nSurrounded by crewmen and security personnel, the Captain watches the explosion, his eyes wide. \nCAPTAIN My... God. \nCREWMAN #1 What do we do? \nCAPTAIN I- \nPOP!   POP!    POP!   POP! \nThe sound of a pistol echoes up past them. \nCREWMAN Captain... he's coming. \nEXT. THE DOCK - THE CHAYKA - CONTINUOUS \nWith his pistol held in both hands -soaked to the bone- John strides towards the boat's entryway, dropping five guards with two perfectly-placed shots apiece. \nHe ejects the spent clips, slaps in a replacement, drops to a knee, and fires off six shots at the two gunmen as they round the corner, dead before they hit the ground. \nJohn drops his pistol, retrieves a submachine gun off a dead guard, unfolds the stock, presses it to his shoulder, and enters the ship. \nINT. THE CHAYKA - THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT \nWith a trembling hand, Iosef pours himself a drink, staring at the door... \n...from behind which is heard the sound of sheer, unadulterated chaos: gunfire, screams, and explosions. \nSilence. \nTHUM! THUM! THUM! \n", "test3_true": "Iosef drops his glass, and unlatches the door. \nThe Captain stumbles into the room, leaning heavy against his desk, pausing to take a swig of whisky, blood trickling down from his forehead, his left arm limp at his side. \nThe Captain reloads, reaches into his drawer, finds a snub- nosed .38, and tosses it to Iosef. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) Do you know how to use that? \nIOSEF Yes, sir. \nCAPTAIN Good. Follow me. And if you shoot me in the back, I'll be the one to fuckin' kill you. \nThe Captain swings open the door, and -with his pistol in both hands- enters- \nINT. THE CHAYKA - A CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \n-bodies lay everywhere. \nGunshots ring out. \nA number of panicking crewmen flee the ship. \nIosef stays close to the Captain, his sweaty hands clinging to the pistol. As the Captain rounds the corner- \n-COMMOTION- \n-as he and John collide. \nSLOW MOTION... \n...as John looks past the Captain, his eyes locking onto Iosef... \n...who -panicking- raises his pistol, and FIRES- \nBACK TO SCENE \n-hitting the Captain in the shoulder. \nCAPTAIN You piece of shit, motherfucker! \nIosef turns and flees... \n...as the Captain and John disarm one another. \nThe Captain roars -in pain and anger- driving a fist into John's side, breaking ribs. He follows through with a wild left, but John avoids it, slapping it aside, the Captain's forward momentum sending his fist to SHATTER again the iron wall of his ship. \nThe Captain howls, wrapping his arms around John, crushing him... \n...and as consciousness begins to fade... \n...John's teeth close around the captain's nose, cleaving it from his face. \nStunned, the Captain releases John who kicks out his knee, moves behind him, wraps his arms around the wounded man's head, and SNAPS his neck. \nEXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - CONTINUOUS \nIosef emerges from the lower deck, firing back into the darkness as tears roll down his face. \nA beat... \n...and John emerges, the very visage of death: his chest etched with bullet wounds, blood trickling down his face, wet, dirty, wounded, pale, and yet... \n...unstoppable. \nJohn moves at a steady pace, the gun in his hand at his side, arm limp. \nIosef sprints towards the far end of the ship, and climbs up the ladder towards the pilothouse. \nJohn follows. \nINT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nOverlooking the entire ship's deck, the pilothouse offers little in the way of escape. \nInstead, Iosef now finds himself trapped. \nHe searches the desk and finds a LETTER OPENER which he yields like a knife, turning... \n...as John enters the room. \nSilence. \nIOSEF Well, come on, muthafucka!   LET'S DANCE! YOU AND ME! \n"}

The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick factory buildings. 
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: 
Eight years later 
Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823. 
The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the horseriders: 
Javert, flanked by two policemen. 
16A   EXT. GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY                               16A 
As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to get in. 
BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living. 
Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless as ever. 
BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying! 
TRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown onto a cart. 
The police enter the harbour. 
17    EXT. HARBOUR - MONTREUIL - DAY                              17 
The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police. 
BEGGARS' CHORUS At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be reckoned And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day! 
Javert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on.

19      EXT. FACTORY YARD, MONTREUIL - DAY                           19 
Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods. Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver, FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate. 
19A     INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - MEN'S SECTION - DAY               19A 
The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first floor office. 
20-22   INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - WOMEN'S SECTION - DAY        20-22 
The long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed business office. The figure of a man within. 
FOREMAN (flirtatiously, to women) At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread! 
FACTORY WOMAN 4 There are children back at home - 
FACTORY WOMAN 2 And the children have got to be fed. 
FACTORY WOMAN 7 And you're lucky to be in a job - 
The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman. As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. 
FOREMAN (quietly, to Fantine) And in a bed! 
FACTORY WOMAN 8 (to Fantine, as a warning) And we're counting our blessings! 
The Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to speed up their work. 
FOREMAN At the end of the day just be glad to be working For a master who cares for the lives of the poor. 
FACTORY WOMAN 7 He's a riddle.. 
FACTORY WOMAN 4 He's no fool.. 
FACTORY WOMAN 6 He's the answer to anyone's prayer 
FACTORY WOMAN 8 And he paid for the brand new school 
FACTORY WOMAN 4 It's no wonder they made him the mayor! 
FACTORY WOMEN Bless the man who leads the way! At the end of the day! 
They get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in the office above. 
The Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her. 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?

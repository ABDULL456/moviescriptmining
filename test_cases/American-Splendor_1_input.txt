Joyce lets go of his hand. She stares at him in disbelief. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TGIF STYLE RESTAURANT - 1980'S - NIGHT 
The most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture. 
HARVEY What's wrong? 
JOYCE Nothing. 
HARVEY Somethin's wrong. Yer lookin' around everywhere. 
JOYCE I guess I never imagined you eating in a place like this. 
HARVEY Me? I never been here. I thought you'd like it. But obviously ya don't, do ya? 
JOYCE It's fine. What difference does it make? 
Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic. 
HARVEY I dunno. None, I guess. (beat) They sure got a lot of meat on this menu. 
JOYCE You're a vegetarian? 
HARVEY Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore. 
Joyce grabs a bread stick. 
JOYCE Hmm. I support and identify with groups like PETA, but unfortunately I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating. 
Harvey just stares at her. 
HARVEY Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh? 
JOYCE Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness. 
A cheery waitress bounces over. 
WAITRESS (sing song) Good afternoon! I'm your server Cindy! What can I bring you two today? 
They slowly look up at her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - NIGHT 
JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess, as usual. 
HARVEY Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty. They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause I couldn't learn ta make a bed. 
Joyce puts down her bag. 
JOYCE I've seen worse. 
She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her. 
JOYCE Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin. 
Harvey just bounces back up and obeys. 
HARVEY What, ya got a headache? 
JOYCE No, but I want to avoid one. 
Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some reason, he's feeling more comfortable. 
HARVEY Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I've just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch. 
Harvey arrives back with the aspirin. He hands it to Joyce.

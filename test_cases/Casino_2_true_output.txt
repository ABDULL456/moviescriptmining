HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms. 
MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat. 
FAT SALLY Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat. 
DOMINICK Fuck!  You... 
FUSCO and FAT SALLY pin NICKY down and hold his face straight ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten. 
DOMINICK (To MARINO) ...rat motherfucker! You rat mother- 
MARINO hits DOMINICK in the shoulder with the bat. 
MARINO Tough guy! You and your f- (he strikes DOMINICK's chest) Fuckin' brother! 
DOMINICK Oh, you - ! 
NICKY tries to look away. 
MARINO No more! 
FAT SALLY Get him, Marino! 
MARINO (Hitting DOMINICK across the neck) You fuckin' scumbag! 
The wiseguys hold NICKY's face so he has to see his brother. 
MARINO (Lunging the bat into DOMINICK's stomach) No more. 
He swings the bat across his head, knocking DOMINICK on the ground. 
NICKY (Still pinned, screaming) Frankie! 
MARINO (Looking at NICKY as he strikes DOMINICK) No more! You see? Watch! 
HARDY and BEEPER join MARINO. All three are beating DOMINICK with baseball bats. 
NICKY (Held down by his neck) Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit! 
MARINO Fuck you, you motherfuck! 
The camera tilts down to DOMINICK's bloody face as the three continue to beat him to death. 
NICKY Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of shit! 
NICKY tries to stand up but FAT SALLY and FUSCO keep him down. 
MARINO No more fuckin' dirty work! 
NICKY (Rolling over on his back in pain) No, no, no, no! 
MARINO (To HARDY and BEEPER) Take him out! Take this motherfucker out! 
They drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield. 
EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER 
DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER stand over him, still swinging their bats. 
NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO. His face is a little bloody. 
NICKY (Whimpering, as they beat DOMINICK) Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom. Frankie. (Pleading for his brother's life.) Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's still breathin'. He's still breathin'. Leave him alone. Frankie. 
MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks away, sobbing. 
MARINO All right. Strip him. 
MARINO and his hoods remove DOMINICK's pants and shirt. 
NICKY (Sobbing as they undress his brother) No balls, you got no fuckin' balls. Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom. 
NICKY sobs. They drag DOMINICK toward a freshly dug grave and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it. 
NICKY (Crying quietly) Dominick.  Dominick. (Sobs.) Dominick. 
NICKY looks up to MARINO. They share a look before MARINO swings his bat, striking NICKY's head. 
FREEZE FRAME ON MARINO. 
UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES. 
MARINO and his men start beating NICKY, who groans and spits blood as he is struck. 
EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER 
NICKY is stripped down to his underwear. HARDY and FUSCO drag him to the grave and dump him over DOMINICK. 
MARINO Come on, come on. Bury 'em. 
MARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, until they are covered up to their necks. 
We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still breathing and groaning. 
ACE (V.O.) The word was out. The bosses had had enough of Nicky. They had enough. How much were they gonna take? So, they made an example of him and his brother. They buried them while they were still breathing. 
A full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with a thud. 
INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DUSK 
ACE is engulfed in flames. His jacket catches fire. He opens the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a smaller explosion. He lies on the floor as a ball of fire rises behind him. Two men pull him away from the car. 
MAN #1 Mister, you all right? 
MAN #2 Watch out, the -! 
ACE watches as his car explodes in flames. Ashes and debris fall on ACE and the two men. 
MAN #2 Mister, you all right? 
ACE (Dazed) Yeah. 
ACE (V.O.) They had other ideas for me. 
EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
ACE is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher. There are firemen and policemen in the background.

ACE's face disappears into the ambulance.

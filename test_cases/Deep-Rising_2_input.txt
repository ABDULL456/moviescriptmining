128     SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT                                      128 
Canton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked eyes watch a TENTACLE slowly squirm across the hood toward him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. Canton backs away from it as far as he can. 
Another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up next to him. Canton crawls away from that one. Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping mucus. Canton's eyes widen, horrified. Then another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up. Canton crawls to the center of the hood. And another TENTACLE. Canton has nowhere to go. The Tentacles close in on him. 
CANTON No! No! No! 
All the tentacles rise over him, about to descend. 
CANTON (CONT'D) NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! 
CUT TO: 
129     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      129 
Finnegan and Trillian race for all they are worth, clamber over the side of the Fuji Maru, dropping to the deck of the Saipan. 
CUT TO: 
130     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         130 
Finnegan and Trillian slowly clamber through the hold, waist deep in water, on edge, eyes wide, watching for any sign of trouble. It's quiet in here. Maybe too quiet. 
TRILLIAN (quietly) Finnegan... 
FINNEGAN Yeah... 
TRILLIAN ...the minute you start your engines ...it's going to kill us, isn't it? 
They step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is stunned. 
FINNEGAN Not unless we kill it first. 
Finnegan SMASHES more of the CRATE, it falls apart, REVEALING the entire torpedo. He hands her his pulse rifle. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) Anything moves, you shoot. 
Finnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile head. Trillian looks around nervously. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... 
TRILLIAN If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island? 
FINNEGAN Jet ski...there's one left up there. 
The plate comes loose. Revealing a gaggle of wires, and parts. 
FINNEGAN (CONT'D) ...let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire...or blue cross red? 
He starts to fiddle with the wires. -- Suddenly, there's a LOUD SLOSHING SOUND right behind them! CRATES TOPPLE! More pulse rifles spill out. Trillian spins, ready to blast away with the pulse rifle, to... 
PANTUCCI Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!! 
FINNEGAN Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red... 
He refers to the wires. 
PANTUCCI Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg? 
FINNEGAN Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid? 
PANTUCCI (fast) Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? 
FINNEGAN Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast? 
PANTUCCI For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast. 
TRILLIAN How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right? 
FINNEGAN Right... 
PANTUCCI Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here? 
FINNEGAN Seafood salad. (to Trillian) You ever operate a jet ski? 
TRILLIAN (nervous) You want ME to go up there?

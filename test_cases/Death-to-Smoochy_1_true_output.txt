The reporters furiously scribble down his statement. 
END OF MONTAGE. 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
Randolph dances down the street like Gene Kelly. He whistles a happy tune and tips his hat to everyone who walks by. As he dances along, he pets a dog... 
RANDOLPH Hi there, poochy! 
Coos at a baby in a stroller... 
RANDOLPH Well, aren't you the cutest little boo-boo in the world! 
And grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it to an old lady... 
RANDOLPH For you, my dear!   May you live to be a hundred! 
He continues to dance onward, waving back at everyone. Unfortunately, he doesn't realize he's heading straight for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening smack. 
RANDOLPH Fuck! 
EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT 
Nora exits the revolving door of the Kidnet building and heads down Broadway. Sheldon pops out from a store front. He's wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to disguise himself. 
SHELDON I have to talk to you. 
Nora keeps walking. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORA We have nothing to talk about. 
SHELDON Don't tell me you believe what they're saying! 
NORA I don't have to believe anyone. The picture in the paper said it all. No one forced you to perform at that rally. 
SHELDON Perform?     I barely sang one song. 
NORA Well maybe next time you'll do a longer set. 
SHELDON Nora, I had no idea that was a Nazi function. None whatsoever! 
NORA Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot swastika you were standing in front of might've given you a hint. 
SHELDON The papers are blowing that out of proportion. It was nowhere near that big. 
Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye. 
NORA Look, the fact of the matter is, I don't know you, okay? Not really. So don't expect me to go out on an emotional limb here. 
Sheldon looks crushed. 
SHELDON But what about the balcony? What about the Klunky-Wunky dance? 
NORA I was drunk.    Don't read too much into it. 
She looks at him for a moment and then walks off. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAYS LATER 
A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets, looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall -- a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street. 
EXT. CONEY ISLAND STATION - STREET LEVEL - LATER 
Sheldon comes up from the subway.    We see the Cyclone from Astroland in the b.g. 
EXT. SIDE STREET (CONEY ISLAND) - FEW MINUTES LATER 
Sheldon stands in front of the methadone clinic he used to perform at. It's boarded up. He just stares at it. An OLD VAGRANT walks up to him. 
OLD VAGRANT If you're lookin' to get a cup of juice, the well's dried up, son. City shut her down. Bastards'll put a new pair of tits on the Statue of Liberty, but they won't help a poor hophead. 
The Vagrant shakes his head sadly. 
OLD VAGRANT Just once I wish I had a little clout. You know? I'd set things straight in this town, believe me. (sighs) Hell of a world. 
He walks off. 
SHELDON (to himself) Hell of a world.

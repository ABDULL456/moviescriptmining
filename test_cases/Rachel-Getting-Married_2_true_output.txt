RACHEL Oh, poor you. You're so much more evolved in your suffering. You know what? Your suffering is not the most important thing in the world to everybody!

Other people have lives! We have lives! I have a life! I'm in school. I'm getting married. I'm... 
Rachel just stands there, not saying anything. 
KYM What? 
PAUL What?!! 
Dead silence. Everyone stares at Rachel. Rachel looks at Sidney. Sidney passes the look right back to her. 
RACHEL I'm pregnant. 
Beat, then: HUGE WHOOPS AND HOLLERS!!!! 
EVERYBODY Congratulations! Oh my god! Etc!!! Paul hugs Rachel and kisses her hair. Sidney and Kieran hug. Emma hugs Rachel and kisses Sidney. Hugging all around. Kym is pissed. Paul grabs Kym and Rachel, and hugs both daughters at once. Rachel and Kym's faces are mushed right next to each other. Kym is impatient and stiff in the dreaded double mush. 
Kym breaks from Paul's vice-like grip. 
KYM That is so unfair! 
PAUL (ecstatic) When did you find out? 
SIDNEY Roughly about the day before we decided to get married. 
RACHEL I can barely believe it myself! 
PAUL (laughing, mushing Rachel's belly)

RACHEL We told her at dinner. 
SIDNEY She was so happy-- 
KYM Wait! Stop! You can't just drop that tectonic bit of information into a completely separate conversation, Rachel. You can't do that! 
RACHEL Kym, you're going to have a niece! 
SIDNEY Or a nephew! 
KYM Oh, god. Of course I'm happy for you. But you can't tell me when we're talking like this. It's a total set-up! 
Beat. All the energy drains out of Rachel. 
RACHEL I am so fucking exhausted. 
KYM Dad, will you tell her I'm happy for her? 
RACHEL I just...I need to go to bed. Sidney? 
SIDNEY Yeah, okay. Great idea. I'm beat too. 
KYM (to Rachel) You're leaving? In the middle of this conversation? 
RACHEL Yes.

CHON How so? 
PINA In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho. 
CHON (Scolds her.) Pina, my God! 
Throughout the conversation Pina makes coffee and prepares a tray of Fornassetti cups and the whole bit. 
PINA And that's not all! Since he wasn't calling, I've torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage... 
CHON I've tripped on the thing, but I didn't want to pry... And the bed? I think I noticed it smoking a bit... 
PINA I dropped a lit match and it began to burn, and I didn't want to squelch it. Fire purifies. I will have to change the mattress, but all for the best! A whole lot of less memories! 
Chon looks at her friend. 
PINA But excuse me, I've interrupted you. You were telling me... 
She grabs the tray, now full with coffee and pastries. 
PINA 
Let's have breakfast on the terrace. 
The two women head for the terrace, which sits in front of the beautiful backdrop curtain of Madrid. 
180. LOFT'S TERRACE. INT. 2008 
Chickens and rabbits, running around. Lots of plants, etc. An idyllic and false image. Only the feelings are authentic and the women's happy disposition for living in hysteria. 
CHON (Struggling with what she's about to say.) Yes. I was telling you that I also have a suitcase at home. 
PINA Your husband's? 
CHON No. It's a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine, uncut. 
Pina's eyes open wide. 
PINA You've become a dealer, Chon? 
CHON No! How could you think that! I am still a Counselor for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase appeared in my closet. Imagine the scandal if the police find out. They could put me in jail! 
PINA 
Certainly! 
CHON I have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as soon as possible. (Thinks.) Because of the hours we keep, politicians consume a lot of drugs. So, between my party cohorts and city hall, I could distribute two kilos, but what do I do with the rest! 
PINA Throw it out! 
CHON Are you crazy? How could I throw it out?! I have to keep the police from finding it in my house... I have to take it some other place, immediately! 
PINA But I don't understand... 
CHON (Interrupts.) Well, it's clear, honey! 
PINA (Finishes her question.) How is it that the suitcase appeared in your closet? 
CHON (Drinks a little coffee, and takes a bite from a pastry.) As I was telling you, after breaking up with my husband, I bumped into this guy on the street who kept watching at me, good-looking, well hung. Summing up, I took him home and screwed him over and over... (Takes another sip of coffee.) 
PINA An how was he? 
CHON In bed? Divine. Look at my arm hair? I've got goose-bumps! (She shows her the hair on her arm, 
standing straight up.) He's that kind of guy who knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure! 
PINA So you lost your mind... 
CHON What else could I do?! So he asked me if he could stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I couldn't promise anything. I didn't want him thinking that I was that easy. So (breathes in) he brought the suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase. And, well, why would I care?! (breathes in) By pure chance, I am watching TV last night and I find out that the police have nabbed him in the course of a drug sting operation and that he is one of the most wanted traffickers! I open the suitcase and I discover that it is filled with little bags of cocaine. I ran out of the house and I haven't returned since... 
Pina breathes out in solidarity. 
PINA What a story, my God! 
CHON (Concluding.) I was wondering why he was such a good fuck! For men living in such high-stakes conditions, each fuck could be the last! (She reaches her arm out, again.) Look, the goose-bumps! 
Once again, she shows Pina her arm, hair standing straight up. 
PINA I've seen them already... They comes easy for you... (Changing topic.) And the suitcase? 
CHON (Humble.) I was going to ask you... if you didn't mind that I brought it here. If they find it in my house, well, it's not about what could happen to me, but that it's just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of Social Affairs. Imagine how upset the mayor would be, and my party! My party can't take one more scandal! 
The doorbell rings: 
CHON The police! 
PINA Shush, how could it be the police?! No one knows you're here! 
CHON I am a woman who attracts attention, Pina. Since I was a little girl... 
PINA Just pretend you're here for coffee... 
Pina limps toward the door, uncertain. (Behind it she will find new adventures). She looks back, toward Chon, half-smiling, tired but charming, filled with understanding and a love for life, with all its emotions and its contradictions. It's with this half-smile on Magdalena's face that the sequence arrives at its end.

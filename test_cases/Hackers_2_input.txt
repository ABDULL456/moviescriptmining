DADE My... class. You mean I'm not in your class? 
KATE No, you're not in my class. 
Kate starts away. 
DADE Give me time! 
A guy in the halls notices Dade. 
GUY Hey, you new? 
DADE Yeah. 
GUY Tell him about the pool, Kate. 
DADE Pool? 
KATE Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there. 
DADE Yeah! Sure. 
Kate starts away again. 
DADE Thanks! 
EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP. 
Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention. One of them notices Dade. 
GEEK Hey! Hold the door! 
He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool. 
Dade (realizing he's been had) No pool. 
Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins raining. 
INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. 
Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles. 
KATE Oh my God! He found the pool. 
INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB. 
The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing skeletons. 
TEACHER I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms. Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur rally. I know some of you kids got computers at home. But these are school property, people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical interface... 
Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking himself into her advanced English class. 
EXT. SCHOOL QUAD. 
It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him. 
KID So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual? 
DADE Homicidal?

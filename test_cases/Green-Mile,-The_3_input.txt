Coffey shakes his head. Harry steps out. 
PAUL My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr. Stanton...those gentlemen there. (beat) This isn't like the rest of the prison. It's a quiet place, we like to keep it that way. 
Coffey considers this carefully, puzzled. 
COFFEY It weren't me making all the noise, boss. 
PAUL (eyes narrowing) You having a joke on me, John Coffey? 
COFFEY No, sir. 
Paul sees he isn't joking, continues: 
PAUL Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you. If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day. 
We might even play some music on the radio from time to time. Questions? 
Coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask: 
COFFEY Do you leave a light on after bedtime? 
Paul blinks. It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking. 
COFFEY Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes. If it's a strange place. 
Paul looks to his men. The guards are trading glances. 
PAUL It's pretty bright in here all night long. We keep half the lights burning in the corridor. 
COFFEY Cor'der. 
Coffey looks confused. Paul points to the lights lining the ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages. 
PAUL Right out there. 
Coffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently, lets go. 
Paul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees. He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper: 
COFFEY Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to take it back, but it was too late. 
Paul turns, leads his men up the Mile... 
PAUL'S INNER OFFICE 
...and they enter a few moments later. Paul is furious, but keeping a lid on his temper: 
PAUL Dean, run Delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken. 
BRUTAL Course they're broken, I heard the damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy. 
HARRY You hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in? 
PAUL How could I miss it, Harry? The whole prison heard. 
This makes Brutal snort, breaking the tension--the others can't help smiling. 
BRUTAL You'll probably have to answer for sending him off the Mile. He's gonna cause you trouble over this, you mark me. 
PAUL I'll chew that food when I have to. Right now I wanna hear about the new inmate...aside from how big he is, okay? 
BRUTAL (smiles) Monstrous big. Damn. 
PAUL Seems meek enough. Looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute. 
HARRY Imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what he done. Here... 
Harry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber bands on the desk before Paul--Coffey's file. 
HARRY ...make your blood curdle. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. E BLOCK PRISON YARD - DAY 
A small are reserved for inmates of the Mile, fenced-off from the main prison yard. Arlen Bitterbuck walks the perimeter under the watchful eyes of guard BILL DODGE. 
We find Paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with Coffey's file on his knees, thoughtfully unwrapping his brown- bagged sandwich. PUSH SLOWLY IN as he begins to read... 
EXT. DETTERICK FARM - DAWN (FLASHBACK) 
...and we see Klaus Detterick walk from his house to the barn with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening horizon. He disappears into the barn... 
...and we hold for a long moment, the house silent b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard... 
...until a WOMAN'S SCREAM shatters the silence. Klaus reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house... 
PAUL ON BLEACHERS 
...as Paul turns the page, keeps reading... 
INT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK) 
...and Klaus bursts in to find his wife MARJORIE absolutely frantic with terror: 
KLAUS WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT? 
MARJORIE THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE! 
She drags him through the house to a screened-off porch area where their 12 year old son HOWIE is pointing and shouting--

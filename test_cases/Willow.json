{"test1_input": "RANON It's not a Nelwyn baby. \nWILLOW No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini... \nMIMS Ooh, it's so cute... \nWILLOW Mims!  Get back here!  It might bite you. \nWillow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying. \nRANON Can't we keep it, Dada? \nWILLOW Absolutely not. \nBURGLEKUTT Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood! \nWillow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis- tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft, plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying baby. \nWILLOW Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect -- that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon, keep this thing hidden... \nEXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY \nBurglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily points his walking stick and goes after him. \nKIAYA Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done anything wrong! \nWillow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field, her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all day. \nBURGLEKUTT Ufgood!  What do you think you're doing!  I tell the planting seeds in this village. \nKIAYA I told him we didn't steal it, Wil- low. \nBurglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose. \nBURGLEKUTT You haven't paid your debts.  Where did you get these seeds? \nWith pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife. \nWILLOW In the forest.  My family's been gathering them since last fall. There's no law against that, Bur- glekutt. \nSuddenly the children laugh in the distance. \nKIAYA Willow!  You left the children alone by the river?? \nIn alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur- glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick. \nBURGLEKUTT Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get your planting done before the rains start.  You're gonna lose this land. \nHe raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks and shakes his head as if to say \"the whole family's crazy.\"  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits. Then runs as fast as he can to the river. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nKiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up, and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his hips. \nWILLOW Absolutely, under no condition, is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby. \nThey all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol- low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow. \nWILLOW Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby. Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be ignored! \nIgnored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed field. \nINT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY \nWillow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood tub and the children entertain the naked baby with sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a magic trick. \nWILLOW This is bad.  If we're caught with that little daikini it'll be the end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need that for the festival. (indicates magic cloth) Kiaya, what are we going to do? \nKIAYA We're gonna give this baby a bath. \nThe baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the bath. \nWILLOW Burglekutt's right.  There's not enough time to finish plowing. We'll lose everything and I'll end up working in the mines. \nHe shudders at the thought. \nKIAYA Willow, do you think we should take her to the Village Council? \nWILLOW No, no!  They'll think it's a bad omen.  There'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody'll blame me for it! \nRANON Look.  What's that? \n", "test1_true": "WILLOW I don't know.  This is trouble. I'll talk to the High Aldwin about it tomorrow at the Festival. \nThe baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath. \nEXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY \nThe raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug- of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight- fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused. The head councilman is Burglekutt. \nThe WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting Willow on. \nWILLOW And now!  For our final amazing bit of magic, I will make an entire pig completely disappear! \nMeegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave, and Meegosh covers his face. \nMims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through Willow's legs and leaps off the stage. \nCROWD Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss! \nBurglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow, embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up with the pig under his arm. \nWILLOW Meegosh, I'm in trouble. \nMEEGOSH Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need a better pig, that's all. \nBut as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur- glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on. \nMEEGOSH Now Burglekutt's got you in the squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in the mines like me. \nWILLOW Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces. That's the last thing I'd ever do. (he shudders) I gotta get my crop planted. \nMEEGOSH You know I'll help you as much as I can, Willow. \nThe Village Council members stand up respectfully as the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several other children who are eating candy. \nMIMS Dada, can we get treacle candy? Can we, can we?  Please? \nWILLOW (preoccupied) Meegosh, can you watch the chil- dren?  I gotta talk to the High Aldwin. \nMEEGOSH (truly amazed) The High Aldwin??  Why? \nBut Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig. \nWillow desperately pushes past people and finally reaches the High Aldwin. \nWILLOW Sir!  I have to talk to you. \nHIGH ALDWIN Not today, Willow. \nWILLOW It's a matter of great importance to me! \nBurglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on Willow's shoulder. \nHIGH ALDWIN Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I know you're eager to be my appren- tice, Willow.  But today is the spring festival. \nSuddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose. \nBURGLEKUTT Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!! Willow Ufgood??? \nHis belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em- barassed. \nThen a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music stops and people grab their children and run for their lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through the village. \nMeegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from the beast's claws. \nDEATH DOG Bordak!  Bordak! \nA loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil- low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its chest and it dies hideously. \nMEEGOSH What was it looking for? \nA VILLAGER It said \"bordak\"!  What does it mean? \nCOUNCILMAN (scholarly) Baby!  It means baby!  It was look- ing for somebody's baby! \nMothers grab their children, people look around the wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence. \nMIMS Mommy? \nSuddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm, his children hurrying behind. \n", "test1_id": 438, "test2_input": "WILLOW You cut your hair, Kiaya? \nHe kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly. \nKIAYA Willow!! \nKiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they break apart, and Willow begins the journey. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE \nWillow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain, amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along, shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's weight. \nEXT. ROAD - EVENING \nThe baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He hides under a bridge. \nNOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu- man, part beast. \nLIEUTENANT We've patrolled the hills.  This is where they killed the nursemaid. \nSORSHA She must have done something with the child.  Widen the search! \nOne of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's stirrup. \nLIEUTENANT Get away from there! \nThe dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm, ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast. He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below. The soldiers gallop off into the woods. \nWillow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his arms. \nEXT. ROAD - MORNING \nA harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face. \nWILLOW I hate this.  Where am I?  I should stick you in a tree and go back home. (looks at baby) I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that. \nHe hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder. \nEXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE \nVarious VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across vast hills and valleys. \nEXT. HILL - DAY \nGasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden scaffolding. \nWILLOW That's it.  The crossroads... \nHe stands and heads toward it cautiously. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAY \nThe place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench. From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one bony arm dangling out. \nWillow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted road.  He shivers with cold. \nWILLOW I hate this. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER \nWillow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face. The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her diaper. \nWILLOW I hate this. \nHe looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's crying gets worse.  He begins to change her. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET \nWillow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near- by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs. Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs, bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan frightens him. \nWILLOW I really hate this. \nNot sure where it came from. he backs away from the fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil- low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against the bars of the cage. \nMADMARTIGAN Hey, Peck...get me some water...or you'll diiiiie...! \nMadmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow races around that fire, picking up everything he owns. \nWILLOW I will--I'll getcha water--getcha lotsa water--anything you say--! \nWillow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the bushes. \n", "test2_true": "He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles his cage. \nMADMARTIGAN You're a weasely little Peck! Gimme some water! \nWillow peeks at him and shakes his head. \nWILLOW I'm not coming near you! \nThey stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad- martigan puts on a very phony smile. \nMADMARTIGAN Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here. \nWILLOW Good.  How long will it take? \nMadmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire. \nMADMARTIGAN Don't make me angry, Peck. \nWILLOW You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that. \nMADMARTIGAN Miserable Pecks. \nWillow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage. Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again. \nEXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT \nThe wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls. Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and offers the milk to Madmartigan. \nMADMARTIGAN That's more like it. \nMadmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk, retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup back. \nWILLOW Do any other daikinis ever come by here? \nMADMARTIGAN Why. \nWILLOW I have to give this baby to some- body. \nMadmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up. \nMADMARTIGAN I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll take care of your baby. \nHe makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy. \nWILLOW No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a reason.  I'll wait for somebody else. \nWillow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the cage with the back of his hand. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER \nBy the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR hoofbeats. \nWILLOW Hey!  Somebody's coming! \nMADMARTIGAN Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire! \nExcited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up the baby and waits. \nMADMARTIGAN No, you fool!  Put it out I say! Out! \nTorches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly dives into the bushes. \nFour boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches. Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the other. \nMADMARTIGAN No!! \nHe rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him. \nPICT Whose fire! \nThey jab their torches at Madmartigan. \nMADMARTIGAN No!  Help!  Stop! \nPICT Where are they?  Where did they go? \nMadmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the flames.  His sleeves ignite. \nWillow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand- fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan. \n", "test2_id": 439, "test3_input": "AIRK Uphill with our rough weapons, we'll never make it! \nSORSHA Elora Danan will die! \nRAZIEL By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the runic drum! \nWARRIOR Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need more forces.  I say we retreat! \nThe other warriors agree. \nRAZIEL Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell. \nMADMARTIGAN Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel? \nRaziel shakes her head. \nRAZIEL Bavmorda has shielded it with a spell of her own. \nThe warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi- ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep though, scratching the ground with his fingernail. \nThe warriors rumble. \nWILLOW Wait!! \nWillow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him. \nWILLOW I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs. \nMADMARTIGAN Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture! \nWILLOW I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle... \nThe all gather around Willow to listen. \nINT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT \nThunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra- dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds. A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles are lit.  The baby screams on the altar. \nWith a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black cloak. \nINT. TENT - NIGHT \nThey all look at Willow. \nAIRK It's too much work. \nWARRIOR It can't be done. \nSORSHA Kael will never fall for it. \nWillow looks hopefully at Madmartigan. \nMADMARTIGAN (doubtful) I don't know, Willow. \nWILLOW Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her? \nMadmartigan turns away and scratches his beard. \nAIRK Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna listen to a Peck?  You and I are warriors.  You know this plan will never work. \nFrustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away. The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor- sha. \nMADMARTIGAN We'll probably die here, Sorsha. \nSORSHA I have no family. \nThe gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk and his men. \nRAZIEL If we do not fight, and the baby dies, all hope for the future is lost.  I shall face the danger alone if I have to. \nThe men shake their heads. \nWILLOW Me, too. \nMadmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm and silences the protest. \nMADMARTIGAN Time is running out.  We must now decide who's going to leave and who is going to stay... \nEXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT \nLight pulsates in the Queen's Tower. \n", "test3_true": "The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby has been streaked with ritual paint. \nBAVMORDA Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak! \nHer voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light. \nEXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN \nThe sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis- carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris with it. \nAlone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz- ziel. \nRAZIEL Time is running out. \nWILLOW Surrender!! \nNockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra- ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his mouth. \nWILLOW We are all-powerful magicians! Give us the baby or we will destroy you!! \nThe Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter. \nKAEL Kill them! \nThe great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow clutches a spear and trembles nervously. \nRAZIEL Patience, Willow. \nWILLOW Courage, Willow. \nHoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands. Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a loud war drum! \nSuddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse- back! \nAnd the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir Asleen army charges with one loud warcry! \nThe eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle. Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor- sha scoops Raziel up on hers. \nINT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS \nMadmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall- way. \nRebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely. \nAIRK Let's squah 'em! \nIn unison, their swords flash and they charge across the courtyard chopping down the enemy. \nENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY \nSorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway. They come to a corner. \nSORSHA No, Willow!! \nShe grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and the women grab his hands and haul him further down the tunnel. \nINT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY \nThey come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra- ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs behind it. \nSuddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with fear. \nSORSHA I will face my mother alone. \nWillow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it. \nINT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY \nBavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN. \nBAVMORDA Sorsha!! \nSorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human: she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on the copper altar. \nSORSHA I won't let you kill her! \nBavmorda's voice is a demonic growl! \nBAVMORDA You are a weakling.  Like you fa- ther!  Can you not see that I am about to become all-powerful! \n", "test3_id": 440}

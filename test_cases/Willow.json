{"train": "RANON It's not a Nelwyn baby. \nWILLOW No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini... \nMIMS Ooh, it's so cute... \nWILLOW Mims!  Get back here!  It might bite you. \nWillow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying. \nRANON Can't we keep it, Dada? \nWILLOW Absolutely not. \nBURGLEKUTT Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood! \nWillow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis- tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft, plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying baby. \nWILLOW Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect -- that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon, keep this thing hidden... \nEXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY \nBurglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily points his walking stick and goes after him. \nKIAYA Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done anything wrong! \nWillow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field, her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all day. \nBURGLEKUTT Ufgood!  What do you think you're doing!  I tell the planting seeds in this village. \nKIAYA I told him we didn't steal it, Wil- low. \nBurglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose. \nBURGLEKUTT You haven't paid your debts.  Where did you get these seeds? \nWith pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife. \nWILLOW In the forest.  My family's been gathering them since last fall. There's no law against that, Bur- glekutt. \nSuddenly the children laugh in the distance. \nKIAYA Willow!  You left the children alone by the river?? \nIn alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur- glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick. \nBURGLEKUTT Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get your planting done before the rains start.  You're gonna lose this land. \nHe raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks and shakes his head as if to say \"the whole family's crazy.\"  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits. Then runs as fast as he can to the river. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nKiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up, and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his hips. \nWILLOW Absolutely, under no condition, is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby. \nThey all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol- low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow. \nWILLOW Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby. Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be ignored! \nIgnored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed field. \nINT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY \nWillow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood tub and the children entertain the naked baby with sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a magic trick. \nWILLOW This is bad.  If we're caught with that little daikini it'll be the end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need that for the festival. (indicates magic cloth) Kiaya, what are we going to do? \nKIAYA We're gonna give this baby a bath. \nThe baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the bath. \nWILLOW Burglekutt's right.  There's not enough time to finish plowing. We'll lose everything and I'll end up working in the mines. \nHe shudders at the thought. \nKIAYA Willow, do you think we should take her to the Village Council? \nWILLOW No, no!  They'll think it's a bad omen.  There'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody'll blame me for it! \nRANON Look.  What's that? \nWILLOW Kiaya!  Kiaya! \nINT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY \nWillow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her. \nWILLOW We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We must take her to the Council. \nThe children run in and they all huddle together, cher- ishing their precious lives. \nINT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY \nArguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the open door at the back and into the balconies above. The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak- ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with his walking stick. \nBURGLEKUTT An evil beast from the outer world has invaded our peaceful village, looking for a baby! \nThis only adds to the frenzy. \nA VILLAGER It's a sign!  An omen! \nANOTHER VILLAGER Our crops will die! \nBURGLEKUTT Silence!  One beast we can kill. But there may be more!  And they won't give up their search till they've found what they're looking for! \nMEEGOSH Whose baby is it! \nOTHER VILLAGERS Who's to blame for this! \nAmid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the back. \nAt the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He points as he speaks: \nHIGH ALDWIN Willow Ufgood!  Come before me! \nThe crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers as Willow approaches the platform. \nHIGH ALDWIN Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow. \nWILLOW (bows his head) My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin. \nThe crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri- ously. \nHIGH ALDWIN A daikini child... (his eyes close) ...of some importance, I feel... \nBURGLEKUTT That's what the beasts want!  Give it back! \nThe crowd rumbles, many agree. \nWILLOW They'll kill her!  We can't let this baby die! \nBURGLEKUTT What do we care! \nBurglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him. Almost in a trance: \nHIGH ALDWIN ...importance...yes...this child is special... \nCOUNCILMAN What should we do? \nInstantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his eyes. \nHIGH ALDWIN This child must be taken beyond the boundaries of our village.  All the way to the daikini crossroads. \nThe room goes silent. \nA VILLAGER Who will do that? \nSEVERAL VILLAGERS Vohnkar!  Vohnkar! \nVohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and pounds his chest once with his fist. \nHIGH ALDWIN The outer world is dangerous and corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are you willing to sacrifice your life? \nBrave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful- ly. \nVOHNKAR If I go, who'll defend you if other beasts attack? \nThe crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow and scuttles away from the platform. \nBURGLEKUTT He's right!  It seems only fair that the man to take this baby to the crossroads... (walking stick up) ...be the very man who plucked it... (walking stick down) ...out of the river! \nAll eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds her back. \nWILLOW You cut your hair, Kiaya? \nHe kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly. \nKIAYA Willow!! \nKiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they break apart, and Willow begins the journey. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE \nWillow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain, amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along, shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's weight. \nEXT. ROAD - EVENING \nThe baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He hides under a bridge. \nNOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu- man, part beast. \nLIEUTENANT We've patrolled the hills.  This is where they killed the nursemaid. \nSORSHA She must have done something with the child.  Widen the search! \nOne of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's stirrup. \nLIEUTENANT Get away from there! \nThe dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm, ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast. He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below. The soldiers gallop off into the woods. \nWillow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his arms. \nEXT. ROAD - MORNING \nA harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face. \nWILLOW I hate this.  Where am I?  I should stick you in a tree and go back home. (looks at baby) I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that. \nHe hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder. \nEXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE \nVarious VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across vast hills and valleys. \nEXT. HILL - DAY \nGasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden scaffolding. \nWILLOW That's it.  The crossroads... \nHe stands and heads toward it cautiously. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAY \nThe place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench. From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one bony arm dangling out. \nWillow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted road.  He shivers with cold. \nWILLOW I hate this. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER \nWillow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face. The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her diaper. \nWILLOW I hate this. \nHe looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's crying gets worse.  He begins to change her. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET \nWillow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near- by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs. Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs, bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan frightens him. \nWILLOW I really hate this. \nNot sure where it came from. he backs away from the fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil- low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against the bars of the cage. \nMADMARTIGAN Hey, Peck...get me some water...or you'll diiiiie...! \nMadmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow races around that fire, picking up everything he owns. \nWILLOW I will--I'll getcha water--getcha lotsa water--anything you say--! \nWillow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the bushes. \nMADMARTIGAN (spitting out dirt) Thanks for your help, Peck. \nWILLOW Are you okay? \nMADMARTIGAN As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us! (points dramatically) You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies! \nWILLOW I don't know. \nMadmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow begins to walk away. \nMADMARTIGAN The world's gone insane.  Good men locked in cages, criminals running free.  It doesn't pay to be honest, Peck. \nWillow stops and turns around. \nWILLOW Don't call me a Peck.  My name is Willow. \nMadmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends his derty hand through the bars. \nMADMARTIGAN Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan. \nWillow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles. Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar- tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way. \nMADMARTIGAN You a woodcutter? \nWILLOW Farmer. \nMADMARTIGAN Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world. \nA rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points. Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker. \nMADMARTIGAN Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm really a good man.  Give me my freedom, and I'll look after that baby for you.  Trust me. \nAfter a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he rubs his hands together and licks his lips. \nMADMARTIGAN That's it--good--good--like that, yes, good, good, the chain--that's it, come on--come on--! \nWillow suddenly steps away. \nWILLOW Nooo, I don't think I should. \nMadmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the roof. \nMADMARTIGAN Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya! Let me out! \nWillow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the baby and rocks her in his arms. \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN \nMadmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up. \nMADMARTIGAN Morning, Willow. \nWillow turns his back on him and tends to the baby. \nMADMARTIGAN Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been in this cage toooo long.  Can't think straight anymore.  Owww...! \nWillow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain. \nWILLOW You all right? \nMADMARTIGAN These burns.  My arms.  Ouch... \nHe holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan. \nWILLOW See if this helps. \nMadmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms. \nMADMARTIGAN Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made something for the baby. \nHe holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts it. \nWILLOW What's inside? \nMadmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it open as wide as possible. \nMADMARTIGAN A tooth. (Willow reacts) I'm strving.  I got no used for it. \nNoise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop him. \nWILLOW Stop!  Wait! \nMADMARTIGAN Hello, little baby... \nEXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER \nA ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire. \nMADMARTIGAN Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow? \nWILLOW I hate this. \nMadmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his cage. \nMADMARTIGAN Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares... (beat) Except me. (wistfully) You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own. \nWILLOW You don't know anything about ba- bies. \nMadmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his finger astutely. \nMADMARTIGAN Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women who do.  Why, if I had somebody in my life--a little daughter for instance--I'd have a reason to live... \nHe clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead- ing: \nMADMARTIGAN Willow.  You can't let me die here. Not when I wanna help you. \nWillow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan. \nWILLOW You gotta promise to feed her. \nMADMARTIGAN I will. \nWILLOW Fresh goat's milk. \nMADMARTIGAN Absolutely! \nWillow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the chain. \nWILLOW And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed. \nMADMARTIGAN Of course!  I promise! \nWillow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad- martigan into a heap of rags and dust. \nMADMARTIGAN Come to Daddy, little darlin'. (picks her up) I think she likes me! \nKneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and hands him supplies. \nWILLOW Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that. \nMADMARTIGAN Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake. \nWillow takes the baby and kisses her. \nWILLOW Bye. \nHe puts her in the papoose. \nWILLOW (to Madmartigan) Please take good care of her. \nMadmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He pats Willow on the head. \nMADMARTIGAN You've done a great job.  Now you go back to your family and get your crop in. \nMadmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished. He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a hill. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nSwinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts proudly up a gentle hill. \nWILLOW Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's come home!  Welcome back, Willow! He deserves a medal:  he's quite mystical.  For honor, for bravery, for his intuitive powers... (he chuckles) ...let's make him Apprentice Aldwin.  Better still:  High Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf- good, High Aldwin of--- \nThe baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding the vulutre is an ELF. \nWILLOW Come back here, you!  That's my baby!! \nThe vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving madly, Willow gallops after it. \nEXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY \nWillow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis- tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on him from every direction, peppering the surrounding trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he races along. \nHe comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes and nets. \nThe forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over Willow and he again has to shield himself from the brightness. \nCHERLINDREA (sternly) I am very serious, Willow.  There is no time to lose. \nNow she intensifies her light so that Willow backs away, completely covering his face. \nWILLOW But I've got a family to think about!  They need me! \nThe queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out from between his fingers. \nWILLOW Hello...? \nThe queen's voice echoes the forest. \nCHERLINDREA Bavmord'a powers are growing like an evil plague.  Soon she will con- trol the lives of you children, your wife, your village...everyone. \nVery gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees. All eyes are upon Willow. \nCHERLINDREA The choice is yours. \nWillow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment. He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up at them, resolved and determined. \nWILLOW I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do it! \nThe fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause. Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and brownies hug his ankles. \nWILLOW But I only have one shoe. \nEXT. WOODED HILL - DAY \nWE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself a brand-new shoe. \nSpirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby. \nWILLOW Wait till I tell my children. Stuff like this never happens in my village. \nHe digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it high in the air.  The brownies gasp. \nTEEMO Hey, careful there! \nWILLOW How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin. \nROOL Look!  Death below! \nRool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK- MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and men fall to their deaths. \nWILLOW Daikinis... \nThey hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him. \nIn the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing under several large horses and black-armored minions. He is frozen in fear. \nHORSEMEN Hyaaaaahh!! \nSwords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly trampling him and the baby to death. \nThe Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter- ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line, following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages below. \nWILLOW Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't cry, Elora.  Things can't get any worse than this... \nEXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY \nBleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro- tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot- tom of the building is an open stable with several horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse. \nIt's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout. \nTEEMO I'm not going in there. \nROOL Me neither! \nWILLOW Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What could possibly happen? \nSuddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi- ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets. Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the stable and up the stairs. \nINT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY \nThe place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI- LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS. Willow enters with the crying baby. \nWILLOW Could you spare some milk for this poor hungry baby? \nEveryone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID as big as a wrestler. \nMADMARTIGAN Not a bad idea. \nMadmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then he squats beside Willow and the baby. \nMADMARTIGAN So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist. \nWILLOW Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me. \nMADMARTIGAN The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides? \nHe shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts his feet up on a log. \nMADMARTIGAN Yeah well...in the morning I think I'll be on my way. \nHe laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly. \nWILLOW Madmartigan, I need your help. \nMADMARTIGAN My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help. \nWillow stares at him angrily. \nWILLOW But you're a great swordsman! \nHe jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and Teemo dive for cover. \nWILLOW (explodes) You're not a warrior, Madmartigan! A warrior wouldn't lie there and do nothing! \nHe kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the log. \nWILLOW We're in trouble!  You've seen the big army that's after us!  You're a fake!  You're a bum!  You're a-- you're a coward!! \nHe picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire, sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him with concern. \nMADMARTIGAN What's with you, Peck? \nWillow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry. \nWILLOW I miss my wife!  I miss my chil- dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing up so fast, he even helps me on the farm now!  And little Mims!  If you ever saw her sweet little face you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd *melt*! (sniffles) Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't know anything about love.  You don't know anything about any- thing... \nWillow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap. \nMADMARTIGAN I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function. (a pause) I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king! \nWILLOW You? \nMADMARTIGAN Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream. \nMadmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the fire.  Willow watches him curiously. \nMADMARTIGAN I'll never fall in love again... \nEXT. WOODS - MORNING \nWillow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone. He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through some bushes. \nWILLOW Madmartigan!  Madmartigan! \nThey've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE. Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily in the water. \nMADMARTIGAN Relax, Willow.  We're having fun. \nThe baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes. Rool points out at the lake. \nROOL That's it!  The sorceress lives there! \nIn the middle of the lake is an island with a single tree. \nTEEMO Are you sure? \nROOL (excited) Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island! \nMadmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh. Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island. \nTEEMO That tree dosn't look like gold to me. \nMADMARTIGAN Gold!! \nMadmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest. \nTEEMO Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold. \nWillow looks down at the browines questioninghly. \nWILLOW This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal. \nTEEMO Queen Bavmorda transformed her. \nRAZIEL What do you want! \nWILLOW We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess. \nStill sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark. Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks her tail. \nRAZIEL Elora Danan! \nMadmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge. \nMADMARTIGAN Rool!  Teemo!  You were right! This whole tree is made of gold!! \nHe strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold. \nRAZIEL Fools!  You should never have come to this place!  We're all going to die! \nThe wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel zips over to Willow and whispers intensely. \nRAZIEL We've got to get off this island right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's our only chance! \nThe wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat. \nWILLOW Madmartigan! \nMadmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree. \nMADMARTIGAN Wait!  Gold!  Gold! \nWaves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti- gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy lake. \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nWillow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches the boat. \nWILLOW Help, Madmartigan!  The oar! \nMadmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop and topple overboard. \nMADMARTIGAN My gold! \nSuddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy climbs in. \nRAZIEL Kill him! \nWILLOW No! \nRAZIEL Kill him! \nMadmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and vanishing. \nThen:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon- ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with the anchor. \nThe monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an- chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in fishing nets and yanking him overboard. \nUnderwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts himself free with his dagger. \nHe surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat. Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan. \nMADMARTIGAN No!!  Help!!  Willow!!! \nWillow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan. Willow throws the acorn. \nThe monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat. \nEXT. LAKESHORE - DAY \nThe storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex- hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit- ting. \nMADMARTIGAN Willow...you...you got...magic...! Wait...we could team up...! \nHe pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods. \nRAZIEL Flee!  Flee! \nThe brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear, dangling her in front of Sorsha. \nSorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with her. \nMADMARTIGAN Nice horse...nice hair...real nice hair...I'd say you've got the most beautiful hair I've ever-- \nShe flashes her eyes at him. \nSORSHA Wolff wants to boil you in oil. \nShe nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously. \nSORSHA Don't tempt me. \nShe turns away.  The baby squirms and cries. \nWILLOW If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying. \nSORSHA Shut up. \nSorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep breath. \nMADMARTIGAN Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman. \nSORSHA (angry threat) My step-father's going to tear you apart. \nMadmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her: \nMADMARTIGAN I'm torn apart already.  I mean it! Under all that armor is a beautiful-- \nCRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead. \nMADMARTIGAN Who is that girl, anyway? \nRAZIEL Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter. \nMadmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself. \nMADMARTIGAN Forget that one, Madmartigan. \nRaziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her teeth and whispers to Willow. \nRAZIEL Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone! \nWILLOW What do I need for that? \nRAZIEL We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair. \nWillow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't take his eyes off Sorsha. \nMADMARTIGAN Now that's a woman...! \nEXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT \nFires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs. From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is grinding a substance with a rock. \nRAZIEL Keep working at it.  Forget all you know, or think you know.  A magician's power depends on disord- er of the mind. \nShe twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan squints up at her. \nMADMARTIGAN You got that one covered. \nWillow hears the baby crying in a distant tent. \nWILLOW I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this? \nRAZIEL Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you... \nWILLOW (reciting) I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it? \nRAZIEL As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand. \nMadmartigan clasps his forhead. \nMADMARTIGAN I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up. \nWILLOW The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan. \nMadmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide- ly. \nMADMARTIGAN We're a tiny version of all that? \nRAZIEL As above, so below. \nRAZIEL Good!  The first step is complete. \nChained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward and pokes Willow with his finger? \nMADMARTIGAN Did she ask about me? \nWILLOW Who? \nMADMARTIGAN Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything? \nWillow deliberately plays innocent. \nWILLOW She said lots of thing.s \nMADMARTIGAN Willow! \nWillow grins.  At last: \nWILLOW She asked about you, Madmartigan. \nMADMARTIGAN Well what did she say? \nSuddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan. \nSORSHA Here.  You're going to need these where we're going. \nShe rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes. The looks at Willow. \nMADMARTIGAN She's in love. \nWILLOW You're crazy.  I think you're in love. \nEXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY \nThe Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun- tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining. \nRAZIEL We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on! \nWILLOW I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality! \nRAZIEL What's the magician's weapon? \nWILLOW The limitless power of... \nRaziel flips around in spasms of impatience. \nRAZIEL Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be? \nWILLOW (frustrated) I can't remember all these things. What am I learning? \nRAZIEL The art of transformation! \nWILLOW (exasperated) But what am I gonna transform?? \nRAZIEL Me! \nWillow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel. \nWILLOW You? \nMADMARTIGAN What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents? \nSorsha rides up to the wagon. \nSORSHA The baby's cold.  Take her. \nShe dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled, she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and listens. \nRAZIEL You remind me of your father, Sor- sha. \nSORSHA My father was a weakling. \nRAZIEL He was a great king. (Madmartigan reacts) Not like your step-father, not like your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen with kindness, and a generous heart. \nSORSHA My mother calls that weakness. \nMADMARTIGAN What do *you* call it? \nSorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan. \nSORSHA I do what I'm told. \nIt starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur. The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird. \nWILLOW What did I do? \nHe sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground. \nMADMARTIGAN Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You busted the lock. \nWilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the stone. \nWILLOW Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get Eloran Danan. \nWith coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across the camp at Sorsha's tent. \nMADMARTIGAN Let's get Elora Danan. \nThey sneak away. \nRAZIEL Wait!  What about me! \nRaziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky. \nEXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN \nWillow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's tent. \nMADMARTIGAN You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the baby. \nMadmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's shoulder. \nRAZIEL I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo= man. \nWillow shrugs apologetically. \nINT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN \nCrouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep. He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside. \nWILLOW (whispers) Come on, Madmartigan...! \nMadmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau- ty, he slowly walks toward her bed. \nWILLOW What are you doing?  Get out of there...! \nMadmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il- luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels. Quietly: \nMADMARTIGAN I love you. \nHe kisses her lips.  Her eyes open. \nSORSHA One move, and you really will be a woman. \nHolding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle. Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch. \nSORSHA You're a fool.  Now put her back. \nMADMARTIGAN I'm not going to let this baby die. \nSorsha presses the knife. \nSORSHA Don't make me kill you. \nWillow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from Sorsha. \nMADMARTIGAN I believe you would... \nSitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places the baby in the straw crib. \nSORSHA Why did you say that? \nMADMARTIGAN Say what? \nSORSHA I love you. \nMadmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back. \nMADMARTIGAN Because it's true. \nSORSHA I don't believe you. \nSorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com- pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine. \nRaziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball, flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze- ment:  the baby starts crying. \nMADMARTIGAN Willow!  Willow!  Are you all right? \nMadmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow. Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL- LAGER points up at the mountain. \nVILLAGER King Kael! \nANOTHER VILLAGER Nockmaar troops! \nMADMARTIGAN (to villagers) Help us. \nIn the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the town. \nINT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY \nMadmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer. \nAIRK Madmartigan.  Settled down with a family huh? \nMadmartigan knocks Airk's hand away. \nMADMARTIGAN You left me to die, friend. \nAIRK You managed alright. \nMADMARTIGAN Is this what's left of your army? \nAmong the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI- ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the ceiling beams. \nOFFICER Keep that baby quiet. \nThey hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nRaziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding alongside Sorsha. \nIn her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil- lage. \nKAEL Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn your village!  Sorsha! \nHe shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where Madmartigan and Willow are hiding. \nINT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY \nWillow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above, shaking dust down on them.  A door opens. \nNobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest. Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone, comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching. Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw. Whisper: \nOFFICER Kill her. \nMadmartigam shakes his head. \nMADMARTIGAN You'll draw the others. \nAirk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away. Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back upstairs. \nINT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY \nSorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two soldiers. \nINT. CELLAR \nIn Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry. \nINT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS \nSorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH. Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave. \nINT. CELLAR \nEveryone sighs with relief. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nIn the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab- laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her horse, and rides off. \nThe deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of the village. \nINT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY \nWillow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel inside. \nINT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY \nDaylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten lava. \nWILLOW Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places. \nMADMARTIGAN Want me to carry Elora? \nWILLOW I'm used to her.  How's she doing? \nWillow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan looks in at the baby's face. \nMADMARTIGAN She's doing a lot better than we are, Peck. \nWillow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension. Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep going. \nINT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE \nHot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub- bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead in the distance. \nMADMARTIGAN Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong? \nWILLOW She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress. \nMADMARTIGAN She's a bird, Willow. \nWILLOW That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and-- \nMADMARTIGAN Watch it! \nWILLOW Ahhh! \nMadmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety. They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something strange. \nThen, something moves on the wall. \nWILLOW I hate this. \nThe cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword. The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an untied balloon. \nSuddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar- tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de- fend Willow and the baby against the army. \nMADMARTIGAN Go, Willow!  Run!  Run! \nWillow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder. At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad- martigan waits. \nThe Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along- side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an- grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit. \nThe army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away. \nMadmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a shadow looms behind him.  He turns. \nThe EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders. It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like visitors. \nMADMARTIGAN Willow!  Willow! \nHe looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them, cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The Eborsisk exhales flames over his head. \nKAEL Go after them! \nSoldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in- cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an- grier. \nWillow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket. A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar- tigan looks to Willow for help. \nMADMARTIGAN Hurry, Willow!  Throw it! \nWillow winds up and throws with all his might.  The Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck- ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The soldier's body turns to stone. \nRAZIEL Look out! \nOne of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby. Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's eye as Willow whisks the baby away. \nThen Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs up over its flaming head and drives his sword down through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby up onto the back of the horse and galloping away. \nKAEL After them!! \nBut as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears. \nEXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY \nINT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD \nThe knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all he has learned. \nWILLOW Capture the enery...limitless power of the will...avvdachh doth indicht rredd baerkinhaekin! \nRaziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands, stretches, and turns into a GOAT. \nWILLOW Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What happened? \nRaziel tilts her goat head. \nRAZIEL I hate this. \nSuddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall. Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover. \nEXT. TIR ASLEEN \nFrom their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders. Sorsha looks up. \nHigh on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently dressed in the glimmering armor of the King! \nKael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti- gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with a huge battering ram and smash it open. \nKAEL Attack!! \nKael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock- maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle attackers on the castle wall. \nINT. TIR ASLEEN \nWillow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court- yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing their swords. \nSorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the stairs toward teh top of the wall. \nINT. ARMORY \nWillow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base- ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man. Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the sword as they close in on him. \nEXT. TIR ASLEEN \nIn the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers as the battle rages. \nUP ON THE WALL \nMadmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin- nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three, four of them with ease.  But not the fifth. \nIt's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court- yeard. \nMadmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens. \nMadmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward. Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword. \nMADMARTIGAN Sorsha. \nSORSHA Madmartigan. \nHe props himself up on his elbows and smiles. \nMADMARTIGAN Whose side are you on? \nShe reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet. \nSORSHA Yours. \nThey look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace. \nMINION Arrrggghhh! \nOut of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves. She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She turns back to Madmartigan. \nSORSHA I love you. \nTheir armor clanks as they throw their arms around each other and kiss, high up on the castle wall. \nINT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD \nKael looks up from his horse. \nKAEL Sorsha!! \nHe sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall, fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great hand.  In it he holds the baby. \nThe army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening. \nINT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nKael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing fear.  Then creaks the door open. \nINT. QUEEN'T TOWER \nBAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil power. \nBAVMORDA Kael! \nCarved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear- ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS. Kael bows. \nKAEL Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child. \nThe baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav- morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back. \nBAVMORDA We must start the ritual! \nShe hears noise outside the castle. \nBAVMORDA Who is that? \nKAEL An army of rebels and traitors. \nBavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically: \nBAVMORDA Where is Sorsha? \nKAEL She has turned against you. \nBavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids: \nBAVMORDA Purify the altar!  Arrange the im- plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha! \nThe druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms out the door. \nEXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK \nThe Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires. Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor- da leers down at them and laughs. \nBAVMORDA This is not an army! \nSorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar- mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback. \nRAZIEL Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick! Hide! \nRaziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent. \nINT. TENT \nWilllow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him. \nRAZIEL Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself! \nWILLOW Why? \nRAZIEL Just do it! \nWillow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to chant. \nEXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE \nMadmartigan faces the queen. \nMADMARTIGAN We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn her over to us! \nBavmorda stabs her finger down at him. \nBAVMORDA You dare to challenge me?  You are not warriors.  You're pigs! \nShe waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape. His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous. \nBAVMORDA You're all pigs! \nThe rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly, they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields. \nSORSHA Mother!  No!! \nBAVMORDA You made your decision! \nAIRK Uphill with our rough weapons, we'll never make it! \nSORSHA Elora Danan will die! \nRAZIEL By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the runic drum! \nWARRIOR Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need more forces.  I say we retreat! \nThe other warriors agree. \nRAZIEL Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell. \nMADMARTIGAN Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel? \nRaziel shakes her head. \nRAZIEL Bavmorda has shielded it with a spell of her own. \nThe warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi- ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep though, scratching the ground with his fingernail. \nThe warriors rumble. \nWILLOW Wait!! \nWillow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him. \nWILLOW I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs. \nMADMARTIGAN Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture! \nWILLOW I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle... \nThe all gather around Willow to listen. \nINT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT \nThunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra- dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds. A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles are lit.  The baby screams on the altar. \nWith a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black cloak. \nINT. TENT - NIGHT \nThey all look at Willow. \nAIRK It's too much work. \nWARRIOR It can't be done. \nSORSHA Kael will never fall for it. \nWillow looks hopefully at Madmartigan. \nMADMARTIGAN (doubtful) I don't know, Willow. \nWILLOW Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her? \nMadmartigan turns away and scratches his beard. \nAIRK Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna listen to a Peck?  You and I are warriors.  You know this plan will never work. \nFrustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away. The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor- sha. \nMADMARTIGAN We'll probably die here, Sorsha. \nSORSHA I have no family. \nThe gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk and his men. \nRAZIEL If we do not fight, and the baby dies, all hope for the future is lost.  I shall face the danger alone if I have to. \nThe men shake their heads. \nWILLOW Me, too. \nMadmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm and silences the protest. \nMADMARTIGAN Time is running out.  We must now decide who's going to leave and who is going to stay... \nEXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT \nLight pulsates in the Queen's Tower. \nLightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy force. \nSORSHA No!! \nPulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as she is about to be implaes, another force stops her. Bavmorda can sense the source of it: \nBAVMORDA Raziel...!! \nThe door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi- cently.  The sorceresses face each other. \nINT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY \nBattle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault, and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min- ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for shelter. \nLike mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up. Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry. And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge axe. \nMadmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready. Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them. \nINT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY \nWillow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and flashes.  He jumps back. \nINT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY \nBavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al- tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the concentration of energy between them. \nRAZIEL The baby will be queen.  It has been foretold, Bavmorda. \nBAVMORDA My ritual will kill the prophecy! Now the child dies with it, its en- ergy exiled into oblivion! (lightning flashes) You see?  I hold the power of the universe! \nRAZIEL Not until your ritual is complete! \nBAVMORDA And who will stop me?  The elements are slaves to my command! \nShe points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning flashes and thunder cracks. \nRAZIEL There is no one who can match your sorcery.  Except me! \nRaziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life, turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be- comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft. \nINT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY \nKael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan. He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up. Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall. \nMadmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down. \nMADMARTIGAN Airk!! \nAirk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding body. \nMADMARTIGAN Airk!  Airk! \nMADMARTIGAN Madmartigan...you're a brave warrior...a true friend...a good man... \nMADMARTIGAN We're gonna win this war, Airk. \nAn incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies. Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up the stairs after Kael. \nINT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY \nThe sorceress continue their battle.  They change each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically and magically. \nIn the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby. \nBAVMORDA As above, so below!  Universe of evil, Raziel!  It conquers even you! \nBavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her, throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes to the altar.  The baby is gone. \nWillow races toward the door with the baby.  The door suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out: \nBAVMORDA *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!* \nWillow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow with her magic. \nBAVMORDA Who are you? \nWILLOW I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician. \nBavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn. \nWILLOW I'm a *great* magician. \n", "test1_input": "WILLOW \n\"WILLOW\" \nStory by George Lucas \nScreenplay by Bob Dolman \nFirst Draft Third Revision November 14, 1986 \n(c) LFL 1986 Lucasfilm LTD.

From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream of a woman giving birth. \nINT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY \nThe scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri- dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a dungeon. \nINT.. DUNGEON - DAY \nSilhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY. \nIn the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the baby in swaddling. \nDRUID Is it a girl? \nETHNA It is a girl. \nDRUID Show me its arm. \nEthna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a small marking. \nDRUID It's true then.  I must tell Queen Bavmorda. \nWith great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the midwife's wrist. \nMOTHER Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're going to kill my baby. \nEthna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes her head at the mother. \nETHNA They'll kill you. \nMOTHER Please save my baby. \nEthna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to- gether some rags and gives them to the mother. \nETHNA Pretend this is the child. \nMOTHER Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you. \nThe mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car- ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs. \nThe mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear. \nQUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries alongside. \nBAVMORDA We will start the ritual at dusk. You're certain this is the one? \nDRUID It bears the markings. \nBAVMORDA I must see for myself!  Just as the omen foretold! \nThe guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the cell. \nBAVMORDA So.  You *were* the one. \nMOTHER Yes.  But nothing you can do will stop the prophecy. \nBAVMORDA This child will have no power over me.... \nBavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi- ously tears them apart. \nBAVMORDA (furiously) Where's the baby! \nOne of the guards looks up the stairs. \n", "test1_true": "Bavmorda flies into a rage. \nBAVMORDA Find that baby!  Use the dogs! Sorsha! \nTwo guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother. \nBAVMORDA Kill her. \nBavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums begin to beat out an alarm. \nEXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY \nTITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling show, clutching the baby. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nNockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts, violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are beaten.  One is killed. \nThe midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby, then runs away from the village. \nEXT. GRASSLAND - DAY \nEthna treks across an open grass field. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nShe huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby. She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs. \nEXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY \nShe scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline. \nEXT. FOREST - DAWN \nEthna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she places the baby and sets it afloat downstream. \nDEATH DOG Bordak! \nThe dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur- ing the dogs.  As they attack her: \nMIDWIFE I don't have her!  No!  No! \nShe grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash- ing at the snarling dogs. \nFrom the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees. \nEXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE \nThe little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees. \nEXT. RIVERBANK - DAY \nAt last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping the baby. \nTITLE SEQUENCE ENDS \nSuddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank. \nEXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY \nHolding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he tosses seeds. \nRANON Dada!  We found something in the river! \nWillow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to- ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from his plow. \nWILLOW I can't run off and play with you now.  I've got work to do. \nRANON/MIMS But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry! \nWillow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with excitement as their father runs toward the river with them. \nEXT. RIVERBANK - DAY \nWE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open. He quickly backs his children away. \nWILLOW Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't know where it's been.  It could be diseased. \nMIMS It's a baby! \n", "test1_id": 438, "test2_input": "They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them. Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he smiles at Rool. \nTEEMO Watch this.  Right between the eyes. \nROOL (to the elves) He never misses. \nArtfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk. \nTEEMO Ooops.  Was that right?  That wasn't right. \nSuddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong. He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm. \nEXT. ELF HOLE - DAY \nThe brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where the elves keep their vultures corralled. \nROOL/TEEMO Hyah!  Hyah!  Git! \nThey untie th evulture and send them flapping away in the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with the baby.  They run for their lives. \nEXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY \nRool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop- ing and screaming. \nEXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY \nThey skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion. The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge. The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels with vertigo. \nWILLOW I can't go out there with the baby! \nROOL/TEEMO (frantically point) Elves!! \nThe elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown- ies wait for him. \nWILLOW Ohhh, I hate this. \nTEEMO Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here. \nWILLOW Why not? \nROOL Because of the trolls. \nWILLOW Trolls? \nThe brownies console Willow with unworried laughter. \nTEEMO Relax.  They only come out at night. \nAn ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk. \nThe elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into the gorge. \nOne troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots. A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot. Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll. \nFlames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree goes crashing down in the gorge. \nWILLOW This is not going well. \nTEEMO Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do. \nWillow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot. \nEXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET \nFading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful sleep. \nEXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT \nWillow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his pant-legs and whisper. \nTEEMO Come on.  This is a privilege.  No- body ever gets called before Her Majesty. \nWonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun. \nSuddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams. Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings his eyes. \nROOL Stand up!  It's the queen! \nCHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag- ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti- ful. \nCHERLINDREA Willow Ufgood. \n", "test2_true": "CHERLINDREA I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom... \nWillow says nothing, still batling the bright light. \nTEEMO Talk!  Say something! \nWILLOW I can't see anything--she's too bright! \nCHERLINDREA I'm sorry... \nThe light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen. She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi- nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies. \nCHERLINDREA Broke-heart of nightingale for our honored guest. \nAll the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip- ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip. \nThe queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le- ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at the mark on the baby's arm. \nCHERLINDREA It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy has come true. \nThe tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi- tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi- cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever- ence. \nWILLOW You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? \nCHERLINDREA She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth. \nWillow starts to get up. \nWILLOW What a relief.  Now I can go home. \nThe queen fragments and reappears right in front of Willow. \nCHERLINDREA No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life. \nWILLOW Me? \nThe Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers himself back down again.  She reappears behind him. \nCHERLINDREA You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen. \nWILLOW What is Tir Asleen? \nWillow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's confusion. \nCHERLINDREA It is a distant castle, where a great king and queen will look after Elora Danan and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule. \nShe is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated by these riddles and mysteries. \nWILLOW Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is it? \nShe reappears again. \nCHERLINDREA The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel. \nWILLOW You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody. \nCHERLINDREA You are very important, Willow. \nWILLOW No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me? (jumps to his feet) I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn! \nFrom down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult- ed. \nWILLOW (continuing) Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers. \nCHERLINDREA My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these... \nCherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand. \nCHERLINDREA They will protect you.  Use them wisely. \nWillow looks at them for quite a while. \nWILLOW They look like acorns. \nCHERLINDREA Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone. \nWillow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the queen. \nWILLOW They're magic?  Are you serious? \n", "test2_id": 439, "test3_input": "Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil- low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside. \nINT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY \nMadmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow. Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from frightened mothers and inspecting them. \nHeavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the bridge. \nSORSHA You!  Are you the mother of that child? \nMADMARTIGAN No. (looks at Llug; in a high voice) I mean yes. \nSorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn. \nSORSHA Let me see it. \nMadmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha. \nMADMARTIGAN (high voice) I can't. \nSORSHA Let me see it. \nWILLOW No!  You can't! \nMadmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha. \nMADMARTIGAN (high voice) I can't. \nSORSHA Why not? \nMADMARTIGAN (to Willow) Why not? \nWILLOW Because she's sick. \nMADMARTIGAN (to Sorsha) Because she's sick. \nSORSHA Give it to me! \nSorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike. She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el- bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off- balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up, pointing their swords and spears. \nSorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders. She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open. He does his best to keep up his femal facade. \nMADMARTIGAN (high voice) Gawd...you're...beautiful... \nSORSHA You're not a woman. \nSorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler. \nLLUG Not a woman??!! \nAll hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives out the window after Madmartigan. \nSORSHA After them!! \nShe grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their way. \nEXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY \nMadmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan rips away his disguise. \nWILLOW Madmartigan!  Wait! \nUp above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti- gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the wagon as it takes off. \nIt has stopped raining.  In the stable under the tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the traffic jam. \nEXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY \nAs Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to hum and takes the baby. \nWILLOW We could've been killed, Madmarti- gan! \nIn the back, the brownies boucne all over the place amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally get their balane they look back in alarm. \nChasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG and a war chariot. \nWillow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring into action.  They struggle with all their might and manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the wagon. \nThe kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse- men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets ready to fire. \nMadmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the road. \n", "test3_true": "WILLOW Heeyah!  Heeyah! \nThen there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the swerving jolt. \nWILLOW Oh no! \nUp ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road. The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor and very nearly goes overboard. \nIn the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard. \nDEATH Bordak!! \nThe dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet. \nDEATH Bordak!! \nIt gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance. \nIn the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad- martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him. \nSuddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off. The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but holds on, dragged by the wagon. \nRool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up in horror as the heavy keg crushes him. \nBut the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them is the war chariot! \nThe Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his head. \nMadmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post. The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK! It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the airl, over a cliff to his death. \nWILLOW Woah...woah...! \nWillow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col- lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into the ditch and lies flat beside Willow. \nSuddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair. \nMADMARTIGAN That girl is a vision. \nAs soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up. \nWILLOW Where's the baby?? \nMADMARTIGAN I thought you had her! \nROOL/TEEMO Willow!! \nThe brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig- ging, flinging debris aside. \nMADMARTIGAN Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...! \nWILLOW Elora Danan! \nWillow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt remorsefully. \nMADMARTIGAN When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf! \nWILLOW Madmartigan!  You saved her life! \nMADMARTIGAN I did? \nWillow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles. Madmartigan switches gears, boasting: \nMADMARTIGAN I mean, of course I saved her life. She's almost my daughter, isn't she? \nWillow bundles the baby and looks up the road. \nWILLOW Let's get out of here before they come back. \nThey hurry off into the darkening woods. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nA campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the brownies point up at the stars. \nTEEMO Northeast is that way.  We've come west and south.  I think. \nMadmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the brownies with sparks. \nROOL Watch it!  You're gonna set us on fire. \n", "test3_id": 440}

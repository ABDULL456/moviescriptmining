CICCI The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, "The Family." 
SENATOR (O.S.) What position did you occupy? 
CICCI At first, like everybody, I was a soldier. 
VIEW ON SENATOR KANE 
A thin, angular Baptist with a Mid-Western accent. 
SENATOR KANE What is that exactly? 
CICCI A button.  You know, Senator. 
SENATOR KANE No, I don't know, explain that exactly. 
CICCI When the boss says push the button on a guy, I push the button, see, Senator? 
The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a hypocrisy. 
The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's attorney, Mr. Questadt. 
QUESTADT You mean you killed people at the behest of your superiors? 
CICCI That's right, counsellor. 
QUESTADT And the head of your family was Michael Corleone. 
CICCI Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone. 
SENATOR KANE Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone? 
CICCI No, Senator, I never talked to him. 
SENATOR SAVOY (very autocratic, deep South, gentlemanly man) There was always a buffer, someone in between you who gave you orders. 
CICCI Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a lot of buffers. 
EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY 
A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and Neri. 
MICHAEL Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci? 
HAGEN No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name. 
Michael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile. 
HAGEN Michael, take the Fifth all the way, that way you can't get into trouble. 
EXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY 
A Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a grouping of me. 
INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY 
Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without asking, but Michael refuses it. 
MICHAEL Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay know I'm back? 
Hagen nods. 
MICHAEL Did the boy get something from me for Christmas? 
HAGEN I took care of it. 
MICHAEL What was it, so I'll know. 
HAGEN A little care he can ride in with an electric motor. 
Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table. 
MICHAEL Fellas, can you wait outside a minute? 
They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear. Only Hagen remains. 
MICHAEL Where's my brother? 
HAGEN Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead. 
MICHAEL I asked about Fredo? 
HAGEN The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York. 
MICHAEL I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him. 
HAGEN My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you. 
MICHAEL (indicating Rocco and Neri on the balcony) They can come in now. 
HAGEN Wait... there's something else. 
MICHAEL Alright. 
Hagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin. 
MICHAEL (impatiently) Go on, tell me. 
HAGEN Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby. 
After a moment: 
MICHAEL Was it a boy or a girl? 
HAGEN Mike, at three and a half... 
MICHAEL What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore! 
HAGEN It was a boy. 
MICHAEL And Kay...she's all right? 
HAGEN She took the Senate Investigation worse. 
MICHAEL Does she blame it on me?  The baby? 
HAGEN I don't know. 
EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY 
The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras. Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar sight of the home he has been forced to be away from. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the estate it was warm, and the trees were full. 
MOVING VIEW 
approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect, as the car pulls in. 
NEW VIEW 
Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the car as it passes.

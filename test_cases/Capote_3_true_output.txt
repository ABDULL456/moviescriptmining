NELLE Danny Burke? (Girl #2 nods) Thank you. 
As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend: 
GIRL #2 Oh, quiet yourself, Janice. 
Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out -- 
NELLE Truman. Truman -- 
Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman, looks at him for several moments. 
NELLE These folks live their lives in a particular way. You need to consider adapting yourself to that fact. 
TRUMAN What -- 
NELLE -- I'm gonna find out where those two kids live. Maybe you'll let me do that alone? 
Nelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of teenagers starts to enter the school. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY 
Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes his hat, slips past the few people standing outside. 
INT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS 
Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into the back room. 
INT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS 
No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy- blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Truman on the PHONE to Jack in Brooklyn. One of Truman's trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads. He drinks, standing at the window. 
JACK (OVER PHONE) I think I scared a friend of yours this morning. He came looking for you while I was writing. 
TRUMAN You hate my friends. 
JACK I wouldn't say hate. So long as they don't knock on my door. 
TRUMAN I saw the bodies today. 
JACK Which? 
TRUMAN The Clutters. I looked inside the coffins. 
JACK That's horrifying. 
TRUMAN It comforts me -- something so horrifying it's freeing. It's a relief. Normal life falls away. (beat) But, then, I was never much for normal life -- 
JACK No, you weren't. 
TRUMAN People here won't talk to me. They want someone like you, like Nelle. Me they hate. 
JACK I can't think of a single quality I share with Nelle. 
TRUMAN Well -- 
JACK Maybe manliness. 
TRUMAN My point exactly. 
JACK It's why I left the Midwest in the first place. I knew I could only find someone like you in New York City. 
On Truman, gazing at the EMPTY TOWN SQUARE below.

EXT. GARDEN CITY, VARIOUS - EARLY MORNING 
A SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING DECORATIONS in his shop window.

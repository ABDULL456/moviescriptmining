INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat. 
In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words apart from slightly muffled cries. 
At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly again, he takes the crowbar out. 
ALEX It's in the loft. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool around the opening. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is David. He stands perfectly still. 
There is a hammer in his right hand. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts himself through and balances on the beams. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing heavily on and across some beams in the loft. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks back and up towards the trapdoor. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only centimetres from his own. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. 
Tim's body lands on Andy. 
David drops himself from the hatch to the floor. 
David takes a large knife from a wooden block.

WINTERS Seal the building! (to Benson) Let's move. 
The SWAT van RUMBLES to life. 
77   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                                       77 
Mary bolts through the store, ducks through a service door. 
78   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SERVICE ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY            78 
Mary bursts out, runs like a spooked horse. 
As she dashes to the mouth of the the alley, she runs smack into the Camaro that almost hit her. It SCREECHES to a stop. The passenger door flies open. 
Mary leans down and looks in, flushes. It's Swan.    He reaches over and yanks her inside, TEARS away. 
The Truck Driver runs into the other end of the alley. 
He starts to give chase as Swan tosses a small package out of the car. The Truck Driver dives for cover as... 
KA-BOOOOM!!!   A dumpster EXPLODES.   The Truck Driver jumps to his feet... 
TRUCK DRIVER (into sleave) We have contact. Black Camaro- 
79   INSIDE THE SWAT VAN                                             79 
The Van SPEEDS up as we hear... 
TRUCK DRIVER (O.C.) -license number HQW-256. 
80   EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY                                         80 
From every direction, unmarked cars, squad units and the SWAT Van converge on the area. 
81   INT.   CAMARO - MOVING                                          81 
Swan drives with deadly confidence, glances at Mary tenderly. 
SWAN You okay? 
MARY Alex- 
SWAN I know.   I warned them. 
He swerves left, then right, pulling a transmitter out of his pocket. 
MARY What is that? 
SWAN Security. 
He sets a dial to 10, pushes a button. 
The transmitter counts down... 9, 8, 7... 
82   EXT. ALLEY - DAY                                               82 
The Camaro tears down a one-way alley going the wrong way. 
INTERCUT WITH TRANSMITTER COUNTDOWN - 6, 5, 4... 
Undercover vehicles race after the Camero, seconds behind. 
They swerve into the alley.

EPPS Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again. 
WES Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot. 
EPPS He's not so-- 
WES He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks. 
EPPS How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet. 
Again Epps looks behind him as Jaeger struggles to his feet and stumbles after his two comrades. 
WES Look at him.  We ought to just leave him behind. 
Epps gives a little laugh like he's just heard a mildly amusing punchline. 
WES(CONT) Like he said:  People get lost in wars all the time.  And out here?  Out here there are eight million ways to die. 
All this talk starts to creep out Epps a little. 
EPPS Okay, so he was riding you.  Get over it. 
Wes smiles a little smile. 
WES I'm just talking. 
They walk on. 
Jaeger works to catch up, muttering to himself as he goes. 
JAEGER Can't even slow up for me.  Wasn't for me they wouldn't even be here.  I'm the one that found the map.  Should have just come by myself.  Should've.  Shouldn't even cut them in.  Shouldn't. 
As Jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come from under his boot.  He goes dead still.  Panic races up and down his spine.  In almost a whisper be says: 
JAEGER Epps... 
Again, louder: 
JAEGER(CONT) Epps! 
Like he couldn't be more annoyed Epps turns around. 
EPPS What!? 
JAEGER Mine. 
Epps isn't sure of what he's heard. 
EPPS What? 
JAEGER Mine.  Land mine! 
Epps doesn't say anything, he just keeps on staring.  Scared, angry they don't get it: 
JAEGER(CONT) I stepped on a land mine! 
Epps and Wes look at each other, then back to Jaeger.  Like he's got no time to mess around: 
EPPS You didn't step on any mine. 
JAEGER I heard it click. 
EPPS If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore. 
JAEGER I heard it. 
WES Maybe it's just a can, or something. 
Jaeger loses it. 
JAEGER JESUS CHRIST, I'M STANDING ON A MINE. SHUT UP, AND GET OVER HERE! 
Just plain sick of all this, Epps and Wes trudge back over to Jaeger. 
EPPS Paranoid, that's your problem.  You're just paranoid.  Why'd the paranoid one have to find the map? 
Epps pulls a knife from his belt.  He sinks to the ground and probes the sand under Jaeger's foot.  Nothing...nothing... WE HEAR THE SOUND OF METAL AGAINST METAL.  Epps goes white. For a second he doesn't move.  Tension falls like a steel curtain.  Slow, careful, Epps withdraws the blade and stands. Jaeger reads the expression on Epps' face. 
JAEGER Oh, God!  Oh God! 
EPPS Just be cool. 
JAEGER It's a mine, isn't it? 
EPPS Just relax.

CARUSO (CONT'D) What the fuck happened? 
Ingram can't answer. Caruso snatches Oscar's wallet out of his hands and waves him away. He and bends down and un-cuffs Oscar. He rolls him over and we see Oscar's eyes are starting to grow distant. 
CARUSO (CONT'D) (whispering to Oscar) Come'on breathe, man. 
Caruso bends down to look at Oscar.

We see Oscar's phone is on the ground ringing. The screen reads, "Sophina Calling". Green (7/5/2012)                                           105. 
109     EXT. FRUITVALE BART STATION ENTRANCE- CONTINUOUS           109 
Sophina now frantic, stands with her cellphone to her ear. 
Kris and Vanessa talk to three POLICE OFFICERS who are guarding the entrance like club bouncers. 
Sophina hangs up the phone, then quickly dials another number. 
INTERCUT WITH 
110     INT. WANDA'S BEDROOM- NIGHT                                110 
Only moonlight fills the room. A cellphone RINGS. Wanda wakes up, checks it, answers the phone. 
WANDA Sophina? 
SOPHINA The police got Oscar and them and we heard something I don't know if it was a beanbag or a taser or what. 
WANDA Sophina, baby calm down. I can't hear you. Is Oscar there with you? 
SOPHINA Naw, he upstairs, with the Police and I can't see them. We downstairs- 
WANDA Where are you? 
SOPHINA We in Oakland, at Fruitvale BART. 
WANDA Did Oscar get arrested? 
SOPHINA I don't know, I think so. 
Wanda closes her eyes for a beat, this hurts. She gets out of bed and starts putting on her clothes.

A SIREN is now super close. Sophina turns to see four PARAMEDICS rush through the emergency entrance turnstile rolling a large gurney with medical equipment on it.

SOPHINA (CONT'D) (into phone) Imma call you back. 
Sophina hangs up the phone and runs towards the paramedics. 
SOPHINA (CONT'D) What happened? 
They ignore her, and quickly get into the elevator with their gear, the doors close behind them. Sophina hears COMMOTION coming from the escalators. She looks over and sees Brandon kicking and struggling, as the Cops bring him down. Cato, Tim, Jason, and Carlos follow, all surrounded by Cops. 
Vanessa and Kris run over to them as the bring them out towards the parking lot, where several Police Cars are parked. 
VANESSA What happened? 
Sophina sprints over to the cars. Cato and Brandon are going so crazy that they don't even notice her. 
NEWSOME (to Sophina) Get back!! 
Sophina get's Jason's attention. 
SOPHINA Where Osc at? What happened? 
JASON THEY FUCKING SHOT HIM PHINA!!! THEY SHOT OSC IN HIS BACK FOR NO REASON!!! 
SOPHINA WHAT? IS HE OKAY? WHERE IS HE? 
The Cops stuff Jason into the back of their car before he can answer. They stuff Tim into the same car.

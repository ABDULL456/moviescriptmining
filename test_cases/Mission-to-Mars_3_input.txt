SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY 
Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day. 
SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020." 
As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE. 
PHIL T minus ten, nine, eight, start ignition sequence, five, four, three, two, one, ignition... Liftoff! 
A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, excited SHOUTS. 
EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON 
DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube. 
CHILDREN (all at once) My turn! My turn! No, I was next! No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can I do one? I want to do one! 
PHIL Guys, guys, please! This is risky stuff here. And I'm a highly trained professional. 
Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for silence. 
PHIL Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch another booster... 
Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and Phil catches it. 
PHIL ...just as soon as he completes his fuel intake. 
ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE 
Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE, MARS ONE!!!" 
WILLIS It'll take us six months just to get to Mars. Another year on the surface, then six months back. That's two years... 
Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well. 
WILLIS I guess what I'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on Earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. Y'know? 
PRETTY GIRL Nice try, Nick. 
As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his beer, swigs it. 
ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open- pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily at the chef. 
KIROV Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty good long rendezvous. 
WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting this as he smiles at Malik. 
WOODY What are you suggesting, Sergei? 
KIROV Maybe you should bring a baseball bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series. 
WOODY Please. Half you guys are foreigners. We'd crush you. 
KIROV No, no, we have equal crews. Three men, one woman. Same handicap. 
He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him. 
WOODY Easy now, you're talking about my wife. (seeing her approach) And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop. 
DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. Then she glances at Kirov, all business now. 
TERRI Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. Thousand bucks make it interesting? 
He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement. 
COTE Eh bien. Winner take all. 
TERRI Good. (smiles sweetly at Kirov) Bring some balls. 
The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt grin. 
WOODY You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, dears." 
The others laugh. 
ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad. 
1ST WIFE ...just not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples to go on this type of mission together. 
One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter. 
1ST WIFE (embarrassed) Nothing personal, Terri. It's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind. 
TERRI (carefully neutral) All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips.

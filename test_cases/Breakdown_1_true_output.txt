JEFF What'd you get? 
Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food. 
AMY Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe they still make this stuff? 
JEFF You kidding. It's probably gourmet cuisine around here. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL - DAY 
Far below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway. There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - FEW MINUTES LATER 
Jeff drives in silence. Amy stares out the window, bored. Looking for a distraction, she picks up a cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AMY (trying to brighten the mood) This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts. 
She gives him a playful glance. 
AMY What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts? 
Jeff shrugs, disinterested. 
JEFF I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car. 
AMY Very funny. (beat) Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars? What would you do with that? 
Jeff stares out the window.       He's not into this. 
JEFF I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm not -- 
Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them -- 
JEFF Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He stole my camera! 
AMY (startled) Who? 
JEFF The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it right under my nose! My brand new Nikon. (pounds wheel in frustration) Goddammit. 
AMY Should we go back? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JEFF What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard. 
AMY Look, maybe if we call the cops -- 
Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks. 
JEFF What the hell? 
The car gives another jolt. 
AMY What'd you do? 
JEFF Nothing.   I -- 
A warning light flashes on the instrument panel. The brakes and steering lose power. The engine quits cold. 
JEFF Hang on -- I can't steer! 
The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road. 
For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor -- the Nikon. She picks it up. 
AMY (deadpan) Found your camera. 
He rolls his eyes.   He yanks the hood release and gets out. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Steam pours from under the    hood of the Cherokee. Amy gets out and looks around    at the scorched wasteland. Jeff goes to the front of    the car, gropes under the hood for the release latch. He     yanks his hand away, burned by the hot metal. 
JEFF Ow! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AMY Are you okay? 
JEFF I'm fine. 
Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn.     She reaches out. 
JEFF (annoyed) I said I'm fine, okay? 
Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.

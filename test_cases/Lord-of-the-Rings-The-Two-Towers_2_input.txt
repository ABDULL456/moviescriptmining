ARAGORN A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none!) 
[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter] 
GIMLI [Jumping and straining to see] Whats happening out there? 
LEGOLAS Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box? 
GIMLI [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!! 
[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.The women and children in the caves huddle together in fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old man next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai in the neck.] 
ARAGORN Dartho! (Hold!) 
[The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. With a hollow groan, the Uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. With a cry, the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts charging.] 
THÉODEN So it begins. 
ARAGORN Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!) 
[The Elves notch their arrow and aim.] 
LEGOLAS Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms.) 
ARAGORN Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!) 
[Arrows rain down on the Uruk-hai below, killing many.] 
GIMLI Did they hit anything? 
THÉODEN Give them a volley. 
GAMLING [to the men] Fire! 
MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE Fire! 
[More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen.] 
ARAGORN Fire! 
GIMLI [Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon! 
[The Uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears.] 
ARAGORN Pendraid! (Ladders!) 
[The Elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. The first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk Berserkers on top of them.] 
ARAGORN Swords! Swords! 
GIMLI Good! 
[Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai climb over the wall.] 
GIMLI Legolas, two already! [Holding up two fingers] 
LEGOLAS Im on seventeen!

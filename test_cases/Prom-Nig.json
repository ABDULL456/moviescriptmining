{"test1_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nAnother SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser. \nSUPER: APRIL 27, 1980. A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull- ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC. \nVIVIAN (O.S.) \n(CALLS OUT) Kim! Turn that music down. You're driving me crazy! Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen, she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open, innocent quality. \nKIM \n(CALLS OUT) Okay, Mom! Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture is written: \"To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing, that is! Love, Nick.\" Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror. This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be- fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the RADIO and exits. \n8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY \nRaymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break- fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he looks much the same way as we remember him. Vivian, however, wears the strain of the past seven years in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner. Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals quick glances at his wife. She does not look up at him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon. \n(CONTINUED) \n8 CONTINUED: \nHAMMOND (reading the paper) I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking of starting up an armed robbery course at the high school.. I've got a feeling it'd be popular... He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard him. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) I just hope there's no trouble at the prom tonight... Kim bursts into the kitchen, interrupting her father with a kiss on the head. \nKIM \n(LAUGHS) Mmmm, sounds like fun! \nHAMMOND \n(SMILING) And how is the next queen of the Winston High Junior-Senior Prom? \nKIM Scared tiff. She leans over to kiss her mother. Vivian automatical- ly turns her cheek to Kim without looking at her. \nKIM \n(CONTINUING) Morning, Mom. We got any yogurt? \nVIVIAN \n(WITHOUT LOOKING \nAT KIM) No, dear. Fix yourself a good meal. You're getting awfully thin. Kim and her father exchange glances. He shrugs \nHAIVMOND who's your lucky escort tonight? \nKIM You know, Daddy... Nick. \n(CONTINUED) \n1L, \n", "test1_true": "HAM`IOND \n(NODS) I've been trying to forget. The boy's too sure of himself. \nKIM \n(INTERRUPTS) Mom, tell him... \nVIVIAN \n(SOFTLY) Seven years ago today. Hammond carefully folds his paper and places it on the table. \nHAM\u00cf\u00bf\u00bdTOND (affects a casual \nATTITUDE) Vi, I made you an appointment with Dr. Fairchild. Vivian finally looks up at him. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) It's this morning, actually. Sorry I forgot to mention it. \nVIVIAN Today? \nHAMMOND \n(LOOKS AWAY) You'd better get ready. He's fitting you in early before his other... people. \nVIVIAN \n(UPSET) It doesn't help. You know that! \nHAMIOND Now, Vi... Vivian stumbles to her feet and rushes out of the kitch- en before he can finish. With a glance at Kim, Hammond hurries after his wife. Going out through the swinging door, he bumps into a young man just entering. \nHAM4OND \n(CONTINUING) Morning, Alex. \n(CONTINUED) \n1J. \nCONTINUED: (3) Hammond exits. Alex, now sixteen, a tall, slender boy, casts a knowing look at Kim. Kim nods. Alex. shakes his head, then begins to rummage through the Pantry, pulling out a Hostess viTikie. ?lopping down at the table, he flips open his electronics book and begins to read. Munching on his Twinkie, he swipes sips from Kim's glass of milk. \nKIM Have you got a date for tonight? His mouth crammed.full of Twinkie, Alex mumbles his reply. \nKIM \n(CONTINUING) I happen to know Jude might be available. Of course, she is older, but... Alex almost chokes. \nALEX C'mon, Kimbo, I may be hard up... \nKIM Alex! Jude's cute... Besides, she's funny and really smart. Give you somebody to do equations with! \nALEX \n(SARCASTIC) Great... Anyway, I'm in charge of the sound system tonight. \n", "test1_id": 2832, "test2_input": "KIM Not bad but it's not romance. \nALEX It'll do for tonight. Kim shoots him a look, then backs off. \nKIM If you get a chance, dance with Jude once or twice, okay? \nALEX Sure. He returns her glass of milk, empty. \n(CONTINUED) \n8 CONTINUED: (4) 8 \nALEX \n(CONTINUING) Any more milk? \n9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nHammond and Vivian are standing by the fireplace. His hand is on her shoulder. She faces the mantel, her back to him. On the mantel is a small shrine to the memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph, fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a glass case. \nHAMMOND Trust me. Vivian does not move. Finally, after a long pause, she turns toward her husband. Her eyes filled with tears, she nods. \n10 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 10 \nHammond is driving. Vivian stares blankly out the win- dow at the grimy city streets. Sitting in the back, Kim and Alex exchange uncertain glances. A tense si- lence pervades. \n11 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 11 \nThe Hammonds' car pulls up in front of a towering modern building. \n12 INT. CAR - DAY 12 \nHammond cuts off the engine and turns to Kim and Alex. \nHAMMOND I'll just be a minute... Vivian is already reaching for the door handle, \n13 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 13 \nAlex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his mother. Taking her arm, he helps her out. Kim leans over in the back seat. \nKIM See you later,'Mom. Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm and leads her into the imposing building. \n14 INT. LOBBY - DAY 14 \nHammond and Vivian cross the room. Though she offers no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along. They hurry into an elevator after an elderly CLEANING WOMAN carrying a mop and a bucket. \n15 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 15 \nThey stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing. Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo- man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump in fright. \nCLEANING WOMAN Could I have one of those? My nerves are shot this morning. With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian rushes out of the elevator. Hammond follows. \n16 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 16 \nHammond and Vivian move down the long, empty hallway. As they round a corner, a figure is visible unlocking a door. \nHAI` IOND \n", "test2_true": "17 INT. OFFICE - DAY 17 \nFairchild bustles about the reception area, turning on lights, checking his messages and appointment calendar. Fairchild is obsessively neat, the office reflects him. \nHAIIOND We appreciate your seeing... us. I know how busy you must be. Vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing with a kitten. Catching Fairchild's eye, Hammond nods toward the outer door. Vivian does not notice the gesture. \n(CONTINUED) \n17 CONTINUED: 17 Fairchild nods in return. Stepping over to his inner office, he opens the door. \nFAIRCHILD Have a seat, Vivian. I'll be right in. She slowly crosses the room, turning suddenly in the doorway. \nVIVIAN \n(TO HAMMOND) Don't forget we're going to the cemetery this afternoon. I want Robin to have her flowers. Hammond moves over to his wife. Taking her by the shoulders, he kisses her lightly on the forehead. \nHAMMOND I won't forget. Vivian looks from Hammond to Fairchild, who smiles. She enters the office, leaving the door open. Hammond shakes hands with Fairchild, and for Vivian's benefit adds... HA\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI`i IOND \n(CONTINUING) Thank you, Doctor. Hammond exits. \n18 , INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 18 \nHammond leans against the wall outside Fairchild's of- fice. He glances at his watch. The door opens and Fairchild steps out, holding a container. Hammond walks with him down the corridor towards the water fountain. \nH.ANMOND She's at it again. \nFAIRCHILD \n(NODS) Today's the date? \nHAIM BOND Seven years ago today Robin was killed. Fairchild looks up from filling his container with water. \n(CONTINUED) \n18 CONTINUED: 18 \nHA,E,10ND \n(CONTINUING; MUSING) This would have been her first prom. \nFAIRCHILD Pardon? \nHAKMOND Tonight's the Junior-Senior Prom at our high school. Robin would have been sixteen, She and Alex. \nFAIRCHILD The twins... How is Alex? \nHAIIOND Fine. I just thank God he was too young to really understand what happened to his sister. \nFAIRCHILD And your older daughter? \nHANMOND \n(SMILES) Kimmy's my princess. Sometimes she'll get depressed for a while... but it never lasts long. Young people seem so much more... resilient. They walk back to the office. \nFAIRCHILD (looking up at Hammond) And yourself? No scars? \n", "test2_id": 2833, "test3_input": "There's a small marble headstone inset with the carved face of an angel and the inscription \"Robin Anne Hammond 1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us.\" Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar- ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection. \nHP`\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMOND (0. S. We have to go, Vi. \n(CONTINUED) \nJ4. \n65 CONTINUED: 65 She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers. Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her shoulders. She looks at him. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) We have to get back. She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away. Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo- ment longer, then. he, too, goes. \n66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY \nDuring the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing a silver whistle hanging from her neck. A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa- sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the delight of Sykes. At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter- rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over. \nHENRI-ANNE \n(SOUTHERN ACCENT) No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend from the waist... Squat! \n(DEMONSTRATES) Always squat to retrieve. Otherwise, you look like the broad side of a barn! (glares at Sykes) Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes? Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls' Laughter. \n66 CONTINUED: 66 \nHENRI-ANNE \n(CONTINUING) That's enough for today, ladies. We don't want you all worn out for the ball tonight. Kim, Jude and Kelly gather'around with the other girls. \nJUDE \n(GIGGLING) Ball? \nKIM Shhh! Kelly takes Jude aside as Kim and Vicki approach Henri Anne. \nKIM \n(CONTINUING; \nWHISPERS) You sure she likes Weller? \nVICKI Positive. I heard her say she's had the hots for him since they met! \nKIM She said that? \nVICKI Well, not exactly. \nHENRI-ANNE Oh, Kim. You'll be in the gym promptly at three-fifteen for rehearsal? \nKIM Well, actually no, Miss Benton. can't make it...

Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki. \nVICKI He keeps making Kim stay after school in detention study hall for no reason... Just so he can be near her. \nHENRI-ANNE That's horrible! Kim gulps. \nHENRI-ANNE \n(CONTINUING) You mean to tell me that awful man A girl half his age! (a very slight \nSMILE) So you have detention this afternoon? Kim nods meekly. Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face. \nHENRI-ANNE \n(CONTINUING; \nFINALLY) Leave everything to me... She hurries away. Kim turns on Vicki and starts to protest. \nVICKI \n(INTERRUPTING) It worked, didn't it? \n67 EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY 67 \nKim and Vicki, and behind them, Jude and Kelly are walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the tennis courts. Vicki's in high spirits and Jude still can't stop giggling. Vicki spots old Sykes heading out toward the playing field. She calls out to him. \n(CONTINUED) \n67 CONTIPRJED 67 \nVICKI Mr. Sykes! \nKIM Vicki, don't... \nVICKI Oh, Mr. Sykes... Sykes stops, turns around. \nVICKI \n(CONTINUING) This is just for you... She turns, bends over, quickly yanks down her shorts and moons him. There's a squeal of laughter from Jude and from Kelly. Vicki whips her shorts back up and runs to the gym door, the other girls in pursuit. Kim looks back at Sykes. He's just standing in the field, not moving. There's a look in his eyes. \n68 INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY 68 \nKim and Kelly are undressing. Three girls pass them headin g for the showers. \nKELLY I'm not like the others, Kim. Drew needs somebody like Vicki who'll give him what he wants. \nKIM \n(LAUGHS) Vicki's sex life is more talk than action. Besides, Drew wants you. \nKELLY I'm afraid if I don't make it with him he'll find somebody who will. \n", "test3_id": 2834}

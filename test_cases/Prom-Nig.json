{"train": "PROM NIGHT \nWritten by \nWilliam Gray \nFrom a story by \nBob Guza \nFINAL DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY \nSUPER: April 27, 1973 All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children. Two faded yellow buses stand ready. \nThe lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL. A swarm of children pours out the door and down the broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward the cars and the buses. \nMoving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND, nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway.. Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub- dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old, two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister. \nALEX C'mon, Robin. \nROBIN \n(STUTTERING BADLY) W-w-where's D-d-daddy? \nALEX He's got a meeting at the high school. We're supposed to walk home with Kim... (sees Robin watching the young couple) She's too busy. Let's go by ourselves. \nROBIN N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait. \nALEX Why? Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands. He's angry. \nALEX \n(CONTINUING) You're crazy, I'm not waiting. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED : He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim. Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking towards her and Nick is bicycling away. \nKIM Okay, let's go. The sisters start to walk across the lawn. \nROBIN Y-you 1-1-like him? \nKIM Who? \nROBIN \n(SMILES SHYLY) Y-you know. \nKIM Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess. They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at her big sister. \nROBIN \n(FINALLY) Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him? \n(MALICIOUSLY) Now you've done it, you idiot! The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the \"killers\" rush towards the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es- cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face. \nWENDY \n(CONTINUING; SLOWLY) Kill, kill, kill... Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin. Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room, bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy in pursuit of Robin. Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, \"KILL, KILL ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap- pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out blindly, escapes the \"killer.\" \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3 \nDarting into the large room, Robin collapses against a wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up- right near the opening are several sheets of window glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad- der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in the doorway, a vicious look on her face. \nWENDY Killers, here! Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away. \nROBIN N-n-n-no! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting \"Kill, kill.\" Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening. Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates. But as Wendy and her fellow \"killers\" close in on her, Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and grabs the ladder. \nROBIN \n(CONTINUING) P-p-please! Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and send it hurtling down directly at Robin. The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the glass slices through her neck. She is instantly decapitated. Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally, he manages to speak. \nNICK \n(WHISPERING HOARSELY) We gotta get somebody quick! Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his arm. \nWENDY Are you crazy? They'll put us in jail! Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow silent. \nWENDY \n(CONTINUING) If we tell anyone, they'll say it's our fault. Who'd believe it was an accident? Nick starts to protest. \nWENDY \n(CONTINUING; \nINTERRUPTING) Listen to me! \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nWENDY (C ONT D ) We'll go home now and never ever tell anyone. They'll think it was an accident. 1,10 one but us will ever know. She looks at each of them. They are still too numb to respond. \nWENDY \n(CONTINUING) Everybody swear never to tell! Wendy glares at Jude. \nWENDY \n(CONTINUING) Jude? \nJUDE \n(SOFTLY) I swear. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nAnother SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser. \nSUPER: APRIL 27, 1980. A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull- ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC. \nVIVIAN (O.S.) \n(CALLS OUT) Kim! Turn that music down. You're driving me crazy! Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen, she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open, innocent quality. \nKIM \n(CALLS OUT) Okay, Mom! Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture is written: \"To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing, that is! Love, Nick.\" Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror. This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be- fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the RADIO and exits. \n8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY \nRaymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break- fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he looks much the same way as we remember him. Vivian, however, wears the strain of the past seven years in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner. Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals quick glances at his wife. She does not look up at him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon. \n(CONTINUED) \n8 CONTINUED: \nHAMMOND (reading the paper) I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking of starting up an armed robbery course at the high school.. I've got a feeling it'd be popular... He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard him. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) I just hope there's no trouble at the prom tonight... Kim bursts into the kitchen, interrupting her father with a kiss on the head. \nKIM \n(LAUGHS) Mmmm, sounds like fun! \nHAMMOND \n(SMILING) And how is the next queen of the Winston High Junior-Senior Prom? \nKIM Scared tiff. She leans over to kiss her mother. Vivian automatical- ly turns her cheek to Kim without looking at her. \nKIM \n(CONTINUING) Morning, Mom. We got any yogurt? \nVIVIAN \n(WITHOUT LOOKING \nAT KIM) No, dear. Fix yourself a good meal. You're getting awfully thin. Kim and her father exchange glances. He shrugs \nHAIVMOND who's your lucky escort tonight? \nKIM You know, Daddy... Nick. \n(CONTINUED) \n1L, \nHATIOND (after a pause) I've learned to live them.. Vivian seems worse this time. \nFAIRCHILD \n(NODS) The persistence of Vivian's trauma. I wonder if there isn't something more serious at work here? \nHAMOND Something more serious than her daughter's death? \n19 INT. OFFICE - DAY 19 \nVivian fidgets in her chair. She seems very small and vulnerable in the large, somber office. \n20 INT. CAR (MOVING) DAY 20 \nAlex is seated opposite his father in the front seat. Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on the car RADIO. Alex fiddles with the tuning dial, searching for music more to his tastes. Lost in thought, Hammond does not see the young girl skipping through the pedestrian crossing. \nKIM \n(SCREAMS) Daddy! Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against the dashboard. \n21 EXT. STREET - DAY 21 \nThe CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri- fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the girl giggles nervously and skips away. \n22 INT. CAR - DAY 22 \nHammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children. \nHAMMOND You all right? They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond slips the car into gear and cautiously continues driving. \nKIM You're worried about Mom? \nHALMOND I was... He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play- ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass over the music. \nKIM Hey, keep that! Alex groans but does as she asks. \nALEX Disco sucks! \nHAMZMOND \n(REPROVINGLY) Alex! \n(CONTINUED) \n22 CONTINUED: 22 \nALEX Sorry, Dad... (turns back to \nKIM) Disco bites it! \nHAMMOND \n(DRYLY) That's much better. The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot. They pile out. \n23 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 23 \nHammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles Kim and she huddles against her father. A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing a pair of electric hedge clippers. \nHAM 0ND (taking her hand) What happened? \nWOMAN (ADELE) Well you see, Mr. Hammond, the, air conditioner fan was set for high but... \nHAP-MOND \n(INTERRUPTS) Please, Miss... Adele, \nADELE \n(INTERRUPTS) Cooper... Ms. Cooper. \nHA MOND Whatever! I have some important calls to make. Please see that I'm not disturbed... (wades through the papers to his inner \nOFFICE DOOR) , and put all this back where it belongs! He enters his office. \n26 INT. HA,1NI OND' S OFFICE - DAY 26 \nHammond tosses his briefcase onto the desk and drops into his chair. He stares at the telephone for a long moment, drumming his finger on the desk. \nCUT TO: \n27 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 27 \nA pink TELEPHONE RINGS. The plush bedroom is empty; suddenly Wendy Richards rushes in. Now eighteen, Wendy is a raven-haired beauty with a full figure, accentua- ted by a low-cut black blouse and tight designer jeans. Tossing her books onto the bed, she eagerly grabs the receiver. \nWENDY \n(BREATHLESSLY) Nick? A long pause, followed by HEAVY BREATHING. Wendy is about to respond when the inhuman VOICE speaks in an eerie, androgynous stutter. \nTELEPHONE VOICE W-Wendy? T-t-tonight it's m-m-my t-turn! Wendy's shock quickly turns to anger. \nWENDY Screw you, Lou! Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her books, she storms out of her bedroom. \n28 INT. FRONT HALL - DAY 28 \nWendy hurries do-in the ornate staircase. Waiting at the bottom holding the girl's sweater is MAUDE, the Richards' elderly housekeeper. \nMAUDE You be home for dinner, Wendy? Wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman. \nWENDY How the hell do I know? She exits. \nL3. \n29 EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - DAY 29 \nThe expansive residence sits back off the road in this upper-middle-class suburb. Wendy climbs into her white Mustang and starts the engine. TIRES SQUEALING, she ROARS out of the driveway with the RADIO BLASTING. \n30 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 30 \nKelly Lynch is just finishing breakfast when the TELEPHONE RINGS. The petite blonde eighteen-year-old stuffs a last bite of toast into her mouth and picks up the receiver. \nKELLY \n(MUMBLING ) Hullo? A pause, then HEAVY BREATHING. Kelly's eyes grow wide as the dreadful voice speaks. \nTELEPHONE VOICE K-K-Kelly? T-tonight it's m-m-\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIZ Horrified, Kelly drops the phone. The DOORBELL RINGS. Frightened, she gasps, hugging the wall. The DOORBELL RINGS again. Very slowly she moves out of the kitchen. \n33 INT. HALL - DAY \nJude Cunningham is leaving her house when the TELE- PHONE RINGS. The chubby, brown-haired girl rushes back into the hallway. A plump, middle-aged woman hurries out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on an apron. MRS. CUNNINGHAM eagerly watches her daughter snap up the receiver. The pause, the HEAVY BREATHING and the strange, terrifying voice. \nTELEPHONE VOICE J-Jude? T-t-tonight it's my-my t-t-turn! A disappointed Jude slowly replaces the receiver. Mrs. Cunningham looks on sympathetically. Still no date? \nJUDE (shakes her head) Getting closer, though. \n33 CONTINUED: 33 \nMRS. CUNNINGHAM A boy? \nJUDE \n(SMILES) An obscene call... and not very obscene at that! Mrs. Cunningham starts to say something. \nJUDE \n(CONTINUING) Sorry, Mom, gotta run. Giving her mother a quick peck on the cheek, Jude exits. \n34 EXT. CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe small house appears almost identical to the other dwellings in this lower-middle-class neighborhood. Jude pulls an apple from her large purse, munching while she walks to the bus stop. A gaudily-painted van pulls up alongside her. The win- dow slowly rolls down and a young curly-haired GUY wearing glasses sticks out his head. \nGUY Hey, beautiful, need a lift? Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside her. \nJUDE No thanks. \nGUY C'mon, I won't bite. Jude chomps down hard on her apple. \nJUDE So who are you? TheGuy leans further out the window. \nGUY Seymour Stone but.. He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk. Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly back onto the road. \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: 27 \nGUY \n(CONTINUING) but they call me Slick! Jude laughs, almost choking on her apple. \nJUDE I can see why... How old are you, Slick? \nGUY (SLICK) Old enough... \nJUDE I've heard about guys like you... running over girls on the sidewalk... \nSLICK Just some girls... If they're good lookin' I give 'em a ride. \nJUDE \n(SMILING) Can you stop that thing? Slick jams on the brakes. The van jerks to a halt. He opens the passenger door. \nJUDE \n(CONTINUING) I'm going straight to Winston High, understand? \n37 CONTINUED: 37 \nJUDE \n(BRIGHTENING) Yeah? Well, as a matter of fact.. \n(THINKING FURIOUSLY) My date is uh, not that certain... Something might be happening, he's not sure, you know? \nSLICK \n(NODDING SOLEMNLY) Yeah, right... Jude watches him. He's slow picking up her hint. \nJUDE So I guess we're both maybe not going... \nSLICK Yeah... too bad... He looks at her. \nSLICK \n(CONTINUING) Hey, you think... \nJUDE I'd love to! She kisses him on the cheek. \nJUDE \n(CONTINUING) See you at eight, same spot! She exits, hurrying across the parking lot as he grins foolishly after her. Suddenly, it dawns on him. \nSLICK \n(CALLS OUT) What's your name? \n38 INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY 38 \nA tall rugged-looking man wearing a police uniform stands in ,the center of the room checking over his revolver. He's DARRYL McBRIDE, forty-eight years old and a veteran Sergeant on the Police Force. Satisfied with the condition of the gun, he jams it back into its holster, turns, calls out. \n(CONTINUED) \n38 CONTINUED: \nMCBRIDE Let's go, son! A handsome dark-haired boy of eighteen emerges from a back room. He's Nick McBride. His father pulls open the front door. \nMCBRIDE \n(CONTINUING) For a guy who moves so fast around a disco floor, you are the slowest goddamn thing... Nick nods sleepily, yawns. \nNICK Right, I know... McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his books and follows. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Nick hesi- tates. Shaking his head he exits, shutting the door. \n39 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe TELEPHONE keeps RINGING. McBride looks at his son. \nMCBRIDE Why didn't you answer i \nNICK It's just Wendy. She's pissed off. She wants me to take her to the prom tonight. \nMCBRIDE I thought you two broke up. The TELEPHONE continues to RING. \nNICK Three months ago... you can't tell Wendy anything she doesn't want to hear. \nWENDY It's not who you go with, honey... it's who takes you home. \nKIM I'll try and remember that. \nWENDY Wait and see, bitch... Just wait and see... \n43 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 43 \nThe corridor is packed with students -- flirting, gossiping, fighting, a few even studying. We PICK UP Kim and VICKI CANTRELL, eighteen, moving down the crowd- ed hallway through the various conversations. \nKIM : So then she threatened me. \nVICKI Wendy's a jerk! \nFIRST MALE (V.0.) She didn't! \nSECOND MALE (V.0.) Swear to God! \nFIRST MALE (V.0.) \n(INCREDULOUS) In the teachers' lounge? \nOTHER VOICES Dual headers... thinks he's a fox... Dust'll run you... long and slinky and tight... swings like my mother... how much for half a lid? Jude joins Kim and Vicki as they walk. \nJUDE guys. \nKIM Jude. \n(CONTINUED) \n43 CONTINUED: 43 \nVICKI Missed you on the bus today. \nJUDE I didn't ride it. \nVICKI I thought you were too big to hide. \nKIM \n(CHIDING) Vicki... \nJUDE \n(IGNORING VICKI) I got a ride. \nVICKI Who with? \nKIM None of your business. \nJUDE \n(BLASE) A guy. Vicki and Kim are left hanging, waiting for more. \nVICKI \n(FINALLY) Jude! Jude can hold it back no longer. \nKIM Shhh! \nVICKI Oh no you don't... (turns back and calls to Nick) She's smiling, Nick. Big grin spread all over her face. Kim punches her friend but the damage is done. Nick grins broadly. Blushing, Kim turns back, flashes him a quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots of Vicki and Jude. \n44 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 44 \nA tall dark figure walks quickly down a concrete cor- ridor. From somewhere nearby, loud VOICES, SPLASHING water, can be HEARD. \n45 INT. POOL GALLERY 45 \nA shadow moves behind the opaque glass plate of a heavy door. \n(CONTINUED) \n45 CONTINUED: 45 The door edges open. Raymond Hammond appears. Prop- ping the door open with his shoulder, he starts down across the narrow gallery to the pool below. \n46 INT. POOL 46 \nA class of senior male students occupies the water, among them Nick McBride and Drew Shinnick. With no Phys. Ed. instructor in sight, it's a general goof-off period. Nick walks out onto the diving board. Drew is treading water below him. \n47 ANGLE ON HAMMOND 47 as he watches Nick intently from the gallery door. \n48 INT. POOL 48 \nNick launches himself out over Drew in an apparent belly-flop. At the last moment, he tucks in and hits the water in a flipped over cannonball. He surfaces to a chorus of whistles and cheers. It was a close shave. \nDREW You wanta take care of yourself, man... Kim's expecting a lot from you tonight... Nick laughs. \n49 INT. GALLERY DOOR 49 \nThe door is easing shut. Hammond is nowhere to be seen. \n50 INT. GYM - DAY 50 \nA side door opens. Hammond steps in, gazes around. The gym is empty, silent. He walks to the stage steps, climbs up, pushes through the thick curtain. \n51 INT. GYM - BACKSTAGE 51 \nIt's a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions, discarded flats from old student productions, banks of lights. Hammond crosses to a rear door, tries it. It's locked. He turns back. As he does so there's a sudden WHIRRING SOUND. A row of spotlights flashes on right in front of him, almost blinding him. He tries to shield his eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \n51 CONTINUED: 51 He spins around. Another bank of lights flares at him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's a LOUD POP. Then a VOICE. \nALEX (O.S.) Who's there? Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's an elevated platform where the electronic control panel is located. Alex peers down. \nHAMMOND Alex?... What the hell're you doing? \nALEX I'm testing the board... I didn't hear you... nobody's supposed to be here yet... \nHAMMOND No, well'... He looks around. He's still trying to get himself together. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) I'm.. I'm thinking we might have a fire hazzard here, all these extra lights. He looks awkward, as if he'd been caught at something. H.A1 ll4OND \n(CONTINUING) all right... He turns, climbs down the stage steps and starts back across the gym. At the other end of the floor a door opens, Sykes looks in. Hammond sees him. \nKIM But, Mr. Weller, tonight's the prom... \nWELLER \n(DISDAINFULLY) Tell that to your... \n(SNIFFS) hunk! He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk. The three girls hurriedly exit. \n53 INT. ROOM (SCHOOL) - DAY 53 \nA hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston High yearbook, the back pages where the individual photographs of graduating students are placed. The hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head shot of Nick McBride. The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards. The yearbook is slammed shut. \n54 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 54 \nKim, Jude and Vicki enter the crowded room. MUSIC from several portable RADIOS can be HEARD above the clamor as the girls move into the long lunch line. Kim spots Alex seated nearby and waves to him. \n(CONTINUED) \n4L. \n54 CONTINUED: 54 \nVICKI \n(NUDGING JUDE) Here comes the incredible hunk himself. Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down the line towards them. He is carrying a tray piled high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy. Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning. \nKIM Looks like a party. \nJUDE Yeah -- I don't think he's gonna be too good for my diet... Slick moves down the lunch line. Suddenly he is bumped from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying across the room. Looking around, Slick jumps back, startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask. \nSLICK \n(ANGRILY) Hey, clown, what the... Three of Lou's gang quickly step up behind the masked figure. \nLOU Say what? \nSLICK \n(SHRUGS) Forget it, Lou. \nLOU \n(SMIRKS) That's what I figured. Slick bends over to pick up his lunch. \nSLICK \n(SOFTLY) Asshole! Lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is standing behind Kim. Lou nuzzles Kim's neck. \nLOU (muffled by the mask) Like me better now? \n(CONTINUED) \n54 CONTINUED: (2) 54 Startled, Kim spins around. Her fear quickly becomes anger. \nKIM It's an improvement! She turns her back to him. \nLOU You like it so much... (spins her around to \n(EXASPERATED) No, Vi. I didn't forget. I told you we'd go to the cemetery... The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the corner. Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods toward the outer office. Hammond gestures for her to wait. She persists until he angrily takes the receiver from his ear and covers the mouthpiece. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) What is it? \nADELE \n(WHISPERING) There are some gentlemen here to see you, Mr. Hammond. \nHAMMOND Can't it wait? \nADELE I didn't ask... But one looks a little like that child in the picture on your desk. Hammond automatically glances at the photograph of Robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family. \nHAMMOND (into the receiver) I've got to go now, Vi... We'll be there within the hour... There's a loud CLICK on the other end of the line. \nHAIIOND \n(CONTINUING) Damn! \n(CONTINUED) \n56 CONTINUED: 56 Frustrated, Hammond slams the receiver into its cradle. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) All right, send them in. The two Male Teachers enter first, followed by Lou and finally Alex. Hammond gives his son a sharp look, then turns to glare at Lou. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING ;WEARILY) You again? \nTEACHER \n(NODS) Brawling in the cafeteria... both of them. He places Lou's ski mask on Hammond's desk. The prin- cipal glances at it. \nHAMMOND \n(FINALLY) Thank you. I'll handle it. The Teachers exit. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) Explanations? He looks at Alex. The boy stares at the floor and says nothing. Hammond holds the mask up to Lou. \nHAIIOND \n(CONTINUING) Halloween? \nLOU I was just foolin' around with this girl... \nALEX \n(INTERRUPTS) Kim! Hammond frowns. \nLOU when this -- your son tackled me and... \nHAMMOND \nKIM \n(SMILING) On the prowl! \n58 EXT. STREET - DAY \nWendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around corners. \n59 INT. MUSTANG 59 \nLou sits pinned to the passenger seat, eyes wide, staring straight ahead as if he can't quite believe this trip. His bravado seems to have left him. He glances over at Wendy in the driver's seat. She's puffing on a cigarette, handling the wheel almost casually. She's in control, \n60 EXT. DRIVE-IN 60 \nThe Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van. The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in. \n61 INT. MUSTANG 61 \nLou's still pinned to his seat. Wendy shuts off the engine, looks at him. He looks at her, lets out a long deep breath. A cute little CAR-HOP in a cut-off costume and roller skates glides over. She leans into Wendy's window, talks through a wad of gum. \nCAR-HOP Ready to order? \nWENDY \n(TO LOU) What do you want? Lou's shifting around in his seat, pulling himself together. \nLOU I'm uh... a little short on cash.. \nWENDY You can owe me. \nLOU Yeah? Okay then, a couple of burgers, a large fries... what kind of beer you got? \nCAR- HOP C'mon man, this is a drive-in not a bar. \nLOU All right, all right... don't get nervous... Gimme a coke... \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n61 CONTINUED: \nLOU (CONT'D) (nods to Wendy) She'll have the same. \nWENDY A small diet cola. \nWENDY That ' sit. The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou. \nWENDY I'll buy you one for Christmas, all right? Now, how do I know you're serious? \nLOU Whatta you mean, serious? I hate that school, Hammond and his asshole family... \nWENDY I don't want anyone hurt... not badly. \nLOU You got it... anything your little heart desires... \nWENDY Lou, shouldn't we go over this. Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her. \nThere's a small marble headstone inset with the carved face of an angel and the inscription \"Robin Anne Hammond 1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us.\" Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar- ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection. \nHP`\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMOND (0. S. We have to go, Vi. \n(CONTINUED) \nJ4. \n65 CONTINUED: 65 She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers. Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her shoulders. She looks at him. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) We have to get back. She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away. Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo- ment longer, then. he, too, goes. \n66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY \nDuring the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing a silver whistle hanging from her neck. A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa- sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the delight of Sykes. At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter- rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over. \nHENRI-ANNE \n(SOUTHERN ACCENT) No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend from the waist... Squat! \n(DEMONSTRATES) Always squat to retrieve. Otherwise, you look like the broad side of a barn! (glares at Sykes) Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes?

It's her photo, torn from the School Yearbook. She rips it from the door, looks at it. \nWENDY \n(CONTINUING) What's this for, Melanie? Her voice echoes through the empty room.

The door to the locker roor slowly opens behind them. \nKIM Let him? She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor. Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE. \nWENDY (O.S.) If you ever try anything like that again, you cow! Melanie thinks it's hilarious. \nMELANIE (to Kim and Kelly) You should've seen her jump... Nadia Comenici never did better... Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand.

Know any good-looking fathers? \nCONTINUED) \n84 CONTINUED: (2) 84 \nKIM \n(SMILES) - I'll keep my eyes open. See you later. She exits as Adele slowly lowers her legs to the floor. \n85 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 85 \nJude approaches her locker, stops. There's a picture taped to her locker door, her picture, ripped out of the Winston High Yearbook. She looks at it, reaches up and pulls it off the door. She winces, looks at her finger. It's bleeding. She looks at the picture. There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it. Jude hears SOMEONE COMING. She turns to see Kelly com- ing toward her. \nKELLY Jude... look... She has something in her hand. It's a photo of her, a, Yearbook photo with the same torn edges.

On the mantel is a small shrine to the memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph, fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a glass case. \nHAMMOND Trust me. Vivian does not move. Finally, after a long pause, she turns toward her husband. Her eyes filled with tears, she nods. \n10 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 10 \nHammond is driving.

ELEVATOR - DAY 15 \nThey stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing. Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo- man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump in fright. \nCLEANING WOMAN Could I have one of those? My nerves are shot this morning. With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian rushes out of the elevator. Hammond follows. \n16 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 16 \nHammond and Vivian move down the long, empty hallway.

Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to face Kim. \nVIVIAN Oh.. I don't know what I was thinking. \nKIM \n(SMILES) It doesn't matter. \nVIVIAN \n(EXCITEDLY) Have you seen the new satin pantsuit I'm wearing? Vivian smiles at her daughter.

She carefully pulls out her prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a white, clinging material. Holding it up against her body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror on the closet door. Watching her reflection, Kim twirls around, hugging the gowm to her body. Satis- fied, she gently lays the go%.m on her bed. \n(CONTINUED) \n92 CONTINUED: 92 Kim begins to undress. Outside, the twilight shadows deepen. THROUGH the VINDOM, a slight movement is SEAN among the trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes VISIBLE, ap- proaching.the window. Kim does not notice the figure as she finishes undressing. She wraps herself in a robe and sits at her dressing table. Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy figure peering inside. When Kim stands up, the figure slips away from the window.

Hammond forces a smile. \nHAMMOND \n(CONTINUING) I'm joking, Vi, it's beautiful.._ C'mon... She hesitates, then comes down to him. \nVIVIAN I told you I'd bought it. \nHAMMOND Of course you did.

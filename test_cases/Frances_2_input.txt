She is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. In the background we HEAR a voice: 
DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain. 
The lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching. 
DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, I am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour. 
Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round and round. The voice drones on. 
DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) The operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever. 
We now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney. 
DR. HARLINGTON We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty. 
Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket... 
DR. HARLINGTON This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment. 
The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted. 
DR. HARLINGTON In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening... 
Frances turns away and stares at the fan again. There is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring... 
DR. HARLINGTON ...with diminished creativity and imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed. 
We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn. 
DR. HARLINGTON These patients will soon be leaving the hospital. 
Harlington's face moves vaguely into Frances' view. 
DR. HARLINGTON Lobotomy gets 'em home. 
He moves directly over Frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan. As the leucotome descends, we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY 
Total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... This house is easing slowly back to nature... 
INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Neglect is just as evident inside. Dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. Lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. She has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. The scrapbook is open on her lap. 
LILLIAN What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances. 
Ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. FOUR REPORTERS crouch on the floor, totally bored. Yesterday's headlines are now old news. 
LILLIAN They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart... 
Two Reporters rise and edge toward the door. 
REPORTER Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're going to have to... uh... 
THIRD REPORTER (rising) Yeah, I better pack it in too. 
LILLIAN (distractedly) Pardon? Oh, would you like more lemonade? 
The last Reporter gets to his feet. 
FOURTH REPORTER (kindly) I think we've had enough. Thank you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye. 
He follows the others out. Lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. Ernest stares into the fire. 
LILLIAN You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home. That'll brighten her day. 
Ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. He knows damn well Frances isn't coming home... 
FADE IN ON: A TELEVISION SCREEN against a dark background The show is "This Is Your Life". We SEE a smiling RALPH EDWARDS, reading from a large black book. Next to him stands Frances. She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. She seems uncomfortable. 
EDWARDS ...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you. 
Throughout this, Frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt. 
EDWARDS ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances? 
FRANCES ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one... 
We MOVE AWAY from the screen to see that the TV set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home. On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York. He still looks athletic, young for his age. Tears stream down his cheeks. 
EDWARDS (O.S.) Were you an alcoholic? 
FRANCES (O.S.) No. 
EDWARDS (O.S.) Were you a drug addict? 
FRANCES (O.S.) No. Never. 
ON THE SCREEN Edwards has moved Frances over to a seating area where various people from Frances' life are waiting, smiling at her. We've never seen any of them before. 
EDWARDS ...and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight... so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail! (indicating seating area) And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you!

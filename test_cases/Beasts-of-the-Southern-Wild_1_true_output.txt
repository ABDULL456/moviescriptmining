EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - DAY 
CRASH CUT TO an off-white monolithic community center surrounded by a cement parking lot. Stressed, amateur looking doctors from the real world move in and out of the glass doors. 
A makeshift sign reads "Open Arms Processing Center." 
INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY 
The interior of the refugee camp is violently, fluorescent- lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of sterility. 
Hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like they've descended from another planet. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't look like a prison, it looked like a fish tank with no water. 
The Bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has been converted into a holding tank/hospital for refugees. Student doctors are examining, treating, feeding people. The abandoned souls, the sick, and the old are lined up waiting for assistance. 
INT. REFUGEE CAMP - KITCHEN - DAY 
A processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits Hushpuppy's tray. 
WINK Don't eat that. 
DR. MALONEY, a clean-cut, over-extended handsome young doctor hustles toward the lunch line. 
DR. MALONEY Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you, we found something in your test. It's- 
WINK Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my kid. Stay, Hushpuppy. 
Wink pulls Maloney out of earshot. 
DR. MALONEY Mr. Doucet, there's no easy way to say this... 
Hushpuppy struggles to hear more, only a couple words come through the din of refugees. 
DR. MALONEY (CONT'D) ...require surgery immediately...you need to think about what you want for your daughter...you could die. 
In Hushpuppy's POV: Maloney puts a sympathetic hand on Wink's shoulder and Wink pushes it off violently. Maloney puts up his hands in peace and Wink shoves him through one of the curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies. 
WINK I don't need nothing from you! You keep your hands off her! I don't need nothing from y'all! Let me go! 
Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue. 
HUSHPUPPY Daddy! 
They tackle Wink to the ground. He goes limp as he falls. 
INT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - DAY 
We TRACK with Wink as he comes to consciousness rolling through the cots. He is sedated and being pushed in a wheelchair. 
He looks through an open door. 
In Wink's POV- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a BABYSITTER. 
She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and looks like a normal little girl for the first time. Her boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate blue dress. The image is jarring.

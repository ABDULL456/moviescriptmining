A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth. 
SETH Ow! 
Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream. 
FATHER(O.S.) Get away from my children! 
The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Fogell and Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them, narrowly missing them. 
FATHER(CONT'D) You sick sons-of-bitches! 
Fogell throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down. Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it. They can't. 
FOGELL Help! 
Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father, knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges, enraged.

FOGELL (CONT'D) Aaaahhh!!!! 
Fogell gets the door open and the two boys run into the alley. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 
They sprint down the alley. Seth coughs and wheezes, slowing down as he lugs the detergent. The Father enters the alley and sees the boys running. He throws his baseball bat. It sails through the air and nails Seth in the back! He falls. 
SETH ARGGG! 
He gets up and the keeps running. 
EXT. STREET CORNER - CONTINUOUS 
Slater and Michaels, completely out of breath, desperately scan the area for the boys. 
OFFICER SLATER Stupid little bastards. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Maybe I should fire a shot? Scare `em out? 
EXT. INSIDE SOME BUSHES - CONTINUOUS 
Evan is nestled inside a large bush, frantically trying to reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself. He keeps looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot - BLAM!!! 
EVAN (to himself, mumbling) Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck. 
As he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on, he sees Seth and Fogell running towards him. He pops out of the bush, scaring Fogell and Seth. 
FOGELL                           SETH Ahh!                              Jesus! 
EVAN (CONT'D) Should I run!?! 
(CONTINUED) 112   CONTINUED:                                                       112 
SETH Fucking run! 
They all run off down the street. 
EXT MAIN STREET 
They turn a corner at the end of the block and continue running. 
They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight of an oncoming bus. It stops at a nearby stop. They haul ass and make it on. 
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
Out of breath, the boys dig up change and put it in the toll box, then walk towards the back of the bus. 
HOMELESS GUY (O.S.) Hey! It's you! 
Fogell looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle. The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze. 
HOMELESS GUY (CONT'D) You got booze in the bag? Can you gimme some? 
SETH No! Fuck off! You already drank our detergent beer! 
HOMELESS GUY That was beer?! (to Fogell) Well, you little shit...ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze...gimme it... 
The Homeless Nutcase reaches for the booze. Seth steps in front of him. 
SETH Back off, or we'll kick the shit out of you! 
EVAN We can't do that. He's homeless. 
(CONTINUED) 114   CONTINUED:                                                    114 
SETH So? Who cares? Just because he doesn't have a home doesn't mean he can be a lunatic!

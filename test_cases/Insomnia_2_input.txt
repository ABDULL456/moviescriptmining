Tanya squirming in her seat.  Not liking this any more. 
TANYA Move over! 
Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK... bearing down on them... 
Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away... The TRUCK...a breath away... 
TANYA (cont'd) (screaming) Move over, you crazy fuck! 
EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD 
The truck and the Cherokee...just feet from each other...at the last moment...the Cherokee jerks out of the way... 
EXT. ICICLE FISHING CANNERY - DAY 
...SCREECHES to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery. Gravel flying.  Will gets out.  Slams his door.  Rounds the car and opens Tanya's door.  She's screaming at him. 
TANYA You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have killed us! 
Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car. 
TANYA (cont'd) Ow!  You're hurting me! 
Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates. Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles. 
TANYA (cont'd) You want to tell me what the fuck this is all about? 
Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone. 
WILL You and Kay were like sisters? 
TANYA That's what I said. 
WILL Told each other everything. (heads down the hill) That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau? 
Tanya steps back. 
WILL (cont'd) Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on your ass at her funeral? 
He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will leans in. 
WILL (cont'd) You like games, little girl?  Well how about this one - you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag. 
Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting, rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She tries to break away... 
TANYA No... 
WILL Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz? 
Tanya looks away. 
WILL (cont'd) Who gave her those dresses? 
She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice. 
WILL (cont'd) I need a name. 
TANYA I don't know. 
WILL You don't know. 
TANYA She wouldn't tell me! 
WILL But you were such good friends... 
Tanya, squirming.  Angry. 
TANYA It was like some big fucking secret! 
WILL What was? 
TANYA She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was going to take her! 
WILL Who? 
TANYA My arm! 
WILL Who? 
TANYA She used some stupid code name. 
WILL What was it? 
TANYA Brody...I don't know... (crying) ...Something Brody! 
Will straightens.  He's heard that name before. 
Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out. She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground. 
TANYA (cont'd) You happy now, you fucking bastard? 
INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
CLOSE ON a FINGER.  Running along a row of book spines. Brundt...Buckley...Buss...Buckham...Byrie... 
PULL BACK to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore. Still in his funeral clothes. 
In the "Mystery!" section.  Not finding what he wants.  Then, something catches his eye:  A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the aisle.  Will limps down to it.  Avoides eye-contact with a YOUNG WOMAN shelving "New Arrivals!" 
Reaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks. Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd. Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for: Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover. 
A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side. Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada.  He graduated...

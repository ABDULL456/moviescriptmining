The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN and the other staffers, sit in front of a monitor watching a news piece. We now cut to CNN footage in front of a hospital as we hear the report continue. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN KING (V.O.) The coroner has stated, that based on the evidence found by the police in the hotel room, that this was an accidental overdose, a lethal cocktail of alcohol and prescription drugs. The Cincinnati police chief, Darryl Mathews, has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report which could take up to two weeks. Just a terrible terrible situation for the former Senator, now DNC Chairman, Jack Stearns and his family. Off the Governor's face we: 
CUT TO: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - KENTUCKY - DAY 
STEPHEN and SENATOR THOMPSON are seated on a bench. 
SENATOR THOMPSON I want on the ticket...you need me on the ticket...and you need my delegates...you could use em before Tuesday. Make a fine story on the Sunday morning news cycle...so I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow...or I endorse Pullman and take my cabinet seat. 
They look at each other. SENATOR THOMPSON (CONT'D) Anything else you want to talk about? 
CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - CINCINNATI - NEXT MORNING 
We're at a press conference - The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN, and the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone. The Governor is making a statement GOV. MORRIS The entire staff is in a state of shock. We have sent our condolences to Jack and JoAnna Stearns and their whole family... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through... All we know at this point is it appears to be a drug...an accidental prescription overdose. Ida? 
IDA Is suicide ruled out? 
GOV. MORRIS We have no reason to believe... 
He looks to Paul. GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) I don't think we have any of that information yet. Obviously there will be a full investigation. Just wanted to say that our hearts go out...our prayers go out to the entire family...and she was part of our family. 
REPORTER 5 Did you know her well Governor? 
GOV. MORRIS Not well. But I did know her, and what I saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit. It's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to Jack. REPORTER 6 How long has she interned with you Governor? The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic. 
PAUL She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four I think, I can check. IDA Will you continue with your schedule today? You're set to tour Proctor & Gamble this afternoon. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
PAUL We will most certainly stay on schedule. This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. The work, the schedule won't be altered. It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart. 
As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating. The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen. 
STEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops vibrating. 
Stephen turns and leaves. CUT TO: 
EXT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - THAT NIGHT STEPHEN approaches the restaurant - the lights are off. He peers through a window - we hear the door unlock. One of the Governor's SECRET SERVICE MEN opens the door. He motions Stephen in. INT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - CONTINUOUS 
Stephen follows the secret service guy through the dark restaurant - they pass several other secret service guys sitting in booths. They cross towards the back to the kitchen door - STEPHEN enters. 
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

{"train": "\"Three Kings\", shooting draft, by David O Russell \nTHREE KINGS \na screenplay by David O. Russell Story by John Ridley and David O. Russell \nDraft Date: 6/22/98 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY \nWIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky. \nTHE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING. \nThe back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby. \nSuddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy turns around, we see his face for the first time. \nTROY Are we shooting people, or what? \nSOLDIER #1 (O.S.) Are we shooting? \nTROY That's what I'm asking you. \nSOLDIER #1 (O.S.) What's the answer? \nTROY I don't know the answer. That's what I'm trying to find out. \nPAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- \nSOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth. TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum. \nPAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye. \nSOLDIER #3 It looks like a grain of sand, but I don't know how I'm gonna get it out-- \nCAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance. \nCAPTAIN VAN METER If they surrender, don't shoot, if they don't surrender, then shoot. \nPAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns back to the dune and runs a few yards. \nStops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on the horizon. \nPOV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE \nThe Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing, loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound. \nSilent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing. \nSOLDIER #3 (O.S.) That guy just shot a towel head. \nSOLDIER #4 (O.S.) Bullshit. \nYOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER \nlies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other. He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him. \nSMASH CUT TO \nFANTASY - INT. HOSPITAL, TORRANCE, CAL. - DAY \nA WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy. \nVIG (V.O.) (deep southern accent) Congratulations, you got yourself a rag head, my man. \nEXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY (PRESENT) \nThe rasping Iraqi dies. \nPAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south, wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath. \nVIG Dag. \nTroy turns, upset, murmurs \"I Get Around\" by the Beach Boys. \nTROY \"Gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, I get around --\" \nSOLDIER #1 I didn't think I'd see anyone get shot over here. \nVIG It looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air -- \nFANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION \nThe Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air. \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nSOLDIER #1 Bullshit, that's not what happened. \nVIG I said it looked like that happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing. \nSOLDIER #2 Oh, my God, it's just like 'Predator,' where the guy, the black guy -- \nSOLDIER #3 Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot off. \nVIG And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing. \nSCENE FROM 'PREDATOR' \nCarl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing. \nBACK TO THE SCENE. \nArchie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General Horn's collar, with its one star. \nGENERAL HORN They made me a general, pal. \nARCHIE GATES For what? I don't even know what we did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell gets to be fucking president-- \nGENERAL HORN Are you high? This is a huge win for us. \nARCHIE GATES Running the press pool's a real big win for me. \nGENERAL PYE You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq? \nARCHIE GATES I'm just saying it's ironic, that's all. \nGENERAL HORN What the fuck is ironic? \nARCHIE GATES We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works I guess. \nGENERAL PYE Just take care of Smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies. \nGENERAL HORN It's either that or be a security guard when you retire. \nARCHIE GATES Fuck you, Ron. \nGENERAL HORN I'm a general now, you can't say fuck you to me. \nARCHIE GATES OK, sir, but there's another thing I'd like to say, if you don't mind. \nGENERAL HORN Go right ahead, Colonel. \nArchie leans wild-eyed into Horn's face and whispers -- \nARCHIE GATES Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn. \nINT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY \nSPLASH -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended hand by DOC ELGIN, 25, stocky, black, no nonsense. \nTROY You've washed your hands like a thousand times, Conrad. \nVIG Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon. \nDOC Why do you let this cracker follow you around? \nTROY He's a good kid. \nDOC He's a wall-eyed cracker. \nTROY He's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in Jackson -- \nDOC I don't give a shit if he's from Johannesburg. I don't want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody. \nVIG Captain uses those terms. \nTROY The point is, Conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes. \nDOC Exactly. \nVIG I'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all. \nDOC What can I do for your headache? \nDoc Elgin opens a case full of pill bottles. \nTROY Got any Vicadan? \nDOC All gone. How about Caffergot? \nTROY Excellent. Let's translate my Iraqi ass map. \nTroy pops the pills, Doc pulls a document from a folder and opens it as he hovers over a table with Troy and Vig. \nTROY Van Meter's at the big pow wow? \nDOC We're cool for at least three hours, but keep Walter on the door. \nWalter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles. \nTROY Would you take those fucking things off? \nWALTER I never got to use night vision. \nTROY They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent. \nDoc unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the Iraqi desert, next to the rumpled ass map. \nDOC These are definitely Saddam's bunkers near Karbala. \nTROY What's inside? \nDOC According to Intelligence -- Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it --  Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it. \nVIG Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten BOS speakers  -- \nTROY Silver Lexus convertible. \nDOC Lexus doesn't make a convertible. \nTROY Yes, they do. \nDOC Infiniti has one coming. \nTROY You're wrong. \nDOC You can't get a car home from here anyway. \nTroy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face. \nTROY Shit. \nARCHIE GATES We dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive -- \nVIG What do you mean? \nARCHIE GATES Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches -- \nFANTASY - A HUGE PLOW \non the front of a Bradley pushes sand right TOWARD THE CAMERA \nARCHIE GATES (O.S.) They had the option to surrender, but they chose to die for their country. \nDOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the sand rolls over them. \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nARCHIE GATES Let's rehearse. \nEXT. DESERT - LATER \nThey sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready. \nARCHIE GATES We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. We pull up fast, and stop short. \nTROY Got it. \nARCHIE GATES And -- Go. \nThe cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow -- \nThe cow steps back, and explodes. \nTroy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's head lands with a thud on the hood of the Humvee. \nARCHIE GATES Who's hurt? \nDOC It's all cow, I think. \nVIG Yeah, it's all cow. \nHe picks cow entrails off himself. \nDOC They said this was swept for mines. \nARCHIE GATES Mines are forever, Doc. They never get all of 'em. \nTROY (low murmur) 'If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda --' \nArchie watches Troy. \nARCHIE GATES Did you guys see any action at all? \nVIG Only night bombing on CNN, except for Troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck-- \nArchie takes Vig's BIG PISTOL and EMPTIES THE SHELLS and puts them into his pocket. \nARCHIE GATES Is sepsis cool? \nVIG What's sepsis? \nDOC Infection of the blood. \nARCHIE GATES As in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. The lead tears in there -- \nFANTASY - INT. STOMACH MUSCLE AND TISSUE \nSlow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity -- \nARCHIE GATES (O.S.) Makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds. The cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you're fucked. \nBile fluid fills the cavity. \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nARCHIE GATES But other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound I've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax -- \nDOC I heard something about that -- \nVIG Tension pneumo what? \nARCHIE GATES A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told. \nDOC That's not fatal, they can stop it. \nARCHIE GATES If you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire. \nThey look at Archie, scared by this. \nTROY Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in? \nDOC The goddamn Beach Boys. \nTROY I'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys. It calms me down. Better than Mozart. \nARCHIE GATES Bach. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT \n'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at the back of the Hummer. \nThe Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties. \nEXT. BUNKER - DAY \nFOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far side of the square and start shooting. \n30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall to the ground as they are shot. \nCHILD Ma-Maa. \nVig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of them look to the side and shout. \nARMED IRAQI SOLDIER Ganan azwar! \nPAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out, bearing down fast on the village square. \nThe soldiers open fire on the truck. \nINT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK \nThe Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite grabs the wheel. \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nArchie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc. They freeze as -- \nThe tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away. \nAn Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder which explodes the container on the back of the truck -- \nMilk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others. \nShiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites crowd the Humvee and climb in. \nIraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck. Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd. \nARCHIE GATES Move. Out of the way. \nArchie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee. \nSHIITE WOMAN Hos-pital. \nShe holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee. \nSHIITE MAN America help. \nHe grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig starts the engine. \nARCHIE GATES Give them MRE's. \nTroy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn. \nThe friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out, and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites. \nArchie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away. \nEXT. DESERT MARSH - DAY \nRaging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke. Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. Paco the Cameraman sits on back. Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar. \nBILL SMITHSON This is boring, I already did this damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold? \nWALTER How about rare pelican migration out by the marshes? \nBILL SMITHSON What? \nWALTER These brave pelicans are migrating in spite of massive pollution -- \nBILL SMITHSON Fuck that. Stop the bike. \nWalter keeps driving. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nDoc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around. \nDOC I'm all right, I'm cool. \nHe lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest. Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset. \nARCHIE GATES What is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few -- I am burning up in this goddamn suit -- \nHe angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched green T-shirt underneath.  Troy and Vig guzzle water. \nARCHIE GATES Discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what I learned, that's what I'm good at. But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks  and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people. \nThe others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits. \nTROY (agitated) I don't even know what happened back there. Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us -- \nDOC They already surrendered to us. Now they're after Shiites. \nVIG What exactly is a Shiite? \nARCHIE GATES They make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. When Bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they're getting wasted. \nVIG (totally puzzled) The civil war? How could it be the civil war? \nFANTASY - STOCK FOOTAGE: UNION SOLDIERS FIGHT DIXIE REBELS \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nVig looks puzzled. \nTROY It's a war inside the same country, Conrad. That's a civil war. \nArchie chucks each of them MARINE UNIFORMS without name tags which everyone puts on, except Troy. \nThe Hummer zips into a bigger village piazza with an old fortress at one end, and races straight to the entrance to an underground bunker in the middle of the piazza. \nARCHIE GATES (into the megaphone) United States Marine Corps. Put your weapons down. \nTroy and Doc leap out, hold pistols out at arm's length as they accost TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS pointing rifles at them. \nTROY Drop your weapon. \nDOC Put it down. \nTroy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and cuff their hands behind their backs. \nVIG Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul. \nINT. SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY \nArchie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by Troy and Doc, pistols drawn. \nAn IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back. Archie and Troy run right past the scared Iraqi. Doc comes third, slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him. \nArchie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy. \nINT. INNER ROOM, SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY \nArchie and Troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively. \nTROY Freeze. \nA large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, CD players, small TVs. A huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall. \nA television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic. \nAnother TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating. \nAn IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs. \nTWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio. \nThey all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for the officer watching 'Happy Days' and CNN.. \nARCHIE GATES By order of the cease-fire signed in Safwan, March 3, the United States Marines hereby confiscate all material stolen by Iraq from the Emirate of Kuwait -- \nOne of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run. Troy heads him off with his pistol -- \nTROY Down. \nThe other rifle-loader stands looking scared. \nIRAQI RIFLE-LOADER Isnam panan fatwa aznir -- \nWHIP PAN TO Doc, who turns the shortwave radio off, pushes the TWO IRAQIS to the ground. One goes peacefully, the other resists; Doc smacks him in the side of the head with his pistol, which fires accidentally. Everyone grabs their heads and ducks -- except Archie. \nARCHIE GATES Never hit anyone with your pistol, Doc. \nDOC Sorry about that. \nArchie is offered a cuisinart by the Iraqi Captain. \nIRAQI CAPTAIN For wife. \nARCHIE GATES I've been divorced three times. \nTroy has one rifle Iraqi on the ground, but the second is on his knees, putting a CD into a mini-stereo. \nRIFLE IRAQI #2 Newest and best. \nTROY No, newest and best has better noise reduction. \nThe Iraqi looks puzzled. \nTROY Less distortion. Get down on the floor, OK? \nHe pushes the man face down, cuffs his hands. Olivia Newton- John's \"I Wanna Get Physical\" PLAYS. \nTROY This is bad music, understand? It's bad for you. \nDOC (O.S.) Hey -- \nWHIP PAN TO the resistant Iraqi struggles to break away and Doc punches him in the head twice, the Iraqi starts crying. \nARCHIE GATES (to Iraqi Captain) Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us so we don't have to kill you. \nTROY There's another room over here. \nPAN TO Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the room. Archie kicks it open. \nINT. INNER ROOM - DAY \nA bound, naked SHIITE MAN IN GLASSES, clean shaven, sits on the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four inches deep, filled with water. There is an electric cable going into the water. The naked Shiite in glasses shakes. \nTroy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out. \nIRAQI SARGEANT I am just do my job, buddy. \nArchie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the man's wrist, takes the pistol out of his hand. Troy watches. \nArchie turns and sees TEN SHIITES across the room: 3 MEN, 3 WOMEN, 4 CHILDREN. The men and women are bound and GAGGED. \nArchie steps toward the Shiites, but the INTERROGATOR, 35, also a captain, steps in his way. \nINTERROGATOR These Shiite. Iraq problem. United States is out now. \nArchie stares at the INTERROGATOR with contempt. \nINTERROGATOR We take them outside, so it don't bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam. \nArchie holds another brick. \nARCHIE GATES Yeah, that's five kilos. \nTROY Five, six, seven, eight, there's sixty bricks in this suitcase. \nDOC Times 50K each -- \nTROY Three million dollars. \nArchie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also filled with sixty bars. Troy opens another suitcase, there's another sixty bars. Doc opens another, another sixty bars. They frantically check all of the suitcases. The handcuffed Captain is crying. \nARCHIE GATES Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each. That's thirty million dollars. \nArchie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock. \nWith effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy, jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top. \nTROY I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus convertibles in different colors. \nDOC I told you Lexus doesn't make a convertible. \nTROY I'll bet you a Lexus they do. \nDOC OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it won't be a convertible. \nSuddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain. \nTROY Shit. \nArchie, Troy, and Doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the bricks rip through and fall to the floor -- \nARCHIE GATES They didn't get it here in these bags. \nDOC The tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds. \nTROY The what? \nDOC Tensilary strength, it's what the suitcase can hold. \nARCHIE GATES Why would you know that? \nTROY He works at an airport. \nDOC 60 bars, 13 pounds each is like -- 800 pounds. The smaller Vuittons handle 65. \nARCHIE GATES You got any more luggage here? \nThe Interrogator looks at him. \nINT. BUNKER BASEMENT - LATER \n120 small, round, Vuitton overnight bags, laid out and opened, cover the entire floor of the basement. \nTroy and Doc finish putting 5 bars in each bag. Archie paces, sweating, speedy like he's on cocaine. \nARCHIE GATES It's crazy to take it all, we're not prepared for it. It's crazy not to take it all, how can we leave it? \nTroy and Doc look nervous. \nTROY What's the shipping plan? \nARCHIE GATES I told you that's handled. \nTROY How is it handled? You have to tell us now. \nDOC Yeah, tell us now. \nARCHIE GATES (pacing) I've got a friend, he's in French Special Forces. He's gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury it. In a few weeks, he'll drive it to Yanbu -- \nTROY Where's Yanbu? \nARCHIE GATES It's a port in Saudi. \nSILENT FANTASY \nHavichon talks to an EGYPTIAN MAN in Lacoste sportswear \nARCHIE GATES (O.S.) Where another friend will ship it on a Turkish boat up the Red Sea to Perpignan, where a French boat will take it to Baltimore -- \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nTROY I don't know about getting them to Baltimore, but these hat boxes ain't gonna fit in the Humvee. \nARCHIE GATES We need a trailer. \nTROY OK, I'll call U-Haul in Karbala to see what they have on the lot today. \nARCHIE GATES See what you can get, Barlow. \nINT. NARROW CEMENT STAIRCASE OF BUNKER \nTroy runs up the stairs. \nEXT. BUNKER - DAY \nTroy runs out the front door. \nTROY Conrad, we need a trailer -- \nThe Iraqi Major stares coldly at Troy. Troy stares at the two soldiers beating Shiites; five others clustered around the woman on the ground. \nVIG Did you get it? Troy, did you get it? \nTROY Yeah, we got it. \nTroy backs the truck up. \nVuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck, which is completely full. \nArchie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods. \nThe Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman. \nIRAQI MAJOR Nazaran yafit haisul. \nArchie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in an open area and shoot her dead. \nTroy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares. \nArchie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman. \nThe Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally. \nArchie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers. \nARCHIE GATES This has to stop. \nThe Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues to slash the Man In Glasses. \nINTERROGATOR You get your ass kick in a war, it feel good to be strong again. \nARCHIE GATES What did you say? \nIRAQI MAJOR You go now, please. \nHe salutes Archie. \nARCHIE GATES I don't think so. I'm sure you know about the Geneva Convention, right? \nINTERROGATOR Geneva convention? You bomb my house, man. \nIRAQI MAJOR That Shiite man is leader of uprising. He kill my man. \nTROY Archie, let's stick to the plan, sir. The plan is for gold, right? \nDOC We can help them first, then be on our way. \nTROY No, we can't. It's not what we're here for. \nARCHIE GATES How much? \nIRAQI MAJOR What? \nARCHIE GATES How much gold do you want to let these people come with us? \nThe Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs. \nINTERROGATOR Cannot do. \nARCHIE GATES What do you mean, cannot do? I'm offering you a lot of money. \nThe Iraqi Major continues smiling. \nIRAQI MAJOR Cannot let Shiite go -- \nINTERROGATOR Saddam kill us. \nIRAQI MAJOR Saddam kill to me if we let them go, OK? Now you go. \nARCHIE GATES Cover me. \nTROY Jesus Christ, we can't save everybody. \nARCHIE GATES Are you listening? I said cover me. \nTroy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point their pistols. Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight prone Shiite prisoners laying face down. \nVig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer. \nARCHIE GATES No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is that clear? \nVIG Yes, sir. \nARCHIE GATES Because we know what bullets do to vital organs, don't we? \nVIG Make infected pockets filled with bile, sir. \nARCHIE GATES That's right, that's what they do. \nTroy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl. \nArchie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in the dirt. \nThe bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground, clutching the Little Girl in arm casts. \nTroy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed. \nArchie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl, and walks them over to the Humvee. \nTwo Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick them back down. \nIRAQI MAJOR (pissed) U.S.A. is out of Shiite war. \nThe Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down. \nARCHIE GATES No shooting. \nTroy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc. \nCUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee. \nSuddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn. \nA tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street, followed by a truck with a rocket launcher. \nTROY Great, a fucking tank. That should send us on our way. \nVIG Grenade launcher, sir. \nVig struggles to lift the grenade launcher. \nARCHIE GATES No. Let's get out of here. \nTROY It's about fucking time. \nTroy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine. Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig. \nPAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in. \nThe tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank. \nTANK IRAQI Hazal mafan. \nHe gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket launcher pulls up. \nINT./EXT. HUMVEE \nas it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives. \nINT. TRUCK \nTroy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go, bouncing along the road. \nTROY We were home free, you stupid son of a bitch. \nWIDE AERIAL SHOT \nthe truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee \nARCHIE GATES (O.S.) What's the tank doing? \nPOV \nthrough Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning. \nDOC (O.S.) Lining us up -- \nBACK TO THE SCENE \nVig pushes the Humvee's accelerator to the floor. \nThe Shiite Man In Glasses and his Little Girl cling to the Humvee as they sit on top of the Vuitton hat cases with eight other Shiites, including TWO FIVE YEAR OLDS, A BOY AND GIRL. \nEXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY \nTwo Iraqi soldiers take a THIN ROCKET, four feet long, and load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it. A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm. \nWHIP PAN TO a Shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor window of a small stone building. Iraqis shout and point at the sniper. The tank turns to the building. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nThe Humvee drives fast over the bumpy two-lane road. \nEXT.

I'm a survivor. \nA Shiite changes Vig's bloody bandage, while a DEAD BODY is laid next to Vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant. \nVIG Is that guy dead?

Vig suddenly grabs his hand in PAIN. The Shiite looks at him. \nVIG Splinter. \nSHIITE Come on. \nEXT. INFINITI \nVig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti. Wads of plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side -- \nVIG Go straight, go straight -- \nHe jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins.

FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY \nArchie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably. Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly. \nARCHIE GATES We're gonna get out of here alive, just do what I say, do you hear me? \nTroy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc. \nArchie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand. \nARCHIE GATES Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna give it a five second fuse. That gives you two steps out the door. \nPAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently. \nArchie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife. \nThe three of them stand at the door, ready.

Archie steadies Troy's hand. The fuse is lit. \nARCHIE GATES Go. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY \nArchie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy, also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning. Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up. \nINT. CHOPPER \nThe chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES. \nEXT. BUNKER \nArchie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker. \nINT. BUNKER DOORWAY - DAY \nThey run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and Doc look terrified. \nARCHIE GATES OK.

BUNKER \nImam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE -- \nINT. BUNKER \nTroy lights the second fuse.

The rotary spins off, whips over Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker. \nSilence. \nTroy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants. \nARCHIE GATES We're not done. Check every Iraqi here. \nArchie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their weapons. Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis. \nTROY (agitated) Where's Conrad? \nARCHIE GATES Don't let your guard down. \nSLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering toward Troy, 125 yards away. \nTroy looks stunned. \nArchie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle. \nAn IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire. \nTroy runs as hard as he can toward Vig. \nARCHIE GATES Cover him. \nDoc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out. \nARCHIE GATES Lock it down. Shoot anything that moves. \nIMAM (translates) Haza janav yasat. \nTroy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's shoulder, as Vig tries to talk. \nVIG You made it, man -- \nTroy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms. \nTROY Help him. \nDoc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood. \nVIG What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc? \nDOC It's around you right now, man, it works on this side or the other side. \nVIG You never told me that part. I guess I could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did -- \nTROY We made the right choice today, Conrad. \nVIG We did good, right? \nTROY We made the right choice. \nThe hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe. \nDOC Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you can. Our father who art in heaven -- \n50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near the bunker watch from afar. \nTroy stands up looking around helplessly. \nTROY Help. \nDOC -- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done -- \nA gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the sound of tearing tissue. Troy looks stunned as he is spun around by the shot. \nArchie spins around in the desert and looks at Troy. \nARCHIE GATES Goddamn it. \nHe runs hard across the desert toward Troy. \nTroy falls next to Vig and they look at each other. \nTroy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty -- RASPING. \nINT. TROY'S RIB CAGE \nHis breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to the left side. \nTROY'S POV \nlooking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING \nThe POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing. \nFLASHBACK TO THE OPENING SCENE, but with weird, MUFFLED SOUND \nSOLDIER #5 Take my picture. \nVIG Do you still want to sell pictures? \nTROY (distracted monotone) For twenty. \nSOLDIER #5 Twenty bucks? \nVIG War's been over five days, ain't gonna be any more of this, Jim. \nSOLDIER #5 Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life? \nTROY You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war. \nSOLDIER #5 Bobby, take my picture. \nHe holds the camera out. \nSOLDIER #4 If he shot the guy, it's up to him. \nSOLDIER #5 It's not like he shot a fucking deer.

An approaching convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by a Humvee. \nArchie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready. \nThe U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker. \nWalter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes. \nHAVICHON Quelle gonzesse, Archie, you got yourself shot. \nARCHIE GATES Those better be words of sympathy. \n6 ARMY DRIVERS, among them the disillusioned infantrymen interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam. \nWalter walks up, carrying a medical pack. \nWALTER Watcha doing out here, Troy? \nThey bang fists in greeting. \nTROY Protecting the free peoples of the world, Walter, you know how it is. \nEXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER \nArchie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc. \nCHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks. \nSIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance \nCLOSE DOLLY Archie. \nARCHIE GATES Double time. \nHe lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others. The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and Walter look up also. Archie does not. \nHavichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the choppers as they pass overhead, loud. \nPAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his path, blowing up dust. \nArchie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the blowing sand. \n10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers, followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles. \nIraqi soldiers watch apprehensively. \nM.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from the Shiites. \nTroy shouts over the choppers. \nTROY Wait. \nU.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border. \nThe Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward the border unaccompanied by American protection. \nARCHIE GATES Let them get over the border. \nTroy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest. \nTROY Let them get over, wait -- \nPlastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back. \nTROY I have to reach this -- \nArchie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front -- \nARCHIE GATES Put his cuffs in front. \nHe and Doc are pulled away from Troy. \nIraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them, throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is thrown to the ground and dragged. \nTROY Look what's happening. \nHe collapses to one knee. \nCAPTAIN VAN METER Not our mission, Barlow. \nTroy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles. \nTROY Cut my cuffs -- \nCaptain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the choppers. \nCAPTAIN VAN METER You fucked me and you're fucked now, so shut your goddamn mouth. \nShiites are lined up in a firing squad. \nDOC He's gonna die. \nTroy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP holding him as he goes to General Horn. \nARCHIE GATES Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical attention, don't let him die -- \nGENERAL HORN We are not involved in the Shiite problem, do you understand me? You are AWOL, you are a fugitive, you are under arrest. \nARCHIE GATES Cut his cuffs. \nGeneral Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground, concerned. \nA US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade, crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes. \nArchie looks at Troy, then up at the border. \nImam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's body is dropped in the sand. \nARCHIE GATES We got the gold. \nGENERAL HORN What? \nARCHIE GATES We got the Kuwaiti bullion. \nGENERAL HORN Bullshit. \nArchie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down. \nARCHIE GATES Pull that barrel. \nGENERAL HORN Pull it. \nAn MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold bars spill to the sand. \nThe General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody, watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers -- and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET. \nTHE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in custody -- stand and watch Archie. \n", "test1_input": "BILL SMITHSON Where the hell are you going? \nArchie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter. \nARCHIE GATES I'll be right back. \nBILL SMITHSON I don't want you helping other reporters, goddamn it. \nSOLDIER #1 We kicked ass. \nSOLDIER #6 We didn't get rid of fucking Saddam -- \nSOLDIER #8 Which totally sucks a big dick. \nSOLDIER #6 Those people are getting reemed -- \nSOLDIER #7 Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man. \nBILL SMITHSON Who's getting reemed?

He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can in the other, like torches. \nTROY (screaming the song) And I'm proud I to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U S A -- \nSoldiers scream and go nuts. \nBeer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths. \n\"I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man\" by Public Enemy blasts. \nWALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two parallel boom boxes like a DJ. \nA Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements. \nSoldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes. \nSoldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the music blasts.  Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal. \nTROY Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. \nVig screams into Troy's face at point blank range. \nVIG Rahhhhhhhhh. \nTROY Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh. \nCAPTAIN VAN METER Goddamn it, where the fuck did this beer come from we gotta take more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow. \nEXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY \nWIDE SHOT -  HUNDREDS OF IRAQIS walking in the desert, hands raised above their heads. \nTRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE) Hasnala shi aluno quibaan -- \nCAPTAIN VAN METER We will not hurt you. Lay down your weapons, get on the ground -- \nTWO IRAQIS with bad face wounds get medical help. \nFIVE IRAQIS \non their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe. They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16 on the begging Iraqis. \nTROY It's cool, no one's gonna hurt you -- \nVig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their faces. \nVIG Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul? \nThe Iraqis wail for mercy. Troy pushes Vig's pistol away. \nTROY You're making them all hysterical. \nVig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is the only one not taking his clothes off. \nVIG Take your fucking rags off, take this off. No comprende English, motherfucker? \nTROY What is your fucking problem, Conrad? \nVIG I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off. \n", "test1_true": "The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once. Vig and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off. Troy takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two. \nVIG Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy. \nVig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up piece of paper is sticking out -- \nTROY There's a document in that guy's ass, Conrad. \nVIG That's the freaky thing. \nWALTER Do you think he ate it? \nTROY It wouldn't come out perfect like that if he ate it. \nTroy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket. \nTROY Go get it, Private. \nIRAQI OFFICER Hasa man timal! \nThe Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up, greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted. \nTROY Open it up. \nVIG You only gave me one glove. \nTROY I'm sorry I don't have another, but you gotta open it up. That's how the chain of command works. \nVig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand. \nCLOSE UP - THE RUMPLED PAPER \nis a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare roads, numbers, and three small boxes. \nVIG What the hell is that? \nTROY Important enough to squeeze your cheeks for. \nINT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY \nIn the half-light of dozens of TV monitors playing Iraqi news from around the world, Archie Gates madly humps CATHY DAITCH on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors. \nCATHY DAITCH You are a trained warrior, trained warrior, trained warrior, Jesus Christ, Colonel! \nTV monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes. Archie lays on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses. \nCATHY DAITCH (breathless) What's Bill got? \nARCHIE GATES Just the celebration story. \nCATHY DAITCH That's it? \nARCHIE GATES That's it -- \nARCHIE GATES How about you? Did you find anything? \nCATHY DAITCH It could be another bullshit lead but I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold -- \nARCHIE GATES Who's the guy? \nCATHY DAITCH Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company B-- \nARCHIE GATES Barlow. \nCATHY DAITCH Got a map out of a prisoner's head. \nARCHIE GATES Out of a prisoner's head? \nCATHY DAITCH Or his ear, or his ass, or his dick, and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam's bunkers -- \nARCHIE GATES Out of a guy's dick? \nThe door explodes open and two MPs grab Archie, pants around his ankles, and drag him from the truck. \nEXT.

Stop her -- \nWHIP PAN TO Cathy runs away as she dresses, MPs grab her. \nMP You are in violation of code 37D, grinding Major Gates. \nThey let her go. Soldiers in gas suits laugh. \nARCHIE GATES You guys have no manners whatsoever -- \nBill Smithson runs up, agitated. \nBILL SMITHSON I told you he was with her -- \nGENERAL PYE We're handling this, OK? \nThe MP pushes Smithson away. \nBILL SMITHSON I wanted help with the gold story, and he took off on me-- \nARCHIE GATES That's a lot of bullshit. \nSmithson is walked away.

Recon photos match the map. \nARCHIE GATES May I look at the goddamn map? \nTroy lets go. Archie holds the map up to the light. He then pours some of Doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it to the light again. He puts the map on the table, turns the light off and clicks on an infra-red flashlight he pulls out. A completely different map appears in green markings. \nVIG Dag. \nARCHIE GATES That's what makes Rangers badass, we get the best flashlights. \nThey stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated. \nARCHIE GATES Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the west. \nDOC Seventy-five klicks north. \nARCHIE GATES More like 65. \nTROY Much closer to Karbala. \nARCHIE GATES Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. Of course -- \nHe turns the overhead light back on. \nARCHIE GATES -- there could be nothing inside but starving Arabs and stolen watches, but I think it's worth checking out, even if I have to do it with clueless reservists like you. \nThey look at him. \nARCHIE GATES I mean, I could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together. \nDOC What gold? \nARCHIE GATES You don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you? \nVIG Rolexes. \nARCHIE GATES Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion. \nVIG You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup? \nARCHIE GATES No. Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup. \nTROY Gold bricks. \nARCHIE GATES 5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market. \nVIG For one gold brick? \nARCHIE GATES I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs. \nDolly: Troy, Doc, Vig stare at Archie. \nFANTASY - EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY \nSILENT - Troy walks in white shirtsleeves, dark tie, pulling a cart with a salesman's black case on it over a curb. \nFANTASY - INT. OFFICE \nSILENT - Troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier, tools and parts all around him, opens a bag of toner, which spills black dust all over his white shirt \nFANTASY - INT.

They had the shit bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us. That's a beaten army in every sense of the word. \nHe looks at them. \nARCHIE GATES You are now under my command, salute -- \nThey salute him.

DESERT CAMP - WIDE SHOT - DAWN \nThree figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they run to a motorcycle and side car. Walter kickstarts the motorcycle. PACO the cameraman sits behind Walter with a video camera.

DESERT - MOVING HUMVEE - MORNING \nBach's Gloria, from Mass in B Minor plays as \nPow pow pow, Vig fires his big pistol into the desert. \nDOC Pull. \nTroy throws a painted football into the desert. Doc fires the M-16 and blows the ball to pieces. \nArchie drives and moves his hand to the Bach. \nThe convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill. \nThe Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people. \nDOC Pull. \nTroy throws another ball, Doc blows it away. \nTROY Pull. \nDoc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert. \nTROY I gave you a better arc, Doc. \nDOC What are you talking about? \nTROY I threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit. \nDOC Bullshit. \nVIG Blacks make better receivers than quarterbacks. \nTROY Stop speaking right now, Conrad. \nDOC Warren Moon is an excellent quarterback. \nVIG The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren Moon. \nDOC Randall Cunningham. \nTROY Don't get down in the mud with him, Doc. \nVIG The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with him. \nArchie moves his hand to the Bach. \nDOC Doug Williams took the Redskins to the Superbowl and won, OK? \nTROY We can all agree there are many excellent black quarterbacks. \nDoc throws a ball. Vig fires his giant pistol twice and misses. \nDOC Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker -- \nVIG This gun's too heavy to shoot one-handed like a movie star -- \nVig fires: blam, blam, bam. The Humvee stops abruptly. \nARCHIE GATES Shut the fuck up. \nThey sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays. \nEXT. DESERT DAY \nNo more music. Troy, Doc, and Vig stand spread apart. They wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from plastic water bottles. A bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked, burned truck to the side, a SKINNY COW meanders. \nARCHIE GATES When we pull up to the bunker, the approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in special operations. It means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we haven't fired a single shot. \n", "test2_id": 517, "test3_input": "ARCHIE GATES Yeah, OK, we need some fighters. \nMAN IN GLASSES So that's worth more than eight suitcases. \nARCHIE GATES Ten. \nMAN IN GLASSES Fifteen. \nArchie looks at him. \nARCHIE GATES That's four million dollars. \nMAN IN GLASSES I think we need it more than you, John Doe, don't you? \nHe extends his hand. They shake. \nARCHIE GATES Archie Gates. \nIMAM (MAN IN GLASSES) Imam Katar. I'll give you back five suitcases to get us over the Iranian border. \nARCHIE GATES What? \nIMAM We gotta get to a refugee camp or we're dead. The camps are in Iran. \nDOC We can't go to the Iranian border. \nIMAM Then we don't have a deal. \nVIG Give me a fucking break, man. \nDOC We saved your life. \nIMAM And we saved yours. \nARCHIE GATES We lost a man for you. \nIMAM What good is it if you leave us to get wasted? The big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator.  You saw what happened to my wife. Look at my daughter. \nArchie looks around. He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged children looking at him. A few mothers. \nARCHIE GATES Who's going? \nIMAM Everyone but the priests. That's \nVIG Fuck it. We'll find this place on our own. \nIMAM It's not on a map. You can look. \nDOC Somebody else will take us. \nDoc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up \nDOC Who will take us to Oasis bunker? \nFifty Shiites turn and look at him silently. Doc dumps a whole suitcase of gold bars. Imam translates. \nIMAM Jarat yalam fantam uraz. \nPeople stare at the gold and say nothing. \nIMAM I don't think so. \nVIG This is a human life we're talking about. \nIMAM (laughs) Tell me about it. \nHis daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch. \nINT.

It's all a job. \nTROY It still matters what you do, what you're doing right now matters. \nINTERROGATOR Bullshit. \nTROY The art of war is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many with minimum violence, minimum -- \nINTERROGATOR Then why you bomb my fahking house and kill my son? Can you think how it feels inside your heart if I bomb your daughter? \nFANTASY - SLOW MOTION - A MISSILE \nsilently destroys Troy's suburban house. \nBACK TO SCENE \nTROY Worse than death -- \nINTERROGATOR It feels like this -- \nHolding the driver at the head, he raps the bridge of Troy's nose. \nTROY Don't -- \nINTERROGATOR Everyday, inside my heart -- \nHe raps Troy's nose repeatedly to make his point. \nINTERROGATOR Like this, like this, like this -- \nHe breaks Troy's nose with a crack. \nINT. MINARET \nA rug is pulled off the old stone floor, a panel is lifted. Old pistols and rifles are pulled out. \nDoc and Vig load and handle the old pistols. \nARCHIE GATES Did we save anything from the Humvee? \nDOC This bag. \nArchie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up pack. He looks at Doc as if to say \"Great.\" \nLATER \nArchie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the end of the ball. Another ball-bomb just like it has already been constructed. \nEXT. DESERT -  DAY \nArchie leads a line of 55 Shiites across the desert. Everyone carries at least one Vuitton bag. Imam carries his daughter. \nVIG You got the same name as the tall model who does David Bowie. \nDOC That's Im-an, with an 'n.' He's Imam with an 'm.' \nVIG That's the same name. \nDOC It's not the same name. \nVIG Whatever. They're both attractive names. \nEXT.

They are all 40 yards back from the truck. \nARCHIE GATES This is the United States Army. Come out of the truck with your weapons in the air. \nNo response. Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES. \nVIG Shit. Sorry. \nHis gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away -- 55 SHIITES flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the desert to look. Doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated truck. \nARCHIE GATES They used a lot of decoys to throw off our bombers. \nDOC Where are we gonna get a vehicle? \nIMAM I know a place that's full of deserters. Maybe they got something. \nHIGH WIDE SHOT: They walk in a single file line in the desert.  Archie in front, carries a Vuitton bag. \nEXT. DESERTER'S BUNKER - DAY \nArchie now walks among Shiites toting old rifles. There are bomb craters, destroyed cars, a few mud dwellings nearby. \nSHIITE America! \nSHIITE #2 America!

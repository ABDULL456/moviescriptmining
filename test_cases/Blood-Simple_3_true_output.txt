We track laterally down the car, along the beam of its headlights, to finally frame Ray as he climbs out of the shallow grave he has just finished digging. 
He plants the shovel and walks back to the car. 
VERY WIDE SHOT 
The grave in the middle background; the car's headlights beyond it. 
Ray is dragging Marty toward the grave. He dumps him in. 
HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE 
As Marty thumps to the bottom, face up. 
CLOSE SHOT  RAY 
As he bends over to pick up the shovel, dripping sweat. We hear the shovel biting into earth. 
HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE 
Ray, in the foreground, pitches the first shovelful of earth onto Marty. Marty moves slightly. 
LOW SHOT  RAY 
As he pauses, looking down into the grave. He stoops down and resumes shoveling, bobbing in and out of frame as he hurls dirt into the grave. 
BACK TO HIGH SHOT 
As Ray shovels, Marty is moving under the loose dirt. A faint, inarticulate noise comes from the grave. 
Almost imperceptibly, Marty's right arm starts to rise. 
LOW SHOT  FROM INSIDE THE GRAVE 
Ray stands on the lip of the grave, hunched over his shovel, crisply illuminated by the headlights. In the shadowy foreground Marty's arm rises, extended toward Ray. He is clutching Abby's gun in his splint-fingered hand. 
CLOSE SHOT  RAY 
As he straightens up and stands motionless, expressionless, watching Marty, making no attempt to get out of the way. 
HIGH SHOT  MARTY 
The gun extended into the foreground. His index finger splinted, he slides his middle finger over the trigger of the gun. 
LOW SHOT  RAY 
Watching. 
HIGH SHOT  MARTY 
The gun trembling in the foreground. His knuckle whitens over the trigger. 
The trigger releases and we hear the dull click of an empty chamber. 
LOW SHOT  RAY 
Staring blankly down at Marty. 
SIDE SHOT 
Of Marty's gun hand as Ray slowly sinks down on the lip of the grave, bracing himself with the shovel. His hand reaches for Marty's. Marty squeezes off two more empty chambers. Ray's hand slowly closes over the barrel of the gun. 
As he pulls, the gun slides from Marty's fingers. 
CLOSE SHOT  THE BLADE OF THE SHOVEL 
Biting into the earth. 
MED SHOT  RAY 
Furiously shoveling dirt into the grave. 
HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE 
Marty barely visible under the dirt. 
MED SHOT  RAY 
Shoveling, panting. 
HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE 
Half full.

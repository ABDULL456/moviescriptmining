JOE Go ahead. 
FIRST FBI MAN Would you mind opening up? Joe glances over his shoulder: no sign of them. He opens the door, but not far enough to let the man in. Behind the large man are TWO OTHER MEN IN SUITS. 
FIRST FBI MAN We're investigating a kidnapping; we'd like to look around. 
JOE You got a search warrant? 
FIRST FBI MAN Oh, we got a warrant all right. He slaps a paper and pushes past Joe; the other men follow... 
JOE Can I she the warrant? First FBI Man ignores this. 
JOE (CONT.) Who're you looking for? The FBI Man gives him a sarcastic glance. 
JOE (CONT.) A mother taking her own child isn't kidnapping. I don't think you're FBI at all. This elicits no response. Joe moves to where he can see the other two guys. Looks down the hall toward: 
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 
SECOND FBI MAN searching the pantry, looking around. He opens the door to the garage and vanishes - 
INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
THIRD FBI MAN looks under the bed, in the closets... yanks clothes aside. At any moment we expect him to find them... 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 
JOE Mister: unless you leave right now, I'm calling the police. 
FIRST FBI MAN Oh...jeez...that's a scary thought. Joe picks up the phone - First FBI Man slams it down. 
FIRST FBI MAN I marri a cop, okay? I'm not in the mood. Joe accepts this. . .but only for the moment. 
INT. GARAGE. NIGHT. 
Second FBI Man looks in the car, under the car... isn't this the logical place for them to hide??? 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 
Third FBI Man returns from the bedroom emptyhanded, starts to search the living room: 
THIRD FBI MAN I'll look around here? 
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 
The Second FBI Man returns from the garage, starts to search... We're scared with every cupboard he opens that he'll find them. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 
Third FBI Man searches the room. SUDDENLY we go to SLIM'S POV...she and Gracie are in a cabinet, looking out through a narrow horizontal slit. Watching the Third FBI Man makes his way methodically in their direction. First FBI Man stands over Joe, keeping him silent. Joe watches the Third FBI Man search the room... And then Joe blinks. Moves his eyes, and looks right in Slim's direction. He realizes where they must be hiding. The Third FBI Man's getting closer and closer to them... Joe realizes he has to do something. Abruptly Joe stands: 
JOE That's enough. 
(VERY FORCEFUL) You hear me? It's time to go. Now. (off First FBI's. shocked look) I know who you are, okay? I know who hired you. First FBI Man whirls. Suddenly he's got a knife in his hand. Definitely NOT FBI. Putting the. knife to Joe's throat: 
"FIRST FBI MAN" Yeah? You know what it feels like to have a knife hit your carotid? 
JOE (trying not to move) No. 
Inside the cabinet, Gracie gasps. Slim puts a hand over her mouth. But Slim herself has to fight the impulse to burst out of there to save Joe - 
"FIRST FBI MAN" You know what it's like to bleed out in less than two minutes? 
JOE No.

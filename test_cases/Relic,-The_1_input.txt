D'Agosta throws open the doors and charges into the Hall.  Jonathan lies on the ground, dazed.  Kawakita stands to one side, teeth chattering in shock.  His hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the gun swings in his hand. 
D'AGOSTA (yells) Where is it?! 
JONATHAN I don't know!  It hit me hard. 
D'Agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun.  Screams can be heard from the people crouched together at the edge of the room.  Hobbes is barking wildly, foaming at the mouth.  It's too dark to see what's happening. 
D'AGOSTA (screams) Somebody tell me!  Where is it now? 
MAYOR (quiet) Lieutenant.  In the south corner. 
D'Agosta sweeps his light to the Mayor who stands rigid in front of the others, points to his left.  The light moves to the far end of the room where THE DARK SHAPE OF MBWUN crouches over the body of a man. It's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions.  The man is long past making a sound.  From the monster comes a faint crunching and slobbering.  Jonathan rises, comes to D'Agosta.  So does Frank.  They stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns.  D'Agosta motions for Kawakita. 
D'AGOSTA On three. 
Kawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in.  The barrel of his shot gun still swings wildly.  He steadies it by taking it in both hands. 
D'AGOSTA One, two... three. 
All three fire.  There's a loud report.  The kickback knocks Kawakita backwards.  Screams erupt from the huddled group.  Hobbes abruptly shuts up.  The men fire and fire until there's nothing left.  D'Agosta reaches for more shells, comes up empty. 
D'AGOSTA Jonathan!  Get everyone behind me! 
Jonathan moves.  D'Agosta sweeps his light across the room but already the shape is gone.  Cuthbert hides behind the Mayor, calls out in a terrified squeal. 
CUTHBERT It went out the door to the rotunda! 
D'Agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors. There's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam both doors.  He picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles. Backs up.  The doors shudder as something hits them hard. 
D'AGOSTA Get everyone into the stairwell! 
Jonathan, the Mayor, Cuthbert and Kawakita together herd everyone towards the stairwell.  They move inside. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Dark and close.  The smell of gunpowder and death.  The Mayor's Wife sees Bailey's body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up. 
CUTHBERT Sweet Jesus! 
D'AGOSTA Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move. 
CUTHBERT My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help! 
D'AGOSTA I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert! 
MAYOR I think we should stick together! 
FRANK (taking Bailey's shotgun) Me too. 
CUTHBERT I'm leaving.  Whoever wants can come with me. 
No one follows. 
D'AGOSTA Wait! 
Cuthbert's gone. 
D'AGOSTA Jonathan, go with him!  He isn't armed. 
Jonathan grabs Hobbes' leash from the Mayor and bounds up the stairs. 
MAYOR Good luck! 
Everyone else follows D'Agosta.  Together, they head down. 
EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT 
Police cars are pulling up outside the museum.  Sirens wail.  Torrents of rain limit the number of onlookers.  Crowds of people are scattered about.  There's disbelief on everyone's faces.  Many people are in shock.  Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a GUARD STATION near the gate.  He yanks the door open and jumps inside. 
INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT 
A number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion. 
IPPOLITO All right everyone.  I'm in charge. Status report. 
One of the security men, WATERS, rises.

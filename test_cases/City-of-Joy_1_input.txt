INT. COURTYARD - NIGHT He bangs on Joan's door. She opens the door in her Indian pajamas. One look at him... JOAN What's happened? MAX Ashoka ordered me to go home. Well, I've come home. 
A beat. She steps aside, he steps in, and the door closes him safely inside. 
EXT. PARK CIRCUS - DAY The rickshaw station. The  rain pours down. People clambor for rickshaws. The  line moves forward as fast as the pullers can take on passengers. Hasari, Ram, Ramatullah, Chomotkar look at the stalled buses, the streetcars, the taxis, the private cars. CHOMOTKAR What a joy it is to survey this disaster! We will all make a fortune! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HASARI The monsoon is the great Durga's gift to the human horse! Hasari glances at Ram, who isn't a part of the joking. HASARI What's the matter? RAM I'm wet and I'm cold. Your daughter is getting married. Time is passing. I want to go home to my wife. 
Chomotkar touches Hasari, nods across the street.   There, we see the Goonda and two thugs. RAMATULLAH Hasari! It's Hasari's turn.   He can't stay to talk with Ram now. He has to go. MARWARI #4 How much to the market? HASARI Eight rupees. MARWARI #4 What!   I won't pay it! HASARI Who else needs a ride?       I am available at a price! 
Several others crowd and shove toward him. MARWARI #4 No!   Take me -- I'll pay, let's go! HASARI The price just went up!       Ten rupees! In advance. The Marwari hesitates only as long as it takes him to dig in his soaking wet pants and to slap the bills into Hasari's hand and climb aboard. Hasari sets out with great difficulty -- and greater determination -- through the floodwaters, flicking his eyes at the Goonda as he goes. 
EXT. WEDDING SHOP - DAY Water  pours down. FROM HERE we see Hasari inside, putting money  down in front of the shop owner and then hustling back  into the rain and taking up his shafts. We WATCH the owner  look after him with a touch of disdain as he comes into  the window and takes down the beautiful green and gold  sari. 
EXT. CLINIC - GUTTERS - NIGHT Water pouring from above; the gutters overflow with refuse. We PAN UP to the clinic. 
INT. CLINIC COURTYARD 
Water pouring off the room into the courtyard. Hasari locks his rickshaw into the shed and turns out, attention to Max, Aloka, Joan, Poomina, Margareta, Mehboub, several others trying to patch leaking roof tiles and keep supplies high and dry. 
INT. CLINIC ROOM Hasari enters. Max looks at him, doesn't like the look of the obviously exhausted man. HASARI How can I help? 
EXT. CIRCULAR ROAD - FISTFUL OF RUPEES (RUNNING MONTAGE) - DAY An Anglo couple jockeying for preference. Hasari selects them from a crowd. This is the beginning of RUNNING MONTAGE. A)   He runs AT us from different directions with riders -- pushing, pushing -- the water getting higher, our FOCUS VARIOUSLY IN NORMAL AND SLOW MOTION ON his feet, his tensed muscles; for a moment, we hear only his breathing, the sound of his feet on the pavement, the RAIN AGAINST the CANOPY of the rickshaw. B)   He drags up with an entire, well-to-do family of six, packed into the rickshaw. C)   He stumbles to a stop outside the emergency entrance to the hospital, carrying a mother and her sick child.

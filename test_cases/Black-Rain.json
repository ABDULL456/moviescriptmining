{"test1_input": "BLACK RAIN \nBLACK RAIN \nby \nCraig Bolotin \nWarren Lewis \nNovember 1987 \nA BLACK SCREEN: \nVarious voices:\t  \"Big six\"... \"That's six the hard way\"... \"Seven or eleven\"... \"Play two\"... \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT \nOne of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle. \nThe voices continue:  \"Hit me\"... \"Double down\"... \"Let it ride\"... \"Hit me\"... \"Anymore for the come out\"... \"Card\"... \nIn contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet brownstone, we go inside to find... \nINT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT \n... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks, tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior wiseguys from having a good time. \nAT THE CARD TABLE \nNICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate. His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled shirt, out of date; Nick could care less. \nTwo other players are still in the game.  One of them is a lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge. \nNick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot. \nNICK One, and one on top. \nDEALER House sees. \nPLAYER ONE (hesitates) I'm out. \nDisgusted, he throws down his cards. \nIt's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives Nick a long look, confident she can win. \nDEBUTANTE (her eyes still on Nick) I see the deuce, and one to chase them home. \nShe throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then decides to match it. \nNICK Call. \nDEBUTANTE (showing her hand) Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport. \nNick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her. \nNICK Very nice, Barbie. (pointing toward her boyfriend) Now, I'd take Ken over there and go home. \nDEBUTANTE Why's that? \nNICK It's time.  That's all. \nBOYFRIEND The lady wants to play.  Someone should teach you to be a better loser, loser. \nNICK Listen, Ken -- \nBOYFRIEND My name is not Ken -- \nNICK -- I'm offering you the benefit of my experience. \nDEBUTANTE Looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this.  It was nice of them to relax the dress code for you. \nThat draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads for the bar. \nCHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the debutante, blocking her path. \nShe steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused. Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick. \nCHARLIE Typical New York woman, big attitude, small apartment, no tits. \nOnly two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women, but not necessarily in that order. \nCHARLIE I think she got to you, pappy. \nNICK (checking his watch) You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.' \nCHARLIE (glancing at the door) Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs. \nNick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front door. \nTHE DOOR \nsplinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted emergency service officers -- the first members of the raiding party -- rush in. \n", "test1_true": "AT THE BAR \nNick and Charlie hold up their glasses. \nNICK (calmly) Alley oop. \nThey down their drinks, then set them down. \nCharlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but Nick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging it around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit. \nA HALF DOZEN COPS \nline the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A., PATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite, nervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the occasion. \nZACHARA Settle down.  Hey, quiet... Please. \nNot a prayer. \nNICK SHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT! \nThat quiets them. \nNICK My name is Conklin.  Let's do this fast so I can go home. \nZachara, annoyed, looks at Nick. \nNICK (softer) It's all yours. \nZACHARA (reads) Under section 216 of the New York State Penal code, I serve notice that this premise and it's occupants... \nNICK \ncatches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands. That's life. \nA well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as CAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against the wall. \nCharlie spins around to stop him -- \nCHARLIE Whoa -- where do you think you're going, hotdog. \nCavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the floor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and plunges through the WINDOW. \nNick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he follows. \nNICK (sighs) Fabulous... \nHe takes off after him. \nEXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT \nNick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential street, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the fur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately, Cavello has a good half block on him. \nFrom nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half block behind, silently cursing his age. \nAT THE CORNER \na limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo streaks away. \nCHARLIE \nturns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT \nNow in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in front of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and hair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in contrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and glowers at himself in the mirror. \nCHARLIE (over the dryer) ... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great. \nNICK Thanks. \nNick turns to leave. \nCHARLIE Hey, hey, where you goin'? \nNICK Home. \nEXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nNick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him. \nCHARLIE Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window -- \nNICK -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello. \nCharlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog complete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The bike is held together with tape and baling wire. \nCHARLIE You know him? \nNick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy. \nNICK He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos. \nCHARLIE So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust? \n", "test1_id": 486, "test2_input": "Nick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot of high quality lingerie. \nINSERT PHOTO:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage Corvette. \nNick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the drawer so it appears untouched.  He pulls open another drawer.  Then another.  Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse T-shirts, he finds: \nA BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY \nin hundreds.  The bottom of the drawer is lined with stacks.  Nick holds them up for Ich to see. \nNICK Not too shabby for a perfume pusher. \nIch, shocked, tries to play it cool. \nICH Too bad it's not in yen. \nNick shoves the drawer shut. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER \nThe GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio, waits at the other. \nTHE GIRL \nsuddenly turns and finds herself facing \nNICK \na few yards away.   Nick smiles, then walks into the store, hoping he hasn't been made. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRain pours down. \nINT.  STOREROOM - NIGHT \nNick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's apartment across the street.  The girl walks in, turns on her light, then disappears into the bathroom. \nIch walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.  He tosses his cap in the corner.  Struck out again. \nICH Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous... \nNICK (looking back out the window) Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere... \nA KNOCK at the door. \nJOYCE (O.S.) It's me. \nIch opens the door.  Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying two odons (box dinners).  Joyce and Ich exchange greetings in Japanese. \nJOYCE What's the latest? \nNick shrugs. \nICH We'll get him, Joyce. \nJoyce peeks out the window.  The girl is getting undressed. \nJOYCE She ever pull down her shades? \nNICK (right back at her) Sure, but then I just pull out the photos. \nIch opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge in front of Nick. \nICH (enthusiastically) Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki -- \nNICK Ichiro -- \nICH (realizing) Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue -- \nNICK Smells like Bayonne at low tide. \nJoyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil. \nNICK Whoa whoa... \nNick grabs the flask.  Dumps it out the window. \nJOYCE Don't be an ass. \nNICK He's on duty. \nJOYCE I paid for that. \nNick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.  Then, spotting something out the window. \nNICK Alley oop! \nNick grabs his coat and goes out the door.  Joyce slips Ich another flask of sake. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "It's our GIRL standing alone on the corner of the street but you wouldn't know it at first.  She's wearing tight leather pants, red leather jacket, earrings, bright red lipstick, and she's dumped the pony-tail, allowing her hair to fall to her waist. \nNICK AND ICH \nwatching in a doorway down the block.  Nick's shivering, his hands thrust in his army surplus jacket.  Ich doesn't mind the cold.  He's had his sake. \nTHREE BOSOZOKU \nriding their bikes come around the corner drive past her, then circle back. \nOne of the RIDERS stops to talk to her, then drives off. She hurries off in the opposite direction. \nICH Yakuza. \nNICK Good.  Very good... \nCUT TO: \nA SUBWAY STATION \nThe girl waits until the last minute, then after glancing back, steps in the car.  The train pulls out.  The cars race past until we see -- \nNick and Ich standing inside of the last car.  It disappears into the tunnel. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT \nThe girl, on the move, pushing through the crowd.  Drop back to find Ich twenty yards behind.  She crosses the street.  Nick, pretending to be looking in a store window, picks her up. \nAROUND THE CORNER \nNick has lost her.  It's a cul de sac with a dozen buildings.  He's standing in the middle of the street. Ich catches up to him. \nNICK She disappeared... shit! \nICH You were too far behind. \nNick does a double-take. \nICH (recalling Nick's words) Don't say anything more.  Don't do anything.  And, for Christ's sake, don't apologize! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  STREET - SHINZOA DISTRICT - NIGHT - LATER \nNICK \ndropping another cigarette butt to the ground.  There's a small pile at his feet.  He's leaning against the wall watching one end of the block.  TRACK over to reveal Ich, his back to Nick's, watching the other end. \nIch glances back at Nick.  Nick ignores him.  Ich turns back. \nICH Nicklaus-san! \nNick turns to see the GIRL walk out of a bath house. She's wearing her ponytail again, with a black dress.  She climbs into a taxi. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PINK SARON HOSTESS CLUB - NIGHT \nThe girl climbs out of the taxi and goes inside. \nNick and Ich are watching from across the street. \nINT.  HOSTESS CLUB \nPacked with Salarymen from the nearby brewery and hostesses in silk dresses selling cheap champagne at expensive prices. \nNICK AND ICH \nWalk in.  Everything seems normal. \nThe BOUNCER in a white tux, stops them.  This is not a place frequented by Gaiijin. \nIch beseeches the Bouncer to let his good friend in, promising that his friend will spend lots of money. \nNick, thinking he's in, takes a step forward.  The Bouncer shoves him back. \nNICK Hey, no hands, huh? \nHe bats his hands away.  Ich grabs Nick by the shoulders, preventing a fight. \nICH You can't come in.  They don't want -- \nNICK Gaiijin. \nICH I'll check it out. \nNick, unsure, turns to go, but before he does: \nNICK If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- \nICH You can trust me. \nNick hesitates, he's not so sure, then shoves the door open. \n", "test2_id": 487, "test3_input": "KOBO She's such a long way home for you. \nNICK Time, I've got plenty of. \nA raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka, swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers. The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap. \nNICK (helping him up) Hey, hey, come on, blow... \nThe Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW as it approaches the next station. \nKOBO (matter-of-factly) This is my stop. \nNICK I'm amused. \nKOBO Don't be. \nNick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's hair. \nKOBO I have her. \nNick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo. Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates. \nKOBO (matter-of-factly) I'll kill her. \nNick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train pulls into the station. \nKOBO I want the plate from your pal, Sugai.  When you get it, you get her. \nKobo gets up, starts down the aisle. \nNICK Sugai won't give it to me, you know that. \nKOBO Then take it from him. \nKobo gets off the train. \nNICK \nfollows him to the door. \nTHE STATION \nKobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby. \nINSIDE THE TRAIN \nNick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone. \nNICK \nbursts into the packed bar car. \nNICK Ichiro?! \nEveryone turns around.  No Ich. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO \nIt slows into the station. \nINT.  TRAIN \nNick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule, ignoring a conductor's angry shouts. \nINT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER \nThe train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running, dodging the crowd. \nThree uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant, hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is gone. \nNICK Where's Ohashi? \nInstead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists. \nNICK What the hell are you doing?! \nCUT TO: \nHOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION \nNick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door at the end of the hall opens. \nOhashi stops in front of his cell. \nOHASHI Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you. \nNICK For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here! \nOHASHI You had my help, detective. \nNICK If anything happens to her while I'm here -- \nOHASHI -- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them. \n", "test3_true": "OHASHI Goodbye, officer. \nOhashi keeps walking. \nNICK OHASHI! \nThe LOUD clank of metal on metal.  Ohashi's gone. \nNICK (yelling at the top of his lungs) OHASHI!! \nHOLD on Nick, his fingers squeezing the bars in rage, then -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nFlood rice paddies stretch to the distance on either side of the road.  We PAN over to Kobo at a phone kiosk outside a gas station. \nKOBO (in Japanese) Yes.  Do it. \nINT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - AT THAT MOMENT \nKobo's girl, Sugai's daughter, hangs up the phone.  She's been on the other end of the line. \nINT.  SUGAI'S ROOM \nThe door swings open.  Sugai is sitting on the floor.  The girl is carrying a tray of tea.  Beneath the tray, we spot something else -- the butt of a short-bladed tanto. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  NARITA AIRPORT - TOKYO - DAY \nA police car rolls through the service gate.  We see Nick inside the car along with two police guards. \nINT.  HOLDING ROOM - NARITA AIRPORT \nA white room.  No chairs.  Jet engines can be HEARD through the walls.  Nick is sitting on the floor, defeated.  He doesn't look up when he hears someone enter. \nICH (O.S.) I'll tell you one thing.  You can't solve a thing sitting on your ass. \nNick looks up.  Ich is in uniform.  A revolver and batton hang from his white web gear.  His undershirt bulges through his khaki shirt.  He looks ridiculous.  Nick has never seen a more beautiful sight. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  POLICE CAR \nIch is driving.  Nick is seated behind a cage in the back seat.  His hands are cuffed.  Ich is driving through the freight area towards a perimeter guard. \nNICK I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me. \nICH I followed them.  An hour from the train station. \nNICK How many men? \nICH I couldn't tell. \nNICK Joyce? \nICH I don't know. \nNICK We need the plate to negotiate with. \nIch nods. \nEXT.  AT THE GATE - TOKYO AIRPORT \nThe car slows.  Ich speaks rapidly to the guard showing him his papers.  The guard takes a good hard look at Nick. Time stands still... He waves them through.  Nick can breath again. \nNICK You know, Ichiro, you just burned your bridges. \nIch is silent for a moment.  He hands Nick's Beretta back through the partition.  So it goes. \nICH Rest. \nNick looks for Ich's eyes in the rearview mirror.  The little cop keeps driving, his eyes on the road. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  STREET - BEPUKU - DAY \nNick and Ich are standing outside their car.  The Police radio crackles from inside. \nWHAT THEY SEE: \nA large crowd gathered outside of Sugai's estate.  Police have cordoned off the area.  An empty ambulance is parked out front with various other cars:  Debonnaire's, Cadillac's... A boy in shorts is endlessly bouncing a ball against the compound wall.  Whatever happened is long over. \nIch flips off the radio. \nICH Someone attacked him. \nNICK Now we've got nothing to negotiate with. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ROAD - DUSK \n", "test3_id": 488}

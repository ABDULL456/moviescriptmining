{"train": "BLACK RAIN \nBLACK RAIN \nby \nCraig Bolotin \nWarren Lewis \nNovember 1987 \nA BLACK SCREEN: \nVarious voices:\t  \"Big six\"... \"That's six the hard way\"... \"Seven or eleven\"... \"Play two\"... \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT \nOne of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is holding open the door for a dowager and her poodle. \nThe voices continue:  \"Hit me\"... \"Double down\"... \"Let it ride\"... \"Hit me\"... \"Anymore for the come out\"... \"Card\"... \nIn contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet brownstone, we go inside to find... \nINT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT \n... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks, tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior wiseguys from having a good time. \nAT THE CARD TABLE \nNICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate. His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled shirt, out of date; Nick could care less. \nTwo other players are still in the game.  One of them is a lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge. \nNick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot. \nNICK One, and one on top. \nDEALER House sees. \nPLAYER ONE (hesitates) I'm out. \nDisgusted, he throws down his cards. \nIt's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives Nick a long look, confident she can win. \nDEBUTANTE (her eyes still on Nick) I see the deuce, and one to chase them home. \nShe throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then decides to match it. \nNICK Call. \nDEBUTANTE (showing her hand) Ladies, aces wired.  Sorry sport. \nNick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough to win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins her giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her. \nNICK Very nice, Barbie. (pointing toward her boyfriend) Now, I'd take Ken over there and go home. \nDEBUTANTE Why's that? \nNICK It's time.  That's all. \nBOYFRIEND The lady wants to play.  Someone should teach you to be a better loser, loser. \nNICK Listen, Ken -- \nBOYFRIEND My name is not Ken -- \nNICK -- I'm offering you the benefit of my experience. \nDEBUTANTE Looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this.  It was nice of them to relax the dress code for you. \nThat draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads for the bar. \nCHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the debutante, blocking her path. \nShe steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's pushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused. Finally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick. \nCHARLIE Typical New York woman, big attitude, small apartment, no tits. \nOnly two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women, but not necessarily in that order. \nCHARLIE I think she got to you, pappy. \nNICK (checking his watch) You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.' \nCHARLIE (glancing at the door) Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs. \nNick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his arms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front door. \nTHE DOOR \nsplinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted emergency service officers -- the first members of the raiding party -- rush in. \nCHARLIE \nhis hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps the ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room. Nick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the knuckles turn white. \nCHARLIE (in a whisper) What are you doing? \nNICK Saving your life. \nNUMBER TWO \nlevels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie. \nAT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE \ncalmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular, plastic-wrapped parcel. \nHe feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO. \nAbolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't affect him or his, resumes eating. \nABOLOFIA You people are wild... Wild. \nNUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave. \nWhat happens next could be a whim, an after thought. Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat before the old man's body hits the floor. \nBlood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the floor. \nCAVELLO \nreaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much left. \nThe killers slowly back out the door, covering the room with the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver. \nNICK (shouting) Police officers.  Everybody stay put. (to Charlie) Get back up. \nAbolofia's eyebrows rise at this development. \nNick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's never been in charge before. \nCHARLIE (nervously showing shield) Police. \nEXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT \nA Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up. \nNick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground. \nNumber Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the trigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House shatter. \nThe LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the package to him. \nNick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down. \nThe driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to take off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs. \nINT.  THE LIME HOUSE \nEveryone's frozen on the floor. \nCHARLIE Call 911.  Tell them an officer needs assistance.  Say ten thirteen. \nNothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie grabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the phone. \nCHARLIE Do it, you dumb bastard! \nSuddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He looks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood from the massacre.  So much for his new shoes. \nHe wheels around, then quickly backs out the door. \nEXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE \nDeserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance. Charlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where is his partner? \nCHARLIE NICK...!  Shit... SHIT!! \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT \nNick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley: it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting, slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's that can. \nAN ABANDONED PAIL \nswings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his gun and nearly blows him away. \nNUMBER ONE \nWe see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO. His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped casually at his side.  A very cool character. \nKobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his finger, slowly points and \"shoots\" at Nick... He lowers his hand. \nNICK On the ground, man.  NOW!! \nKobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand English.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and kicks out his legs. \nINT.  INTERROGATION ROOM \nABOLOFIA is seated in chair next to his LAWYER.  Nick, Oliver, and a third detective are grilling him. \nABOLOFIA He was with a friend, sure.  I shake hands with the guy and a minute later he's bleeding all over my socks. \nATTORNEY Will that do officers?  My client has had a terrible shock. \nNICK Yeah, he's not used to seeing other people do the killing. \nATTORNEY I won't tolerate harassment! \nOLIVER What about the package? \nATTORNEY We know nothing about it. \nSilence.  Abolofia looks at Nick, then at Oliver. \nABOLOFIA Hard to believe a trained police officer could let this kind of thing happen right in front of his face. \nNICK I did make a mistake.  I let the wrong guy get hit. \nAbolofia doesn't blink an eye, goes for the jugular. \nABOLOFIA Cheer up, Nick.  I'm sure it's easier to pick a dead man's pocket. \nNick springs from his feet.  Oliver grabs Nick before he can get close to Abolofia. \nATTORNEY That's it, we're through! \nCUT TO: \nKOBO \nthe Japanese killer who smashed in Nick's face last night. He's sitting in an interrogation room an hour later with a DETECTIVE and a JAPANESE TRANSLATOR.  He won't talk. \nOBSERVATION ROOM \nNick and Oliver watching through the glass. \nOLIVER Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested. \nNICK Why? \nOLIVER He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him. \nNICK What? \nOliver nods.  That's the way it is. \nON KOBO \nhe turns and looks at Nick.  He can't possibly see him through the one way glass but he knows Nick's there. \nON NICK \nlooking at him. \nON KOBO \nmaking a cutting mark across his forehead, right where Nick's bandage is.  It's uncanny. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER \nNick is sitting in front of Oliver's desk.  The sunlight makes him wince; wincing makes his face hurt. \nOLIVER Japanese embassy talks to state department.  State talks to police plaza.  They to me and me to you. Shit rolls down hill. \nOliver drops a file folder on the desk.  Nick opens it: petty cash, vouchers and plane tickets. \nOLIVER You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight. \nNICK What...?  What if I say no? \nOLIVER Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country. \nNICK Why me? \nOLIVER They said send a detective if I could spare one. (then) I can always spare you. \nNick bridles at the insult.  Oliver's had a hard-on for Nick for years, and Nick's tired of it. \nNICK (soft) You got something to say to me, Captain? \nOliver doesn't want to get into it. \nOLIVER Yeah.  Have a wonderful flight. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ORANGE SUN \non the tail of a Japan Airlines 747.  A driving rain storm.  The plane taxies down the runway and disappears into the black rain. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SIDE STREET - MINIMAI MURAMATSU - NIGHT \nThe jammed streets are barely wide enough to get a motorcycle down.  It's a bad neighborhood, one of the poorest in Tokyo. \nWe spot the small kimono clad WOMAN, clip-clopping on wooden geta, leading Nick and Charlie through this labyrinth. \nCHARLIE (looking around) Getting very weird. \nNICK I'd feel better if we had some heat. \nCHARLIE Maybe we should bail? \nSeeing they've stopped, the woman gestures for them to hurry up, then disappears around the corner. \nNICK (looking at the maze of streets) Think we could find our way back? \nCUT TO: \nA GARISH PINK SIGN - PINK SARON BAR \nA poor man's idea of a bar.  The woman points inside, chirps away in Japanese, bows, then hurries off leaving Nick and Charlie on their own. \nINSIDE PINK SARON \nNick and Charlie disappear into darkness as the woven flaps shut behind them.  A vintage wurlitzer juke box glows across the room.  An Enka plays.  (Haunting Japanese blues.) \nMAN'S VOICE (FROM THE DARKNESS) Big shots from New York.  I like your style! \nICHIRO MATSUMOTO steps into a pool of light just inches from them.  He is a short overweight man looking every minute of his fifty-five years.  His white short sleeve shirt is too tight; his narrow tie spotted in the middle; his collar soaked in sweat.  He's not drunk yet, but he's been at it a while.  Call him Ich. \nICH (bowing) Detective Ichiro Matsumoto.  I'm the man you're looking for. \nThis is Ohashi's best man?  Well, at least he speaks English. \nICH The man you are looking for, Kobo, was a member of the Samaguchi-gummi. A Yakuza. \nIch nods, offers them what's left of his Sapphoro beer. They shake their heads.  Ich finishes it. \nNICK Where do we start looking for this guy? \nICH Where would you look for the mafia? \nCHARLIE The back room at Lombardi's after the Columbus Day Parade.  Under the bed.  In the mayor's office. Everywhere. \nIch heads for the door without saying a word. \nNICK Where're you going, Ichiro? \nICH (stops, faces them) The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's. (tucking in his shirt tail) And call me Ich. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ICHIBANKAN BAR BUILDING - KABUKI CHO - NIGHT \nImagine an ultra modern indoor shopping mall, except there aren't any stores.  The only product sold here is pleasure:  Bars, hostess clubs, Turkish baths.  A post- modern red light district with music piped in and automated doormen. \nINT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME CLUB \nHip, younger Japanese are wedged together at the long chrome bar.  The GUYS sport leather jackets and Raybans. The GIRLS are decked out in fifties American party dresses and short cropped hair.  Jerry Lee Lewis wails in the background. \nNick, Ich and Charlie are at one end of the long bar.  Ich is drinking them both under the table. \nICH (singing) \"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.\" (raising glass for toast) To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis. \nNICK (checking his watch) Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night. \nICH No, this is the place for the young Yakuza. \nNICK That's what you said in the last three piss pots. \nIch sets down his drink, pours more sake for Nick and Charlie then for himself.  He's having a great time. \nICH I love you people.  The music, the clothes, the movies... Japanese respect only what is Japanese. \nNick glances at Charlie. \nNICK It's incredible.  Hit him or something. \nCHARLIE I don't think he'd feel it. \nICH (beginning to slur his words) Americans change everything.  When I was young the city was wood and paper... I was ten when the bombers came.  I lived underground for three days.  When I came up, the city was gone... A ball of fire. \nNick gets to his feet.  Ich grabs him by the arm, stopping him. \nICH It began to rain, Nick.  You know what color the rain was? \nIch doesn't give him a chance to answer. \nICH Black... It was black from the ash. Very impressive.  You Americans, you could make black rain. \nIch polishes off his drink.  An awkward silence.  Charlie, wanting to lighten the mood -- \nCHARLIE (leaning close) Say Ich, between friends, where can I grab some squish around here? \nNick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's blocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past, but they grab him. \nKOBO \nholding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train tears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at \nNICK \ntrying to struggle free. \nKOBO \nhis eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the speeding express as if he were a sack of laundry. \nNICK \nNICK NO!! \nA woman SCREAMS. \nThe train barrels through the station. \nKobo starts toward Nick.  He's next. \nA pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd searching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile. \nNICK \nmanages to break free of the leatherboys holding him. They flee into the crowd as the police close in. \nACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO \nslips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a train by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove commuters into the already packed cars. \nNick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him. He can't get through. \nTHE SUBWAY DOORS \nslam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on the empty platform. \nTHE LAST CAR \nstreaks past him.  Kobo stands in the rear window, getting smaller and smaller until the train disappears down the tracks. \nICH Nick! \nIch, out of breath, is standing on the platform.  Nick looks at him with disgust -- where the hell was he. \nSTAY on Nick, his head bowed, being surrounded by the sea of blue-suited commuters. \nFADE TO WHITE. \nFADE IN: \nNICK'S FACE against a white wall.  That's all we see. Ohashi's voice OFF SCREEN. \nOHASHI (O.S.) ... You ignored me.  I don't care about what you want.  Get on a plane, detective Conklin.  Go home. \nWe HEAR a door open and SLAM shut off screen.  Hold on Nick, frozen in place, then: \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CENTRAL SECTION - TOKYO POLICE H.Q. - DAY \nAgain, the fifty desks, fifty faceless men working. Typewriters CLACKING, phones RINGING.  We MOVE down the rows to find Nick sitting behind one of the desks.  He's on the phone to New York. \nOLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE) It's not your job. \nNICK He was my partner. \nOLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE) They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner! \nNICK I planned on catching him, Captain. \nOLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE) How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane. \nNICK He killed a police officer. \nOLIVER (V.O.) (PHONE) Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period. \nOliver hangs up.  A moment of long distance hum cross talk.  Nick doesn't move.  Pull back through the rows of cops busily working... SOUND FADES. \nCharlie Parker's alto sax FADE UP as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SHINJUKU - NIGHT \nThe MUSIC continues.  The sax screams as the melody is abandoned. \nNick is drunk.  Roaring angry drunk.  He doesn't know where he is.  He doesn't care.  He plows down the street, occasionally grabbing a passerby, then letting them go. \nNick begins to laugh.  A couple is staring at him, Nick yells at them, but we DON'T HEAR HIM.  He stumbles on... drop back to find. \nICH \nEXT.  NARITA AIRPORT \nThe brightest object in the frame is a yellow forklift carrying a jostling aluminum coffin toward the open belly of the cargo plane.  Nick watches it from the edge of the tarmac. \nAIRPORT CHECK IN GATE \nNick hands the clerk his ticket. \nNICK ... Smoking. \nCLERK Aisle or window? \nNick spots a folded newspaper someone has left on the counter.  He can't read it, of course, but there's a picture of the subway platform where Charlie was killed, swarming with police.  Nick continues to stare at the paper. \nCLERK Aisle or window, sir? \nNICK (looks up) I want to cash it in.  Yen. \nCUT TO: \nICH'S APARTMENT - DAY \nNick steps in, drops the two suitcases. \nNICK Ichiro? \nThe woman steps out of the kitchen, babbles something in Japanese.  Nick doesn't have a clue. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LAS VEGAS WELCOME BAR - AFTERNOON \nOnly a handful of patrons.  Joyce is straightening bottles behind the bar. \nNICK (O.S.) What's tricks? \nShe looks up, surprised to see Nick standing in front of her. \nJOYCE Ich said you left. \nNICK There was a change in plans. \nBeat. \nJOYCE I'm sorry about your friend. \nNick's surprised at how fast she heard. \nJOYCE Dead gaiijin's are big news. \nNICK Gaiijin? \nJOYCE An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me. (beat) More you. \nNICK I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time. \nJOYCE I don't give tours. \nNick smiles. \nNICK You can count on the truth from people who don't like you. \nJOYCE You have a helluva way of asking for help. \nNICK You have a helluva way of answering. \nDraw. \nJOYCE Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs. \nNICK Maybe I'm a quicker learner. \nJOYCE I don't think so. \nFrom OFF SCREEN: \nICH (O.S.) Nicklaus-san. \nNick turns to see Ich, leaning against the door frame. He's already had a few drinks too many.  He's delighted to see Nick. \nICH I've continued working on the case! \nNICK I can see that. \nIch ambles into the room, slips down into a chair.  He spills the contents of the large manila envelope he's been carrying onto the table:  a wallet, a set of keys, playing cards, etc. \nICH (signaling to Joyce) Joyce... A drink please. (to Nick) Kobo has disappeared.  My superiors don't trust me. \nNick walks over to the table and looks at the items. \nICH Kobo's.  Taken off him when he was arrested in New York. \nNick sits down.  Joyce gives Ich his scotch. \nICH I knew you'd come back.  You feel you have a debt you can never pay. But you will, even if it costs you your life.  Giri.  Honor. \nNICK (to Ich) Now we're making progress. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SEIBU DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nCLOSE ON A SALESGIRL behind the cosmetic counter.  She is wearing the store uniform:  blue and white dress and white gloves.  A doll.  We shouldn't recognize her at first. Then -- \nINSERT A PHOTO \none of Kobo's porno pics.  It's the same face. \nREVEAL NICK \nholding the photo, standing in the crowded store.  Ich is beside him. \nNICK That's Kobo's girl?  He's sure? \nIch glances back at the man in the Hawaiian shirt standing by the door.  The man nods. \nICH He's sure. \nThey watch the girl help a customer choose an eyeliner. \nICH Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo. \nNICK Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SOBA RESTAURANT - DAY \nNICK \nis struggling with his chopsticks and bowl of noodles. From O.S. A LOUD SLURPING SOUND.  The sound stops, then starts again.  Nick can't eat.  He sets his bowl down and looks over at \nICH \nslurping his noodles.  It is considered polite to slurp soba noodles as loud as possible. \nIch stops.  Looks at Nick, then resumes his slurping. \nNICK Think you could keep it to a dull roar? \nThey're sitting by the window across from the Seibu department store watching the entrance. \nICH It's good manners. \nNick nods.  Picks up his bowl.  Again the LOUD slurping off screen.  Nick starts to eat the noodles.  He can't continue with Ich slurping.  He sets the bowl down. \nIch grins, resumes slurping and we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - SIX P.M. \nThe SALESGIRLS are lined up at the door bowing and thanking the last customers for shopping in their store. Standard practice. \nThe GIRL whom Nick and Ich have been watching comes out wearing her uniform and heads down the street. \nNICK AND ICH \nwaiting in the restaurant, get up to follow. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GIRL \nstepping out of the laundry carrying her wash.  She walks past a doorway where... \nNICK is standing. \nICH now walks past his partner picking up the tail.  No acknowledgement between them. \nEXT.  STREET CAR STATION \nThere are dozens of street cars waiting to pull out.  The girl is on one of them.  Ich has lost her.  Nick and Ich hurry from car to car. \nICH You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.' \nNICK (cutting Ich off) No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize! \nICH Nick... \nNick hurries toward another car to check it out. \nNICK What'd I tell you? \nICH There she is! \nThey spot the girl sitting in the window of one of the street cars, about to turn onto the main street. \nThe two cops race for the car.  Nick leaps on.  Ich is a few steps behind.  Nick sticks out his hand, pulls Ich up. They stand looking at one another, both breathing hard, both out of shape. \nCUT TO: \nNick goes through her chest of drawers:  on the top, a lot of high quality lingerie. \nINSERT PHOTO:  The girl and Kobo posing in a vintage Corvette. \nNick replaces the picture, and carefully rearranges the drawer so it appears untouched.  He pulls open another drawer.  Then another.  Under the jeans and Mickey Mouse T-shirts, he finds: \nA BANK STACK OF U.S. CURRENCY \nin hundreds.  The bottom of the drawer is lined with stacks.  Nick holds them up for Ich to see. \nNICK Not too shabby for a perfume pusher. \nIch, shocked, tries to play it cool. \nICH Too bad it's not in yen. \nNick shoves the drawer shut. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GIRL - DUSK - TWO DAYS LATER \nThe GIRL buys fruit from a stand as NICK watches from one end of the block; ICH, listening to his transistor radio, waits at the other. \nTHE GIRL \nsuddenly turns and finds herself facing \nNICK \na few yards away.   Nick smiles, then walks into the store, hoping he hasn't been made. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  GIRL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRain pours down. \nINT.  STOREROOM - NIGHT \nNick, leaning against the wall, watches the girl's apartment across the street.  The girl walks in, turns on her light, then disappears into the bathroom. \nIch walks in, exhausted, soaked to the skin.  He tosses his cap in the corner.  Struck out again. \nICH Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous... \nNICK (looking back out the window) Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere... \nA KNOCK at the door. \nJOYCE (O.S.) It's me. \nIch opens the door.  Joyce, dressed for work, is carrying two odons (box dinners).  Joyce and Ich exchange greetings in Japanese. \nJOYCE What's the latest? \nNick shrugs. \nICH We'll get him, Joyce. \nJoyce peeks out the window.  The girl is getting undressed. \nJOYCE She ever pull down her shades? \nNICK (right back at her) Sure, but then I just pull out the photos. \nIch opens one of the box dinners and sets it on the ledge in front of Nick. \nICH (enthusiastically) Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki -- \nNICK Ichiro -- \nICH (realizing) Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue -- \nNICK Smells like Bayonne at low tide. \nJoyce hands Ich a flask of hot sake in tinfoil. \nNICK Whoa whoa... \nNick grabs the flask.  Dumps it out the window. \nJOYCE Don't be an ass. \nNICK He's on duty. \nJOYCE I paid for that. \nNick tosses a few thousand yen on the table.  Then, spotting something out the window. \nNICK Alley oop! \nNick grabs his coat and goes out the door.  Joyce slips Ich another flask of sake. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HOSTESS CLUB \nNick waiting under the pink neon sign. \nINT.  HOSTESS CLUB - LATER \nIch is sitting at the crowded bar.  A HOSTESS has her arm around his neck.  He checks out the room, searching for the girl.  He notices two THUGS standing outside a sliding door.  Ich finishes his drink. \nICH (in Japanese) Let me up. \nHOSTESS (shoving him down) Sit, sweetie. (to bartender) Another Seagrams! \nIch relents.  Then, spotting something across the room: \nWHAT HE SEES:  A rice paper door slides open, momentarily revealing a DOZEN men with close cropped hair sitting on tatami mats, playing poker.  Some have their coats off, revealing arms covered with tattoos.  Yakuza. \nA hostess, serving drinks, steps but leaving the door partially open. \nThe hostess slides the door open to the adjacent room, but Ich CANNOT see inside.  She slides it shut. \nIch's hostess wants him to buy another drink, but Ich shakes his head, gets to his feet, and pretending to be drunk, stumbles toward the sliding doors. \nIch bumps into a table; slaps a stranger on the shoulder; then starts singing along with Frank Sinatra on the stereo.  He's a little too loud, a little off key. \nThe bodyguards eye Ich suspiciously.  He stumbles past them, then grabs the sliding door and yanks it open. \nINSIDE THE ROOM \nA low table.  Kobo is at one end.  An older, distinguished, sliver-haired man in his seventies whom we will come to know as SUGAI is at the other.  Ich can't believe his eyes:  Sugai is the head of the largest Yakuza syndicate in Japan. \nA half dozen LIEUTENANTS sit on either side of the table. Half are older, dressed in conservative suits; the other half are younger wearing $700 Issy Miyake jackets. \nSUGAI AND KOBO \nare having a heated discussion.  The GIRL Ich and Nick have been following walks over to Kobo and sits beside him.  This makes Sugai even more irate.  He's on his feet, red faced and screaming. \nFOUR GUARDS \nseeing Ich, pull out their Beretta's.  Two more grab him and fling him head first against the wall. \nICH (drunken, in Japanese) I have to piss, gentlemen... I'm so sorry but I have to -- \nThe bodyguards hurry him towards the door. \nEXT.  HOSTESS CLUB \nNick checks his watch, it's been an hour - where the hell is Ich? \nIch comes stumbling up the steps, still affecting his drunken, pigeon-toed walk.  Nick, of course, thinks Ich has gotten drunk again.  Two of the bodyguards are watching from inside. \nNICK I don't believe it... (grabs him) Son-of-a-bitch -- \nIch, knowing they're being watched, grabs Nick by the sleeve and drags him off still pretending to be drunk. \nICH (under his breath) I'm not drunk... \nNICK We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto. \nICH Nick -- \nNICK Shut-up. \nNo longer fearing he's being watched, Ich abruptly stops his affected walk, and sounding very sober -- \nICH You shut-up! (then) Kobo is inside.  He's with Sugai, the head of the Summaguchi-clan. \nACROSS THE STREET \nIch is dialing on the police call box as he fills Nick in on Sugai. \nICH ... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant. \nNICK I want to yank Kobo. \nICH Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san. \nIch quickly speaks on the police phone, then hangs up, pleased with himself. \nNICK Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick. \nICH San is an honorable title. \nIch realizes it's better to drop it. \nCUT TO: \nTHE HOSTESS CLUB - MINUTES LATER \nDrunken Salarymen spill out the door. \nICH AND NICK \nare standing across the street waiting for the cops to arrive. \nNick freezes. \nNICK While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. \nOHASHI Look. \nOhashi directs Nick's attention across the street where a SURVEILLANCE VAN is parked.  The rear doors are open revealing a van full of surveillance equipment and cops. \nOHASHI You ruined an on-going investigation that could have gotten us more than one runner. (to Ich, in Japanese) I want a full report in the morning, officer. \nIch bows as Ohashi walks off. \nNICK Maybe if you'd work with us -- \nOhashi ignores him, continues walking toward his waiting car. \nNICK (shouting) Hey...! (Ohashi keeps walking) HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR! \nOHASHI (his back toward Nick) Twenty-four hours, detective. \nOhashi slips into his car.  Nick storms up to the car and slams his fist on the window. \nNICK Ohashi! \nOhashi faces straight ahead, ignoring Nick.  Nick takes the extradition paper and spikes it on the car antenna. \nIch grabs Nick by his arm, pulling him back from the car. The car pulls away. \nICH Nick, stop! \nNick whirls, and before he realizes what he's doing, punches Ich below his left eye.  Ich stumbles back over the curb and lands on his ass. \nNICK Damnit, Ichiro, I'm tired of people telling me what I can and can't do. No one ever solved anything sitting on their ass. \nNick, beside himself with frustration, watches Ohashi's car disappear down the block. \nON ICH \nlooking up at \nNICK \nwho walks off without looking back at his partner. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ICH'S BATHROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER \nNick, standing beside the tub, dumps a pail of hot water over his head, rinsing himself off.  He grabs a towel and walks out of the room. \nINT.  ICH'S APARTMENT \nIch, holding an ice pack to his face, is lying on a tatami mat against the wall looking up at the ceiling.  An open bottle of Seagrams beside him. \nNick stretches out on another tatami on the opposite side of the room and looks up at the ceiling, too. \nNICK The ice help? \nNothing from Ich. \nNICK Where does this Sugai live? \nICH (cold) A resort city, Beppu. \nNICK I want to go talk to him. \nICH What...?  Why? \nNICK Because he knows how to get to our man. \nICH He'll never speak to a Gaiijin. \nNICK I'll be a nice Gaiijin. \nNick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the door.  All of his and Charlie's clothes have been neatly hung up. \nHe shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with the way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand over the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining. \nNick rips the lining open.  Charlie's .32 Beretta and a spare clip tumble out. \nNICK The little bastard.  God bless him. \nIch takes a drink from his bottle. \nICH It's very small. \nNICK Big enough. \nICH It's illegal, Nick. \nNICK It's a new deal. (putting it in his waist band) ... coming with me tomorrow? \nICH Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick. (beat) No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore. \nNick picks up the liquor cap which rolled across the floor.  He tosses it to Ich.  Ich reaches for it, but misses. \nNICK Sure, pal.  You've got better things to do. \nJOYCE I don't remember saying yes. \nNICK I don't remember you saying no. \nJoyce smiles, heads inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ICH'S APARTMENT - DAWN \nIch is sleeping. \nNick slips into his leather motorcycle jacket.  He drops Charlie's gun into his pocket.  He glances down at Ich, seeing if he's awake.  He's not.  Nick walks out. \nIch opens his eyes.  He's been awake the whole time. \nCUT TO: \nTHE YANAKA CEMETERY - DAY \nIch, wearing a blue suit, is pouring water over a simple stone with a wooden dipper.  Next, he places incense in a holder and folds his hands in prayer. \nThe photo on the stone is of a young man wearing a school uniform.  Ich's son. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA BULLET TRAIN - DAY \nIt's bull's-eye nose cone scuds across the endless rice paddies west of Tokyo.  Women in straw hats stand in the knee deep water pruning the rice by hand.  Old Japan rubbing shoulders with the new. \nINT.  TRAIN - DAY \nCLOSE ON NICK looking out the window as the countryside shoots past at 140 mph.  From O.S. several children chanting:  \"Harrow, Harrow.\" \nNick looks over to see three uniformed school children thrusting their notebooks and pens at him. \nJOYCE \nis sitting across from Nick. \nJOYCE They want your autograph. \nNICK Who am I supposed to be? \nJOYCE This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson... \nNICK Tell them I'm not. \nShe does, but the kids insist. \nJOYCE They'll never go away. \nNick, reluctantly signs.  Joyce takes one of the kid's notebooks before passing it back. \nJOYCE Mick Jagger? \nJoyce smiles, surprised at his choice.  Then, she looks up shocked to see -- \nICH \ncarrying a gift wrapped package under his arm.  He's wearing his hat, blue suit and tie. \nIch sits ACROSS the aisle from Nick and Joyce.  He doesn't say a word.  Faces straight ahead. \nNick looks at Joyce, then back at Ich. \nNICK I'm sorry, Ichiro.  I lost it last night.  I shouldn't have hit you. \nStill nothing from Ich. \nNICK What's in the box? \nICH (still not facing him) For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you. \nNICK So I bring some cheese? \nJOYCE Gifts are expected here. \nNick nods, looks back out the window.  He'll never understand this country.  He looks back to see -- \nJoyce looking annoyed at him.  Nick gets the message. \nNICK Hey, Ich... Thanks.  I'm glad you're here.  I mean it. \nIch still won't acknowledge Nick. \nEXT.  BULLET TRAIN \nThe Bullet Train disappearing into the foothills. \nEXT.  BEPPU - DAWN \nPlumes of white steam spindle skyward from every street corner.  If you didn't know it was steam, you'd think the city was on fire.  Beppu is a resort famous for it's geothermal baths. \nEXT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE \nSUGAI The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me. \nNICK You trust me? \nSUGAI I'll pay you. \nNick laughs at Sugai's audaciousness. \nNICK (indicating the counterfeit bills) With these? \nSUGAI Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police. \nNICK If I say no? \nSUGAI You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it. \nNICK I don't have to. \nSugai cools.  Without a word he gets to his feet and starts toward the door. \nNICK I have ten hours to grab my man. \nON SUGAI \nstill walking with his back to Nick. \nNICK (O.S.) You won't get hurt. \nSugai turns to see Nick, across the room, pointing the Beretta at his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ROOM - SUGAI'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe room where Ich and Joyce are waiting.  Sugai enters. Their surprise turns to shock when they see Nick behind him holding a gun to the old man's head. \nICH No... \nNICK Let's go.  Him first. \nICH Nick, you can't do this. \nNICK It's done. (to Joyce) You don't have to come. \nShe hasn't moved a muscle. \nINT SUGAI'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY \nSugai watches calmly as Nick, Ich, and Joyce put their shoes on.  Nick keeps the gun on him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SUGAI'S COURTYARD \nNick steps out of the house.  He now has one end of a wire coat hanger loosely wrapped around Sugai's neck, the other end around his wrist.  His gun is pressed just beneath Sugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai. \nA handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is polishing Sugai's Debonnaire car.  They spot Nick and Sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns. \nNICK Explain to them.  They shoot me, they kill you. (Sugai hesitates) DO IT! \nSugai explains to his lieutenants.  They stand helpless as Nick walks Sugai toward the car. \nNICK Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside. \nICH No. \nNICK Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me. \nIch takes the keys from the man polishing the car.  He gets inside.  Joyce hurries in bedside him. \nICH You don't know what you're doing. \nNick slides Sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over and shuts the door. \nNICK Start it. \nICH (terrified) I can't... \nJOYCE Slide over. \nJoyce, furious at Nick, starts the car, gets behind the wheel.  Ich gets in on the other side. \nShe spins the car around.  The gate opens.  They tear off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET - BEPPU - DAY \nThe car bursts through the funnels of steam from the hot- springs beneath the street.  It tears down the narrow block dodging traffic.  Joyce is concentrating hard on the road. \nNICK (to Ich) Where's somewhere safe? \nNothing from Ich.  He's still apoplectic. \nJOYCE (angrily) You came up with the first part. \nTHE CAMERA FINDS the closed elevator door.  It opens, Kobo steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery. \nCUT TO: \nSUGAI \nwearing his hat and coat is sitting on the couch, his back to us, facing out the window. \nDrop down to -- \nTHE ROOM BENEATH HIM \nA couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room. \nThe door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting into Sugai's room above. \nTHE GIRL \nstarts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump bullets into the ceiling. \nKOBO AND HIS MEN \nstop in front of every door long enough to blast into the room.  They make their way down the hall. \nA naked man steps into the hallway and is matter-of-factly gunned down. \nKobo and his men stop in front of Sugai's room. \nINT.  SUGAI'S ROOM \nSugai, wearing his hat, is slumped down on the couch which has been splintered by the bullets from below. \nOUTSIDE THE ROOM \nKobo signals the men.  All six open-up through the door. \nINSIDE THE ROOM \nThe door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men step in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom door, into the closet... Windows shatter, mirrors fall, total destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE. \nKobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He lifts up his hat.  It's a cowboy mannequin wearing Sugai's clothes. \nTHE ELEVATOR DOOR \nopens.  A DOZEN of Sugai's men carrying machine pistols come out. \nTHE OUTSIDE BALCONY \nNick and Ich lie on their bellies, guns out. \nINSIDE THE ROOM \nKobo's men turn.  Sugai's men open-up.  Three of Kobo's hitters go down.  The others try to flee into the adjoining room. \nKobo goes for the balcony. \nTHE BALCONY \nas Kobo steps out.  He steps right into -- \nNICK \nwho slams the side of Kobo's head with the butt of his gun. \nTHE ROOM \nNick and Ich drag Kobo in by his jacket collar.  Sugai, very much alive, walks in from the hallway.  Nothing is said.  Sugai looks at Kobo for a long beat, then walks out. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SUGAI'S HOUSE - DAY \nKOBO \nstanding alone in the middle of a tatami room.  His face is badly beaten.  His hands are bound.  Two guards stand near the wall.  Nick and Ich stand across the room. \nSUGAI \nwearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in Japanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to answer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife -- from it's scabbard. \nSUGAI (in Japanese) Contact your associate in New York and tell him to hand my plate over to Abolofia. \nNothing from Kobo. \nSUGAI You have betrayed the syndicate and personally dishonored me.  I would rather the deal fell through than... \nThe guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to Sugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's neck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on Kobo's arms. \nNICK \ncan't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to get up, Ich stops him. \nKobo realizes Sugai isn't just threatening him. \nKOBO No... I'll arrange it. \nKOBO She's such a long way home for you. \nNICK Time, I've got plenty of. \nA raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka, swaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers. The Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap. \nNICK (helping him up) Hey, hey, come on, blow... \nThe Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves on.  Kobo looks out the window, the train begins to SLOW as it approaches the next station. \nKOBO (matter-of-factly) This is my stop. \nNICK I'm amused. \nKOBO Don't be. \nNick looks up to see Kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond hair tied with black ribbon.  Joyce's ribbon.  Joyce's hair. \nKOBO I have her. \nNick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled over Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo. Kobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates. \nKOBO (matter-of-factly) I'll kill her. \nNick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs.  The train pulls into the station. \nKOBO I want the plate from your pal, Sugai.  When you get it, you get her. \nKobo gets up, starts down the aisle. \nNICK Sugai won't give it to me, you know that. \nKOBO Then take it from him. \nKobo gets off the train. \nNICK \nfollows him to the door. \nTHE STATION \nKobo get into a waiting Jaguar.  Four guards nearby. \nINSIDE THE TRAIN \nNick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the Jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone. \nNICK \nbursts into the packed bar car. \nNICK Ichiro?! \nEveryone turns around.  No Ich. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TRAIN - TRAIN STATION - TOKYO \nIt slows into the station. \nINT.  TRAIN \nNick shoves past the passengers lined up in the vestibule, ignoring a conductor's angry shouts. \nINT.  TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER \nThe train stops.  Nick flies out and starts running, dodging the crowd. \nThree uniformed policemen, including Ohashi's assistant, hurry toward him; they're dismayed to find that Kobo is gone. \nNICK Where's Ohashi? \nInstead of offering him help, the policemen grab him and slap a pair of handcuffs on Nick's wrists. \nNICK What the hell are you doing?! \nCUT TO: \nHOLDING CELL - TOKYO POLICE STATION \nNick, waiting alone in the cell.  It's been hours.  A door at the end of the hall opens. \nOhashi stops in front of his cell. \nOHASHI Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you. \nNICK For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here! \nOHASHI You had my help, detective. \nNICK If anything happens to her while I'm here -- \nOHASHI -- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them. \nThe police car streaks across endless fields. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nNick is at the wheel.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes. Ich is slumped down in the seat watching the road. \nIch pulls out a cigarette.  Nick lights it for him. \nNICK Joyce told me about your family. It's tough... \nIch looks up surprised. \nICH Thank you. (beat) You have one? \nNICK A wife.  She left. \nICH I'm sorry. \nNICK Me too. \nIch glances over at Nick, then back at the road. \nNicks rubs out his cigarette and presses down on the accelerator. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  KOBO'S HIDEOUT - DAWN \nA small, contemporary house perched on a dry piece of land.  A paved road, lined with dense foliage runs on a berm between the flooded rice paddies. \nON NICK AND ICH \nsitting in the car watching from a hillside turnoff. There's no easy way in. \nNICK Let's go. \nIch hands Charlie his shuto -- an 18 inch long knife. \nNICK What's that for? \nICH Luck. \nNick tucks the shuto inside his jacket. \nNICK Thanks. \nNick opens up his door and climbs out. \nICH You know, Nick, we can't lose. \nNICK (stopping) Why's that? \nICH Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DIRT ROAD \nleading to the house lined with foliage.  The rice paddies on either side. \nCUT TO: \nNICK AND ICH \nmaking their way through the waist high water. \nTWO WORKERS \nwith their hoes make their way into the water.  They don't see our cops. \nOUR COPS \nmaking their way along the edge of the road.  The SOUND of a motorcycle coming. \nTHE MOTORCYCLE RIDER \nslows and drops a gear as he turns off the main road and onto the dirt berm toward the house.  He's one of Kobo's Bosozoku -- a long way from the streets of Tokyo. \nThe rider comes around the bend to see -- \nA COP \nstanding in a uniform.  Ich.  For a moment he doesn't know what to do.  Then, he draws a pistol from his belt and accelerates toward Ich. \nICH \nstands his ground as the bike closes in.  The biker takes aim. \nIch drops off to the side as -- \nNICK \nrises from a ditch and swings a hoe at the rider as he passes, catching the man across the face.  The rider drops like a swatted fly.  The biker's momentum carries it a few yards before it falls and skids to a halt. \nNick hurries to the bike. \nICH Yes... \nNICK (to Joyce) Call for help. \nNick mounts the other bike, and puts the turbo charged rocket into gear. \nTHE ROAD \nRain pours down as Kobo turns onto the main road.  He opens up the throttle, and in less than a second, he's a screaming dot in the distance. \nNICK \ncomes around the same corner.  His bike fishtails and slides out from under him. \nFURTHER DOWN THE ROAD \nKobo tears past a police car.  The police car takes off after him. \nTHE FOOTHILLS \nA series of steep switchbacks traverse the steep, densely forested hills. \nKobo's bike flies up the road.  The police car can't keep up, begins losing ground. \nTHE POLICE CAR \ngoing flat out, falling further and further behind. Kobo's going to escape. \nSUDDENLY \nNick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is scraped and bloody. \nON KOBO \nglancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's pleased.  He gives it more gas. \nNICK \npulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain stings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open. \nTHE FOOTHILLS \nKobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher and higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the peak. \nNICK \nis gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind him. \nA BOSOZOKU \nthe one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail. \nON NICK \nas the biker draws even. \nTHE BIKER \npulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder. \nNick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops back.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with him.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good. \nThe biker moves in again, blade drawn. \nNICK SEES \nsomething the biker doesn't. \nA TRUCK \ncoming around the corner. \nNICK \nswerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts too late and runs -- \nINTO THE GLEAMING \nradiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its wheels. \nON KOBO \naround the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up on the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to see \nNICK \nburst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred- and-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain. \nKOBO \nwaits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off back down the mountain, shooting past Nick. \nNick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the wheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid, heading right for the edge of the road. \nCUT TO: \nNICK \nstill moving, his arms and legs feel like lead. \nKOBO'S FINGERS \nas they reach for the plate. \nNICK \ngrabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick picks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash Kobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate, shattering it in a half-dozen pieces. \nNick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face. \nNICK Keep the change. \nNick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks over at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows. The same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way mirror in New York. \nNick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen... \nFADES TO BLACK. \nBLACK SCREEN \nThe SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The SOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down. \nThe SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING phones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES... \nFADE IN: \nINT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS \nFifty identical desks.  Fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties work under fluorescent lights. \nOHASHI \nis at his desk studying a report. \nSuddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the electric typewriters. \nOhashi looks up to see -- \nICH \nwalking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is bandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches. \nIch silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to Ohashi's desk. \nICH \nstops in front of the desk and snaps to attention. \nICH Constable Ichiro Matsumoto presents captured prisoner Kobo, Chief Inspector Ohashi. \nIch salutes. \nOHASHI Inspector Ohashi will take charge of the prisoner. \nIch uncuffs Kobo and steps aside to reveal -- \nNICK \nstanding at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's also bandaged and on crutches. \nNick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the main switch up.  The lights and fans start working. \nHe turns and walks out the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  POLICE COURTYARD - A FEW DAYS LATER \nA small decoration ceremony. \nON ICHIRO \ngetting two golden suns pinned to the lapel of his dress uniform. \nIn the far corner \nNICK, JOYCE AND \nIchiro's wife, dressed in a formal kimono, watch the ceremony. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  JAPANESE RESTAURANT - TOKYO - DAY \nJoyce and Nick are sitting alone at a table.  Nick's left arm in in a sling. \nNICK Can't make you change your mind? \nJOYCE Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. \nNICK Might be different in New York. \n", "test1_input": "Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe. Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters. \nNICK What's this? \nCHARLIE Let go... \nNick pulls out a Beretta 32. \nCHARLIE Back-up. \nNICK Get rid of it. \nCHARLIE Why? \nNICK It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. \nCHARLIE (looking at Nick's bike) I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater. \nThe Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke. Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some ski goggles. \nCHARLIE Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello. \nNICK Charlie... \nNick pops the bike into gear. \nNICK ... You still got shaving cream on your ear. \nNick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke. \nEXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT \nWE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night. \nEXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT \nCivil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick or Chrysler in every garage. \nOne house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open grave.  He shoots away. \nINT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT \nA hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet. \nNick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up. \nNICK Short shift? \nCONNIE Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at the ceiling.  They've just made love. \nCONNIE It's getting too cold even for me, Nick. \nNICK Connie... \nCONNIE All right, how's the new partner? \nNICK High spirits, desire, commitment. \nCONNIE You'll take care of that. \nNICK Give me a break, would you? \nCONNIE If you give me one. \nNick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection. The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly, they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe. \nNICK Are you expecting anyone? \nCONNIE I wasn't expecting you. \nShe disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open, then telling someone to wait. \nCONNIE (poking her head in the room) Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT \nNick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn. Charlie is holding his hands up defensively. \nCHARLIE ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's -- \nNICK -- I should tear your head off. \nCHARLIE Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- \nNICK -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up. \nCharlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He knows he's on sensitive ground. \n", "test1_true": "CHARLIE (buddy buddy) I like her.  She's nice. (lowering his voice) For her age. \nThe bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's clothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile. Without a word, she goes back inside and slams the door behind her. \nNick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie shrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT \nThe Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of Chinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the jukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind the bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other dishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three a.m. at the Lime House. \nAT THE BACK TABLE \nOur man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out of place. \nA Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them. \nAT THE BAR \nCharlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might peg him.  Nick is at ease. \nCHARLIE What are they doing now? \nNICK Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked. \nCHARLIE Who do you think the Jap is? \nNICK Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know? \nCHARLIE I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him. \nCharlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot. \nCHARLIE Whatdaya think?  'Bostonians'. Eighty-five bucks. (lowering his voice) Girls go for shoes.  Second place they look. (off Nick's reaction) Hey, I read it in a magazine. \nNick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door. \nNICK (dead serious) Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me? \nCHARLIE What? \nWHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of the bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey hair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight Mafioso. \nNICK Frank Abolofia. \nCHARLIE The Wolf? \nAbolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake hands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests. \nNICK (in a whisper) Some party. \nCHARLIE Maybe we should do something? \nNICK Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm. \nNick turns away, resumes his drink. \nNICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark Versace suits. \nNUMBER ONE \nwears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the room then nods to -- \nNUMBER TWO \nwho pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters. Everyone hits the floor. \nNUMBER ONE \nslowly walks toward Cavello's table. \nNUMBER TWO \ncovers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty hands. \nNICK AND CHARLIE \non the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy either. \nAT THE TABLE \nOur Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them contemptuously. \nAbolofia has put enough people in this situation to be philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any precipitous action. \nNUMBER ONE (in Japanese) Give it to me. \nThe Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long, silent pause... Then, still not facing him: \nBUSINESSMAN (in Japanese) Go to hell. \nNumber One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging his eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his coat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube. \nHe presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's throat. \n", "test1_id": 486, "test2_input": "NICK You going to take this crap off our hands? \nNAGASHIMA (confused) Crap...?  Oh, the prisoner.  Yes. \nHe barks some orders to the officers who immediately take Kobo by the arms and put cuffs on him.  Nick unfastens his cuff when they're through. \nIn contrast to Nagashima's gentility, the cops are rough with the prisoner. \nCHARLIE (extends his hand) Charlie.  Kon-ich-iwa. \nNagashima shakes his hand.  Bows.  Charlie bows back. Nick wouldn't bow if his life depended on it.  Nagashima hands Nick an official looking document. \nNAGASHIMA If you will please give this to the customs inspector he will expidate -- expedite you.  We have a car and a driver outside. \nNICK Right. \nCHARLIE (bows) Arigato. \nNick grabs Charlie by the arm and starts for the customs line. \nNICK Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun. \nCHARLIE Hey, when in Rome -- \nNICK In Rome, I'll bow. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CUSTOMS BOOTH - DAY \nNICK and CHARLIE make their way through the crowd toward the head of a long line.  They dump their bags on the counter.  The INSPECTOR, furious that they have taken cuts in line, barks at them in Japanese. \nNICK Inspector Nagashima told me to give you this. \nHe hands the Inspector the official looking document.  The Inspector scans the paper.  Hands it back to them. \nINSPECTOR (broken English) You must get in line behind the rest. \nNICK We're cops.  Pol-ice-men. \nThe Inspector signals a nearby POLICEMAN.  The Inspector says something in Japanese.  Hands the policeman the document.  The policeman shakes his head, amused, points to the end of the line. \nNICK Fellas, get serious. \nFrom off screen someone CALLS OUT: \nMAN (O.S.) Nick! \nNick and Charlie turn to see KOBO, their prisoner, standing on the other side of the thick plastic divider. The handcuffs are off.  The three alleged 'policemen' are heading out the door behind him.  It was a set-up:  Nick and Charlie have been had. \nKOBO (perfect English) Thanks for the ride, detective. \nHe slowly backs away from the glass as if he had all the time in the world, finally disappearing in the crowd. \nCUT TO: \nNICK AND CHARLIE \ntrying to shove past the customs inspectors who are wrestling them aside. \nNICK Cops!  He's our prisoner! \nTwo more policemen arrive.  Nick and Charlie are thrown up against the wall.  Out come the cuffs.  SNAP! \nNICK What's going on?  We're the good guys! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nFifty identical desks.  Fifty identical phones.  Fifty identically dressed men in white shirts and ties working under the fluorescent lights of this large open room. \nWe GLIDE PAST the rows of desk to find INSPECTOR OHASHI, mid forties, sitting behind a perfectly arranged desk. Ohashi prides himself on order. \nNick and Charlie are standing in front of him. \nNICK Get me something like an Identi-Kit and I'll give you a description. \nOhashi remains poker faced.  He continues to arrange papers and apply his hanko (personal seal) to the bottom of a stack of official papers. \nCHARLIE There must be some witnesses from the airport? \nStill nothing from the good inspector. \nNICK What is it, tea time? \nStill nothing from Ohashi.  Finally: \nOHASHI (quiet rage) You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer. \nNICK Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents. \nOhashi bows slightly, we're not sure why. \nNICK I want a gun. \n", "test2_true": "NICK We're police officers. \nOHASHI You're foreigners. \nNICK Work with me.  I want your best detective. \nPause.  Ohashi returns to his papers.  Nick can't believe it. \nNICK Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this. \nOHASHI (not looking up) Do you know what this is? \nOhashi holds up the document that was handed to Nick at the airport. \nOHASHI It's a laundry list.  Go home, detective. \nNick studies him for a beat, then turns away.  To Charlie: \nNICK Let's go. \nCHARLIE Nick, we can't just -- \nNICK I said let's go, Charlie. \nReluctantly they head towards the door, passing long rows of bureaucrats, telephones ringing off the hook.  Nick stops at the door, spots a fuse box nearby.  He glances back to make sure no one is looking. \nNick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out what the hell he's doing.  Nick attaches one cuff to the main lever then yanks it down. \nThe lights go out.  The fan's stop; so do the typewriters; so does the air conditioning.  Dead silence. \nNick attaches the other cuff to a pipe, snaps it shut. Now it's impossible to left the main lever. \nFrom the far end of the room: \nOHASHI What are you doing?! \nNick drops the key down the water fountain drain. \nNICK Your best detective, Ohashi. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  POLICE STATION - DAY \nNick and Charlie cross the street.  Charlie's trying to read the name from the piece of paper Ohashi has given them. \nCHARLIE ... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side. \nNICK Let's grab some food. \nCHARLIE First decent idea you've had. \nCharlie pulls out his 'Footloose in Tokyo\" book, flips through the pages. \nCHARLIE Food... Food, here we go.  Tokyo offers a wide variety of food.  It's best to sample the local specialties, including sashaimi, soba, and world renown Kobe beef... \nNick goes into a restaurant.  Charlie drops the book, disgusted with Nick's choice.  Charlie reluctantly follows him in.  REVEAL it's a Shakey's Pizza restaurant. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HOUSING PROJECT - SHIN OKUBO - DAY \nRows of post-modern buildings of odd shaped windows and brightly painted concrete walls.  Nick and Charlie are searching for the Japanese cop's building.  They can't speak the language; they can't read the signs; and half the buildings don't have numbers.  It's a nightmare. \nCHARLIE This should be it... \nNICK You said that in the last two places. \nCharlie holds out the paper to a passing man. \nCHARLIE Kore?  Doku?  Kore doku? \nThe man gestures toward the building Charlie was pointing to. \nNICK Okay, you were right. \nCharlie grins, satisfied. \nINT.  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe boys are knocking on a door.  Nick turns the handle. It's unlocked. \nTHE APARTMENT \nA four tatami room.  An unholy mess:  Food packages, beer bottles, stacks of papers and file folders.  Framed pictures of long dead relatives hang on the wall. \nCHARLIE This the right place? \nNICK I hope not. \nA WOMAN now appears at the door.  Middle aged, wizened face, in a full traditional Kimono. \nCHARLIE Konichiwa.  Ichiro Matsumoto? \nThe woman babbles bird-like in rapid Japanese.  She bows. They're in the right place. \n", "test2_id": 487, "test3_input": "Suddenly, the street is empty again.  Silent except for the SOUND of the wind beating against paper lanterns, rustling the wind chimes... \nHold on Nick and Charlie standing in the middle of the street, realizing just how far away from home they are. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  HOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING \nA rocket shaped building:  a mixture of Dutch Gable and Japanese Minka roof.  The mid-day sun beats down on a particular room. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM \nNick and Charlie are sacked out.  They never bothered to pull the curtains.  THE SOUND OF KNOCKING at the door. \nICH (O.S.) Nick! \nNICK Give us a break... \nICH (O.S.) It's Ichiro.  Ich. \nNICK Leave the rice cake outside and go home! \nBut Ich persists. \nAT THE DOOR \nAs Nick opens up.  Ich bows.  He's now clean shaven and has put on a clean shirt. \nICH There's been a murder.  Yakuza.  You should come. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PRINTING PLANT - DAY \nThe murder scene.  NO SOUND. \nA SERIES OF SHOTS: \nA BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN in the claws of six foot working robotic.  The tattooed covered legs swing back and forth like a pendulum. \nTHE TORSO is wedged in between two enormous printing rollers. \nTHE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt. It's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun to congeal. \nWE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching. Charlie has the dry heaves. \nREAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of the usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter, there is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance. \nINSPECTOR OHASHI \nquietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic. The severed legs stop swinging. \nNick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows deeply.  Ohashi doesn't acknowledge any of them, talks to a man holding a tape measurer. \nNICK Could you fill me in? \nOHASHI Why don't you ask your chief detective? \nIch looks down at the floor. \nNICK Because I want you to tell me. \nOHASHI The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. \nNICK Can we skip the poetry, inspector? \nOhashi pauses.  Ich looks at Nick as if to warn him he can't speak to Ohashi that way. \nOHASHI There's a war, detective, between two rival groups.  The man who escaped, Kobo, leads the younger group.  They did this. \nICH Kobo's a wild boy.  He was a lieutenant in the Sammaguchi-gummi. \nOHASHI (in Japanese) Excellent, Officer Matsumoto.  How is your investigation going? \nICH (in Japanese) Well, sir.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work with these distinguished gentlemen. \nHe bows.  It's pathetic. \nPOLICE LIEUTENANT Looking for clues in the bottom of a sake bottle, Matsumoto? \nLaughter all around. \nOHASHI He's an officer of great distinction. \nAnother sarcastic dig.  Ich stoically stands and takes it. \nCHARLIE Hey, Ich has been helpful. \nOHASHI (ignoring him, to Nick) Have you changed your mind and decided to go home, detective? \nNICK Not until one of us bags Kobo. (looking at the corpse) And it doesn't look like you're doing so hot. \nOhashi coolly flicks the ashes of his cigarette and we -- \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "Ich, Nick, and Charlie are threading their way through the crowd toward the subway entrance. \nTWO BIKERS, their hair slicked back, watch the trio from the top of two different subway entrances. \nAs soon as Ich, Nick and Charlie go down the steps, they climb off their bikes and follow. \nINT.  SUBWAY STATION \nNick, Ich and Charlie are riding the people mover that stretches the length of this endless tunnel.  They're sandwiched between the legions of SALARYMEN (white collar workers) who all wear identical blue suits and white shirts. \nNick looks over at Ich, who is still suffering in silence from the recent humiliation. \nNICK You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever. \nICH (beat) I don't deserve Ohashi's respect. \nNICK Why the hell not? \nICH I don't, that's all. \nIch looks away, obviously uncomfortable. \nCHARLIE You cool, Ich? \nICH Cool? \nCHARLIE You all right?  You okay? \nIch nods. \nCHARLIE What does Ichiro mean, anyway? \nICH (smiling) What does Charlie mean? \nCHARLIE Hey, all right. \nCharlie slaps Ich on the back. \nNICK smiles at Charlie's remark.  He can't help but like this wide-eyed goofy kid. \nSomething makes Nick's smile fade. \nNICK'S POV \nKOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite direction.  His Kamali suit looks like it just came from the cleaners. \nNICK Charlie! \nCharlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the railing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake. \nIch can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously shoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the end of the walkway. \nCHASE SEQUENCE \n-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen. \n-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back. \n-- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all directions. \n-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them near the turnstile. \nNick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say anything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving people out of the way. \nNICK (calling after him) It's a set-up...!  Charlie! \nCharlie hasn't heard him. \nAT THE TURNSTILE \nKobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears onto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The guard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it. Charlie leaps over the turnstile. \nThe GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway police. \nTHE PLATFORM \nCharlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces. Kobo is gone. \nNICK \nshoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at him to wait.  Charlie can't hear his partner. \nTHE SUBWAY \npulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his whistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd back. \nA LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he stumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at the last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo. \nKobo smiles, it's all a big joke. \nWhat follows happens in a flash: \nON NICK \nNICK Charlie! \n", "test3_id": 488}

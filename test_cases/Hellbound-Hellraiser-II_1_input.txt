KYLE opens his mouth a few times, as if unsure what to say. 
KYLE It's all true. 
53   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT 
TIFFANY walks around her room, staring at her completed puzzles - those on the wall and the one on the floor - and waiting for the next one. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
54   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY 
A simple shot tells us it is the next morning. 
55   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY 
MALAHIDE , dressed in a black suit, is in the room, staring at the empty mattress. We TRACK with him through to his LIVING ROOM. 
56   INT.   LIVING ROOM  MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY 
In contrast to the secret and private obsession room, this room is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful professional. 
It is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white walls. The walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three large canvases of abstract art. 
The longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table, which rests against it about half way down. On this table is a very simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful white lilies. Above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror. 
As MALAHIDE enters, the first thing he sees is a bloody palm- print on one of his white walls. He blinks at it and looks down into the room. We CUT TO; 
JULIA. At first it seems she is staring at the lilies, but as we TRACK around her, we realise she is staring at the reflection of her skinned self. 
Her face snarls at herself, she roars with rage, forms her hand into a fist and shatters the mirror. 
MALAHIDE rushes towards her. She swings round and freezes him with a glance. 
They hold their positions for a moment, MALAHIDE nervous and JULIA furious, and then JULIA makes herself relax. She sighs, takes a few deep breaths, and then speaks. 
JULIA I'm cold. 
TIME CUT 
57   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY 
CLOSE UP on a strangely Art Deco electric fan heater, with bright red coils emitting waves of heat. 
We pull out to see MALAHIDE standing by the table with the flowers. There is now a half-full glass of wine on the table, along with an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored. A pack of cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of MALAHIDE's jacket. 
JULIA enters the room and closes the door behind her. She is dressed in one of MALAHIDE'S suits. It is a light weight suit of white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries. 
She crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre of the room, to allow MALAHIDE to look at her. 
JULIA Well? 
MALAHIDE'S nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to smile. He nods his head slowly a few times. 
MALAHIDE Yes... Yes. You look... 
JULIA Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish? 
MALAHIDE No. You look... 
He pauses, lost for words. 
JULIA doesn't wait for an answer. She crosses to the table and takes up his glass of wine. She downs it in one. 
MALAHIDE stares at her, a little surprised. 
JULIA Yes, I still like WINE ... 
She smiles strangely at him and then moves closer. Slowly, keeping her eyes on his, she reaches into his breast pocket for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth.

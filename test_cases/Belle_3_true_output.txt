61.6: The whirl of the pleasure gardens...DIDO alone - searching hard for OLIVER or the others. Her pace quickens as a hand comes down on her shoulder, taking her breath away. 
OLIVER I did not dare return to Lady Mansfield without you. 
DIDO (relieved) I..I am terribly sorry. I thought I saw the others, I went after them....and found myself lost. OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving. 
CUT TO: 61.7 ON LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, ASHFORD, seated on a bench. LADY MANSFIELD It's almost dark! 
LADY ASHFORD Look, here are James and Miss Murray. ELIZABETH and JAMES approach, sit on the bench opposite. ELIZABETH I do hope you know how well I think of you. 
JAMES As I do you. 
ELIZABETH Then I hope, Sir, you plan to honour your attentions...as not to would leave me looking... quite foolish. JAMES And I should not call myself a gentleman! Satisfaction washes over her. As DIDO and OLIVER appear, LADY     * MANSFIELD lets our a cry of relief, goes to say something -       * LADY ASHFORD lays a finger across LADY MANSFIELD's lips.          * 
LADY ASHFORD Say nothing! This has all been for the good of the future, I assure you! 
CUT TO: 61.8: The two couples and ladies stroll back to the carriages. 
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D) Elizabeth is a determined spirit. LADY MANSFIELD She is. They stare at the couple ahead. 
LADY ASHFORD She will need a gentleman who can temper her. Quite a task. 
She fixes on LADY MANSFIELD, lets her eyes do the talking... LADY MANSFIELD exchanges a look with LADY MARY. 
LADY MANSFIELD (to Lady Ashford) Do I sense that an address is finally to be made? LADY ASHFORD goes carefully... 
LADY ASHFORD She is an exquisite girl... (with relish) And...since there is no male heir and...it will therefore fall upon Elizabeth and her husband to eventually inherit all of Kenwood and its lands... 
Colour drains from LADY MANSFIELD. LADY MARY closes her eyes, dismayed. LADY MANSFIELD Lady Ashford, may I... LADY ASHFORD ...I realise there will be no end of worthy addresses to consider. ON LADY MANSFIELD as she too closes her eyes at the strain. 
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D) My dear? Lady Mansfield, what is it? 
62   INT. ASHFORD CARRIAGE - NIGHT.11                           62    * JAMES Penniless? LADY ASHFORD (disgusted) Without an inch of property, or shilling to her name! 
OLIVER chuckles. LADY ASHFORD rests her hand on JAMES' knee. 
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D) Your situation can attract so much better, James. She brings nothing but name. A real lady is blessed with SO much more. 
OLIVER (sardonic) Do you hear that, James? A lady's good breeding alone will not do! LADY ASHFORD (to Oliver) Your brother needs a wife who will bring him further land! LOTS!... if he is ever to exert more political influence than your father has. JAMES But what of her own father? 
LADY ASHFORD The Seventh Viscount Stormont is a scoundrel. Ensconced in Vienna with the girl's vicious step-mamaa and his new offspring - who I am told is to inherit EVERYTHING.

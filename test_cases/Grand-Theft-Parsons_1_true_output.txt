PHIL Yes I am. 
CLERK No. You're here to pick up a casket. 
Phil looks irritated. 
PHIL Okay.   A casket. 
CLERK What flight number? 
CON TINUE D: 
PHIL It   was due out on the next flight to   New Orleans, but I'm driving it   now. The stiff doesn't like to   fly. 
The clerk stares at him. 
CLERK You're one of those funny guys, right. 
PHIL Yeah, but it's my day off. 
CLERK Name? 
PHIL Mine or the...? 
CLERK The deceased. 
Phil moves to the desk. 
PHIL Parsons. 
The clerk turns and shouts over his shoulder. 
CLERK Barney - bring up Parsons. 
INT. BANK - MANAGER'S OFFICE. MORNING The Bank Manager is staring at the piece of paper. 
BANK MANAGER I simply can't give you any money based on this piece of paper. 
Barbara is totally calm. 
BARBARA It's not a piece of paper. It's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money. 
BANK MANAGER Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly, subject to a valid will existing. 
CON TINUE D: 
She just looks at him.      He tries again. 
BANK MANAGER (CONT'D) Mister Parsons was a customer of ours. We can't just pass his money across to someone who says they're in the will. There are... rules. 
Barbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to cry. 
BARBARA You don't seem to understand. These are his wishes. Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable. He gives her his handkerchief. 
BANK MANAGER No... I do... understand, Miss Mansfield. Really I do. 
BARBARA Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money. 
BANK MANAGER Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead. 
BARBARA Are you saying that I'm lying? BANK MANAGER No, absolutely not. But getting a copy of the death certificate would probably be a good first step. 
INT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING 
Stanley takes a swig from a hip flask and looks out of the window. A very overweight, red-faced man squeezes into the next seat. He bangs Stanley with his knee as he sits, but Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of the window. He is watching the cargo being loaded. 
P. J. GAMBRELL Paw on the space, don'tcha think? 
Stanley turns slowly. 
CON TINUE D: 
STANLEY I'm sorry? 
The fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand, which Stanley shakes awkwardly and reluctantly. 
P. J. GAMBRELL P J Gambrell, at yer assistance. Pernell Jayson. Jes' saying paw on the space in dese buckets.

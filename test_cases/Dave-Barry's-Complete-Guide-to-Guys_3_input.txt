(TO CAMERA) If that was you...you're a guy.

INT. A DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
SHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The muffled SOUNDS of the warmup band O.S. 
SHERYL CROW Well there were always guys at my shows - right from the beginning. I mean you start out playing beer halls, right? So when you have beer, you have guys. And it sorta just grew from there. But I was okay with it. They didn't cause much trouble. 
DAVE (O.S.) And what about men. 
SHERYL CROW Men cause trouble. 
(THEN) But that's okay too. I get half my songs from that. 
DAVE (O.S.) So it all works out. 
SHERYL CROW Long as they buy the records...

INT. MIAMI PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 
Dave walks along the stacks in the ANTHROPOLOGY SECTION. 
DAVE So where did this all start? Many experts now think they know where men came from, but what about Guys? where did they come from? He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things. 
DAVE To answer this question accurately, we might have to look something up. So instead we'll travel back to prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and get there just in time for the Dawn of Guys.

TITLE CARD: "THE DAWN OF GUYS" 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PREHISTORIC AFRICA - MOONLIGHT 
The endless expanse. A cluster of caves. SOUND EFX of all kinds of nasty shit out there. Skittering over rocks. Slithering through the grasses. Bigger predators, circling... A ROOSTER cocks his head back and CROWS out. 
CUT TO: 
TNT. ONE OF THE CAVES PRIMATE ROGER opens one eye...SEES PRIMATE ELAINE, PRIMATE KIDS and PRIMATE IN-LAWS. Hairy grunting things, all sleeping in a protective clump... 
He rolls over, back to sleep. But the ROOSTER CROWS again... 
CUT TO: 
THE ROOSTER, COOKING ON AN OPEN FIRE 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CAVES - MORNING 
PRIMATE ROGER comes out. A sleepy nod at PRIMATE GENE and OTHER PRIMATES, as they take up LARGE JAGGED ROCK SLABS leaning against their caves and start off. In a few million years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way. 
EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE AREA - CAVES IN B.G. - MORNING 
PRIMATE ROGER and PRIMATE GENE have joined PRIMATE LENNY and PRIMATE PHIL. All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks.

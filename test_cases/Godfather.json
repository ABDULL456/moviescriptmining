{"train": "The Godfather \nTHE GODFATHER \nScreenplay \nby \nMARIO PUZO \nand \nFRANCIS FORD COPPOLA \nTHIRD DRAFT\t\t\t\tPARAMOUNT PICTURES 1 Gulf and Western Plaza March 29, 1971\t\t\t\tNew York, New York 10019 \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) \nThe PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering: \nTHE GODFATHER \nWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\" Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion. \nBONASERA America has made my fortune. \nAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen. \nBONASERA I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family.  She found a boy friend, not an Italian.  She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.  She resisted; she kept her honor.  So they beat her like an animal.  When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain. \nHe can barely speak; he is weeping now. \nBONASERA I went to the Police like a good American.  These two boys were arrested and brought to trial.  The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence.  Suspended sentence! They went free that very day.  I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me.  Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather. \nBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home. \nThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside. \nDON CORLEONE Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends. \nBONASERA What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask! \nDON CORLEONE And what is that Bonasera? \nBONASERA whispers into the DON's ear. \nDON CORLEONE No.  You ask for too much. \nBONASERA I ask for Justice. \nDON CORLEONE The Court gave you justice. \nBONASERA An eye for an eye! \nDON CORLEONE But your daughter is still alive. \nBONASERA Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you. \nBoth HAGEN and SONNY react. \nDON CORLEONE You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money. \nBONASERA America has been good to me... \nDON CORLEONE Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you... \nSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs. \nBONASERA Be my friend. \nDON CORLEONE Good.  From me you'll get Justice. \nBONASERA Godfather. \nDON CORLEONE Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return. \nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) \nA HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine. \nDON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies. \nThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied. \nDON CORLEONE Where's Michael? \nSONNY He'll be here Pop, it's still early. \nDON CORLEONE Then the picture will wait for him. \nEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns it.  Then he moves to his wife. \nSONNY Sandra, watch the kids.  They're running wild. \nSANDRA You watch yourself. \nHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows HAGEN. \nEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945) \nOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance. \nDON CORLEONE My Godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat. \nAt once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER. \nJOHNNY I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather. \nDON CORLEONE Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you? \nJOHNNY I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up... \nHe's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to HAGEN. \nDON CORLEONE Tell Santino to come in with us. He should hear some things. \nThey go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) \nHAGEN glances up the staircase. \nHAGEN Sonny? \nThen he goes up. \nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945) \nSONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy. \nLUCY Sonnyeeeeeeee. \nHer head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze in that position. \nHAGEN (O.S.) Sonny?  Sonny, you in there? \nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945) \nOutside, HAGEN by the door. \nHAGEN The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem. \nSONNY (O.S.) Okay.  One minute. \nHAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the door again.  TOM leaves. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) \nDON CORLEONE ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in Heaven, is it possible you turned out no better than a Hollywood finocchio. \nBoth HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes. \nDON CORLEONE All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work. \nJOHNNY He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. \nThe DON is silent, stern. \nDON CORLEONE You take care of your family? \nJOHNNY Sure. \nHe glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can. \nDON CORLEONE You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want. \nJOHNNY It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot. \nDON CORLEONE I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. \nHe takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt. \nDON CORLEONE Now go back to the party and leave it to me. \nHe closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN. \nDON CORLEONE When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom? \nHAGEN They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important? \nDON CORLEONE No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom? \nHAGEN I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night. \nThis saddens the DON.  He sighs. \nDON CORLEONE Genco will wait for me.  Santino, tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big car, and ask Johnny to come with us. \nSONNY And Michael? \nDON CORLEONE All my sons. (to HAGEN) Tom, I want you to go to California tonight.  Make the arrangements. But don't leave until I come back from the hospital and speak to you. Understood? \nHAGEN Understood. \nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) \nNow all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses. \nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) \nSilence. \nHIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat. \nDON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace. He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply. \nDON CORLEONE Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns. \nEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945) \nJACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate, armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate, and TOM enters. \nEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945) \nHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens, martinis in hand. \nWOLTZ You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom, I had to check you out.  I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. (a piece of statuary) Florence, thirteenth century. Decorated the garden of a king. \nThey cross the garden and head toward the stables. \nWOLTZ I'm going to show you something beautiful. \nThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\" TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as WOLTZ approaches. \nWOLTZ You like horses?  I like horses, I love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive Racehorses. \nThe animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him with true love in his voice. \nWOLTZ Khartoum...Kartoum...You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.  But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud. \nINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945) \nHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous. \nHAGEN Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship. \nWOLTZ Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else. \nHAGEN He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood? \nWOLTZ You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork! \nHAGEN I'm German-Irish. \nWOLTZ Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS! \nEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945) \nAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC.\" next to an open-faced fruit market. \nA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO. \nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) \nLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced. They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE. \nSOLLOZZO My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous. \nDON CORLEONE Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity? \nSOLLOZZO I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend. \nDON CORLEONE What percentages for my family? \nSOLLOZZO Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up. \nDON CORLEONE And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? \nSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN. \nSOLLOZZO My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share. \nDON CORLEONE So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me? \nSOLLOZZO If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone. \nThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer. \nDON CORLEONE I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect... (pause) But I'll say no to you. \nWe feel this around the room. \nDON CORLEONE I'll give you my reasons.  I have many, many friends in Politics. But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling.  They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business. \nSOLLOZZO takes a breath. \nDON CORLEONE No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed. \nSOLLOZZO Are you worried about security for your million? \nDON CORLEONE No. \nSOLLOZZO The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. \nThis startles SONNY; he blurts out. \nSONNY The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment? \nSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line. \nDON CORLEONE Young people are greedy, and they have no manners.  They speak when they should listen.  But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. \nSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard: \nThe DON turns to SONNY. \nFREDO (going) Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick, he's sick.  I don't mind getting the car. \nFREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out his window. \nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) \nFREDDIE crosses the street. \nINT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nOFFICE MANAGER Buon Watale, Don Corleone. \nThe MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the DON glances out his window. \nThe black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving. \nDON CORLEONE Merry Christmas. (handing the MANAGER an envelope) \nAnd he starts down the stairs. \nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) \nThe light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open fruit stand near the corner. \nThe PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then turns back to the car. \nEXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945) \nTOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks, someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO. \nHe takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him. \nSOLLOZZO (quietly) Don't be frightened.  I just want to talk to you. \nA car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open. \nSOLLOZZO (urgently) Get in; I want to talk to you. \nHAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened. \nHAGEN I haven't got time. \nTWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him. \nSOLLOZZO Get in the car.  If I wanted to kill you you'd be dead already. Trust me. \nHAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the car drive off. \nEXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945) \nRADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY nostalgically hums \"The Bells of Saint Mary's,\" as they walk arm in arm. \nKAY Would you like me better if I were a nun? \nMICHAEL No. \nKAY Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman? \nThey have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do. MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question. \nKAY (a little voice) Michael? \nMICHAEL I'm thinking about it. \nKAY Michael... \nMICHAEL No, I would not like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. \nShe cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave. \nThe headlines read: \"VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED DOWN.\" \nMICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY knows to remain silent. \nMICHAEL (desperately) They don't say if he's dead or alive. \nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) \nDON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car. \nDON CORLEONE Fredo, Fredo! \nThe paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots. \nFive bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car. \nThe PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit. \nThe TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off. \nTheir feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are more GUNSHOTS. \nFREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops the gun. \nThe gun falls amid the rolling fruit. \nThe GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form. \nThe GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came. \nThe PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.  But the street itself is now empty. \nSONNY A couple of our people will come to stay here.  Do whatever they say; I'm going over to the main house. If you want me, use Pop's special phone. \nThe telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it. \nSONNY Hello. \nSOLLOZZO (O.S.) Santino Corleone? \nSANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY indicates that she be quiet. \nSONNY Yeah. \nSOLLOZZO (O.S.) We have Tom Hagen.  In about three hours he'll be released with our proposition.  Don't do anything until you've heard what he has to say.  You can only cause a lot of trouble.  What's done is done. (a pause) Don't lose that famous temper of yours. \nSONNY (quietly) I'll wait. \nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945) \nFULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house. \nINT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945) \nSONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls out. \nSONNY Ma?  Ma, where are you. \nThe kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm. \nSONNY Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad. \nMAMA (quietly) Santino?  Have they killed him? \nSONNY (almost in tears) We don't know yet, Ma. \nMAMA I'll get dressed.  In case we can see him... \nShe moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office. \nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nHe switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk, and dials a number. \nSONNY Tessio...This is Santino Corleone. I want fifty reliable men out here. \nTESSIO (O.S.) I heard, Sonny...but what about Clemenza's regime? \nSONNY I don't want to use Clemenza's people right now.  Understood? \nHe hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer. \nSONNY Luca. \nINT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945) \nThe interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits and ties sit around in the booths. \nHAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him. \nSOLLOZZO I know you're not in the muscle end of the family--so I don't want you to be afraid.  I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me. \nHAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully. \nSOLLOZZO Your boss is dead... \nHAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes. SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully. \nSOLLOZZO (pushing the bottle) Have some more.  We got him outside his office, just before I picked you up.  You have to make the peace between me and Santino. \nHAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man. \nSOLLOZZO Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it. \nHAGEN (pulling himself together) Sonny will come after you with everything he's got. \nSOLLOZZO rises, impatiently. \nSOLLOZZO That's going to be his first reaction.  You have to talk some sense into him.  The Tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people.  The other New York Families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war. \nHe leans close to HAGEN. \nSOLLOZZO The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business. \nHAGEN Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi. \nSOLLOZZO I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids. \nHAGEN I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do. \nSOLLOZZO (lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness) Good...then you can go... (he escorts him to the door) I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense. \nHe opens the door; they step out together. \nEXT NITE: BUILDING \nHAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit. \nBut a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out. He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to SOLLOZZO in private. \nThen SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in. \nSOLLOZZO The old man is still alive.  Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive. (he gives a fatalistic shrug) Bad luck for me, bad luck for you. \nHAGEN If I plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never do better than I did tonight with that Turk. \nEXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945) \nThe windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night. \nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) \nThe living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m. \nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nSONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks.  They can barely talk anymore. \nHAGEN Is the hospital covered? \nSONNY The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list. \nHAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad. \nHAGEN Too much, too far, too personal. The Don would consider this all purely a business dispute: Get rid of Sollozzo, and everything falls in line.  YOU don't have to go after the Tattaglias. \nCLEMENZA nods. \nHAGEN What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me. \nSONNY If Luca sold out we're in real trouble. \nHAGEN Has anyone been able to get in touch with him? \nSONNY No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up. \nHAGEN Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number. \nMICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up. \nHAGEN Keep trying every fifteen minutes. (exhausted) \nSONNY Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies? \nHAGEN Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny. \nSONNY (angry) That's easy to say; it's not your father. \nHAGEN (quietly) I was as good a son to him as you or Mike. \nSONNY Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way. \nHAGEN We're all tired... \nSONNY OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day. \nThere is a timid knock on the door. \nSONNY What is it? \nPAULIE GATTO looks in. \nCLEMENZA I tol' you to stay put, Paulie... \nPAULIE The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package... \nSONNY Tessio, see what it is. \nTESSIO gets up, leaves. \nPAULIE You want me to hang around? \nSONNY Yeah.  Hang around. \nPAULIE Outside? \nCLEMENZA Outside. \nPAULIE Sure. \nHe closes the door. \nSONNY Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood? \nCLEMENZA Understood. \nSONNY Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news. \nHAGEN Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that. \nSONNY OK forget it, just stay on the phone. \nMICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one answers. \nTESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside. \nCLEMENZA A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. \nINT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945) \nLUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand. LUCA looks up at him. \nThen SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately. LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes bulge. \nONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength leaves him. \nCLEMENZA Maybe, or you gotta know now. \nPAULIE Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing. \nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945) \nThe car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway. Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE. \nCLEMENZA Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a leak. \nThe car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him. \nHe turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car. \nPAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered. \nCLEMENZA Leave the gun. \nLAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945) \nHIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons. \nMICHAEL walks along in the rear yard. \nHe is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard. \nA rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This is where he was a child.  Then a shout. \nCLEMENZA (O.S.) Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone. \nCLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL hurries into the house. \nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945) \nCLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot. He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the hook. \nCLEMENZA Some dame. \nMICHAEL picks it up. \nMICHAEL Hello.  Kay? \nKAY (O.S.) How is your father? \nMICHAEL He'll be OK. \nKAY (O.S.) (pause) I love you. \nHe glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the phone. \nKAY (O.S.) I LOVE YOU. \nMICHAEL Yeah Kay, I'm here. \nKAY (O.S.) Can you say it? \nMICHAEL Huh? \nKAY (O.S.) Tell me you love me. \nMICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls up in a corner, and in a quarter voice: \nMICHAEL I can't... \nKAY (O.S.) Please say it. \nMICHAEL Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK? \nKAY (O.S.) OK. (click) \nCLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house. \nCLEMENZA How come you don't tell that nice girl you love her...here, learn something... you may have to feed fifty guys some day.  You start with olive oil...fry some garlic, see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat balls if you like...then you throw in the tomatoes, the tomato paste...some basil; and a little red wine...that's my trick. \nSONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA. \nSONNY You take care of Paulie? \nCLEMENZA You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter. \nMICHAEL starts to leave. \nSONNY Where are you going? \nMICHAEL To the city. \nSONNY (to Clemenza; dipping bread into the sauce) Send some bodyguards. \nMICHAEL I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things. \nCLEMENZA Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian. \nSONNY OK, but be careful. \nEXT NITE: CAR \nMICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front seat. \nNURSE (frightened) We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed. \nShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room. \nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945) \nThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. MICHAEL hears them, stops. \nMICHAEL Hurry, into there. \nThey push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers. \nMICHAEL (stepping out) Who is it? \nENZO Michael...do you remember me, Enzo, the baker's helper to Nazorine, now his son-in-law. \nMICHAEL Enzo, get out of here.  There's going to be trouble. \nA look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face. \nENZO If there...will be trouble...I stay with you, to help.  I owe it to the Godfather. \nMICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get. \nMICHAEL Go outside; stand in front...I'll be out in a minute. \nINT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945) \nThey part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they put his FATHER. \nNURSE (frightened) He's awake. \nMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly. \nMICHAEL Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh, don't try to speak.  There are men who are coming to try to kill you. But I'm with you...I'm with you now... \nThe OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly puts his finger to his FATHER's lips. \nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945) \nOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO, pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night. They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not. \nMICHAEL Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. \nThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations. \nMICHAEL Listen... \nWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. They stand, hands in their pockets. \nA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them. MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates. MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they are not. \nAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief. \nIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is McCLUSKEY. \nMCCLUSKEY I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.  Who the hell are you and what are you doing here? \nANOTHER COP standing nearby: \nCOP He's clean, Captain. \nMICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely. \nMICHAEL (quietly) What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father? \nMCCLUSKEY (furious) You punk-hood.  Who the hell are you to tell me my business.  I pulled them off.  I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other. I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off.  Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital. \nMICHAEL stands quiet. \nMICHAEL I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room. \nMCCLUSKEY Phil, lock this punk up. \nA DETECTIVE The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a war hero, and he's never been mixed up in the rackets... \nMCCLUSKEY (furious) Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put the cuffs on him. \nMICHAEL (deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? \nWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945) \nHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN holding rifles. \nMICHAEL Christ, Sonny really means business. \nThey continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment. \nCLEMENZA How come all the new men? \nTESSIO We'll need them now.  After the hospital incident, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning. \nINT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY \nThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nSONNY That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nHAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS move in. \nHAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down. \nSONNY One of Tattaglia's people? \nHAGEN No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it. \nTESSIO Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us. A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private.  Good food.  Everybody minds their business.  Perfect. (he moves to the desk and makes a crude drawing) This is the entrance, Mike.  When you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. Clemenza, you gotta work fast to plant the gun.  They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall.  We can tape the gun behind there. \nCLEMENZA Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car.  You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go.  See? Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down...you come out blasting.  And don't take chances. In the head, two shots apiece.  And out as fast as your legs can move. \nSONNY I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand. \nCLEMENZA The gun will be there. \nSONNY (to MICHAEL, warmly) You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right. \nCLEMENZA We gotta move... \nMICHAEL O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back? \nSONNY Probably a year... \nHAGEN (starting to crack) Jesus, I don't know... \nSONNY Can you do it Mike? \nMICHAEL moves out. \nEXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945) \nThe enormous \"CAMELS\" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open the front door. \nDRIVER Get in, Mike. \nHe does, the car drives off. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945) \nInside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat and shakes MIKE's hand. \nSOLLOZZO I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened. \nMICHAEL I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone. \nSOLLOZZO He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him. \nMcCLUSKEY grunts. \nMCCLUSKEY He's a good kid.  He's all right. Turn around, up on your knees, facing me. \nHe gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk. \nMCCLUSKEY I'm sorry about the other night Mike.  I'm getting too old for my job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the aggravation.  You know how it is. He's clean. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945) \nMICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where they're heading. \nThe car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is concerned. \nMICHAEL We're going to New Jersey? \nSOLLOZZO (sly) Maybe. \nMICHAEL closes his eyes. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945) \nThe car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider, temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on the way back to the city. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945) \nSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and then leans to the DRIVER. \nSOLLOZZO Nice work; I'll remember it. \nMICHAEL is relieved. \nEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945) \nThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in the Bronx:  The \"LUNA AZURA\".  There is no one on the street. MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the car.  They enter the restaurant. \nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) \nA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor. SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room.  There are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet. \nMCCLUSKEY Is the Italian food good here? \nSOLLOZZO Try the veal; it's the finest in New York. \nThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table. They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY: \nSOLLOZZO I am going to talk Italian to Mike. \nMCCLUSKEY Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti. \nEXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945) \nANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning three steps of a front stoop. \nINT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) \nTESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a crossword puzzle. \nA thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter. \nSix or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets. Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays. \nA MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat. \nEXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945) \nA CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet alley. \nINT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945) \nA MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in a pool of blood on the tablecloth. \nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) \nA neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: \"Five Family War...\" \nThe table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE has fallen asleep on his arms at the table. \nSEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses. \nThe PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods appreciatively. \nMAN Nice Augie...nice. \nEXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46) \nSeveral cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb. \nInside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile. \nUp one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette. \nOne of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a door opening; they look up. \nThe man sitting on the stop stands; and looks. \nSONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes. \nHe jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car: \nDRIVER Pick up your sister? \nSONNY Yeah. \nThe car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars. \nINT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46) \nHe knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again. \nCONNIE'S VOICE Who is it? \nSONNY It's me, Sonny. \nWe hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him. \nSONNY (tenderly) Connie, what is it? \nHe turns her around in his arms. \nHer face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment. \nCONNIE (desperately) It was my fault!  I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me.  He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it. \nSonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe. \nSONNY I'm goin' to have the doctor come over and take a look at you. \nHe starts to leave. \nCONNIE Oh Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't. \nHe stops, and then laughs good naturedly. \nSONNY Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do? Make your kid a orphan before he's born. \nShe laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves. \nEXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET \nCARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. \"Book\" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball. \nCARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we recognize that it is SONNY. \nHis face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has CARLO by the throat. \nHe pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand. \nSALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned. \nSONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood. \nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) \nThe Corleone Mall. \nEqually impressive security stands ready at the Corleone Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE DETECTIVES. \nIt all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE. All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday clothes, wait. \nEXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946) \nOne ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway, preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a team of BUTTON MEN. \nSitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with a rifle on his lap. \nINT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946) \nInside the Main CORLEONE House: \nHospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN. \nAll the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA, THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN. \nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) \nThe DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but been converted into a hospital room, with complete and extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO should leave. \nThey do, the door is closed. \nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946) \nThe mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the Sunday dinner, and set the table. \nCARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face. \nCONNIE What's the matter, Carlo? \nCARLO Shut up. \nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946) \nAll the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is the spokesman for the family. \nHAGEN ...since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on most of our operations...on the other families too.  There's been a lot of bad blood. \nThe OLD MAN glances at SONNY. \nSONNY Pop, they hit us and we hit them back. \nHAGEN We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up. \nThe OLD MAN nods. \nSONNY Freddie's gonna go to Las Vegas...under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.  I want him to rest... \nFREDO I'm goin' to learn the casino business. \nThe DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for. \nHAGEN Michael... (he takes a breath) It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. \nThe DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and rage. \nHAGEN He's safe now...we're already working on ways to bring him back. \nThe DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone. \nINT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946) \nHAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is expansive and optimistic. \nSONNY We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you? \nHAGEN You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. \nSONNY No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me. \nHAGEN Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation. \nSONNY Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have? (TOM starts to leave) Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore. \nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946) \nThe FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table. \nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) \nSOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally by the gate. \nONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling. \n-----------------------------------------FADE OUT------- \nINT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946) \nCONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone. We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom. \nCONNIE Who is this? \nGIRL (O.S.) (giggle) I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just wanted to tell him I can't see him tonight; I have to go out of town. \nCONNIE's face turns red. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \nFADE IN: \nINT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT \nThe serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone. \nHAGEN (O.S.) This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request. \nBONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes. BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry. \nBONASERA Yes, I understand.  I'm listening. \nHAGEN (O.S.) You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him. \nSilence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright. \nBONASERA Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes. \nHAGEN (O.S.) Good.  He never doubted you. \nBONASERA The Don himself is coming to me tonight? \nHAGEN (O.S.) Yes. (click) \nBONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room. \nSilently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes from him.  He lights a cigarette. \nBONASERA For the last year, they have been killing one another.  So now, what? Your Godfather comes to me...Why? (whispering, slyly) They've killed someone so important that they wish to make his body disappear. \nMRS. BONASERA (frightened) Amerigo! \nBONASERA They could make me an accomplice to their murder.  They could send me to jail! \nHe slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years. \nBONASERA And if the other families find out...they will make me their enemy. They could come here to our house. I curse the day I ever went to the Godfather. \nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946) \nWith his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters. \nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946) \nBONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room, past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into the alley. \nHe sits on a bench, and waits. \nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946) \nThe tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley; we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral parlor. \nCLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door. BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet protruding. \nBONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way the MEN should carry their sinister burden. \nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946) \nThey carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming room. \nThen BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE. \nHe walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER. Then, after a long gaze: \nDON CORLEONE Well my friend, are you ready to do me this service? \nBONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone. \nBONASERA What do you wish me to do? \nDON CORLEONE (staring at the table) I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is. \nHe draws down the gray blanket. \nBONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees: \nThe bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE. \nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946) \nSONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth. \nA car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the car blocking him. \nThe windows of his car are shot out. \nBullet holes puncture the doors of his car. \nHis hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car. \nHis arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that he will survive it. \nSuddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER fire. \nHis face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground. \nA FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and make off in the distance. \nSONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they are too late. \nHAGEN When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean? \nDON CORLEONE Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told. \nHAGEN You mean Tattaglia. \nDON CORLEONE (shaking his head) Barzini. \nHAGEN (a revelation) He was the one behind Sollozzo? \nDON CORLEONE Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along. \nThe black limousine speeds away from us in the night. \n------------------------------------------FADE OUT------ \nFADE IN: \nEXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT \nA CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left grotesque and misshapen. \nGRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets. \nTHE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry knapsacks. \nThe THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, overlooking an impressive view of land and sea. \nEXT DAY: SICILY ROAD \nThe THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods respectfully. \nMICHAEL Don Tommassino. \nDON TOMMASSINO Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa. \nMICHAEL Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen. \nDON TOMMASSINO You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo. \nMICHAEL I know. \nDON TOMMASSINO Where are you going? \nMICHAEL Corleone. \nDON TOMMASSINO There is nothing there.  Not anymore. \nMICHAEL I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old. \nDON TOMMASSINO Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America. \nMICHAEL Don Tommassino...I should see this place. \nDON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes. \nDON TOMMASSINO That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car. \nMICHAEL No...I would like to walk to Corleone. \nThe OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car. \nDON TOMMASSINO Be careful Michael, don't let them know your name. \nThe old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues on his journey. \nEXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE \nThe THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit trees, in bloom and bursting with life. \nEXT DAY: VILLAGE \nThey continue in the empty streets of a little town; the post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns. \nThe THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main road \"VOTA COMMUNISTA\". \nEXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD \nThey continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them. \nEXT DAY: FIELD \nOut in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong, marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men carrying billowing red banners. \nEXT DAY: GROVE \nThey are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees is a deep, tall field of wild flowers. \nThe Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese. \nMICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief. \nFABRIZZIO You tell us about America. \nMICHAEL How do you know I come from America? \nFABRIZZIO We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot. \nMICHAEL Only the son of a Pezzonovanta. \nFABRIZZIO Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say? \nVITELLI (laughing with them...pouring more wine) I know about what you mean! \nFABRIZZIO This was a beauty.  Right, Calo? \nVITELLI (laughing) Beautiful all over, eh? \nFABRIZZIO And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth. \nVITELLI does not laugh quite so much. \nVITELLI Yes, we have beautiful girls here... but virtuous. \nVITELLI is no longer drinking with them. \nMICHAEL She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair.  She looks more Greek than Italian.  Do you know a beauty like that? \nAs MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl. \nVITELLI No. \nThen he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room. \nFABRIZZIO God in Heaven, I think I understand... \nHe goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he returns. \nFABRIZZIO Let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief. It's his daughter. \nThey start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move. \nCALO Come quickly. \nMICHAEL Innkeeper.  More wine! \nFABRIZZIO (whispered) The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up. \nMICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority. \nMICHAEL Tell him to come to me. \nThe two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them. \nMICHAEL (quietly) I understand I've offended you by talking about your daughter.  I offer you my apologies, I'm a stranger in this country, I don't know the customs very well.  Let me say this, I meant no disrespect to you or her... \nCALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed. \nVITELLI (shrugs) Who are you and what do you want from my daughter? \nMICHAEL I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country.  My name is Michael.  You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter.  With your permission and under the supervision of your family.  With all decorum.  With all respect.  I am an honorable man. \nCALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then asks: \nVITELLI Are you a friend of the friends? \nMICHAEL When the proper time comes, I'll tell you everything that a wife's father should know. \nFABRIZZIO It's the real Thunderbolt, then. \nVITELLI (formally) Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village. \nMICHAEL Your daughter's name? \nVITELLI Appolonia. \n-------------------------------------FADE OUT----------- \nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD \nMUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders. \nDON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road. \nThe Sunday churchbells ring. \n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- \nEXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE \nMICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS. Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace. \nShe looks at him. \nAPPOLONIA Grazia. \n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- \nEXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE \nNow the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's cafe. \nMICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS, though they are all dressed differently. \nThey go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is talking and talking. \nMICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet. She wears the gold necklace around her neck. \n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE---------- \nEXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME \nMICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart. \nMICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he sees MICHAEL. \nCALO Should I get your bag? \nMICHAEL No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia? \nCALO (smiling) She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas.  She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America. \nMICHAEL smiles. \nMICHAEL Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car. \nHe leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee. \nHe looks out from the opening in the doorway. \nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD \nThere is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child. \nCALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat. \nThen MICHAEL seems disturbed. \nOver, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO disappear through the gate. \nMICHAEL (muttering to himself) Where the hell is he going? \nMICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside. \nMICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. \nAPPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is. \nAPPOLONIA (calling out) I'll drive to you. \nHe smiles affectionately. \nCALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds out his hand. \nMICHAEL No.  No! \nHis shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, as she switched on the ignition. \nPart of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia. \nMICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious. \nINT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM \nMICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead. \nMICHAEL Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know that the one who gives me Fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in Sicily. \n--------------------------------------FADE OUT---------- \nFADE IN: \nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951) \nEaster. \nA HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs. \nThe DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants. \nSuddenly, he stops and looks. \nMICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase. \nGreat emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in MICHAEL's direction. \nMICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him. \nDON CORLEONE Be my son... \nINT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY \nDON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the building. \nDON CORLEONE This old building has seen its day. No way to do business...too small, too old. \nThey enter the DON's glass-panelled office. \nDON CORLEONE Have you thought about a wife?  A family? \nMICHAEL (pained) No. \nDON CORLEONE I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know. \nMICHAEL I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when. \nDON CORLEONE Accept what's happened, Michael. \nMICHAEL I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me. \nDON CORLEONE No, I wanted other things for you. \nMICHAEL You wanted me to be your son. \nDON CORLEONE Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America. \nMICHAEL I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. \nMICHAEL turns to JOHNNY. \nMICHAEL Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started.  We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers.  We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same.  We count on you to convince them. \nJOHNNY Sure, I'll do anything for my Godfather.  You know that, Mike. \nThere is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL, who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast style. \nMOE Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want? \nMICHAEL Thanks. \nMOE The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good! (to his BODYGUARDS) Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house. \nMICHAEL Is my credit good enough to buy you out? \nMOE laughs. \nMOE Buy me out?... \nMICHAEL The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out. \nGREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS. \nMOE (furious) The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out. \nMICHAEL Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better. \nMOE You think I scam? \nMICHAEL (the worst insult) You're unlucky. \nMOE You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out. \nMICHAEL You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price. \nMOE The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel! \nMICHAEL (quietly, deadly) Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public? \nFREDO (his face turns red) Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe didn't mean anything.  He flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends.  Right, Moe? \nMOE Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick asses to make this place run right. Freddie and I had a little argument and I had to straighten him out. \nMICHAEL You straightened my brother out? \nMOE Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink. \nMICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal: \nMICHAEL I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price. \nMOE You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders. \nFREDO (frightened) Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him. \nMICHAEL The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. \nNobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door. MOE exits angrily. \nMICHAEL Freddie, you're my older brother. I love you.  But don't ever take sides with anybody against the Family again. \nEXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955) \nKAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it. \nShe has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who plays with a cardboard bird on a string. \nTwo other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards. \nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO PORTERS carrying luggage. \nNERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder. \nMICHAEL turns, and sees KAY. \nLAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically, the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver; and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the other cars. \nAnd the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other sedans. \nINT DAY: LIMO (1955) \nThe little BOY looks out the window as they drive. \nMICHAEL I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall. \nKAY Oh Michael. \nMICHAEL We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets. \nKAY Don't you want dinner first? \nMICHAEL No, you eat...don't wait up for me. \nKAY Wake me up when you come to bed? \nThe little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window. \nEXT DAY: MALL (1955) \nFADE IN: \nINT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955) \nALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently. Then the badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress. \nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955) \nMICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is beginning to take on a matronly look. \nINT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955) \nIn a Long Island motel. \nROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it, checks it, and puts it back together. \nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955) \nPETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates, takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then gets in, drives off. \nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955) \nThe Church. \nVarious relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating. Not all of the participants have arrived yet. \nCONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the infant; showing him off to interested people. \nEXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955) \nNERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight. \nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955) \nLAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising \"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY\". \nINT DAY: CHURCH \nThe Church. \nCONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn. \nPRIEST (to MICHAEL) Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world? \nMICHAEL Yes, I promise. \nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVE. \nNERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his nightstick. \nThe DRIVER looks up in surprise. \nNERI points to the \"No Parking\" sign. \nThe DRIVER turns his head away. \nNERI OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or you wanna move? \nDRIVER (obviously a hood) You better check with your precinct. \nNERI Move it! \nThe DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's jacket. \nNERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then he crooks a finger at the DRIVER. \nNERI Let me see you license and registration. \nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY \nLAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up. It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he returns into the room. \nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955) \nCLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward. \nINT DAY: CHURCH \nThe Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils. \nPRIEST Ephetha...be opened...So you may perceive the fragrance of God's sweetness. \nEXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955) \nThe DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center is arguing with NERI. \nNow the DRIVER looks up. \nWHAT HE SEES: \nTWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving glass doors. \nNERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of BARZINI within them. \nINT DAY: CHURCH \nIn the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him the infant. \nPRIEST Do you renounce Satan. \nMICHAEL I do renounce him. \n", "test1_input": "EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945) \nThe DON's eyes peering through the blinds. \nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) \nKAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding, burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and the vitality. \nKAY I've never seen anything like it. \nMICHAEL I told you I had a lot of relatives. \nKAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop. We see what she sees: \nHer interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine barrels. \nKAY (amused) Michael, what are those men doing? \nMICHAEL They're waiting to see my father. \nKAY They're talking to themselves. \nMICHAEL They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right. \nKAY Why do they bother him on a day like this? \nMICHAEL Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. \nEXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945) \nCONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples. She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest. CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold. \nDiscreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin. \nCARLO (whispered) Cut it out, Connie. \nThe purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money. \nPAULIE (O.S.) What do you think?  Twenty grand? \nA little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse. \nPAULIE Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding! \nSONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN. \nHe bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear. \nSANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh. \nWOMAN Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra? \nSANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter. Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais. SONNY and LUCY are gone. \nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945) \nThe empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY surreptitiously steps out. \nShe looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing, motioning for her to come up. \nShe lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs. \nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) \nKAY and MICHAEL. \nKAY (in a spooky low tone) Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a relative? \nShe has picked out LUCA BRASI. \nMICHAEL No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him. \nKAY (Excited) Who is he? \nMICHAEL (Sizing her up) You really want to know? \nKAY Yes.  Tell me. \nMICHAEL You like spaghetti? \nKAY You know I love spaghetti. \nMICHAEL Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. \nShe starts to eat her spaghetti. \nShe begins eating, looking at him eagerly. \nMICHAEL Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did. \nKAY Al Capone! \nMICHAEL My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off... \nKAY Michael... \nMICHAEL Then the legs at the knees... \nKAY Michael you're trying to scare me... \nMICHAEL Then the thighs where they joined the torso. \n", "test1_true": "MICHAEL Then Luca turned to the other man... \nKAY Michael, I love you. \nMICHAEL ...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated. \nThe smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story. \nKAY I never know when you're telling me the truth. \nMICHAEL I told you you wouldn't like him. \nKAY He's coming over here! \nLUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near their table. \nMICHAEL Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams. \nKAY (having survived LUCA) How do you do. \nMICHAEL My brother, Tom Hagen. \nHAGEN Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business. (privately) He's been asking for you. \nMICHAEL Thanks Tom. \nHAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously following. \nKAY If he's your brother, why does he have a different name? \nMICHAEL My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) \nDON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the YOUNG COUPLE. \nLUCA (O.S.) Don Corleone... \nTHE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech. \nLUCA (with difficulty) Don Corleone...I am honored, and grateful...that you invited me to your home...on the wedding day of your...daughter. May their first child...be a masculine child.  I pledge my never ending loyalty. (he offers the envelope) For your daughter's bridal purse. \nDON CORLEONE Thank you, Luca, my most valued friend. \nTHE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful. \nLUCA Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I know you are busy. \nHe turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN. \nDON CORLEONE I'm sure it's the most generous gift today. \nHAGEN The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo. \nDON CORLEONE is not pleased. \nHAGEN The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin.  Also he has access to this country.  He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law.  For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action.  They call Sollozzo the Turk. He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids.  He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger.  Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint.  Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man. \nTHE DON nods. \nHAGEN He's his own boss, and very competent. \nDON CORLEONE And with prison record. \nHAGEN Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify. \nDON CORLEONE When did he call? \nHAGEN This morning. \nDON CORLEONE On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait. \nWe now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style. \nDON CORLEONE What that?  It sounds like Johnny. \nHe moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light. \nDON CORLEONE It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding. \nHAGEN Should I bring him in. \nDON CORLEONE No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson. \nHAGEN It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again. \nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) \nJOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and excitement of the wedding GUESTS. \nKAY I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane. \nMICHAEL Sure. \nKAY I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off. \nMICHAEL He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career. \nJOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight. They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears. \n", "test1_id": 672, "test2_input": "HAGEN I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime? \nDON CORLEONE I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye. \nMICHAEL How did you find out? \nHAGEN Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth. (pause) Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly. \nMICHAEL Not so perfectly if you noticed. \nHAGEN Mike, why am I out? \nMICHAEL You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying. \nHAGEN OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones... \nDON CORLEONE Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen. \nHAGEN Maybe I can help. \nMICHAEL (coldly) You're out, Tom. \nTOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM leaves. \nMICHAEL looks at NERI. \nMICHAEL I'm going to talk to my father. \nNERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside. \nEXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955) \nDON CORLEONE I see you have your Luca Brasi. \nMICHAEL I'll need him. \nDON CORLEONE There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out \"Kill me, kill me.\"  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man. \nThey walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over. \nDON CORLEONE Barzini will move against you first. \nMICHAEL How? \nDON CORLEONE He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety... \nHe rises, and looks at Michael... \nDON CORLEONE ...and at that meeting you will be assassinated. \nThe DON walks on further. \nDON CORLEONE Your wife and children...you're happy with them? \nMICHAEL Yes. \nDON CORLEONE Good. \nMICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then: \nMICHAEL I've always respected you... \nA long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL. \nDON CORLEONE And I...you. \nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955) \nKAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left them off. \nKAY How is your husband feeling? \nMAMA He's not the same since they shot him.  He lets Michael do all the work.  He just plays the fool with his garden, his peppers, his tomatoes, as if he was some peasant still.  But men are like that... \nShe stops toward the Church. \nMAMA You come in, too. \nKAY shakes her head. \nMAMA The Priest ain't gonna bite you cause you're not Catholic. (whispered) He's in the back drinkin' his wine. \nKAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church. They enter. \nINT DAY: CHURCH (1955) \nInside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from the holy water. \nMAMA You can. \nTentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar. \nMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some. \nMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles. \nShe finishes, and bows her head. \nEXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME \nVery few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks. An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous. Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King. \n", "test2_true": "EXT DAY: MALL (1955) \nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL \nSilence. \nThe flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence. \nHundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful. \nMICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of Don Corleone. \nBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on. \nThe VIEW ALTERS, \nand we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn. \nChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last look at the great man. \nCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to pay their respects. \nFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin. \nThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time. \nMICHAEL watches the scene. \nBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men. \nAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don Corleone. \nMICHAEL watches silently. \nBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO. \nCONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He embraces and comforts her. \nEverywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching all who come close to him. \nEXT DAY: MALL (LATER) \nLater on the Mall; some people have left, although there are still hundreds of mourners. \nA young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18. \nGIRL Do you remember me? \nTESSIO No... \nGIRL We danced together at Connie's wedding. \nTESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown', and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He finds him. \nTESSIO Mike, could I have a minute? \nMIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close by. \nTESSIO Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out. \nMICHAEL He talked to you? \nTESSIO (nods) I can arrange security. \nMICHAEL looks at him. \nEXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955) \nThe Cemetery.  Late day. \nThe hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in Queens Village. \nHundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take pictures, etc. \nMICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN. \nMICHAEL (softly) Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him. \nHAGEN Did he give you his politicians? \nMICHAEL Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. (he looks at TOM) I guess you've figured it all out? \nHAGEN How will they come at you? \nMICHAEL I know now. (a passion wells up inside of MICHAEL) I'll make them call me Don. \nHAGEN Have you agreed on a meeting? \nMICHAEL (nods) A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe. \nHAGEN looks at him; understands. \nMICHAEL But after the Baptism.  I've decided to stand as godfather to Connie's baby. \nThey look up. \nThe coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel, with the bold inscription: CORLEONE. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \n", "test2_id": 673, "test3_input": "He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it. \nTESSIO (after the pause) Tell Mike it was business...I always liked him. \nHAGEN He understands that. \nTESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses. \nTESSIO (softly) Tom, can you get me off the hook? For old times' sake? \nHAGEN I can't. \nHAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back. \nTESSIO is led into a waiting car. \nHAGEN looks away, and walks off. \nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955) \nCARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out. \nWHAT HE SEES: \nEXT DAY: MALL (1955) \nMICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI, LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN. \nThey move toward us. \nExcitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it. \nHe wears a broad smile. \nCARLO Godfather! \nMICHAEL You have to answer for Santino. \nThe smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room. \nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955) \nThe door opens, and the grim party enters. \nMICHAEL You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone? \nCARLO (dignity) I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me! \nMICHAEL (quietly) Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. \nCARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified. \nMICHAEL (almost kindly) Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini? \nCARLO (sees his way out) Barzini. \nMICHAEL (softly) Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport. \nCARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting; with a group of MEN around it. \nHe looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him. \nMICHAEL I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on. \nEXT DAY: MALL \nCARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his things in the trunk. \nONE opens the front door for him. \nSOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who. \nCARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man. \nIt is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially. \nThe motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet. \nThe garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color. \nHis thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield. \nThen the body goes slack. \nCLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off. \nEXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955) \nMICHAEL and his party.  They watch. \nThen he turns and walks off, and they follow. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \nFADE IN: \nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955) \nMICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving. \nThey do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights flash by. \n", "test3_true": "NERI You know I would never question anything you say. \nMICHAEL (smiles) Speak your mind. \nNERI I'll do this for you; you know I should. \nMICHAEL No.  This I have to do. \nEXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955) \nMICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door. \nMICHAEL Sit in the car. \nINT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955) \nHe walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza dough in the air. \nMICHAEL Where's the boss? \nMAN In the back.  Hey Frank, someone wants you. \nA MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent. \nMAN What is it? \nHe stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits. \nEXT DAY: MALL (1955) \nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL \nSeveral moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs indicating that the property is for sale are evident. \nA black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out, restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs across the Mall into Michael's house. \nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955) \nInside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed; furniture prepared for shipping. \nCONNIE Michael! \nShe hurries into the living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL and KAY. \nKAY (comforting) Connie... \nBut CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI is watchful. \nCONNIE You lousy bastard; you killed my husband... \nKAY Connie... \nCONNIE You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him!  You blamed him about Sonny, you always did, everybody did.  But you never thought about me, never gave a damn about me. (crying) What am I going to do now, what am I going to do. \nTWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to finish. \nKAY Connie, how could you say such things? \nCONNIE Why do you think he kept Carlo on the Mall?  All the time he knew he was going to kill my husband.  But he didn't dare while my father was alive.  And then he stood Godfather to our child.  That coldhearted bastard. (to KAY) And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo?  Just read the papers.  That's your husband. \nShe tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria she has no saliva. \nMICHAEL Get her home and get a doctor. \nThe TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly. \nKAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL.  He feels her look. \nMICHAEL She's hysterical. \nBut KAY won't let him avoid her eyes. \nKAY Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me. \nMICHAEL Don't ask me. \nKAY Tell me! \nMICHAEL All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time. \nKAY Is it true? \nShe looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth. \nMICHAEL (after a very long pause) No. \nKAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him.  Then she kisses him. \nKAY (through her tears) We both need a drink. \nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955) \nShe moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the house with their BODYGUARDS. \nShe watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him. \nCLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it. \n", "test3_id": 674}

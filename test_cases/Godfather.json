{"test1_input": "DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace. He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply. \nDON CORLEONE Remember my new Consigliere, a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns. \nEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945) \nJACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate, armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate, and TOM enters. \nEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945) \nHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens, martinis in hand. \nWOLTZ You should have told me your boss was Corleone, Tom, I had to check you out.  I thought you were just some third rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. (a piece of statuary) Florence, thirteenth century. Decorated the garden of a king. \nThey cross the garden and head toward the stables. \nWOLTZ I'm going to show you something beautiful. \nThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\" TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they rise as WOLTZ approaches. \nWOLTZ You like horses?  I like horses, I love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive Racehorses. \nThe animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him with true love in his voice. \nWOLTZ Khartoum...Kartoum...You are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even Russian Czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse.  But I'm not going to race him I'm going to put him out to Stud. \nINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945) \nHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table, attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous. \nHAGEN Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship. \nWOLTZ Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else. \nHAGEN He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood? \nWOLTZ You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork! \nHAGEN I'm German-Irish. \nWOLTZ Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS! \nEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945) \nAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott Street with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS, INC.\" next to an open-faced fruit market. \nA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO. \nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) \nLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced. They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE. \nSOLLOZZO My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous. \nDON CORLEONE Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity? \nSOLLOZZO I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend. \nDON CORLEONE What percentages for my family? \nSOLLOZZO Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up. \nDON CORLEONE And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? \nSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN. \nSOLLOZZO My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share. \nDON CORLEONE So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me? \nSOLLOZZO If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone. \nThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer. \nDON CORLEONE I said I would see you because I've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect... (pause) But I'll say no to you. \nWe feel this around the room. \nDON CORLEONE I'll give you my reasons.  I have many, many friends in Politics. But they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling.  They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business. \nSOLLOZZO takes a breath. \nDON CORLEONE No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed. \nSOLLOZZO Are you worried about security for your million? \nDON CORLEONE No. \nSOLLOZZO The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. \nThis startles SONNY; he blurts out. \nSONNY The Tattaglia family guarantees our investment? \nSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line. \nDON CORLEONE Young people are greedy, and they have no manners.  They speak when they should listen.  But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. \nSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard: \nThe DON turns to SONNY. \n", "test1_true": "TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers. \nDON CORLEONE What is this nonsense? \nHAGEN It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film. \nINT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945) \nIt is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something wet. \nHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet. He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood. \nWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out. Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him. \nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) \nCLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding. \nDON CORLEONE Send Johnny my congratulations. \n----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------- \n(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED) \nFADE IN: \nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945) \nFifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents. \nKAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store, carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm. \nKAY We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen... \nMICHAEL And what do you want for Christmas? \nKAY Just you. \nThey kiss. \nINT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945) \nCLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony at the City Hall, no big fuss, no family, just a couple of friends as witnesses. \nThe two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on the two single beds that they have pushed together. \nKAY What will your father say? \nMICHAEL As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object. \nKAY What time do they expect us? \nMICHAEL For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire. \nKAY Michael. \nMICHAEL Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night. \nHe moves to the telephone. \nMICHAEL (CONT'D.) Operator.  Get me (fill in number) \nKAY Michael, what are you doing? \nMICHAEL Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here. \nKAY Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please. \nShe hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception. \nMICHAEL Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah... listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow morning.  There's something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas.  Will he be home tomorrow night? \nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nHAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background, through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork. \nHAGEN (O.S.) Sure.  Anything I can do for you. \nMICHAEL (O.S.) No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right? \nHAGEN Right. \nHe smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out. \nHe peeks into the DON's office. \nHAGEN Michael called; he's not leaving New Hampshire until tomorrow morning.  I've got to go, I promised Theresa I'd pick up some toys for the kids. \nThe DON smiles and nods. \nTOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE. FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper. \nDON CORLEONE Tell Paulie to get the car from the lot; I'll be ready to go home in a few minutes. \nFREDO I'll have to get it myself; Paulie called in sick this morning. \nDON CORLEONE That's the third time this month. I think maybe you'd better get a healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell Tom. \n", "test1_id": 672, "test2_input": "NURSE (frightened) We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed. \nShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room. \nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945) \nThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. MICHAEL hears them, stops. \nMICHAEL Hurry, into there. \nThey push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers. \nMICHAEL (stepping out) Who is it? \nENZO Michael...do you remember me, Enzo, the baker's helper to Nazorine, now his son-in-law. \nMICHAEL Enzo, get out of here.  There's going to be trouble. \nA look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face. \nENZO If there...will be trouble...I stay with you, to help.  I owe it to the Godfather. \nMICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get. \nMICHAEL Go outside; stand in front...I'll be out in a minute. \nINT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945) \nThey part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they put his FATHER. \nNURSE (frightened) He's awake. \nMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly. \nMICHAEL Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh, don't try to speak.  There are men who are coming to try to kill you. But I'm with you...I'm with you now... \nThe OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly puts his finger to his FATHER's lips. \nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945) \nOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO, pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night. They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not. \nMICHAEL Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. \nThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations. \nMICHAEL Listen... \nWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. They stand, hands in their pockets. \nA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them. MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates. MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they are not. \nAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief. \nIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is McCLUSKEY. \nMCCLUSKEY I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up.  Who the hell are you and what are you doing here? \nANOTHER COP standing nearby: \nCOP He's clean, Captain. \nMICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely. \nMICHAEL (quietly) What happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father? \nMCCLUSKEY (furious) You punk-hood.  Who the hell are you to tell me my business.  I pulled them off.  I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other. I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off.  Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital. \nMICHAEL stands quiet. \nMICHAEL I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room. \nMCCLUSKEY Phil, lock this punk up. \nA DETECTIVE The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a war hero, and he's never been mixed up in the rackets... \nMCCLUSKEY (furious) Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put the cuffs on him. \nMICHAEL (deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed) How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? \nWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945) \nHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN holding rifles. \nMICHAEL Christ, Sonny really means business. \nThey continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment. \nCLEMENZA How come all the new men? \nTESSIO We'll need them now.  After the hospital incident, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock this morning. \nINT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY \nThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \n", "test2_true": "SONNY I've got a hundred button men on the streets twenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one hair on his ass he's dead. \nHe sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand, kiddingly. \nSONNY Mikey, you look beautiful! \nMICHAEL Cut it out. \nSONNY The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet. \nHAGEN Was there a definite proposal? \nSONNY Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse. \nHAGEN What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno? \nSONNY Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father. \nHAGEN We should hear what they have to say. \nSONNY No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street. \nHAGEN The other families won't sit still for all out war. \nSONNY Then THEY hand me Sollozzo. \nHAGEN Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business. \nSONNY And when they shot me father... \nHAGEN Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal... \nSONNY No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood? \nHAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned. \nHAGEN I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration. \nSONNY (still fuming) McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait. \nMICHAEL We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now. \nSONNY The kid's right. \nHAGEN What about McCluskey? \nMICHAEL Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later. \nSONNY Go on Mike. \nMICHAEL They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me. (pause) Then I'll kill them both. \nEveryone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL. Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak. \nSONNY You?  You, the high-class college kid.  You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business.  Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face.  You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal. \nNow CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps his face serious. \nMICHAEL (angrily, but cold) Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather.  He took my joining the Marines personal.  I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. \nMICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing. \nINT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945) \nCLOSE on a revolver. \nCLEMENZA (O.S.) It's as cold as they come, impossible to trace. (he turns it upside down) Don't worry about prints Mike, I put a special tape on the trigger and butt.  Here. (he hands the gun to another pair of hands) Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight. (it fires: very LOUD) I left it noisy, so it'll scare any pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander away. \nMICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop. \nCLEMENZA Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip out. Everybody will still think you got it.  They'll be starin' at your face, see?  Then walk out of the place real fast, but don't run. Don't look anybody directly in the eye, but don't look away from them neither.  Hey, they'll be scared stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's gonna bother with you.  Don't worry about nothing; you'd be surprised how good these things go.  O.K., put your hat on, let's see how you look.  Helps with identification. \nThey put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it. \nCLEMENZA Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell. \nMICHAEL How bad will it be? \nCLEMENZA Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble... \nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) \nMICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the Corleone buttonmen. \nHe continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of whisky.  The radio is playing. \nMICHAEL Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up. \nSONNY What are you, inspecting the barracks? (SONNY sits up with his head in his hands) You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away? \nMICHAEL A million times. \nSONNY Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign. \nHAGEN We don't let Mike go until we have the hostage, Sonny. \nCLEMENZA It's okay...the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men. \nThe phone rings in the DON's office. \n", "test2_id": 673, "test3_input": "SONNY That could be a Tattaglia informer with the meeting place. \nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nHAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS move in. \nHAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down. \nSONNY One of Tattaglia's people? \nHAGEN No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it. \nTESSIO Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us. A small family place with big booths where people can talk in private.  Good food.  Everybody minds their business.  Perfect. (he moves to the desk and makes a crude drawing) This is the entrance, Mike.  When you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. Clemenza, you gotta work fast to plant the gun.  They got an old- fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall.  We can tape the gun behind there. \nCLEMENZA Mike, they're gonna frisk you in the car.  You'll be clean so they won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the restaurant, wait and talk a while, and then ask permission to go.  See? Then when you come out, don't waste time; don't sit down...you come out blasting.  And don't take chances. In the head, two shots apiece.  And out as fast as your legs can move. \nSONNY I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand. \nCLEMENZA The gun will be there. \nSONNY (to MICHAEL, warmly) You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right. \nCLEMENZA We gotta move... \nMICHAEL O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back? \nSONNY Probably a year... \nHAGEN (starting to crack) Jesus, I don't know... \nSONNY Can you do it Mike? \nMICHAEL moves out. \nEXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945) \nThe enormous \"CAMELS\" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open the front door. \nDRIVER Get in, Mike. \nHe does, the car drives off. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945) \nInside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat and shakes MIKE's hand. \nSOLLOZZO I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened. \nMICHAEL I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone. \nSOLLOZZO He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him. \nMcCLUSKEY grunts. \nMCCLUSKEY He's a good kid.  He's all right. Turn around, up on your knees, facing me. \nHe gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk. \nMCCLUSKEY I'm sorry about the other night Mike.  I'm getting too old for my job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the aggravation.  You know how it is. He's clean. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945) \nMICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where they're heading. \nThe car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is concerned. \nMICHAEL We're going to New Jersey? \nSOLLOZZO (sly) Maybe. \nMICHAEL closes his eyes. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945) \nThe car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider, temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on the way back to the city. \nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945) \nSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and then leans to the DRIVER. \nSOLLOZZO Nice work; I'll remember it. \nMICHAEL is relieved. \nEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945) \nThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in the Bronx:  The \"LUNA AZURA\".  There is no one on the street. MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the car.  They enter the restaurant. \nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) \nA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor. SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room.  There are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet. \nMCCLUSKEY Is the Italian food good here? \nSOLLOZZO Try the veal; it's the finest in New York. \nThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table. They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY: \nSOLLOZZO I am going to talk Italian to Mike. \nMCCLUSKEY Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti. \n", "test3_true": "MICHAEL (using English for emphasis) Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life. \nSOLLOZZO What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce... \nMICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up my sleeve\".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face. \nSOLLOZZO What is it? \nMICHAEL Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? \nSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon. \nMCCLUSKEY I frisked him; I've frisked thousands of young punks; he's clean. \nHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods, indicating no one is there. \nSOLLOZZO Don't take too long. \nMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside. \nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945) \nMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet. Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun...he gropes searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun. \nCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out. \nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) \nHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table. McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues back to the table.  He sits down. \nMICHAEL Now I can talk.  I feel much better. \nThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him. \nThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area. \nThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood. \nSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended. \nMICHAEL pivots, and looks: \nThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth. \nMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull. \nThe air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall. He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed. Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty. The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face. MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table. McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table. MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN. He moves, not letting the gun go. \nMICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression. \nHis hand: still holding the gun. \nHis face: finally he closes his eyes. \nHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud. \nHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back. \nHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax. \nThen he leaves. \n---------------------------------------FADE OUT--------- \nFADE IN: \nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945) \nA MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge. ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly. \nA little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table, quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there is an occasional laugh. \nROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out. \nA large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily. \nThe sentimental tune is continued over the following: \nINT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945) \nA MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie still together in a bullet-riddled automobile. \nINT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945) \nA MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop. \nINT DAY: MATTRESS \nTen mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including CLEMENZA, are taking naps. \nAn arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table. \nThe MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and pouring the wine. \nTrash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment. \nINT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945) \nA MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S. Truman. \n", "test3_id": 674}

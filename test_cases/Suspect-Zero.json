{"test1_input": "DYLAN (impressed) Well now... (Charlton shrugs) So what the hell's he doin' here? \nThat one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk. Mackelway and the others look inside... \nThere, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt- shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet. \nMackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body. \nHe leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the steering wheel. Gently. \n...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton leans in, gets a look. \nCHARLTON Christ... \nMackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed into a series of dark, disjointed images: \n12   EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                        12 \nSeems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped. \nA MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to the ground. Then we look up. \nMackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are: \n13   INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY                 13 \nWe start on the EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve to a pad of paper, on a DESK. Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE. He holds the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if expecting to get some kind of pulse from it. \nHere come those IMAGES again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash, Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then they cease... \n...and O'Ryan begins to DRAW, hurriedly. Only half of his face is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is total. \nHis pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain, the wind. They're all alive in O'Ryan's mind... \nAnd that DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the gun, Mackelway. \nThen, the pen is set down. The drawing is complete. \nO'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the exact time and date on to the drawing. Then he slips it into a folder marked, \"MACKELWAY.\" \nCUT TO: \n14   EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB. DAY                   14 \nPicket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing. A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, each bringing food... and tissues to cry into. \n15   INT. SPECK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)             15 \nShocked faces. Food on unmatching trays. Speck's wife - JAN, 40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile. FRIENDS and FAMILY mill about, tending to her. \nKIDS hover. Two of them, a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY and an 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL, sniff back tears as people offer condolences. \nBut the focus here is Jan - her grief. She's shaking... \nO'RYAN (O.S.) Mrs. Speck? \nShe looks up. O'Ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty faces in here. Jan half-nods. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Just wanted to offer my condolences. (takes her hand) I didn't know him well but... I think Harold was a much more complex man than people realized. \nJan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now. \nJAN (through tears) He was, wasn't he? \nO'RYAN I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am. \nShe sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. O'Ryan extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off. \nBeside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck. We blow past it, and into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the portrait's FRAME, and: \nBAM! We're rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again: \n16   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                                  16 \nThis time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to be saying: \n(O.S.) Please... \nThe sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite somewhere, or a distance of time and space. \nThen the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway... \nCUT TO: \n17   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 10:30 P.M. 17 \nMackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon, parked between two big-rigs in the lot of the \"All-American Diner.\" Sky looks black tonight. It rumbles... \nAnd that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw... It was all his. \nHe pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket. Slugs them down. This headache is a constant. Then he gets out of the Yukon... \n18   INT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER GAINESVILLE - CONTINUING                   18 \nMackelway enters, spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite a WOMAN, her back to us. \n19   INT. BOOTH - CONTINUING                                         19 \nMackelway approaches. The Woman doesn't turn. \nCHARLTON Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce you, but I understand that won't be necessary. \n", "test1_true": "Mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react. It takes some effort. \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) Seems your former office has decided we might need some help on this one. So they sent out Agent Kulok. \nFRAN Tom. \nMACKELWAY Fran. \nThat was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note. \nCHARLTON I guess we're skipping the tearful reunion. Have a seat, Tom. \nMackelway sits opposite Fran. She folds her hands. \nMACKELWAY How's things back at the ranch? \nFRAN Movin' right along. \nThat might've been a dig; Charlton can't tell. \nCHARLTON Okay. Whadda we know? \nFRAN Picked up a foot-print in the back seat of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger than Speck's. \nJust like that, Fran is piping up. Mackelway's unoffended. \nCHARLTON 'Kay. \nFRAN Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he was strangled from behind... I think our guy waited for him in the backseat, sprung this on him once the car was moving. \nShe slides that FOURTH DRAWING to Charlton - giving us our first look at it. \nINSERT - THE DRAWING: \n...a STEAMER-TRUNK, lined with plastic. Inside it are large ZIPLOC BAGS. Inside the bags are BODY PARTS. \nIt's realized so accurately that it looks more like a photograph. No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply. \nTHE BOOTH - RESUMING \nCharlton eyes it without reaction. \nFRAN (CONT'D) Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges of the paper, consistent with powdered gloves. (Charlton nods) So he gets the dropped in his lap, it spooks him, and the car winds up in the ravine. \nPlausible enough, until: \nMACKELWAY I don't think so, no. I think it was pushed. \nFRAN How ya figure? \nMACKELWAY The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near the embankment. \nWithout embellishing any further, he slides over the PHOTOGRAPHS that he took this morning with the Minox: tire- tracks, foot-prints. She eyes them. \nThen she eyes Mackelway. Charlton notes the tension. \nCHARLTON Okay. So our guy likes to draw pictures of body parts and then spring 'em on people. What's that get us? (they're silent) That's what I thought. \nThere is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran. Charlton has no time for it. \nCHARLTON Oh. 'Fore I forget. This came in for you: \nHe tosses a 9-by-12 ENVELOPE at Mackelway, who opens it. Six sheets of paper slide out. \nFirst one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX: same hand-written inscription as the last one: \"Attention, Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls.\" \nOkay. This is twice now. He knows what will be under this top sheet without even looking. But here's Page One: \nA photo of a middle-aged African-American WOMAN. Across the top of the photo, in hand-writing: \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\" \nAnd typed on the bottom: \"Tanya Green. Age 42. Ht. 5'9\", Wt. 165, Eyes Blk, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Ames, Iowa. Date of Disappearance: 3-22-97.\" \nThe following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women, young, old. Four more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. \nBut before he can think it through, he hears: \nMANAGER (O.S.) It's about time. \nThey turn. That came from the NIGHT MANAGER: a humorless guy named LES. He's looking at the front door, through which Dolly has just entered. Pink cowboy boots tonight. \nDOLLY Don't start in on me, Les. I couldn't get the pickup started and Harlan took the Dodge. \nThe Manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the booth. Dolly stops short, taken aback. \nDOLLY (CONT'D) Holy Hell. My one shot at winding up on \"Cops\" and I'm in my weekday boots! \nCUT TO: \n20    INT. DINER - BOOTH - LATER                                       20 \nDolly and Mel sit opposite Mackelway and Fran. \nDOLLY He was a quiet guy. Normal. Liked to read fishing magazines. Not much of a tipper. Is that a lousy thing to say? \nFRAN It's fine. \nMel rolls his eyes. \nMACKELWAY What can you tell us about the other man? \n", "test1_id": 3162, "test2_input": "CUT TO: \n179   INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)                 179 \nFran has just arrived. She scans the place. Doesn't see Mackelway. Great. She reaches for that cel-phone again... \nCUT TO: \n180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180 \nMackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms and legs are bound. His mouth has been GAGGED. \nAnd he is staring into his own REFLECTION. \nHe lies on his side. A MIRROR has been propped on the floor, just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look at but himself. \nHe strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them. He's helpless, powerless. And that mirror is forcing him to watch it all with perfect clarity. \nA few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet. \nO'RYAN Are you afraid? \nThere was a delight to that question - we can see it on O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the gag. But the answer's obvious. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (quoting himself, as Daitz:) \"Imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any kind. No hidden desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of evil.\" \nAll Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) And the name we give that killer... is Zero. (again:) Are you afraid? \nSlowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on the floor. It GLOWS. Good God... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) It'd be customary at this point to start praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't seen too many answers though. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you, either. You're alone. \nMackelway tries to speak. It's impossible. \nO'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for Mackelway to say: \nMACKELWAY Where's the boy? \nO'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily. \nO'RYAN (re: the mirror) My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to watch yourself say something so heroic. I'm almost envious. (MORE) \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (casually) The boy's under the bed. In pieces. Are you afraid? \nMackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then looks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it... \nO'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) I know what you're thinking: \"There is pain coming. Am I going to take it like a man?\" Let me put you at ease: You won't. None of them do. Men, women, children. They all weep, they all beg. They pass out, they piss themselves. They attempt negotiation: You wouldn't believe how many men have lain right where you're lying right now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve. It's pathetic. Are you afraid? (of course, no reply) Then there's that moment when they realize there's nothing left to be negotiated. They're just mine. And they're helpless. And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender... well, it's almost pornographic. I put this mirror here because I don't want you to miss it. Are you afraid? \nWith that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful. \nBut Mackelway can't look at anything else. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) How about now? \nJust like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's face. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke rise from its edge. \nAnd Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it. \nHe struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound comes out of him. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Are you afraid? \nO'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife just under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is unbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you? \nTwo things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me to death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry... \nO'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch above Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Are you? \nMackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is awful. He stares at his own reflection. \n...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (top of his lungs) Are you afraid?! \nThat bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight - can't watch this anymore. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (infuriated) Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit or I'll cut the fucking lids off!! \nMackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep sobs shudder through him, as... \nO'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm: O'RYAN (CONT'D) ARE YOU AFRAID?!?! \nMackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am terrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag. \nWith his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head forward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS, obliterating the image. \n...and everything goes black. \nThen, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless to beat them back: \n180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                              180a \nOut of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of the Navaho. \n", "test2_true": "-That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth, dancing around a fire in a frenzy. Then a curtain of wheat obscures him, revealing: -Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting us. Looks like they're naked. But as we approach them, they seem to get farther away. Then that curtain of wheat that separates us from them reveals: -Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us for something, a job well done, when: \nMackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn. He FIRES... Then looks to see who he's just shot. \nA body. He turns it over. \n...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror, giving way as we... \n181   FADE UP AGAIN...                                                  181 \n...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a pad. Calm. Businesslike. His back turned to us. \n182   INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                   182 \nTime has passed. We don't know how much. Or maybe we're dead, or dreaming. It's hard to say... \nBut there's O'Ryan, at a desk. Writing... \nMackelway's eyes are open. His FOREHEAD has a bright red raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror. \nBut the brain is functioning. It starts running through a check-list: \nI'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive. There's O'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's just my right arm. But it is searing. \nThe check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that GAG has been removed. \nAnd MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I am dead. \nMackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort. Everything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it. Flexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it. \nThen he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped around it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks as though a nurse had tended to it. \nBut this sure as hell isn't a hospital... \nThen, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without meaning to. \nBut O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed malevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why. \nO'RYAN (softly) Stand up. \nMackelway pauses, rewinding that one. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) It's over now. Can you stand? \nMackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat. So he's a step behind. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) We really do have to go. \nO'Ryan rises, crossing toward us. Even unbound, Mackelway is expecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a piece of paper onto Mackelway's lap. \nIt's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the background. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still too unwound to speak... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) This is where he'll be. With the boy. (a beat) Zero. He's coming home today. We're going to be there. \nMackelway's starting to understand now. This was an act. An initiation. That stuns him... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) You're ready to come with me now. You've been in the pit. Stand up. \nMackelway eyes him - utter disbelief. \nO'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of Basic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can we shake on it? \nInstead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES: \nIt is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an animal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back. \nThen Mackelway is upon him. \nAll the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable sobbing... they ERUPT now into violence. \nIt is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it off. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand comes down like a sledgehammer. \nOne blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are savage, barely human. He's out of control. \nO'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around this fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here. He's going to squeeze the life from him. \nThis is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild, hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out of O'Ryan's throat. \nThen Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than a second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own twisted image. \nHe looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined to kill this guy. \n...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again. \n...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An animal. \nHis hands, without warning, release their grip. \nO'Ryan gasps for air. His face has been bloodied. Mackelway rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from O'Ryan's chest. That makes breathing a little easier. \nMackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap BATHROOM. \n183   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING                           183 \nMackelway enters. There's a mirror in here too. That fat BANDAGE on his shoulder stares back at him. \nHe tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm - revealing a hideous wound. \nIt's a ZERO, WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT. \n", "test2_id": 3163, "test3_input": "Now everything clicks: O'Ryan was branding him. Initiating him with that red-hot knife. \nMackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. He splashes some water on his face, his mind still reeling. \nThen O'Ryan appears in the doorway. He too looks like hell - face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat... \nMackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, then places that DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink. Mackelway eyes it. \nThen O'Ryan stuns him... by laying Mackelway's GUN atop the drawing, without a word. \nMackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at O'Ryan's face, just inches away. \nWe're TIGHT on Mackelway's hand. It trembles with rage. \nBut O'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. In fact he smiles, utterly confident. Then: \nO'RYAN (re: gun) Soon. I promise... But not yet. \nHe eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. Then O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the front door. \nMackelway stands, rigid. He raises the gun. Maybe I'll just shoot this fucker in the back. \nThen those IMAGES come at us again, out of nowhere: \n184   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                          184 \nOut of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet wind, tall wheat, our own heavy BREATHING as we run... And that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the sound of O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling: \nO'RYAN (O.S.) Please... I'm begging you. \nThat was clear enough. A gun rises. We seem to be holding it... \nThen those images vanish, and we are jolted back to: \n185   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING                             185 \nMackelway tightens. O'Ryan's out the door. This VISION that keeps getting clearer and clearer... What the hell does this it mean? \nDown go two more Vicodens... \nCUT TO: \n186   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT                          186 \nA huge STORM devours scenery on both sides of us. O'Ryan drives. Mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face, still recovering from what happened in that room... \nSilence... Then: \nMACKELWAY Tell me about Icarus. \nO'RYAN Why? \nMACKELWAY Just... wanna know. \nO'Ryan eyes him. The sky is black. \nO'RYAN There were five of us. In the program. \nMackelway's all ears... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) We'd come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then you'd go to your room, with your pen and (MORE) \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) your pad of paper, always alone, and you'd try to lock in. Son of Sam. John Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be driving his car, or having a beer or brushing his teeth... or cutting someone's eyes out. \nThat was said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) If you did it right, you got all of it: The way it sounded. The way it smelled... Those people were looking up at you, begging you for mercy. It was like being God. (a beat) ...except you're not. Because you can't do a thing for them. Can't make it stop. You're just watching, helpless. \nHe pauses. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) They wired us into this current, the five of us: darkness, the pit itself. We were plugged right into it. But nobody taught us how to shut it off... (thinking back...) We were just men. And we saw things men shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil - and it never shut off. Even now, it's still there. \nMACKELWAY They all wind up like you? The other agents? \nO'RYAN No. They're dead now. \nOh. Mackelway doesn't reply... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) They broke down. Then they opted out. (Mackelway's a blank) Killed themselves... After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became impossible. Ya see? \nMackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head- lights. Then: \nMACKELWAY I'm sorry. \nO'Ryan shrugs. He appreciates it. The windshield wipers beat back rain... \nCUT TO: \n187   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT                      187 \nO'Ryan continues to drive. Silence hangs. Then: \nO'RYAN We're here. \nMackelway sits up. O'Ryan pulls over at: \n188   EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING                   188 \nWe've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard. \nO'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift briefly to the drawing. \n", "test3_true": "O'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: \"Cuff me.\" \nThe CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat. Mackelway reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan to club the guy. \nBut O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then he stops. Simply has to ask: \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's... How many of 'em is he actually responsible for? \nO'Ryan lays it right out: \nO'RYAN All of 'em. \nMackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan to the steering wheel and approaches the house. \n189   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY - CONTINUING                           189 \nThe place is in some disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint, etc. Mackelway looks through the kitchen window. \nNo one's visible. He walks around the side of the house. \n190   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 190 \nO'Ryan watches as Mackelway vanishes. This is a moment of opportunity. With his free hand, he reaches into his pocket, grabbing a lighter. \n191   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SIDE - CONTINUING                              191 \nMackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain. But now he can see inside the Living Room of this home: \nIt's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames. \nAnd an OLD LADY, leaning over a record player. \nTough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller. There's also an old tv in here: \"Wizard of Oz\" is on it. \nThe lady is 70, frail, thin. She also happens to be BLIND. Cataracts on her eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen. \nHe moves to another window. \n192   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 192 \nO'Ryan, keeping his eyes on that house, now lights the lighter... and holds the flame up to the CHAIN connecting his hand-cuff to the one on the steering wheel. \nThe chain begins to heat up... \n193   EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - RESUMING                                 193 \nMackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen. \nIt, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose. The refrigerator, the table, the toaster - all old. \nThe oven is an antique too. Delia crosses to it, grabs a towel, opens it... and pulls a CAKE from it. \nShe brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a lady who can't see. On the table is an old-fashioned baker's frosting tube. \nShe grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins to write on the cake, in frosting. Slowly. \nMackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. The first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: \"Happy Bir...\" It's a work in progress. \n194   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                              194 \nO'Ryan has that handcuff chain GLOWING now. We don't know if he'll have time to break the thing... until: \nThe passenger-side door is opened, abruptly. \nMACKELWAY It's his birthday, isn't it? \nO'Ryan turns. Here's Mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what O'Ryan's doing with that lighter. \nO'Ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly. Mackelway decides to ignore the whole thing... \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) He comes home on his birthday. \nO'Ryan nods. Then Delia's front door swings open. \nDELIA (O.S.) (aloud, delighted) Darling?! That you?! \n195   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                          195 \nDelia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking to the dark rainy street. That confuses them. \n...until we hear the rumble of an 18-WHEEL TRUCK. \nIt turns a corner onto this street. Mackelway turns now... \nWe've seen this truck before. A monstrous, rolling beast. And Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. Behind him, Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing. \nBut that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the sound of that 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, its tires locking- up on the wet road. \nMackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry, sinewy man of 35... Let's call him ZERO. \nTheir eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again and begins to rumble down the street. \nDELIA (CONT'D) (confused) Daryl? Honey? \nNo answer. That truck is rumbling away. Mackelway turns, racing for the Yukon, leaving Delia at the door. \n196   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               196 \nMackelway jumps in to the Yukon, unlocking those cuffs. \n", "test3_id": 3164}

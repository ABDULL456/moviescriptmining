{"train": "Suspect Zero \nWritten by \nZak Penn \nRevisions - Billy Ray \nDirector's Shooting Script \nNovember 30, 2001 \nFADE IN: \n...on a BLACK WAVE - vast, oceanic, and coming right at us. BEGIN TITLES. \nThe wave is relentless, huge, menacing. We can't tell if this is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything - noisily. It sucks, it yawns, it roars. \nThen we realize... this massive wave of darkness is actually just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now... \n...to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds. END TITLES. \n1   EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M.                      1 \nAmongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its back. The carton asks \"Have You Seen Me?\" above a photographed face that's been obscured by grime. \nYellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through it all. We stay with the carton... \nThen that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts off and whips past us. \n...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness. \nThen, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed. \nA LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. \"Have You Seen Me?\" It's heartbreaking. TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35: concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie. \nA vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them. \nCUT TO: \n...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee. \n2   INT. \"THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER\" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2 (4:30 A.M.) \nHAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man. Reads \"Rod and Reel\" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight: \nTruckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a \"Drink Bud!\" mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO... \nDOLLY (O.S.) Top that off for ya, Hon? \nThat's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck looks up, smiles thinly, \"No.\" Dolly heads off. Speck returns to his article, underlining a particular passage. \n...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite Speck's. Speck reacts, startled. \nSPECK Jesus... \nThe MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka... \nO'RYAN What's in the case? \nSPECK I'm sorry? \nO'RYAN You're always lugging that case around. I'm curious. \nSpeck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here. So why is this guy bothering me??? \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) What do you sell? \nSPECK I'm... in restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name? \nO'RYAN Must travel a lot, huh? \nSpeck is looking for Dolly, a Manager, anyone... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Whole country, or just hereabouts? \nSPECK I don't mean to be rude but-- \nO'RYAN How's your wife feel about it? \nThat spun things a bit. Speck pauses. \nSPECK What? \nO'RYAN She must get lonely, with you gone all the time. Does she? \nSPECK Look, I... \nO'RYAN Do you get lonely? \nSpeck's so thrown now he can't answer. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Ya miss fucking her, Harold? \nSPECK Listen, I don't know who you are but you can't-- \nO'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide. \nWe catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN. \nAnd, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued. \nThat's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly. Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows. \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) Ms. Potter's the nice girl you met at the desk. She puts a package together for all the new agents, things to know about the area, help with finding apartments and such. This one's yours: \nCharlton stops at a CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A corner of dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread. \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) Not so different from Dallas, is it? \nMACKELWAY (fuck yes) No, Sir. \nCHARLTON Good. \nAn abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world: \nA framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15, on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer, calendar, a baseball covered with autographs. \nHe opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of BUFFERIN into the back of it. \n...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles, and throws them down his throat, as: \nGRIEVES (O.S.) Ya like Frito Pies? \nMackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not quite as ambitious. But solid, decent. \nMACKELWAY I dunno. What are they? \nGrieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway: \nGRIEVES Welcome to the minors. \nGrieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie. God, get me outta here... \nCUT TO: \n6   INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER                          6 \nA BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as THOSE OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on assignment. Men in motion. \nBut Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report. It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word \"beige\" and replacing it with \"tan.\" \nHis head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him. But after lingering for a half-second on that \"Most-Wanted List\" again? Starkey? It's a wound... \n7   INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER                  7 \nMackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar to him. Filter, water, grounds, etc. \nKATIE (O.S.) Here. Lemme do that. \nHe turns. This is KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under- challenged by her job. Been here two years. In two seconds she's got the thing percolating. Of course. \nKATIE (CONT'D) It takes some experience. \nHe shrugs, not feeling too smooth. \nKATIE (CONT'D) You're Mackelway, right? \nMACKELWAY Mmm-hmm. \nKATIE Fax came in for you. It's the room next door. \nMACKELWAY Oh. Thanks. \nHe rises, heads for the \"fax room\"... \n8   INT. \"FAX ROOM\" - CONTINUING                                      8 \nA former closet, converted into useful space. FIVE FAX MACHINES sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. One fax machine is printing. Mackelway approaches it. \nSix pieces of paper await him. The first is a TOP-SHEET, written by hand: \"Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency - Wichita Falls.\" No sender named. \nHe looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax. \nA young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\" At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read: \n\"Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1\", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn. Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99.\" \nMackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two. \nA young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed photo. Another \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\" scrawled across the top of it. And, at the bottom of the sheet: \n\"Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6\", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00.\" \nThe other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and vitals. Faces. Facts. \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\" \nHe looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line. \nHe eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then Charlton emerges from his office, shouting: \nCHARLTON Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all day, or do you wanna do something? \nMackelway's out of this room in an instant. \nCUT TO: \n9   EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY                         9 \nYour standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now... \nPOLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site. Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out. \nTwo men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup. \nDYLAN (impressed) Well now... (Charlton shrugs) So what the hell's he doin' here? \nThat one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk. Mackelway and the others look inside... \nThere, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt- shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet. \nMackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body. \nHe leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the steering wheel. Gently. \n...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton leans in, gets a look. \nCHARLTON Christ... \nMackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed into a series of dark, disjointed images: \n12   EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                        12 \nSeems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped. \nA MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to the ground. Then we look up. \nMackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are: \n13   INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY                 13 \nWe start on the EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve to a pad of paper, on a DESK. Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE. He holds the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if expecting to get some kind of pulse from it. \nHere come those IMAGES again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash, Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then they cease... \n...and O'Ryan begins to DRAW, hurriedly. Only half of his face is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is total. \nHis pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain, the wind. They're all alive in O'Ryan's mind... \nAnd that DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the gun, Mackelway. \nThen, the pen is set down. The drawing is complete. \nO'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the exact time and date on to the drawing. Then he slips it into a folder marked, \"MACKELWAY.\" \nCUT TO: \n14   EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB. DAY                   14 \nPicket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing. A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, each bringing food... and tissues to cry into. \n15   INT. SPECK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)             15 \nShocked faces. Food on unmatching trays. Speck's wife - JAN, 40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile. FRIENDS and FAMILY mill about, tending to her. \nKIDS hover. Two of them, a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY and an 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL, sniff back tears as people offer condolences. \nBut the focus here is Jan - her grief. She's shaking... \nO'RYAN (O.S.) Mrs. Speck? \nShe looks up. O'Ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty faces in here. Jan half-nods. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Just wanted to offer my condolences. (takes her hand) I didn't know him well but... I think Harold was a much more complex man than people realized. \nJan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now. \nJAN (through tears) He was, wasn't he? \nO'RYAN I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am. \nShe sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. O'Ryan extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off. \nBeside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck. We blow past it, and into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the portrait's FRAME, and: \nBAM! We're rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again: \n16   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                                  16 \nThis time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to be saying: \n(O.S.) Please... \nThe sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite somewhere, or a distance of time and space. \nThen the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway... \nCUT TO: \n17   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 10:30 P.M. 17 \nMackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon, parked between two big-rigs in the lot of the \"All-American Diner.\" Sky looks black tonight. It rumbles... \nAnd that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw... It was all his. \nHe pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket. Slugs them down. This headache is a constant. Then he gets out of the Yukon... \n18   INT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER GAINESVILLE - CONTINUING                   18 \nMackelway enters, spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite a WOMAN, her back to us. \n19   INT. BOOTH - CONTINUING                                         19 \nMackelway approaches. The Woman doesn't turn. \nCHARLTON Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce you, but I understand that won't be necessary. \nMEL Like I said, I never really saw him. Harold came up, complainin' about the guy - but time I turned, he was gone. \nFRAN                      MACK (at Dolly:)               (at Dolly:) Could you de--            Did you get a-- \nThey each stop short, waiting for the other to yield. Finally Mackelway nods, \"Go ahead.\" \nFRAN Can you describe him, Ma'am? \nDOLLY Sure. He was... \nDolly pauses, her face scrunching a bit. Troubled... \nDOLLY (CONT'D) That's weird. Guy was in here better part of an hour. We had a real pleasant chat... But I can't remember a thing about him. For the life of me. Couldn't even tell you what color his eyes were. \nShe shrugs apologetically. \nFRAN Happen to see what he was driving? \nDOLLY That one's easy. It's still in the lot. (they perk up) The Bonneville out there with the awful paint job. \nShe gestures to the lot, where an old PONTIAC BONNEVILLE sits, its paint stripped down to the primer. Bingo. \nFran and Mackelway eye it, then one another. \nCUT TO: \n21   EXT. DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                          21 \nFran and Mackelway emerge, heading for the Bonneville. \nMACKELWAY We ought to work out some kind of protocol. \nFRAN For what? \nMACKELWAY Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty silly, our talking over one another. \nFRAN Fine. I'll handle them from now on. \nHe doesn't argue. They come to a stop at that Bonneville, stripped down to its primer. Time to work... \nTwo agents, all instinct. We see them study things, details, their minds always churning... Mackelway pulls out his Minox, snaps off a few more shots. Then: \nMACKELWAY Trunk's ajar. \nShe turns. Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar. Mackelway approaches, cautiously. \nHe doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to protect against prints. He opens the trunk. \nFirst thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a- slash-through-it... staring right at him. \nBut this time, it's been carved into somebody's back. \nMackelway stares. So does Fran. Before them lies a body, stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead. \nMackelway sighs. Things just got tougher... \nCUT TO: \n22   INT. ARCHER COUNTY MORGUE - DAY                                   22 \nHarold Speck lies on a table. A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines him. Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample frame yet to be examined. \nThe lights are out, but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO, with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown. He speaks into it with a quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc. \nMackelway and Fran are here... watching. Mackelway is particularly focused on Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS, we now see, have also been torn off. Hmmmm... \nFRAN Why eyelids? \nMACKELWAY Huh? \nFRAN No other signs of torture here. Why take somebody's eyelids off? \nMACKELWAY So they can't blink. \nShe sighs, aloud: \"I know that already, Asshole.\" Coroner keeps his head down, speaking into that microphone. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) It's a metaphor - to make certain the victim sees... or to make certain that we see something. (she's silent) Or maybe it's just a fuck-you. \nCoroner continues his monotone narration... then crosses to the sink. \nThat puts him out of earshot. So: \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) (to Fran, quietly) I'm sorry about Don. \nFRAN (thrown) Huh? \nMACKELWAY You're not wearing your ring anymore. \nThat was an attempt at kindness. She knows that. Still, she eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's... \nThen there's a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM. \nThey turn. Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS WINDOW, in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue. He presses a piece of paper up against the glass. \nOn it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: \"MATCHES ONE OF ONE.\" Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash- through-it. \nThis is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street map. \nThe ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those scrawled lines take us to \"The Hope House,\" in Oklahoma City. At the bottom a scribbled name, \"David Dyson,\" and a contact number. \nMoving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods. He just got a break... \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Wait. \nThey stop. Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible beneath these stairs: a BOX, with a bucket of PAINT sticking out of it... \n28   INT. BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING                  28 \nMackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box. \nSure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK PAINT here. And some used brushes. \nMackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson. \nInside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE. Mackelway grabs it, eyes it. \nHe flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc. \nMackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials in this box, he spots a large folded MAP. \nHe grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED. \nBut before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker: \nA photograph of himself. \nIt takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway. \nIt is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year, concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7 on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List... \nDyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway. \nMackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS, for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK. 29   EXT. STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe, hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the thuds of our own heavy feet. \nThis is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town. Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: \"This is the place,\" and sticks out his palm. \n30   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          30 \nMackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist, murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning failure for all involved. \n...as we RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again... \n31   INT. \"CLUB\" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK                   31 \nBad-lighting, drunk patrons in a CIRCLE, and a DONKEY-SHOW taking place on a bare stage. Feels like we've stepped into some kind of evil carnival. It's dizzying. \nAmong the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing. \nSuddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head. \nStarkey freezes, caught. Some of the PATRONS around him find somewhere else to stand... But the show goes on. \n32   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          32 \nThat ARTICLE gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's case was thrown out of court. It is this: \nThe F.B.I. Agent on the case had made a mistake in \"evidentiary procedure.\" Hence, Mackelway's picture. \nOn his face, we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: six months ago. \n33   INT. COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK           33 \nThree months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros. Now Mackelway sits in this courthouse ANTEROOM, adjacent to a courtroom. Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him. \nPROSECUTOR #1 D'you understand how fucked we are? \nMACKELWAY Yes, Sir. \nPROSECUTOR #1 Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me? \nMACKELWAY They assured me that they understood protocol. \nPROSECUTOR #1 Well guess what? They didn't. And this prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not. \nThat registered. \n34   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             34 \nBeneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES, all concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it. \nMackelway's memory just got stoked again: \n35   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK                    35 \nMackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped. \nThe hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps. \n36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36 \nThe door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror. \nHe's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his own reflection. \nThen he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns. \nOut of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey emerges, coming into view under a single light. \nBeside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK. \n37   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             37 \nMackelway stares... at a record of his deepest wound. But what the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient? \n42   EXT. A BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                       42 \nA typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just across the street from O'Ryan's cheap motel... \n43   INT. BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                        43 \nLow-lights, dust on the floor. Pool tables. \nLORETTA is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox, weighing her choices. She's got a thick curtain of hair, which she wrangles with a CHIP-CLIP. It's a habit. \nShe chooses a country-rock tune, then heads for the bar, walking to the beat. It's fun being 19 and beautiful. \n44   AT THE BAR - CONTINUING                                          44 \nThe BARTENDER'S a stocky guy with a broad smile. \nLORETTA (re: song) How's that? \nBARTENDER Little cute for my taste, but I can stand three minutes of it. \nLORETTA I'll have a seven and seven, please. \nBARTENDER Seven and seven. Got some i.d.? \nShe half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re- fastening that chip-clip. It's her best move. \nLORETTA It's in the car. No one's asked me for it for a couple years now. \nBARTENDER If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end of the song. \nShe eyes him: are you really carding me? He smiles: nothing personal, Sugar. So she heads for the door. \n...on her way, she passes a booth. In it we find a familiar face - Virgil Ray Starkey... \nHe remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her. But behind his eyes, something primal just took place. He rises, heads for the door. \n45   EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                          45 \nLoretta walks to her VW Bug. Starkey exits the bar. She doesn't notice. We TILT UP: the lights are off in O'Ryan's motel room... \n46   EXT. AT LORETTA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER                             46 \nIt all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground beside the open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away, kicking up gravel. \nCUT TO: \n...Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread. \n47   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - MINUTES LATER                            47 \nWe're off-road. Missouri's woods can be seen through the windshield. And Starkey is staring at us. Pawing at us... \nLORETTA Please, Mister... \nStarkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head against the window, hard. That makes things start to swim. Starkey tears at her clothes, lowers himself on to her. \nShe whimpers. WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO: \n48   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - SAME                                 48 \nThis is where you go when you've just moved to Wichita Falls and money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen table, scuffed blinds. \n...and one sleepless agent, having one lousy night. \nMackelway sits on the edge of his bed, almost able to hear Loretta's helpless cries. Some nights are like this. His head is POUNDING again. Down go four more Bufferin. \nAbove him, covering the bedroom mirror, is the MAP he took from that Hope House basement. O'Ryan's map, UNFOLDED. \nIt's HUGE: 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring the mirror. \nAs we glimpsed while still in that basement, this map his been written on, in pen. O'Ryan's notations cover it: Over a THUSAND CITIES on it have been CIRCLED, by hand, in RED. Each of those circled cities has a DATE written beside it, also in red: (\"4/6,\" \"5/19,\" \"10-26,\" etc.) \nMackelway studies it, his face working. Another of those WHIMPERS from Loretta seems to hang, suspended. Mackelway shakes it off, certain that he's imagining it. \nHe won't sleep a wink tonight. We LEAVE HIM, returning to: \n49   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - RESUMING                                 49 \nThe attack continues, its terror unimaginable. Loretta sobs. It hurts. Starkey's too powerful to fight off. We stay on her face: dazed, her mind simply checking out. \n...until a look of cognizance comes over her, brought on by a SHADOW that just passed by. \nThen the window behind Starkey simply EXPLODES. \nGlass flies everywhere, and TWO ARMS reach into the pick-up. They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up, his back sliced open by shards. He screams. \nShe can't resist coming to the window, where she sees: \n50   EXT. WOODS - STARKEY'S PICK-UP - CONTINUING                       50 \nStarkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing over him, looming large as a Grizzly... is O'Ryan. A long HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand. \nBut his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational: \nO'RYAN Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya know where I can find a good donkey show? \nStarkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac: \nSTARKEY Huh? \nO'RYAN Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America animals have rights. (pointedly) Don't they, Virgil? \nOf course, O'Ryan had circled \"Macon\" too. Beside it he'd written \"5-6.\" So Macon gets a yellow pin. \nMackelway continues, as: \nFRAN (O.S.) Got nothing on the last fax. \nMackelway turns. In comes Fran. \nFRAN (CONT'D) Came from a business center at a Mariott in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it. \nMackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the room. \nCHARLTON Whadda we know about the map? \nMACKELWAY It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost perfectly. \nCharlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red. Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.) \nCharlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the map: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it. \nCHARLTON Why's Greenville in blue? \n(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but tiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.) \nMACKELWAY Only city where the date on the fax and the date on the map didn't correspond. \nHe pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named \"Steven Kim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance: \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Fax lists the date of disappearance as August 7. On the map he's written \"10- \nThe DATE on O'Ryan's map reads \"10-26\" beside Greenville, Tx. So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map. \nCharlton notes today's date: October 17... \nCHARLTON Any of these bodies been recovered? \nMACKELWAY Two so far. Female, disappeared from Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male, Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th. \nOn the MAP, Dayton's got \"4/12\" written beside it. Trenton has \"1/5.\" Both have yellow pins in them. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) But both bodies were found over a thousand miles from where they'd last been seen. One in Montana, the other in Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both. \nCharlton looks to the table, where AUTOPSY REPORTS and AUTOPSY PHOTOS sit - two victims we've never seen before. \nWe see the VICTIMS photographed face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below. Charlton gives the photos a cursory glance, nothing more. \nBut we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from Trenton - an odd BURN MARK on his lower left calf. \nLooks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf... \nCHARLTON Either of the bodies have the zero on them? \nMACKELWAY No, Sir. \nCharlton, frustrated, SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE. We look to that MAP, a handful of yellow pins in it... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n...that same map, over a HUNDRED YELLOW PINS in it now. \n55   INT. FBI OFFICE - \"O'RYAN ROOM\" - NIGHT                          55 \nIt's 8:30 at night. Mackelway is alone in here - staring at the map. He's been doing a lot of that lately. \nThe stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has grown as well. Every one of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map. \n(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC, each stamped and addressed to Mackelway.) \nMackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him. Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he took himself with that Minox. \nFRAN Why you? \nMACKELWAY Huh? \nFRAN He could be sending these to any agent in any office in the country... But he's sending them to you. Why? \nMackelway's been asking himself that same question lately. \nMACKELWAY I don't know. \nPHONE RINGS. She grabs it. \nFRAN (INTO PHONE) This is Agent Kulok. (a beat) Who's calling? \nShe hears the answer, then covers the phone. \nFRAN (CONT'D) (to Mackelway:) Do you know a professor named Daitz? Says he's from Tulane. \nMACKELWAY (eagerly) Yeah. Criminal Psych. I've been trading e- mails with him. \nFRAN (INTO PHONE) One moment, please... \nShe hands him the phone... \nCUT TO: \n56   EXT. TULANE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                     56 \nA beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In its center lies a vast, expensive structure - the Behavioral Sciences Building. The place goes on forever. \n57   INT. TULANE - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES BUILDING - SAME                 57 \nJAN No. Why? \nHe shrugs, dismissing it: \nMACKELWAY It's nothing. Trace elements we found on his trunk. Any interest in chemistry? Maybe as a hobby? \nJan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory... Then she shakes it off. He lets it go. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Anyway, thank you. And thanks for the coffee. Next time I'll call first, I promise. \nJAN No trouble at all. \nCUT TO: \n92   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 92 \nMackelway sits in his car. Through his windshield we see Jan as she backs out of the driveway. \nShe pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a grieving widow can give. He waves back. \nThen she's gone, disappearing around a corner. \nMackelway pauses a beat, checking his rear-view mirror to be sure. Then he gets out of his car... \nCUT TO: \n93   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SIDE GATE - MOMENTS LATER                     93 \nMackelway sneaks around the side of the house, pulling on a lever to unlatch the side-gate. \n94   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUING                         94 \nHe emerges into the tiny backyard, making a bee-line for that storm cellar door. \nHe knows he shouldn't be doing this. It's beyond risky. But here he is, without a warrant. \nThere's no lock on the cellar door. He reaches for it. Then he stops himself. Just noticed something: A NEIGHBOR-LADY, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is looking right at him through her bedroom window. \nFuck it. He enters the storm cellar. \n95   INT. SPECK'S STORM CELLAR - CONTINUING                             95 \nSeven steps, leading to a dusty cement floor. Mackelway looks around. \nFacing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case of disaster: Cans of food, sternos, sleeping mats, drums of potable water. \nAnd long FOOT-LOCKERS. Two of them. That's where Mackelway's eyes go, instantly. He hurries to them. \nThrows one open. Nothing but sheets and blankets inside. He paws through it... finding nothing else. \nHe throws the other trunk open. Inside? Pillows. Fuck. \nHe slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on shelves. He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their rows, making more noise than he ought to. \nBut he finds nothing behind them... except more cans. He approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside. Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD, locked. \nHe pulls at the cupboard door, hard. It splinters. \nInside, a rifle and some boxes of ammo... same as you'd find in every other storm-cellar in Texas. \nHe pauses: Am I crazy...? \nCUT TO: \n96   EXT. SPECK'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER                            96 \nHe emerges from the storm-cellar, confused. Shuts the storm- cellar door. \nThen he turns. Something else just caught his eye: \nAbove Speck's bedroom window is another window, a tiny one. An attic... \nHe heads for that UNLOCKED BACK DOOR, and enters... \n97   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING                    97 \nHe hurries toward the stairs, reaches them... then spots something through the Entry Hall window: \nOn the street outside, pulling up to the curb... is a POLICE CAR. Sirens off. That Neighbor-Lady must've placed the call. And here's Mackelway, without a warrant. Shit. \nTwo ABILENE COPS get out, approaching the house. Mackelway climbs the stairs. \n98    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUING                        98 \nIf he stays quiet, he might just pull this off. \n99    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SECOND STORY - CONTINUING                  99 \nA tiny hallway, with four doors. Up ahead, dangling from the ceiling, is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold- out stairs... and an attic. \nMackelway tugs on the rope. The fold-out stairs drop down out of the ceiling. Then he hears: \nNEIGHBOR LADY (O.S.) He's inside! He's inside! Went in through the back! \n...which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to hell. So he climbs up those fold-out stairs. \nThe two ABILENE COPS now circle the house, entering through the back-porch door, just as Mackelway did. \nHe pulls up the folding stairs. Maybe the guys'll do a half- assed search and then leave... \n100   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - ATTIC_- CONTINUING                        100 \nThe agents find seats around the table. Charlton takes his place at the head of it. \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) (to the assembled:) Okay. We've got a serial killer of serial killers. \nFran scribbles something on a piece of paper: \"What a genius!\" Slides it over. Mackelway conceals the note, as: \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) (still grand-standing) He's a transient with a history of mental illness. He also happens to think he's a former agent of this Bureau. And he is pursuing something that he calls \"Suspect Zero.\" Anybody got anything intelligent to say? \nNobody's volunteering.   There's just silence. \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) (familiar refrain) That's what I thought... \nCUT TO: \n104   OMIT                                                             104 \n105   EXT. WICHITA FALLS FBI OFFICE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT              105 \nMackelway exits the office, heading for his Yukon. \nThen he stops... because Katie is waiting out here, leaning against her Toyota Camry. \nMACKELWAY (fondly) Hey. \nKATIE Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids keepin' bodies in his attic? \nHe nods... but what is she doing out here? \nMACKELWAY Yeah. (a beat) You okay? \nKATIE Yeah. Just... Wondered if you could do me a favor. \nMackelway waits... as Katie hands over a manila envelope. Mackelway opens it. \nInside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl named KAREN SUMPTER, with an attached sheet listing her vitals: height, weight, age, etc. \nAnother face. Another disappearance... \nKATIE (CONT'D) Her name's Karen Sumpter. We were friends. (almost reluctantly) She disappeared last year. Nobody knows where. She was a little wild, but not like that. \nHer sadness is obvious. Mackelway nods. \nKATIE (CONT'D) Anyway, I know you're gonna be in on the autopsies - of the girls they found over at Speck's. Figured you might see if one of 'em was... \nHer voice trails off. This is hard. \nKATIE (CONT'D) If it is, I'd like to be the one to notify her folks. Out families've been friends for years. \nMACKELWAY (gently) Sure. Of course. \nKATIE Thanks... 'Night. \nMackelway puts the envelope under his arm. She starts up the Camry. The sky rumbles. He eyes her. \nFor some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet... \nSMASH CUT TO: \n106   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      106 \nCandles. Shadows on the wall...and Mackelway and Katie, at it again, with the sounds of that eery Navajo CHANTING coming from the boom-box. \nMackelway is studying her, staring into her eyes, her breathing. She's beginning to climax now... and those eyes go wider. We MOVE INTO THEM, and: \nWe are abruptly SLAMMED, again, INTO ANOTHER SET OF THOSE ODD, DISJOINTED IMAGES from that unidentified place: \n107   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME - NIGHT                        107 \nWet wind in a blur of gray. The sound of our own heavy breathing. A voice rising above the wind, pleading: \n(O.S.) Please... \n108   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - RESUMING                                  108 \nShe is utterly lost now. And that CHANTING seems to have gotten louder somehow. \nIMAGES FLICK at us now: culled from that BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE, found at the halfway house: a TRIBESMAN with eyes rolling back in his head, foaming at the mouth. \nMackelway tries to shake it off, tries to keep his focus on Katie. He buries his head into her neck, as: \n109   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                         109 \nTall wheat, wet wind. Then a MUZZLE FLASH, and a body slumping to the ground. And suddenly we are in: \n110   INT. ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - NIGHT 110 \nO'Ryan, at a desk. He has just \"remote viewed\" these images somehow. And they've left him rattled. \nIt's time to get out of this room. Quickly. \nCUT TO: \n111   EXT. ROAD - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME (NIGHT)                         111 \nA stolen, non-descript CHEVY pulls out of a motel room parking lot, on to the street. \n112   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUING                           112 \nO'Ryan is behind the wheel, driving. \n113   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER (DUSK)                  113 \nThe door bursts open. The greasy bag and the soda fall to the floor. Mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. He dials hurriedly. \n119   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - SAME                           119 \nWe're in a PARKING LOT outside a WAL-MART. Fran's just thrown a bag into her Ford Taurus. Her CEL-PHONE RINGS. She grabs it. \nFRAN (INTO CEL) Kulok. \nMACKELWAY (INTO PHONE) He really was FBI. \nFRAN Huh? \nMACKELWAY O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep. Fran, he was FBI. \nHe can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what was in that file now; PAGES are splayed across Mackelway's coffee table: \nA copy of an FBI I.D. BADGE, xeroxed memoes, test scores, citations, evaluations, reports. The entire career of Special Agent Benjamin O'Ryan... in black and white. \nFRAN That's impossible. \nMACKELWAY I'm look at his whole history! Citations, letters of commendation, even his fucking test scores from Quantico. The guy was an agent. \nFRAN I don't believe it. \nMACKELWAY Listen to me-- \nThen we hear a BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Shit! Hold on. \nThat irritated her. Mackelway clicks over. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Yes? \nO'RYAN (THRU PHONE) Read anything interesting lately? \nMackelway's eyes go wide. \nMACKELWAY Where are you? \nCLICK. O'Ryan's just hung up. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Shit! \nHe stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting to Fran. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) That was him. \nFRAN He called you at home? \nMACKELWAY Yes. \nBEEP. Call-Waiting again. \nFRAN Jesus. Call me back. \nMackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye. \nMACKELWAY (INTO PHONE) O'Ryan? \nO'RYAN (THRU PHONE) I've found him, you know. \nMACKELWAY Who? \nO'RYAN Zero. \nMACKELWAY Zero's a myth. You made him up. \nO'RYAN Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they? \nMACKELWAY Do you? \nSounds like O'Ryan just laughed... Then, another curve: \nO'RYAN Was she pretty? \nMACKELWAY Huh? \nO'RYAN I could hear her moaning, right under the Navajo chanting. Whole thing was downright tribal. What's she look like? \nThat was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling violated, feeling \"watched.\" He draws the blinds. Double bolts the front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any kind of wire tapping. \nBut Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with O'Ryan on the phone. \nMACKELWAY (calmly) You tell me. \nO'Ryan laughs. He liked that. \nO'RYAN Fair enough. We'll stick to business: How'd ya like my old room? \nMACKELWAY Huh? \nO'RYAN \"Hope House.\" You were there. \nHow the hell did he know that? It's unsettling. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Dyson re-paint it? (no reply) My room. Did he re-paint it? \nMACKELWAY Yeah. White. \nO'RYAN ...But you saw what was underneath, of course. \n131   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        131 \nO'Ryan reacts. Something just changed: \n132   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING                             132 \nThe wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a tsunami. \n...which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY. \n133   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        133 \nO'Ryan just heard it too. Then new images come at him - but they are, at first, GRAINY, CHOPPY... \n134   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME                                134 \nThe sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING. \nLike an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens: \nWe're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness. \nBefore us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE. \n135   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 135 \nMackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now - enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave, its lip. He continues. \n136   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        136 \nO'Ryan tightens. We can't tell if he experiencing something from the past, the present, the future... \n137   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         137 \nWe WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself. There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40. \nKathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table. \n138   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        138 \nO'Ryan, at his desk, seems to be getting all of this. And it is agitating him. There's perspiration on his forehead. \n139   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      139 \nThe sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine. \nWe whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie. \n140   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     140 \nO'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total... but every part of him is becoming tense. \n141   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              141 \nMackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort. More of that wave is visible to him. But he doesn't step back to take that in. \n142   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      142 \nThat swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running we know not where. \n143   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     143 \nO'Ryan's foot starts to tap: anxiousness, discomfort. \n144   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      144 \nWe run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave. \nThen, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back door, which leads on to that Play Area. \nAnd we hear a horrified yell: \nKATHLEEN (O.S.) Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?! (fainter) Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?! \nThe sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken over by the sounds of that awful WAVE... \n145   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              145 \nMackelway suddenly stops... as if some electric charge had just shot through him, short-circuiting him into stillness. He begins to step away from the wall. \n146   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                        146 \nO'Ryan has lost the \"pulse\" - the connection that had allowed him inside what we just witnessed. \nHe rises, hurrying into a tiny bathroom. We STAY ON THAT WRITING PAD, trying to decipher these lines and squiggles - the ideograms - as we hear the sounds of O'Ryan, retching. \n147   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 147 \nMackelway sits on the bed, looking at what he's just uncovered. An awesome sight. His head is pounding worse than ever... so he reaches for the Vicoden. \n148   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         148 \nWe've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK blows by us in the distance... \n149   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        149 \nO'Ryan washes his face, eyes his reflection in the mirror, scrutinizing himself. \n150   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 150 \nOn the wall opposite Mackelway, that huge black wave is now entirely visible to him. Bits of chipped white paint litter the floor. \nMackelway tosses over a few pages from O'Ryan's file. \nMACKELWAY Agents, trained to \"see\" distant locations using nothing but the mind. They called it Remote Viewing. \nCharlton eyes the pages without comment. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Army stole it from the Soviets. The Bureau stole it from the Army - used it to track serial killers. (a beat) Experimental program. O'Ryan was the first agent they recruited. \nCHARLTON Good for him. \nMACKELWAY Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit. (Charlton's waiting) ...except, it worked. It's how he drew this: Mackelway's referring to that DRAWING: a steamer-trunk, filled with ghastly Ziploc bags: \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) He'd never been in that house before. He just saw what was in there - the Bureau taught him how... same one that deleted him. Same one that's trying to catch him now... Does anything about all this strike you as odd? \nCharlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... Then: \nCHARLTON I'm going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred. You can take the day off. \nWith that, he's gone - leaving Mackelway alone in here. Nothing to look at but that black wave... He hears Charlton, leaving the building. \nHe slams another Vicoden, then hears a PHONE RING. Fuck it. He's not moving. Let Voice Mail get it. \n...until he hears the sound of a FAX coming in. \nHe rises. Follow him: \n155   INT. FBI OFFICE - CUBICLES - CONTINUING                           155 \nMackelway hurries through the office, as the sound of that fax grows louder. \n156   INT. \"FAX ROOM\" - CONTINUING                                      156 \nHe enters. The fax has spun out a single sheet. No top-sheet. That's odd... \nBut here's another face, another victim, with the customary HAVE YOU SEEN ME? across the top. \nA young African-American boy: \"Lloyd Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10\", Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville, Texas. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-99.\" \nThat's it. One face. The transmission ends. Mackelway eyes those vitals. They mean something. Greenville... \n157   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN'S ROOM - RESUMING                        157 \nHe re-enters, and approaches that huge MAP. There's that wave of black pins, with the one BLUE PIN in its center; Greenville, with a \"10-26\" written beside it. \nMackelway pulls out the lone blue pin, replaces it with a black one. Now the wave is complete. All black... \nCUT TO: \n158   INT. 18-WHEELER - CAB - MOVING - NIGHT                            158 \nWe've seen this truck before - several times in fact. It rumbles along the highway. We don't see who's driving, but we do see who's in the passenger seat: \nIt's Charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just witnessed. He sleeps fitfully. \nA MAN'S HAND can be seen, edging into frame - the DRIVER. He picks up a CASSETE, shoves it into the tape deck. \nAnd out comes the sound of \"Barney the Dinosaur.\" \nBARNEY (THRU DASHBOARD STEREO) Oh silly songs get sillier/When you hear them once again/And maybe you're hearing an echo/Or maybe it's only a friend! \nThe truck continues to rumble along. \nCUT TO: \n159   INT. FBI OFFICE - OUTSIDE THE O'RYAN ROOM - MORNING        159 \n6 a.m. Fran pauses outside the O'Ryan Room... where Mackelway sleeps on a chair. Poor guy was here all night. \nShe regards him... then her eyes find that MAP, and the gaping black wave across it. A horrible image... \nShe studies Mackelway again, almost tenderly, until: \nCHARLTON (O.S.) Does he listen to you? \nShe turns, startled. Here's Charlton, right behind her. And she's been caught... watching Mackelway sleep. \nFRAN I'm sorry? \nCHARLTON It's not a strength of his. I'm noticing that lately. \nTruth is, she doesn't like Charlton. Or trust him... \nFRAN He's fine. \nCHARLTON I'm not so sure. (a beat) You oughtta sit him down, remind him how a chain-of-command works. \nFRAN He's fine, Sir. \nCHARLTON Talk to him. \nWith that, he's gone. Fran watches as he heads for the Front Door... and exits. \nShe looks back to Mackelway. He awakens with a start. Thinking no one's watching, he pops another Vicoden. \n160   INT. O'RYAN ROOM - CONTINUING                                  160 \nFran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange. Mackelway checks his watch as a few AGENTS exit the suite. \nMACKELWAY They going to Denton? \nFRAN Mmm-hmm. \nHe grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from ten states. \nMACKELWAY (INTO CEL) This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor- Alpha. Got that? \nHe puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. Vic just made a turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT. \nA huge BANNER overhead reads, \"FOUNDERS DAY CARNIVAL!!!\" \n171   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUING                          171 \nThere are several BIG-RIGS parked here, but the vast majority of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and SUV's. A few pick-ups. \nThere are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel, and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must be a thousand people in attendance today. \nVic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching: \nVic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year- old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still screaming and flailing. \nVic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, \"Behave or else.\" Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival. \n172   EXT. MACKELWAY - AT HIS CAR - RESUMING                            172 \nHe gets out of the Yukon, approaching Vic's truck. We CROSS THE LOT WITH HIM. \nHe reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We still can't tell if it's Charlie.) \nMackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of course. And he can't shoot his way in. \nHe looks to the kid inside: \nMACKELWAY You okay? (Kid's a blank) Kid? You okay in there? \nThe Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit... Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still visible to us, but he won't be for long. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) (at the Kid) I'll be back. Don't worry. \nMackelway heads into the carnival. \n173   EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUING                                        173 \nHe begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling TICKETS for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy. \nRunning... because we just lost sight of Vic. \nMackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a tray or two. Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that Vic on the other side of it? \nMackelway takes off. \n174   EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - CONTINUING                                    174 \nNo Vic. But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back in the direction of the parking lot. \nHe runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn machine, past those ladies selling tickets. \n175   EXT. PARKING LOT - RESUMING                                      175 \nHe hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. But he bursts through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big- rigs, then turns a corner and: \n...runs smack into Benjamin O'Ryan. \nThe shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to recover from it. But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away. \nMackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to face with O'Ryan. \nAnd O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused. \nO'RYAN Well, well... Must be quite a moment for you. Congratulations. \nMackelway still hasn't spoken, until: \nMACKELWAY What're you doing here? \nO'RYAN Waiting for you. \n...which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right in front of Vic's rig. \nBut he wasn't expecting what comes next: \nVic has returned to the rig, with a WOMAN beside him. Turns out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door, unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat. \nFIVE YEAR-OLD Mommy! \nThe kid dives into the Woman's arms. \nWOMAN Morning, Baby! \nVIC I told you she'd be here. (to Woman) He's been a brat all morning. \nMother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread things, badly. \nAnd O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin. \nMACKELWAY (at O'Ryan) Hands up. \nO'Ryan raises his hands. Mackelway reaches for his cuffs. \nCUT TO: \n176   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                       176 \nO'Ryan's hands are cuffed in front of him. Mackelway leads him to the Yukon, opens a door for him, and puts him into the backseat. A few LOOKIE-LOU'S strain for a peek. \nCUT TO: \n179   INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)                 179 \nFran has just arrived. She scans the place. Doesn't see Mackelway. Great. She reaches for that cel-phone again... \nCUT TO: \n180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180 \nMackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms and legs are bound. His mouth has been GAGGED. \nAnd he is staring into his own REFLECTION. \nHe lies on his side. A MIRROR has been propped on the floor, just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look at but himself. \nHe strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them. He's helpless, powerless. And that mirror is forcing him to watch it all with perfect clarity. \nA few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet. \nO'RYAN Are you afraid? \nThere was a delight to that question - we can see it on O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the gag. But the answer's obvious. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (quoting himself, as Daitz:) \"Imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any kind. No hidden desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of evil.\" \nAll Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) And the name we give that killer... is Zero. (again:) Are you afraid? \nSlowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on the floor. It GLOWS. Good God... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) It'd be customary at this point to start praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't seen too many answers though. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you, either. You're alone. \nMackelway tries to speak. It's impossible. \nO'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for Mackelway to say: \nMACKELWAY Where's the boy? \nO'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily. \nO'RYAN (re: the mirror) My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to watch yourself say something so heroic. I'm almost envious. (MORE) \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (casually) The boy's under the bed. In pieces. Are you afraid? \nMackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then looks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it... \nO'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) I know what you're thinking: \"There is pain coming. Am I going to take it like a man?\" Let me put you at ease: You won't. None of them do. Men, women, children. They all weep, they all beg. They pass out, they piss themselves. They attempt negotiation: You wouldn't believe how many men have lain right where you're lying right now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve. It's pathetic. Are you afraid? (of course, no reply) Then there's that moment when they realize there's nothing left to be negotiated. They're just mine. And they're helpless. And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender... well, it's almost pornographic. I put this mirror here because I don't want you to miss it. Are you afraid? \nWith that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful. \nBut Mackelway can't look at anything else. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) How about now? \nJust like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's face. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke rise from its edge. \nAnd Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it. \nHe struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound comes out of him. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Are you afraid? \nO'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife just under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is unbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you? \nTwo things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me to death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry... \nO'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch above Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Are you? \nMackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is awful. He stares at his own reflection. \n...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (top of his lungs) Are you afraid?! \nThat bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight - can't watch this anymore. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) (infuriated) Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit or I'll cut the fucking lids off!! \nMackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep sobs shudder through him, as... \nO'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm: O'RYAN (CONT'D) ARE YOU AFRAID?!?! \nMackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am terrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag. \nWith his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head forward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS, obliterating the image. \n...and everything goes black. \nThen, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless to beat them back: \n180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                              180a \nOut of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of the Navaho. \nNow everything clicks: O'Ryan was branding him. Initiating him with that red-hot knife. \nMackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. He splashes some water on his face, his mind still reeling. \nThen O'Ryan appears in the doorway. He too looks like hell - face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat... \nMackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, then places that DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink. Mackelway eyes it. \nThen O'Ryan stuns him... by laying Mackelway's GUN atop the drawing, without a word. \nMackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at O'Ryan's face, just inches away. \nWe're TIGHT on Mackelway's hand. It trembles with rage. \nBut O'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. In fact he smiles, utterly confident. Then: \nO'RYAN (re: gun) Soon. I promise... But not yet. \nHe eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. Then O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the front door. \nMackelway stands, rigid. He raises the gun. Maybe I'll just shoot this fucker in the back. \nThen those IMAGES come at us again, out of nowhere: \n184   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                          184 \nOut of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet wind, tall wheat, our own heavy BREATHING as we run... And that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the sound of O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling: \nO'RYAN (O.S.) Please... I'm begging you. \nThat was clear enough. A gun rises. We seem to be holding it... \nThen those images vanish, and we are jolted back to: \n185   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING                             185 \nMackelway tightens. O'Ryan's out the door. This VISION that keeps getting clearer and clearer... What the hell does this it mean? \nDown go two more Vicodens... \nCUT TO: \n186   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT                          186 \nA huge STORM devours scenery on both sides of us. O'Ryan drives. Mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face, still recovering from what happened in that room... \nSilence... Then: \nMACKELWAY Tell me about Icarus. \nO'RYAN Why? \nMACKELWAY Just... wanna know. \nO'Ryan eyes him. The sky is black. \nO'RYAN There were five of us. In the program. \nMackelway's all ears... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) We'd come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then you'd go to your room, with your pen and (MORE) \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) your pad of paper, always alone, and you'd try to lock in. Son of Sam. John Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be driving his car, or having a beer or brushing his teeth... or cutting someone's eyes out. \nThat was said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) If you did it right, you got all of it: The way it sounded. The way it smelled... Those people were looking up at you, begging you for mercy. It was like being God. (a beat) ...except you're not. Because you can't do a thing for them. Can't make it stop. You're just watching, helpless. \nHe pauses. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) They wired us into this current, the five of us: darkness, the pit itself. We were plugged right into it. But nobody taught us how to shut it off... (thinking back...) We were just men. And we saw things men shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil - and it never shut off. Even now, it's still there. \nMACKELWAY They all wind up like you? The other agents? \nO'RYAN No. They're dead now. \nOh. Mackelway doesn't reply... \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) They broke down. Then they opted out. (Mackelway's a blank) Killed themselves... After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became impossible. Ya see? \nMackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head- lights. Then: \nMACKELWAY I'm sorry. \nO'Ryan shrugs. He appreciates it. The windshield wipers beat back rain... \nCUT TO: \n187   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT                      187 \nO'Ryan continues to drive. Silence hangs. Then: \nO'RYAN We're here. \nMackelway sits up. O'Ryan pulls over at: \n188   EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING                   188 \nWe've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard. \nO'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift briefly to the drawing. \nMACKELWAY Drive. \nHe accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) (re: burn) Fuck! \nCuffs are unlocked now. O'Ryan starts up the Yukon. \n197   EXT. GREENVILLE STREETS - DRIVING - CONTINUING                    197 \nO'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig. Mackelway gets on his cel- phone, dials. Rain falls in SHEETS all around them. \nMACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE) (urgently) This is Mackelway! I'm travelling north on... Grove Road, approaching I-30 in Greenville. Request immediate back-up. Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated truck, Texas license plate Alpha-- \nThe Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path. Mackelway drops the phone. Grabs it again. \nMACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D) Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha. \nZero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the road, forcing O'Ryan to swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved on to a curb, then clunks down to the street again. \nThen Zero jams on the brakes. Mackelway's eyes go wide. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) (at O'Ryan) Brakes! \nO'Ryan jumps on the brakes. The Yukon screeches to a stop, throwing itself into a sideways slide. It bangs, passenger side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window. \nMackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig pulls away again. O'Ryan follows. \n198   THE CHASE - CONTINUING                                            198 \nZero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to the Interstate. Mackelway is locked in on that truck. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) (into cel-phone again) Travelling due west now. Don't see a name. It's a service road, running parallel to the-- \nThen Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He just saw something that made his jaw drop: \nOn the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT. \nTime seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed. Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen it before. \nAnd so has O'Ryan... \nMackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid... \nEverything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with O'Ryan. \nAnd O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. \"Please...\" \nO'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig. Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time. That shreds their front tire. \n...which means that in one minute this car is going to be undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that Interstate - now - Zero will be gone. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) (absently) What're you... \nO'RYAN Can't let him hit the Interstate. \nMackelway braces himself, as O'Ryan guns his car up the left side of the rig, shredded tire and all. Then: \nHe pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he jams on the brakes. \nZero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab, swatting the Yukon away like a fly. \nWe're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look like tinker toys. \nThe torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS. \nThe Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road, upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out the busted windshield. \nWhat he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig is lying flat on its side. \nAnd, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field... \n199   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING                                 199 \nThe rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But the passenger-side door pops open. And Zero pokes through it, his eyes immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT. Rain pours. \nMackelway's watching. O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry. \nZero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat field - vanishing. \nMackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels across the street. \nJust then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives. \nMACKELWAY (over his shoulder, running) Get the van open! He's got a kid in the van! \nSTATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car. Mackelway sprints into the tall wheat. \nO'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. Now he too disappears into that Wheat Field. \n200   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING                                     200 \nTall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea where he's going. \n...except he's been here before. He's seen it. And there is a feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting. \nHe's practically blind in here. Can't see five feet in front of him. Nothing but the sound of his own breathing. \nThat, too, was presaged. Those visions... \n201   EXT. ZERO'S TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING                              201 \n...and hands him the gun. Just like that. \nMackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground. \nO'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as: \nO'RYAN (at Mackelway) You have to understand: none of this was arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I. WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage. We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He drops to his knees, gasping. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) I saw us here. You did too. THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage have shattered. Breathing is almost impossible. \nMackelway tightens. His head just began to throb... \nMACKELWAY Okay. You made your point. \nO'RYAN Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point you would've shot him yourself by now! \nAnother swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's neck. He crumbles, face down. \nFuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right up against the back of O'Ryan's head. \nMACKELWAY Enough! \nThen, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles. \nSomething about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a relief. \nMACKELWAY (CONT'D) Drop it. \nO'RYAN Or what? \nMACKELWAY Just drop it. \nO'RYAN Would you shoot me? \nThat's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider. \nMACKELWAY Put it down. \nO'RYAN (calmly) I want you to think for a second. About your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed, like I am - except you keep running from it. (Mackelway's silent) You hear things. You see things. That's why you can't sleep, why your head always aches. \nHe turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between them. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) ...and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal. And then you're going to kill me. \nThat threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment - wheeling around... \nHe takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire- iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is dead. \nMackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur. \nO'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway. \nMackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees. \nBut O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready. \nMACKELWAY Get up. \nO'RYAN I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this already. For months now. \nMACKELWAY Get up. \nO'RYAN Every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain. And you... \nHe puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you to. \nMackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse: \nFRAN (O.S.) (aloud) Mack? \nShe's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan: \nO'RYAN I'm tired, Mack. \nFRAN (O.S.) Can you hear me? \nShe's 90 yards out now... \nO'RYAN Pull the trigger... (no reply) I'm not going to jail. Now pull the fucking trigger! \nMackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Fucking coward. \nO'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway. \nO'RYAN (CONT'D) Some things are not up to us to decide. They just exist. They're inevitable. This field. This rain. This moment. It has all already happened. You know that. You've seen it too. \nHe shoves Mackelway in the chest. \nFRAN (O.S.) Mack? \nShe's 70 yards out now... \nO'RYAN Shut it off for me. \nMACKELWAY I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan. \nO'RYAN Of course you will.

The lab is dark. He throws on every light switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER. \nSo he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work- stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it. Lining the walls are wide CABINETS. \nBut there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the \"stacks\" - perfect for hiding behind. \nHe plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out... \nHe walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching, nudging open cabinets. One has been opened: \nBottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it... \nIn the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it. Kneels down, looking into darkness... \nThen, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open... And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck. \n66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66 \nMackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside him on the other side of that cage.

He walks along the edge of Furnace #1... \n...and is assaulted, from above. \nO'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's gun skids across the floor. \nAnd his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze. \nHe wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting fuzzy. \nWe see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE? \nO'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control. \nThen O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of FOOTSTEPS. And we hear: \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Hey! You! What're you doing down here! \nWe turn, groggily. TWO JANITORS rush toward us, keys jangling. It's all foggy, wavy, distorted. \nWe see O'Ryan RISE.

The shock of pain from his chest stops him. \nFRAN How ya doin'? \nMackelway half-nods. His chest is bandaged. \nCHARLTON We're gonna need everything you can remember about this guy, Tom. Physical description, any kind of distinguishing characteristics. \nThat was terse. Charlton looks pretty pissed-off. \nMACKELWAY (scratchy) Where is he? \nCHARLTON The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked in on it. (before Mack can ask:) (MORE) \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) They're fine. But the description they gave of him wasn't worth a damn. \nMackelway nods. \nCHARLTON (CONT'D) Case you're curious the real Professor Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the country. We can't find him. (Mackelway nods) Whose idea was it to meet there? \nMACKELWAY His, Sir. \nCHARLTON Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone? \nMACKELWAY No, Sir. \nCHARLTON But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that it? \nThe truth? Charlton has him pegged. But: \nFRAN Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent Mackelway was acting under the assumption that I'd already checked the guy out. We're both to blame. \nHold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced. \nCharlton, however, seems unmoved... \nCHARLTON Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview unaccompanied? \nFRAN (reluctantly) Yes, Sir. \nCHARLTON Then whose fuck-up is it? \nMackelway eyes her: \"Thanks for trying.\" She nods. \n", "test1_true": "CHARLTON You wanna work alone, start your own agency. \nMackelway can do nothing but nod.

O'Ryan. \nOdd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this rousing music, or feel the power of this place. People in the next row are stomping their feet. Music soars. \nBut O'Ryan just drops his head, slowly... and begins to WEEP in the middle of this boisterous congregation. \nOutside, an 18-WHEEL TRUCK can be heard, rumbling by with great force.

Character. \nAnd candles. Lots of candles. They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway and Katie all over the walls. \nAn odd MUSIC fills the room, coming from a BOOM-BOX on the floor. It's a rhythmic Navajo CHANT, with Native-American drums providing the pulse. \nIt's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic... and it fits the intensity of the moment: Mackelway and Katie, coupling madly, their eyes locked. She's breathless. \nFirst time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that furnace room. A FAT BANDAGE covers a quarter of his chest. Dried blood can be seen beneath it. \nThere's an intensity in his eyes. The chanting, the candles, Katie's body, his wound... they've conspired to bring an intensity into his eyes. It's dark, primal. \nAnd he's been expressing it for an hour without relent... which is why Katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge of the bed, exhausted. \nShe reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume. The chanting dies down into silence. She catches her breath. \nKATIE (softly) I can't anymore. \nMackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the VOLUME on that boom-box back UP.

But Mackelway eyes it calmly. \nHe slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide... as Katie appears in the doorway. She eyes him. \nKATIE Can't sleep? \nHe shrugs, turns. \nMACKELWAY What was that music? \nKATIE It's Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I never played it for anybody before.

He wears a sleeveless down vest and a \"God Bless America\" cap. \nMackelway turns, but Vic's already past us. \nSomething about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk, the attitude. Something. \nSo Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast. Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched. \nMackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee. Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again. \nAnd sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig... \nBut this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly... all of this visible through the windshield. \nMackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit... \nVic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like he's saying \"Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!\" He might be little Charlie - we can't tell from here. \nBut we can see that Vic is yelling at him: \"Shut up!\" \nAnd we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated. He's hauling dairy products. \nOn a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as coincidence. He might not be so vigilant. \nThis isn't a normal day. He races for the door. \n169   EXT. TRUCK-STOP - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                    169 \nMackelway backs out in the Yukon, trying to keep a visual on Vic's truck. \nANOTHER 18-WHEELER pulls in front of him, blocking his view entirely. \nMACKELWAY Dammit! \nHe honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading for the exit of the lot. \nJust spotted Vic's rig again. \n170   EXT. ROAD/INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                     170 \nHe follows Vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road approaching I-30. But there are three cars between them - Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate. \nVic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between them. \nVic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail. \n", "test3_id": 3164}

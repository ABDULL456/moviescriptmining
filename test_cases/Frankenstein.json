{"test1_input": "VICTOR (quietly) It's a letter to my father. \nHenry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to Victor's table. \nVICTOR Professor Waldman. \nWALDMAN (takes a seat) Victor, explain yourself. \nVICTOR Krempe has a way of provoking my temper. \nWALDMAN You have a way of provoking his. (beat) I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies. \nVICTOR To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new. \nWALDMAN You disdain accepted wisdom? \nVICTOR No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known. \nHENRY (mutters to Waldman) Now you've got him started. \nVICTOR These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought \nHENRY ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before. \nVICTOR But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions. \nWALDMAN I understand your frustration. I was young once myself. (beat) Walk me home. Something I'd like to show you. \nINT - WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nThe gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to big windows where the light would be best during the day. Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, all quite excellent. \nThe rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of tables crammed with experiments and clutter. \nWALDMAN You know for thousands of years the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity? They say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth. \nThey arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle. \nWALDMAN Their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams. \nHe directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the wall. It depicts the human body from front and side angles. \nAcupuncture points are clearly marked. \nVICTOR Preposterous. \nWALDMAN I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous. (off their looks) I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since. \nHENRY It smacks of magic. \nWaldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries. \nWaldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe. \nWALDMAN Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it? \nWaldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm at the array of wires and batteries. \nWALDMAN Electricity. \nVICTOR It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this! \nWALDMAN Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom. \nVICTOR But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views! \nWALDMAN It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous. (off his look) Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go. (drapes the toad) What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies. \nVICTOR I doubt that decision is still mine to make. \nWALDMAN (waves) Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe... \nVictor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a stern gesture for silence. Listen. \nWALDMAN \"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty. \nVICTOR Why? \nWALDMAN (draws close) Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste. \nWaldman hands him the acupuncture needle. A gift. Victor studies it, fascinated. \nWALDMAN Go home, Victor. Write the letter, \nINT - LECTURE HALL - DAY \nDOLLYING VICTOR IN A SWW 360: He stands before the students and faculty, reading his apology. \n", "test1_true": "Up in the gallery, Krempe nods grudgingly to himself. \nINT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - DUSK \nExquisite silverware goes CLINKING SOFTLY onto polished wood as: \nELIZABETH (O.S.)

Elizabeth splits her attention between supervising and reading Victor's letter, while Justine busies herself with a flower arrangement. Willie gets underfoot.

(glances to Willie) Fellow...\" \nFATHER He always was opinionated. \nELIZABETH (reads on, laughs) He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab! \nWILLIE What's that? \nFATHER That's where they cut things open and peer about inside. \nWILLIE Things? What sort of things? \nFather is about to press on with the gory details, but Elizabeth freezes him with a glance. \nELIZABETH It's far too ghoulish for your young ears. \nThe old man throws Willie a look. We'll talk later. \nELIZABETH The point is, your brother is a brilliant student well on his way to becoming the finest-and most compassionate doctor ever... \nINT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nA DISSECTED DOG convulses through its electronically-induced paces. Kicking. Twitching. Tasting the air with its dead tongue. TILT UP to reveal Victor at the switch. \nWaldman leans close to observe. Softly: \nWALDMAN Re-configure the leads? \nVICTOR Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system? \nWaldman nods. \nWALDMAN Worth a try. \nINT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY \nWith Waldman at his side and Henry providing the tools as needed, Victor instructs a freshman class in the internal workings of a dissected corpse. Professor Krempe observes from a distance. \nVICTOR ...and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts I've already named... cerebrum and cerebellum. Any freshmen feeling queasy yet? (glances around, smiles) All of you, from the look of it. We'll resume your torture tomorrow. \nHe waves them dismissed. They laugh and exit, relieved. \nWaldman squeezes Victor's elbow. Well done. Victor stiffens at Krempe's approach. \nKREMPE You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum. \nVICTOR Despite the lack of challenge. \nKrempe reddens, but says nothing. He gives Waldman a curt nod and walks off. \nWALDMAN Victor. He was trying to be gracious. \nVICTOR The strain was evident. \nHENRY Come now, you must take some satisfaction. You've risen to the top of your class. A position of prominence and regard. \nVictor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles. \nVICTOR What keeps me going are my friends. \nHe throws his arm around Henry's neck, pulls him into an affectionate headlock. Henry struggles and laughs: \nHENRY Leave off! \nJEWELER'S SHOP - DAY \nVictor is gazing with reverence at a gorgeous oval locket dangled before him by a smiling JEWELER. He glances to Henry for an opinion. \nHENRY Your Elizabeth must be quite a treasure, Victor (pointedly to jeweler) ...to justify these prices. \nThe jeweler's smile goes frosty. \nWALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY \nTIGHT ANGLE ON the locket lying open against canvas, dangling from an easel frame. TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than three inches high within its penciled oval. \n", "test1_id": 1608, "test2_input": "MARIE Very good! Maggie. Try the next. \nNow the Creature beats Maggie to the punch: \nCREATURE Garrr...denn. Garden. \nTHOMAS Maria! Look! It's snowing! \nThe children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in the doorway: \nMARIE Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your death! \nGRANDFATHER Let them play. There's plenty of wood for the fire. \nFELIX (shoots her a look) He's right about that. \nBefore she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter. \nTHE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. Softly: \nCREATURE It's snnowwinng. \nEXT - HOUSE - DAY \nBright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder. \nEXT - WOODS - DAY \nTRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. Happy as a kid himself. \nMaggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree. \nMAGGIE That one! It's the most beautiful tree I've ever seen! \nFelix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping. \nINT - PIGSTY - NIGHT \nThe Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire \nCREATURE Most beautiful... tree... \nThe kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light. \nThe children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out into the darkness: \nMAGGIE Merry Christmas! \nThe door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering of a glowing angel and a message: \nCREATURE For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of the... Forr-rest. \nHe snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize. \nHe plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies. \nHe's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad. \nHe picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. Screw potatoes and turnips. \nEXT - HOUSE - MORNING \nThe children race out the door to find the plate empty. And a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard, \nINT - PIGSTY - NIGHT \nThe Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. Marie reads a book aloud: \nMARIE ...with particles of heavenly fire, the God of Nature did his soul inspire... and pliant still the ethereal energy which wise Prometheus tempered into paste... \nThe Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, and pulls out what's been there all along: \nVictor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head this way and that. Slowly: \nCREATURE Myyy Darrllnng Vic...tor... Willee haaad hisss burrth-dayyy. I wissh... yooo cuud huvv beeen... herre... to sharre ut... withh... ussss... \nEXT - GRANDFATHER'S POND - DAY \nGrandfather sits playing his recorder. Again, the Creature approaches to listen. Grandfather stops. Turns. \nGRANDFATHER I know you're there. (waits for a response) Won't you speak to me? \nThe Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal. \nCAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it... \nINT - PIGSTY - DAY \n", "test2_true": "CREATURE ...of sscience... and to c-create... a beinng... in the image of man... assembled ffrrom... the... dead bodieess I have... gatherrred... \nHe turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's Victor's sketch of his patchwork man. The rendering includes suture marks where the pieces were joined. \nThe Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too horrible to conceive... \n...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm... And the massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an exact match to the drawing. He throws his head back in an animalistic PRIMAL SCREAM, face twisted in a mask of utter horror, Munch's painting made flesh... \nIN THE WOODS \n...and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns from chopping wood. His family gathers, eyes wide, listening to the sound trail off. Softly: \nFELIX God in heaven. \nIN THE PIGSTY \nA massive hand rips the page from the journal, raises it in a clenched fist. \nANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature huddled in a corner, dropping his head into his arms to hide his face. Sunlight throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats. He sobs, wracked with despair as we \nFADE TO: \nEXT - VALLEY - DAY \nThe house is distant below. Felix and his family are heading out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow before them. Only Grandfather is missing. \nThe gentle MUSIC of the recorder drifts up from the house. \nANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill. Watching. Waiting. The family dwindles in the distance. \nINT - HOUSE - DAY \nFor the first time, we actually see the inside of the house from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall. \nGrandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder. \nThe Creature's face appears at a window. Peering in. He ducks from view, appearing at another window. Making sure the house is otherwise empty. He vanishes again. The door swings silently open. His figure fills the doorway. \nGrandfather stops playing. Silence. \nGRANDFATHER Would you like to sit by the fire? \nThe Creature enters. Sits. Holds his hands toward the embers, feeling the warmth. \nCREATURE Nice. \nGRANDFATHER The music? Or the fire? \nGrandfather offers him the recorder. The Creature hesitates, takes it, inept where such delicacy is required. He puts it to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones. He gives it back, huffing air, delighted. \nGRANDFATHER I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows. \nCREATURE Better that way... for me. \nGRANDFATHER Why? \nCREATURE I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you. \nGRANDFATHER (smiles) It can't be as bad as that. \nCREATURE (soft) Worse. \nThe old man-reaches for his face. The Creature draws back. \nGRANDFATHER I can see you with my hands. If you'll trust me. \nThe Creature decides to trust. He eases forward. Grandfather runs his fingers over his features. Gently: \nGRANDFATHER You're an outcast. \nCREATURE Yes. I have been seeking my friends. \nGRANDFATHER Friends? Do they live around here? \nCREATURE Yes. Very close \nGRANDFATHER Why do you not go to them? \nThe Creature pauses. Emotions swirling. Afraid to continue. \nCREATURE I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful \nGRANDFATHER (softly) People can be kinder than you think. \nCREATURE I am afraid. \nGrandfather reaches out and takes the Creature's hands. \n", "test2_id": 1609, "test3_input": "JUSTINE Get out! \nINT - COURTROOM - DAY \nThe courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older KITCHEN MAID is on the stand. \nKITCHEN MAID I found her sobbing her eyes out. Poor thing, I said, what's all this? And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor. How she'd always loved him, and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth. \nA MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a stunned glance. \nKITCHEN MAID She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent. How she wished it was hers. She swore me never to tell a soul. (peers at Justine) That was before the boy went missing, a'course. \nINT - COURTROOM - DAY \nVictor is on the stand: \nVICTOR I always viewed her with brotherly affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me. \nPROSECUTOR Rejection can be a powerful wound. People have been known to do uncanny things. \nVICTOR But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved? \nVictor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly: \nVICTOR It's hard to believe. \nINT - COURTROOM - DAY \nElizabeth is on the stand: \nELIZABETH Justine and I grew up as sisters. I know her better than anybody. \nDEFENDING COUNSEL Do you think it possible she committed this crime? \nELIZABETH William was as much her child as mine. We were both mother to him. (beat) I believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body. \nDEFENDING COUNSEL Then you consider the charge without merit. \nELIZABETH I consider the charge imbecilic. \nINT - COURT ROOM - DAY \nJustine is now on the stand: \nJUSTINE Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer. \nPROSECUTOR And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? (off her silence) Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein? \nHer gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, trapped. \nJUSTINE I have always loved him. \nPROSECUTOR Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion? \nJUSTINE Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind. \nPROSECUTOR So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this. (holds up the locket) The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted. (leans close) How did it come to be in your possession? \nJUSTINE I have no knowledge of that. \nEXT - FIELD - DAY \nA PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still twitching. \nEXT - SAME FIELD - NIGHT \nAnother eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor looms from the darkness, staring. \nAnd then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to- eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly: \nCREATURE Frankenstein. \nVictor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness. Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified. \nVICTOR Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO! \nScreaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking to his knees, weeping helplessly: \nVICTOR Oh God. Justine. Forgive me. \nINT - MANSION - STUDY - DAWN \nVictor pulls a carved box from a shelf. Opens it. Lying inside in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 Collier flintlock revolvers. \nMANSION - DAWN \nVictor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on a horse held by Claude.

Is there something between you? \nVICTOR I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass. \nVictor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off. TILT UP to the mountain. Shrouded in snow. Waiting. \nMONT BLANC - DAY \nA lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge... \nVictor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the glacier. A bitter wind blows... \nThey plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding before our eyes. Primeval and vast... \nThe horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him. \nThe figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair of revolvers. \nHe glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the rocks and crags. Searching. \nVICTOR WHERE ARE YOU? \nHe hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings. \nVictor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the achievement of actually having created life. \nHe pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. Still the Creature comes. \nVictor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking. \nFiring. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking... \n...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips over the edge of the precipice. \nVictor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a 30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him sliding across the ice with a mighty heave... \nINT - ICE CAVE - DAY \n...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to sprawl heavily to the cave floor. \nWinded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates. \nA huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as the Creature enters... \n...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers down. He tosses a few more sticks on the flames. Pause. \nCREATURE Come warm yourself if you like. \nVICTOR You speak. \nCREATURE Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. (pause) I've been waiting for you. Two months now. \nVICTOR How did you find me? \nThe Creature grabs Victor's journal off the \"shelf.\" He unwinds the thong, the letters spill out. \nCREATURE The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. (picks up a letter) Your Elizabeth sounds lovely. \nVICTOR Kill me and have done with it. \nCREATURE Kill you? Hardly that. \nVICTOR Then why am I here? What did you want with me? \nCREATURE More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me? (off Victor's look) What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice. (grabs a book, thumbs to a certain page) Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me? \nVICTOR Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother. \nCREATURE Your crime... as well as mine. \nVICTOR How dare you. You're disgusting and evil. \nCREATURE Evil? (scurries closer) Do you believe in evil? \nVICTOR I see it before me. \nCREATURE I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me.

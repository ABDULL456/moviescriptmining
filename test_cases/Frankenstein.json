{"train": "FRANKENSTEIN \nWritten by \nSteph Lady & Frank Darabont \nFrom the novel by \nMary W. Shelley \n2ND REVISED DRAFT \nFebruary 8, 1993 \nTITLES UNFOLD IN BLACKNESS as we are lulled by the distant flute-like sounds of a recorder. Overall the effect is mournful and haunting, elegant and serene... \n...and we CRASH TO: \nEXT - BARENTS SEA - NIGHT \n...a storm of inconceivable force and violence. Merciless arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells. \nThis is the last place in God's creation that any human being should be. And yet... \n...the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before us, looming from the darkness and chaos. it crashes upward through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- first into the trough. The sails on the forward mast are still deployed. It's insane; in this weather they should be stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3). \nHurtling toward us. Rising and falling. Thundering through the swells. And as she sweeps past CAMERA within a seeming hairbreadth, we PAN with the ship and find ourselves... \nEXT - SHIP - NIGHT \n...aboard the \"Alexander Nevsky,\" along for the ride whether we like it or not. There are men all around us, dark screaming FIGURES glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes flapping in the gale. A GROUP OF MEN are in a life-or-death tug of war \nWALTON PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL! \nRiiiiippp! All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing tatters. The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, trailing rope and fabric. The men dive aside as the jib smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. Splintered shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel. \nWalton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- down on the pitching deck. \nGRIGORI, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid. Walton shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. LIGHTNING throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, staining his teeth. He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact and straining against the wind. We hear a huge CRACK! \nThe base of the mast is starting to give. \nWALTON Cut the damn rigging free before we lose the mast! \nLong-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. Frantic men begin hacking at the ropes. Walton snatches an axe from a passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. He attacks a guy-rope with primal fury, CAMERA rising and falling with the motion of his axe. Suddenly, a chilling cry from high above: \nLOOKOUT (O.S.) IIIICEBEEEEERG! \nTHE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2) \nThe LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope knotted at the chest. He points ahead. \nWALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine field. \nAn iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us into darkness... \nEXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT \n...and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before them like a ghostly white mountain. Walton finds his voice: \nWALTON HARD TO PORT! \nTHE PILOT fights to turn the wheel. Men rush to his aid, throw their backs into it, straining to the limit. The wheel is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way. \nPUSH IN on Walton and the crew: \nGRIGORI It's going to ram us. \nWALTON It wouldn't dare. \nTHE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2) \nThe lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands. Face white with terror. Breath coming in ragged gasps. \nSHIP'S POV \nCrashing through the swells. Rising and falling. Tilting the world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming.  For a brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge... \n...and smack the ice. \nVARIOUS QUICK-CUT ANGLES \nGod just hit the ship with an anvil. Mast #1 snaps at the base with a thunderous CRACK and begins to topple in a symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging... \nThe lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below... \nAnd is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around his chest, We hear another horrible CRACK... the sound of his back breaking... \nYOUNG SAILOR Is it breaking up? \nOLD SAILOR Just dancing on the current. It'll freeze even tighter come next wind. \nCAMERA DRIFTS past to another group: \nSAILOR #4 It was a polar bear. That's what I say. \nSAILOR #5 Say all you want, but you weren't there. It left human tracks. \nSAILOR #6 No man could tear those dogs apart. \nSAILOR #5 No human. We've roused a demon from the ice. \nCLANG-CLANG! The men spin. A SAILOR on starboard has rung the signal bell. The men race over, crowding the gunwale. \nSAILOR Something. In the mist. \nWalton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, rifle aimed at the sky. The men wait. Holding their breath. Scanning the darkness. \nAN APPARITION looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side and lolling slowly with the motion of the current. \nYOUNG SAILOR It's the demon! Shoot while you've a chance! \nThe Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box spotlight and swings it around. The beam seeks out the specter and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around him. \nEXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT \nThe men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised. \nGrappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged. Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer. Men clasp arms, forming a human chain. Grigori is the first to reach the motionless figure on the dog sled. \nWALTON Dead? \nGrigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the furred hood to search the neck for a pulse... \n...and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN. \nEXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - NIGHT \nA HOWLING WIND has kicked up, pelting the huddled sentries with sleet. CAMERA TRACKS past, moving steadily toward the dimly-glowing window of Walton's cabin... \nINT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT \n...where we find Walton and Grigori in tense discussion: \nGRIGORI Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance. \nWALTON They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now. \nGRIGORI Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny. \nWalton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on the table before him. \nWALTON (low, tight) Let them try. \nGrigori is taken aback. He hears a shifting of blankets and glances to the captain's bed. Walton follows his look. \nFrankenstein has awakened and is watching them. \nGrigori exits, uneasy under Frankenstein's gaze. Walton rises, retrieves a pot from the stove. \nWALTON You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you. \nVICTOR (hoarse, faltering) I'm... dying. \nVictor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before his face. Fingers skeletal and black. \nVICTOR Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis. \nWALTON Are you a physician? \nVICTOR (faint smile) How is it you come to be here? \nWALTON There's a startling question, coming from you. (beat) I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole. \nVICTOR Ah. An explorer. \nWALTON Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment. \nVICTOR I heard. \nWALTON I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature. \nVICTOR Creature? A... human like creature? \nWALTON (stunned) You know of it? \nELIZABETH Are you sure it can't hurt us? \nVICTOR Nothing can. Not ever. \nShe seeks his hand. Fingers clasp. Comfort and strength. \nTILT UP to the skylight. Rain drumming the glass... \nINT - MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nVictor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements stiff and awkward, childlike. MRS. MORITZ is at the harpsichord. Justine sits with her dolly, watching. \nMRS. MORITZ You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong... \nVICTOR Mrs. Moritz. \nMRS. MORITZ ...aaand, one-two-three, one-two- three, twirl-two-three... \nJUSTINE Mama, can I dance with Victor? \nMRS. MORITZ Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a sweeping arc about the room! one- two-three, twirl-two-three. \nVictor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast room, tripping on each other's toes. They pass within inches of CAMERA, bodies WIPING FRAME... \nINT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY (TEN YEARS LATER) \n...and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons. \nMRS. MORITZ ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... Excellent! You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen! \nThey're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws her a look of reproval: \nMRS. MORITZ Justine. Surely you can maintain better time than that. \nJUSTINE Yes, Mama. \nFlustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about the room, their attention only on each other. \nINT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nA skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension. \nWaiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying to reassure him. \nELIZABETH She'll be all right. \nAnother SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably blocked by Mrs. Moritz. \nMRS. MORITZ You can do nothing here. Wait downstairs. \nHe can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her. \nVICTOR Mother? \nFATHER Victor, do as you're told! \nJustine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror... \nINT - PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \n...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth... \nEXT - MANSION - NIGHT \n...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain. \nINT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT \nVICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth appears at his side. He doesn't look at her. \nVICTOR As a boy, I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree. \nb.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue. \nVICTOR Father? \nA FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red. \nELIZABETH Oh God. The blood. \nFather sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth race up the stairs and pause before him. \nFATHER I did everything I could. \nVictor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry. \nFather gathers them into his arms. \nThe music ends amidst applause. The men bow to the ladies, the ladies curtsy in return. Victor escorts Elizabeth off the dance floor. Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy. \nJUSTINE You dance so beautifully together. \nELIZABETH And you look so lovely. \nThey share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. The orchestra recommences. The music is lush. Justine looks hopefully to Victor, keeping her tone light: \nJUSTINE Victor? Spare me one dance? \nElizabeth catches Victor's eye. \nELIZABETH Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite out of breath. \nVictor gallantly offers his arm. Justine takes it, lighting up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ... \n...and they begin to dance. She's glowing. This is a big moment for her. But they've hardly begun, when... \n...ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne glass with a knife. The dancers stop. The orchestra falls silent. Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass among the guests with glasses of champagne. \nFATHER My friends, fatherly pride won't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast. \nShouts of assent. Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands. \nFATHER To Victor. My son. Who read every medical book in my library by age thirteen... and then re-read them, which seemed excessive even to me. (the guests ROAR with laughter) Drape yourself in glory, my boy. Study well.  When you return, you return a man of medicine. I will then be honored to call you \"colleague.\" \nVICTOR But never your equal. \nFATHER No. You'll surpass me. \nApplause and roars of approval. The drinks are tossed back. \nVictor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes. \nEXT - MANSION - NIGHT \nMusic and warm light spill from the windows. A COUPLE eases through a French door and come racing across the lawn, giggling and hushing each other. They take refuge under a tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and Elizabeth. She leans against the trunk to catch her breath. \nELIZABETH Smell the air. Wonderful. \nVICTOR Quite a send-off, isn't it? \nELIZABETH Father's so proud. \nVICTOR And you? \nELIZABETH Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there. \nVICTOR I'll have to do better than that. \nELIZABETH You will. (searches his eyes) What do you want, Victor? \nVICTOR To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear... \nHe's so serious, she can't help laugh. \nVICTOR I'm not mad. \nShe smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead. \nELIZABETH No. Just very earnest. And very dear. \nAn extended moment. Unspoken words flowing between them. \nVictor leans forward and kisses her. Her eyes widen slightly. So do his. Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. He whispers: \nVICTOR I've loved you all my life \nELIZABETH All my life I've known. \nThey kiss again. A breath. A shiver. \nVICTOR This feels... incestuous. \nELIZABETH Is that what makes it so delicious? \nShe brushes her lips against his. Gentle as a sigh. \nELIZABETH Brother and sister still? \nVICTOR I wish to be your husband. \nELIZABETH I wish to be your wife. \nVICTOR Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now. \nELIZABETH If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate? \nVICTOR (quietly) It's a letter to my father. \nHenry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to Victor's table. \nVICTOR Professor Waldman. \nWALDMAN (takes a seat) Victor, explain yourself. \nVICTOR Krempe has a way of provoking my temper. \nWALDMAN You have a way of provoking his. (beat) I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies. \nVICTOR To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new. \nWALDMAN You disdain accepted wisdom? \nVICTOR No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known. \nHENRY (mutters to Waldman) Now you've got him started. \nVICTOR These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought \nHENRY ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before. \nVICTOR But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions. \nWALDMAN I understand your frustration. I was young once myself. (beat) Walk me home. Something I'd like to show you. \nINT - WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nThe gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to big windows where the light would be best during the day. Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, all quite excellent. \nThe rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of tables crammed with experiments and clutter. \nWALDMAN You know for thousands of years the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity? They say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth. \nThey arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle. \nWALDMAN Their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams. \nHe directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the wall. It depicts the human body from front and side angles. \nAcupuncture points are clearly marked. \nVICTOR Preposterous. \nWALDMAN I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous. (off their looks) I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since. \nHENRY It smacks of magic. \nWaldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries. \nWaldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe. \nWALDMAN Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it? \nWaldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm at the array of wires and batteries. \nWALDMAN Electricity. \nVICTOR It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this! \nWALDMAN Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom. \nVICTOR But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views! \nWALDMAN It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous. (off his look) Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go. (drapes the toad) What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies. \nVICTOR I doubt that decision is still mine to make. \nWALDMAN (waves) Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe... \nVictor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a stern gesture for silence. Listen. \nWALDMAN \"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty. \nVICTOR Why? \nWALDMAN (draws close) Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste. \nWaldman hands him the acupuncture needle. A gift. Victor studies it, fascinated. \nWALDMAN Go home, Victor. Write the letter, \nINT - LECTURE HALL - DAY \nDOLLYING VICTOR IN A SWW 360: He stands before the students and faculty, reading his apology. \nWaldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently for the portrait, suffused with daylight. \nHenry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly hates people looking over his shoulder. \nHENRY (deadpan) Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth? \nWaldman heaves a long-suffering sigh. He abruptly jabs his brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint. Dignity upheld he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs. \nINT - WALDMAN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nVictor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's company. Cigars are lit, wine is flowing. Conversation is fast and loose, intense and passionate: \nWALDMAN I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of. \nHENRY You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated? \nWALDMAN I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets. \nHENRY (turning serious) Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes? \nWALDMAN No. But someday. \nHENRY Thank goodness. We'd be out of work. \nA HOWL OF OUTRAGE AND LAUGHTER. Victor flings his napkin in Henry's face. \nVICTOR Only you would think of that! \nHENRY (laughing) Somebody has to! \nVictor raises his wine glass. The others join. A toast. \nVICTOR I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself. \nWALDMAN (laughter) Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor. \nHENRY (raises his glass) And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein. \nVICTOR (grins) Nothing in moderation, Clerval. \nINT - POOR HOUSE - DAY \nCAMERA, TRACKS the gritty reality of a big-city poor house, crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, wailing babies, stampeding children. Absolutely jangling with noise and confusion... loud and stifling... people getting eye-ear-nose-throat exams... being vaccinated... \nThe \"doctors\" in attendance are all Ingolstadt STUDENTS performing community service, none of whom look like they're enjoying it. Schiller looks particularly harried. We find Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations. They keep glancing over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified about getting his vaccination: \nMAN Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox in it, I hear tell! \nFAT WOMAN Pox? They givin' us pox? \nRipples of panic spread. Waldman is as tense and clipped as we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue: \nWALDMAN No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine... \nFAT WOMAN Vaca-what? \nWALDMAN ...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow (glances at her girth) ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox... \nMAN I told you there was pox in it! \nWALDMAN ...no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity, perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is the point of this whole bloody exercise... \nVictor and Henry are pausing work. Concerned. Drifting closer. The ferret-faced man is cornered. \nMAN You doctors kill people! I don' care what you say, you ain't stickin' it in me! \nWALDMAN I most assuredly am! It prevents disease and it's the law! Why am I explaining myself? Somebody restrain this damn fool! \nIt happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry. Victor looks after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. Puzzled. It still hasn't really dawned. \nWaldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed to his sternum, lips tight. He looks more annoyed than anything else. He exhales slowly. \nHENRY Professor? \nWALDMAN (softly) Oh God. \nThat's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls to the floor. People are pushing and crowding to see. \nEXT - POOR HOUSE - DAY \nA cobblestoned street-scene. Carriage. A delivery wagon. Vendors. Pedestrians. The doors of the poor house burst open, releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for help... \nINT - UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - DAY \nKrempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket. The chapel is full. Victor is seated near the back. Dazed. Henry comes up the aisle and slides in next to him. Victor doesn't even glance over. Henry whispers: \nHENRY They just caught the man who did it. \nWe find Victor standing over the corpse. Gaunt and hollow- eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are swarming in the flesh. He abruptly raises a cleaver and WHACKS it off at the elbow. \nINT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT \nTRACKING SLOWLY past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis. Dead tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a slow-burning flame. Victor smears a glass slide, places it under a microscope. \nINT - GASTHOF - DAY \nVictor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. Henry is across from him: \nHENRY Victor. This has got to stop. (Victor glances up) Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class. \nVICTOR I've been preoccupied. \nHENRY We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life. \nVICTOR That is my concern. (faint smile) I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory. \nHENRY How much longer? \nVICTOR Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now. \nEXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nThe wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open. \nCAMERA PUSHES through to find Victor standing inside over a stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands. He's nervous, working up his courage: \nVICTOR Materials. That's all they are Tissue to be re-used. \nHe pries off the stone lid. It THUMPS heavily to the floor, cracking in half. He opens the casket, reaches in, raises the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it. \nEXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT \nStone monuments. Bare trees. Ivy-covered ground. Victor shoulder-deep in a grave. Shoveling. A lamp burns low. \nCOFFIN - NIGHT \nPitch black. The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high. \nVICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT \nTRACKING ALONG the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional head staring through the glass, dead cats... \n...and we find Victor working into the wee hours. Hunched over his specimens. Candle flame flickering low. Referring back to Waldman's notes. Making notations in arcane books such as \"De Occulta Philosophia,\" by Agrippa, and \"Le Sciences et les arts D'alchimiste,\" by Paracelsus. \nFRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY \nA magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue sky. TILT DOWN to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion distant. A steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth regards a stack of mail. \nELIZABETH Nothing. Still nothing. \nJUSTINE It's been months. It's not like him. \nELIZABETH Something's wrong. I know it. (off her look) I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg. \nJUSTINE So have I \nELIZABETH I should go. I should leave today. \nJUSTINE Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt. (beat) Besides, they're only rumors. \nELIZABETH (beat, nods) And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor. \nJUSTINE Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease. \nElizabeth gives her a hug. They walk toward the mansion \nINT - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY \nMurky and dark. Bellows are pumping. Showers of sparks cascade. The BLACKSMITH and his ASSISTANT are pounding a metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet into shape. Victor enters. The blacksmith directs his attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the wall. Victor runs his hand over the surface. Nice. \nINT - MATERNITY WARD - CHARITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nA WOMAN lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. One of the ASSISTANTS snatches it up, scurries around the corner. Victor is waiting in the shadows. Money changes hands. \nINT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT \nVictor is examining the amniotic fluid. Boiling it off. Working to synthesize it. \nINT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT \nVictor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be a large copper vat. He dips his hand in, examines the consistency and smell. ANGLE WIDENS, spinning slowly up to reveal that the vat is human in shape. A sarcophagus. \nEXT - ALLEY - NIGHT \nWe find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. A PAIR OF MEN lurk in the shadows, waiting. \nHenry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned at the human suffering around him as we \nFADE TO: \nINT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT \nVictor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal: \nVICTOR Time running out. Rate of decay accelerating. Must strike now... or start again from scratch. \nHe gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped with glittering needles big enough to knit with. \nVictor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing identical marks on the body before him... \nNow he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage... \nNow he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners of the steel grate... \nNow he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, wires and all... \nHIGH WIDE ANGLE \n...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. \nFrankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all unlike the Da Vinci... \nAnd he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and sinister shadows... \n...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape. \nFaster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster. \nThe frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear: \nFrankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble. \nFrankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes checking on his creation drifting in the murk. \nFrankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge. \nFrankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle. \nOver it goes. WHAM! Overdrive. \nThe body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking. \nFrankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam wrenched out like a Polaroid plate. \nHe reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm... \nEEL POV (IN THE TUBE) \n...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges. \nFrankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child. \nVICTOR (muffled through the glass) Live, you bastard! \nA huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing and spasming against the glass. \nFRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence \nINSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS \n...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off. \nFRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing. \nIt was all for nothing... \nINSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS \n...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid. \nFRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another. \nWe see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation. \nTriumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper: \nVICTOR It's alive. It's alive. \nAnd then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope to hoist the lid away... \n...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying. \nSilence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity passes in the space of a heartbeat. \nThe Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING. \nVOICE (O.S.) Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out your deeeaaad! \nA death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, DRIVER ringing his bell. It makes no sense to the Creature, but it's a sign of human life. He presses on... \nEXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY \n...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little attention. \nThe Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing. \nIt's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more. \nWOMAN (O.S.) Here! What do you think you're doing? \nThe Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him. \nMouth gaping. Too stunned to scream. \nThe Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: he curls his lips back and snarls. \nHe's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away... \n...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright... \nROUGH MAN Stupid bastard! \n...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified faces on all sides... \nHe's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague! \n...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, whimpering for them to stop. \nVENDOR'S WIFE BURN HIM! BURN HIM! \nThe Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat. \nThe Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, hurling rocks and sticks. \nEXT - STREETS/ALLEYS - DAY \nThe Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. They'll be here any second. \nHe sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT - STREET - DAY \nElsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks. \nWORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder: \nWORKER #1 Over here! \nWORKER #2 hurries over. Stares down. Eyes also widening. \nWORKER #2 Oh my God. \nWorker #1 rips his mask away. It's Henry. He leans down and grabs Victor, trying to rouse him. \nHENRY Victor! \nWorker #2 also sweeps his mask aside. Professor Krempe. \nKREMPE Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! Lift on three! One, two, three! \nThey hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and carry him into the street. Victor rouses, feels himself being carried. He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with heaps of reeking dead. Staring. Waiting. \nVICTOR (delirious, struggling) No... no... I'm not dead... please... Don't put me on the cart! I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD! \nANGLE WIDENS UP as they carry him kicking and screaming past the death cart and on across the square... \nWIPE TO: \nEXT - MASS CEMETERY - DAY \nA death cart rattles past, bearing its load. PAN WITH IT to reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is drifting like black snow.  BODIES  are dumped into a slit- trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking. \nOne of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, loose soil crumbling under his fingertips... \nON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH \n...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes spinning over his head into the trench. \nWA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, running from this ghastly place of flames and death... \nHENRY We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside. \nVICTOR (deeply moved) Everything in moderation, Clerval. \nHENRY Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein. \nVictor takes Henry's hand. Squeezes it. \nHENRY It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there. \nVICTOR (thinking of his creation) No. They don't. \nHENRY Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here? \nVictor pauses, too emotional to respond. Softly: \nVICTOR I want to go home. \nBeat. \nHenry accepts this, though he doesn't like it. \nHENRY It'll be months before you're well enough. Meantime, your family must be frantic not hearing from you. \nHenry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand. \nHENRY I found these. Some of the postmarks go back nine months. (slaps them on the bed) Why don't you open them? And when you've the strength, have the decency to ease their minds with a reply. Soon as the city ends quarantine, I'll even mail it for you. Along with this. (raises the locket) It's a beautiful gift. Does her no good lying here. \nHenry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt. Victor is swept with emotion and remorse. He closes his eyes. Softly: \nVICTOR It can't survive. \nINT - PIGSTY - DAY \nThe Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. He rouses, scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. Felix is returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his back. The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie. A pathetic array of potatoes and turnips. \nFELIX Not much to look at. Even less to eat. I don't how we're going to get through the winter with this yield. \nMARIE We'll sell another pig at market. \nFELIX One less for us. \nMARIE We'll make do. We always have. \nHe sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. She moves to comfort him, cradling his head to her breast. He returns her embrace, drawing strength. A tender, gentle moment. The Creature watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes. \nFELIX I'll see if I can scratch a few more out of the ground. \nHe hoists the basket and exits. The Creature turns to watch Felix trudging back toward the fields. \nEXT - FIELD - DAY \nFelix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes. Back-breaking work. Thomas provides what help he can. Some distance away, Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal the Creature watching from the brambles... \nINT - PIGSTY - NIGHT \nThe Creature watches the family eat their dinner. Potatoes and turnips. A glimmer of understanding in his eyes. \nEXT - HOUSE - NIGHT \nA long shadow looms toward the dwelling... circling the house... approaching the shed. Baskets and tools... \nEXT - FIELDS - NIGHT \nWe find the Creature working by the light of a refulgent moon, hacking away at the soil, tilling the earth... \nINT - PIGSTY - DAWN \nThe Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house. He scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out. All the baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before the door. \nThe door opens. Felix steps out and trips on a basket, sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips. He sits up, gazing in wonder. \nINT - PIGSTY - NIGHT \nA sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall. \nThe Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato. \nA pig comes snuffling at his elbow. He shoves him away. Go find your own. Inside, the family is enjoying a much more generous meal than the last one: \nGRANDFATHER I wish we could thank our benefactor. \nFELIX Nothing in this life comes free of cost. I'd like to know who and why. \nMAGGIE It's the Good Spirit of the forest. \nFELIX Who's been filling your head? \nMARIE Very good! Maggie. Try the next. \nNow the Creature beats Maggie to the punch: \nCREATURE Garrr...denn. Garden. \nTHOMAS Maria! Look! It's snowing! \nThe children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in the doorway: \nMARIE Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your death! \nGRANDFATHER Let them play. There's plenty of wood for the fire. \nFELIX (shoots her a look) He's right about that. \nBefore she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter. \nTHE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. Softly: \nCREATURE It's snnowwinng. \nEXT - HOUSE - DAY \nBright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder. \nEXT - WOODS - DAY \nTRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. Happy as a kid himself. \nMaggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree. \nMAGGIE That one! It's the most beautiful tree I've ever seen! \nFelix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping. \nINT - PIGSTY - NIGHT \nThe Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire \nCREATURE Most beautiful... tree... \nThe kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light. \nThe children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out into the darkness: \nMAGGIE Merry Christmas! \nThe door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering of a glowing angel and a message: \nCREATURE For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of the... Forr-rest. \nHe snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize. \nHe plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies. \nHe's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad. \nHe picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. Screw potatoes and turnips. \nEXT - HOUSE - MORNING \nThe children race out the door to find the plate empty. And a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard, \nINT - PIGSTY - NIGHT \nThe Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. Marie reads a book aloud: \nMARIE ...with particles of heavenly fire, the God of Nature did his soul inspire... and pliant still the ethereal energy which wise Prometheus tempered into paste... \nThe Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, and pulls out what's been there all along: \nVictor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head this way and that. Slowly: \nCREATURE Myyy Darrllnng Vic...tor... Willee haaad hisss burrth-dayyy. I wissh... yooo cuud huvv beeen... herre... to sharre ut... withh... ussss... \nEXT - GRANDFATHER'S POND - DAY \nGrandfather sits playing his recorder. Again, the Creature approaches to listen. Grandfather stops. Turns. \nGRANDFATHER I know you're there. (waits for a response) Won't you speak to me? \nThe Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal. \nCAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it... \nINT - PIGSTY - DAY \nHe pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds further and further into the woods... \nEXT - POND - LATE DAY \n...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly- pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar WALTZ/LOVE THEME.) \nWillie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't noticed him... \n...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet: \nCREATURE Wait! Don't be afraid! \nThe boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket. \nAt the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does have reason to be afraid. \nThe Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, teeth grinding in greater and greater rage. Eyes wild. \nTHEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush. The terrified boy. The pursuing monster. Faster and faster... \nINT - FRANKENSTEIN KITCHEN - DUSK \nWhirling with activity. Mrs. Moritz supervises the staff. \nElizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations. \nJustine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen staff. Carrots go flying. \nMRS. MORITZ Justine! Pay attention! \nJUSTINE (tight) Yes, Mother. \nELIZABETH (pulls her aside) Are you all right? \nJUSTINE (even tighter) Fine. \nJustine sees genuine concern. She softens: \nJUSTINE I'll be all right. Really. \nFather enters with Claude. Both men worried. \nFATHER Have you seen Willie? \nELIZABETH Is he not back yet? \nFATHER Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived. \nELIZABETH It's far too late for him to still be out. \nEXT - MANSION - DUSK \nElizabeth exits with the others \nCLAUDE Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find him. \nHe rushes to gather the men. Elizabeth gazes off. Wind kicking up. Night approaching. Almost too dark to see. \nEXT - COUNTRYSIDE/WOODS - NIGHT \nA massive search in progress. People are scouring the fields on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name. Elizabeth enters frame, calling out: \nELIZABETH WILLIE! \nLIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching. \nEXT - WOODED AREA - NIGHT \nThe stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern held high... \nJUSTINE WILLIE! \n...and one of the \"tree trunks\" turns out not to be. It darts abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, Justine enters the woods. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING sends shadows skittering among the trees... \nEXT - ROAD TO MANSION - NIGHT \n...And the storm is now a raging downpour, TILT DOWN to reveal a coach clattering through the rain. \nINT - COACH - NIGHT \nVictor is peering out the window flap. \nVICTOR There! Look! \nHenry cranes to look. A LIGHTNING FLASH stutters the mansion briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road, \nHENRY Quite a place. \nJUSTINE Get out! \nINT - COURTROOM - DAY \nThe courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older KITCHEN MAID is on the stand. \nKITCHEN MAID I found her sobbing her eyes out. Poor thing, I said, what's all this? And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor. How she'd always loved him, and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth. \nA MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a stunned glance. \nKITCHEN MAID She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent. How she wished it was hers. She swore me never to tell a soul. (peers at Justine) That was before the boy went missing, a'course. \nINT - COURTROOM - DAY \nVictor is on the stand: \nVICTOR I always viewed her with brotherly affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me. \nPROSECUTOR Rejection can be a powerful wound. People have been known to do uncanny things. \nVICTOR But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved? \nVictor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly: \nVICTOR It's hard to believe. \nINT - COURTROOM - DAY \nElizabeth is on the stand: \nELIZABETH Justine and I grew up as sisters. I know her better than anybody. \nDEFENDING COUNSEL Do you think it possible she committed this crime? \nELIZABETH William was as much her child as mine. We were both mother to him. (beat) I believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body. \nDEFENDING COUNSEL Then you consider the charge without merit. \nELIZABETH I consider the charge imbecilic. \nINT - COURT ROOM - DAY \nJustine is now on the stand: \nJUSTINE Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer. \nPROSECUTOR And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? (off her silence) Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein? \nHer gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, trapped. \nJUSTINE I have always loved him. \nPROSECUTOR Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion? \nJUSTINE Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind. \nPROSECUTOR So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this. (holds up the locket) The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted. (leans close) How did it come to be in your possession? \nJUSTINE I have no knowledge of that. \nEXT - FIELD - DAY \nA PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still twitching. \nEXT - SAME FIELD - NIGHT \nAnother eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor looms from the darkness, staring. \nAnd then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to- eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly: \nCREATURE Frankenstein. \nVictor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness. Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified. \nVICTOR Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO! \nScreaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking to his knees, weeping helplessly: \nVICTOR Oh God. Justine. Forgive me. \nINT - MANSION - STUDY - DAWN \nVictor pulls a carved box from a shelf. Opens it. Lying inside in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 Collier flintlock revolvers. \nMANSION - DAWN \nVictor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on a horse held by Claude. Elizabeth is at his heels. \nHe draws closer still. Intimate. Turning his head this way and that. Puzzling at Victor's face. Softly: \nCREATURE Were the dying cries of your brother music in my ears? \nHe raises his hand before Victor's eyes, bony fingers curling to clutch an invisible throat. Victor is petrified \nCREATURE I took him by the throat with one hand... lifted him off the ground. And slowly crushed his neck. (emotion growing) That poor, innocent child died in my grip... because all I could see was your face... and all I could feel was my rage. And when I let him go, he fluttered to the grass like a sparrow... \nFLASHBACK INSERT: FIELD \nThe Creature gazes down at Willie's body. He stares at the hand that committed the crime as if waking from a dream. \nTears welling. Overcome with shame and horror. \nHe falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy. \nRESUME ICE CAVE \nVictor stares in horror as the Creature relates his story with tears shining in his monstrous eyes. \nCREATURE Later, when they were searching, I followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods... \nFLASHBACK INSERT: - BARN \nJustine is asleep in the hay. Haggard, wet, exhausted. The Creature looms over her, a monstrous shape backlit by the lightning, gazing on her beauty. His hand reaches down, hovering reverently, wishing to caress the swell of her breasts at the neckline of her bodice ... \nCREATURE (V.O.) She was so lovely. I longed to touch her... and seek her sympathy... \nThe locket drops from his hand to dangle in his fingers. He lowers it, tucking it gently away in her pocket \nCREATURE (V.O.) ...but I simply returned the object which had triggered my crime, hoping in some small way to atone... \nRESUME ICE CAVE \nNow tears are shining in victor's eyes as well. \nCREATURE You gave me these emotions, but you didn't tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead. Because of us. \nVictor is crushed by remorse. A sob escapes him. \nCREATURE Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking? \nVICTOR There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand. \nCREATURE What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? (spreads his hands) Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people? \nVICTOR Materials. Nothing more. \nCREATURE You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this? \nHe grabs up the recorder, plays a brief snatch of melody. \nCREATURE In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? (beat) And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered. \nVICTOR Trace memories in the brain, perhaps. \nCREATURE Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? (soft, intense) Who am I? \nVICTOR (hollow) I don't know. \nCREATURE Then perhaps I believe in evil after all. \nThe Creature moves off. Victor is emotionally exhausted \nVICTOR What can I do? \nCREATURE There is something I want. (pause) A friend. \nVICTOR Friend? \nCREATURE A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me. \nVICTOR Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking. \nCREATURE I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. (beat) I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours. (off his look) You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein. \nVICTOR And if I consent? \nCREATURE We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together. (beat) No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow. \nPUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Considering it. Beaten. \nEXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - NEXT MORNING \nVictor is calming his skittish horse as the Creature looms into view. Victor turns. The Creature tosses Victor his journal. Victor hesitates, jams it into his saddlebag. \nCREATURE Soon? \nINT - COFFIN - NIGHT \n...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss. \nEXT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT \nThe Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature enters with his prize... \nINT - ATTIC - NIGHT \n...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the table before us. \nTILT UP TO: \nCREATURE I want her. \nVictor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes. \nKnowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's dead. He can barely get the words out: \nVICTOR Why... her? \nCREATURE Her body pleases me. \nThat's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's all he can do to keep from throwing up. \nCREATURE Materials, remember? Nothing more. Your words. \nVictor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly: \nVICTOR My words. \nHe turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, probing the back of the neck with his fingers. \nVICTOR The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. We'll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. They'll have to be replaced. The fresher the better. \nEXT - ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT \nOutside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best saucy smile: \nPROSTITUTE Want some yourself? Or just like to watch? (draws close) What do you say, lover? I can make it good for you. \nThe Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in his palm. Softly: \nCREATURE I know you can. \nAnd he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine. \nINT - ATTIC - NIGHT \nThe dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror. \nVICTOR What is this? \nCREATURE A brain. Extremities. \nVICTOR This was not taken from a grave. \nCREATURE What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her. \nVICTOR No. I draw the line. \nThe Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table. \nCREATURE You will honor your promise to me! \nVICTOR (through gritted teeth) I will not! Kill me now! \nCREATURE That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours. \nThe Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night. \nVictor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead prostitute. The full horror sinking in. \nINT - ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING \nVictor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive padlock. He hurries down the steps. \nINT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nVictor and Elizabeth, intensity flying: \nVICTOR No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today. \nELIZABETH Why the change? What about your work? \nVICTOR It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes? \nINT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT \nVictor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles. \nElizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted through the sheer white nightgown. \nELIZABETH You're soaking. \nShe approaches, peels off his coat. Victor stares at her, awe-struck. She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms demurely... then laughs at her own modesty. \nELIZABETH Brother and sister no more. \nVICTOR Now husband and wife. \nHe strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips. \nVICTOR I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then. \nELIZABETH (a whisper) I have been waiting for this ever since. \nShe leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable... \n...kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, CAMERA DRIFTING around them in slow circles, candles spinning like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now onto the bed. Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining... \nElizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up the nightgown, making her shudder with desire... \n...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING. \nHe rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed and ready on the nightstand. \nELIZABETH Victor! \nVICTOR Open this door for no-one! \nEXT - CHALET - NIGHT \nVictor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his pistols. The men converge, shouting in the rain: \nGUARD #2 I saw him in a flash of lightning! He vanished toward the lake! \nCLAUDE Get after him! \nSeveral men race off in pursuit. TILT UP from Victor and Claude... as a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the Creature clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent smile. He scurries  silently up, further and further into the tree... closer and closer to the balcony. \nINT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT \nElizabeth. Tense and waiting. A shadow looms across the balcony... spilling through the French doors... onto the floor... a bony hand reaches for the latch... \nThe doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth spins as candles blow out all over the room. The Creature enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow. Softly: \nCREATURE Don't bother to scream. \nEXT - CHALET - NIGHT \nThe men come running back from the lake. They stop before Victor and Claude. \nGUARD #3 We lost him. \nAnd GUARD #4's eyes drift up: \nGUARD #4 Why are those open? \nVictor spins, gazing up. Breath catching in his throat. The French doors are swaying in the wind. \nVICTOR Elizabeth. \nINT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT \nElizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light of the fireplace. \nThe Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing: \nELIZABETH You don't want to hurt me. \nHe averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty. \nCREATURE You're more lovely than I could ever have imagined. \nFOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs. A HEAVY CRASH of men throwing their shoulders at the door... \nVICTOR ELIZABETH! \n...and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls. \nShe tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest with pile-driver force... \nINT - LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT \nThe Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper: \nCREATURE Could we ever have forgiven? \nThe question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in shadow to the door. Pauses. \nCREATURE I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now. \nWALTON What kindness? \nCREATURE Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing. \nAnd then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the night... \nEXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT \nThe crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen mast, axes rising and falling in waves... \nEXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT \nThe body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice. \nWalton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small campfire drifts past. \nWalton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it. \nWalton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men back away, preparing for the coming blaze... \n...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching. \nPILOT (softly) Christ. \nGrigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, denying his aim. \nWALTON It has a right to bear witness. \nGrigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. Men start backing toward the ship. \nWALTON Stand fast. All of you. \nThe men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of flame. Walton moves forward... \n...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again. \nIt's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK! \nIce cascading skyward. \nOLD SAILOR THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP! \nGRIGORI (whips toward Walton) TORCH THE DAMN THING! \nWalton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back. \nWALTON BACK TO THE SHIP! \nThe men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve... \nGRIGORI LEAVE IT! \n...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course across the ice, separating them from the torch. \nThey fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels. \nTHE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice. \nNO \nHe starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of cascading water and spinning fragments. \nTHE NEVSKY \nThe first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side. \nWALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see: \nTHE CREATURE \nracing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse. \nTHE NEVSKY \nbreaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet into the icy water. \nTHE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice crashing down after him. Gone. \nWALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him. \n", "test1_input": "PROFESSOR KREMPE, a squat little man, paces before the packed galleries of eager young STUDENTS. \nKREMPE In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse. (off their laughter) Any questions? \nVICTOR (hand shoots up) But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works. \nKREMPE Philosophical? \nVICTOR Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one. \nThis reference is lost on all but a few. At the faculty table: PROFESSOR WALDMAN peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses on his nose. Up among the students: HENRY CLERVAL leans out and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction. \nSCHILLER catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes. \nKREMPE Paracelsus? \nVICTOR Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa... \nKREMPE What is your name? \nVICTOR Victor Frankenstein, sir. (no response) Of geneva. \nKREMPE Of Geneva. (beat) Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism? \nTitters sweep the room. Krempe remains staunchly unamused: \nKREMPE Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. Frankenstein's suggested reading list... thankfully, that would be most of you... would be well advised to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we concern ourselves with immutable reality... (specific to Victor) ...not the ravings of lunatics and alchemists hundreds of years in their graves. Understood? \nVictor is flushed and humiliated. Held like to say more, but wisely swallows his anger and nods. \nKREMPE I am relieved. Are there any relevant questions? (there are none) Lecture hall dismissed. \nEXT - UNIVERSITY - DAY \nVictor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming over the exchange with Krempe. He strides across the lawn, eyes fixed straight ahead. \nHenry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step. Victor glances over. Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been there all along. Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes his straight-ahead demeanor. They walk in silence, just two guys heading in the same direction. \nHenry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself. Victor shoots him a sharp look. Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced with blank innocence. Did somebody snicker? \nHENRY I was just clearing my throat. \nVICTOR Very well then. \nThey continue walking. Silence thick. Finally: \nHENRY You know, you're quite mad. \nVictor stops. Turns. \nVICTOR (low, measured) I am not mad. \nHENRY (matching Victor's tone) As a march hare. \nHenry's expression betrays nothing... but perhaps there's a trace of amusement in his eyes? \nVICTOR Are you having me on? \nHENRY Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane. \nBeat. Victor smiles. Henry grins, offers his hand. Takes it. \nHENRY Henry Clerval. \nVICTOR Victor, Victor Frankenstein. \nHENRY I know. You have a way of making an impression. \nINT - GASTHOF - DUSK \nThe tavern is packed with students and noise. Beer and food served at a frantic pace. We find Victor and Henry at a small table, tearing into sausages and cheese. \nVICTOR Do you really think I'm mad? \nHENRY Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak. \nSchiller enters with FRIENDS. They pause at Victor's table \nSCHILLER If it isn't the sorcerer. Found yourself an apprentice? \nVICTOR I'm afraid I rejected his application. He merely dabbles. \nHENRY Dilettantes need not apply. What about you? Schiller, isn't it? \nSCHILLER Von Schiller. I'm interested in real medicine. Treating the sick. \nHENRY Really? I myself find sick people rather revolting. (off their looks) I'm here to secure my degree with a minimum of fuss and hard work that I might settle into a life of privilege treating rich old ladies with gout and dallying with their daughters. \n", "test1_true": "Schiller and his friends stalk off. \nEXT - INGOLSTADT - DUSK \nLONG LENS magnificently compresses buildings and steeples, distant hills and drizzly sky.

(claps his shoulder) ...keep them to yourself. \nVictor takes a shocked beat and bursts into laughter. \nINT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY \nWaldman, in sinock, addresses a GROUP OF STUDENTS from across morgue slab. He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse dissected to reveal the inner workings. The others crowd for a closer look. Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and rolls his eyes in utter disgust. \nINT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY \nPUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor sitting at a tall dormer window, writing a letter with quill and ink. It's raining outside. The garret is tidied. \nEXT - RYE FIELDS - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY \nWORKERS are harvesting for miles around. PAN to Elizabeth and Claude examining the sheaves on a wagon. She cracks the grain and tastes it, glances to Claude. He smiles and nods. \nCLAUDE It's turning out to be a good year. \nELIZABETH Let's return a tenth of the crop to the tenants. (off his look) They had a hard winter. \nCLAUDE Not even your father would be that generous. \nELIZABETH Then there's no need to tell him, is there? \nClaude grins and motions to his MEN. They resume loading the sheaves as a STABLEBOY rides up: \nSTABLEBOY Miss! The mail arrived! There's one from Master Victor! \nINT - FRANKENSTEIN PARLOR - NIGHT \nWe find the family gathered around the fire as Elizabeth reads Victor's letter aloud: \nELIZABETH ...and not a day goes by that I do not cherish your faces in my mind's eye or ache to see you all again. Be assured that I am with you in spirit, and you are never far from my thoughts. I remain, as always, your loving and devoted Victor.

SHOUTING from within: \nVICTOR (O.S.) That's no excuse for being a pompous ass! \nVictor storms out with Krempe at his heels. Krempe pauses in the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him: \nKREMPE I'll see you thrown out of this university! I'll go to the dean himself! Take me at my word, Frankenstein! The dean himself! \nClassroom doors are opening, faces peering out. Waldman among them. Victor keeps going, doesn't look back. \nINT - GASTHOF - NIGHT \nVictor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in his thick, well-worn leather journal. \nHENRY The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss. \nVICTOR You're a comfort to me, Henry. \nHENRY What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help. \n", "test2_input": "GRANDFATHER Perhaps I can help.

Trying to get the words out. And the door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading: \nCREATURE Don't let them hate me! \nFelix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, again and again, trying to kill the thing... \nGRANDFATHER Leave him alone! \n...the CREATURE SCREAMING and taking the blows, writhing across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his pleading hands. The CREATURE rolls from under the brutal beating and sails out the door. \nEXT - WOODS - DAY \nThe Creature runs bleeding and sobbing, a specter sailing among the trees with greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings. Running from the horrified screams of rejection still echoing in his mind. \nEXT - WOODS - DAY \nA snowscape. Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat. \nA realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes. \nHOUSE - DUSK \nThe sky is brewing. The Creature runs across the courtyard toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out. See? Here's the flower you gave me. Don't you understand? \nCREATURE It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee! \nNothing. He glances around. The pigs are gone. Chickens too. \nThe Creature's eyes go wide. He dashes to the house \nHOUSE - DUSK \n...and bursts in to find it empty. Items have been scattered and left behind. Books, clothes, even the old man's recorder. They left in a hurry. \nCREATURE ...no. \nHOUSE - NIGHT \nWe hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's recorder jammed in his belt. \nA HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting as the house is consumed... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMONT BLANC - DAY \nMassive pale gray feet walking through the snow. ANGLE WIDENING to reveal a lone, windswept figure traversing the glacier with a walking staff. Struggling toward the crest of a ridge. Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind. \nTHE CREATURE rises from below the crest and gazes down. \nGlowering with triumph at achieving his goal.

Henry appears: \nHENRY Our carriage is here. \nEXT - INGOLSTADT CITY GATES - DAY \nBustling with activity. Hopeful. A traffic snarl is jammed up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city. People, carriages, wagons, goods. We find Professor and MRS. KREMPE saying goodbye to Victor and Henry: \nMRS. KREMPE (watching the gates) Such a terrible winter. I'll praise God to see those gates open again. \nKREMPE I'll have all your things sent on. They should arrive soon after. (Victor nods) It's been a rough time, lad. For us all. But if you'd like to come back and finish out your final term once university re-opens... \nA ROAR goes up from the crowd. The gates are finally opening as SOLDIERS swing them aside. The traffic starts to flow. \nVictor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully. \nVICTOR Thank you, Professor. For everything. \nKrempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug. \nKREMPE Write and let us know you've arrived safely. \n", "test2_true": "VICTOR Take me home, my friend. \nHenry signals the DRIVER.

Victor? \nWILLIAM That's what I'm telling you! \nELIZABETH (swept with relief) Thank God. \nWillie thrusts the package into her hands. She hesitates \nFATHER Open it. \nWillie scrambles to bring her the letter opener. Elizabeth lays the package down, slits it open. Willie peers in. \nElizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all. She presses the catch. The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's miniature oil painting. \nWILLIAM It's Victor! \nJUSTINE It's beautiful! May I? (takes the locket) He looks so handsome. \nElizabeth pulls out the letter. Apprehension and hope. She begins to read. The others watch her. Waiting. Her face lights up, blinking back tears. She remembers to breathe. \nFATHER What does it say? \nELIZABETH Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. (beat) He's coming home to marry me. \nInstant pandemonium and joy... except from Justine, whose heart quietly breaks.

Under the circumstances, it'll have to do... \n...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo with jagged glass claws... \n...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in.

She knows she's supposed to remember... but can't remember what remembering means. \nThey both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war. \nPlease... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of flesh like a patchwork. \nShe looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers. \nOne belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh God, what's happened to me? \nELIZABETH Vic... tor? \nCREATURE ...no... \n...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her own eyes. \nVictor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside. \nCREATURE GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE! \nVICTOR SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS! \nYes. She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying... \n...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before they can stop her. \nVICTOR NO! \nShe spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... loathing for herself for what she's become. \nIt turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the Creature racing after her... \nINT - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT \n...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up on impact. \nVICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in Hell. \nVICTOR You killed her! You killed her! \nHe hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes down at his Maker one last time... \nCREATURE We killed her. \nAnd then vanishes through the smoke and flames. \nEXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY \nThe once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family. \nVictor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly: \nHENRY Victor. \nNo reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard. \nHe rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack horse. The animal stands saddled and ready. \nHe starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a stranger... and then his features soften. \nVICTOR All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand. \nHENRY Let it go. \nVictor pauses, emotions swirling. Wishing he could grab the dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper: \nVICTOR You should have been my father's son. He would have been so proud. \nVictor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his horse. Henry runs after him, shouting: \nHENRY VICTOR! COME BACK! \n", "test3_true": "EXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY \nThe solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept glacier ... \nINT - THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY \nVictor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled. The cave is now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot where the campfire had been... \nEXT - GLACIER - DAY \nA panorama of snow. Pristine... save for the long trail of footprints stretching off before us. \nVictor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor. \nHe slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by the reins. Dwindling across the frozen landscape. \nARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.) I followed his trail north... always north... and always one step behind... never stopping... driven by my fires of rage... and revenge... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT - WALTON'S CABIN - TWILIGHT \nVictor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able to speak, drained now of everything. \nVICTOR A year now I've followed him. Perhaps more. Only to arrive at this place. Tired. So very tired. I never did find... whatever it was... I was looking for... and neither will you, my friend. (off Walton's look) Value life above ambition... or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers... as they have in mine. (reaches out feverishly) See your loved ones again. I cannot. \nWalton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest. Softly: \nWALTON Rest now. \nVictor is silent. His breathing shallow. Walton just sits And waits... \nA SLOW DISSOLVE marks the passage of Walton's long vigil... \nVictor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen. Perhaps, the faces of those he loved. The eyes glaze. A peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward off the chill. Exits the cabin. \nEXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT \nGrigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the ice. His coat is open. Walton joins him. Surprised at how warm it is. He holds up his hand, testing the breeze. \nWALTON A warming wind. \nGRIGORI This ice will break yet. (glances over) How's our guest? \nWALTON He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. (beat) Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin. \nGRIGORI Aye, Captain. \nGrigori moves off to gather help. Walton turns and heads back to his cabin. \nINT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT \nWalton enters... and freezes at the sound of SOFT WEEPING. \nHe can't see the bad from here. Could it be the dead man? He glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor. \nHe eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned. \nWALTON Who are you? \nThe figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim yellow light: \nCREATURE He never gave me a name. \nWalton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move. Unconcerned. \nCREATURE You were with him at the end. \nWALTON (finds his voice) Yes. \nCREATURE I was watching. \nWalton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the breeze, chilled at the thought. The Creature returns his gaze to Victor. \nCREATURE I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him. \nWALTON What is that to you? Evil as you are. \nCREATURE (swivels his gaze) I am as he made me. In his own image. \nWALTON You drove him to his torment. \nCREATURE And he drove me to mine. \nWALTON Then why weep for him? \nCREATURE Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine. \n"}

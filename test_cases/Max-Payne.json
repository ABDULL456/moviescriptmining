{"test1_input": "MAX PAYNE \nWritten by \nBeau Michael Thorne \nOVER BLACK: \nMAX'S VOICE C I don't believe in heaven, but I have this idea about it. Something I heard in a song. \nFADE IN: \nWhite. \npristine, empty frame.   Clean and peaceful. \nMAX'S VOICE Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. \nThere's gentle motion in the blank frame, like swirling 16mm grain. A RUMBLE starts to build, low but growing louder... \nThe grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, now a dirty dishwater grey. The RUMBLE becoming a HOWLING WIND. \nChurning black water LAPS at the bottom of the frame... \nEXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAWN \nA blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks. MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore. \nMAX'S VOICE There's an army of bodies under this river. Criminals, people who ran out of time, out of friends. \nChunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's body freezing, skin turning blue. Heavy winter clothes saturating, like an anchor dragging him down... \nMAX'S VOICE The next time they drag this river, they'll find me on the bottom with the rest of them. And there won't be anybody left to say I was different. \nMax's face sinks below the surface... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nNothing to orient us to the location, the time. Just a flash of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold. Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps... \nBEDROOM \nA WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY. Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man? \nSomething's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open. \nSomething BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in... \nRESUME - HUDSON RIVER \nWind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water. \nMAX'S VOICE I could feel the dead down there, just below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me as one of their own. \nMax breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the undertow. Not simply trying to breathe...trying to swim. \nMAX'S VOICE It was an easy mistake to make. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET (NYC) - NIGHT \nAbruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight. Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway... \nOn the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them. \nTITLE CARD:      ONE WEEK EARLIER \nINT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAY \nA filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear... \nThe same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three... \nThe watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy. \nSUBWAY BATHROOM \nThe Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the edge of the sink before washing his hands... \nMAN #1 Hey, that's a really nice watch. \nNo answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head... \n", "test1_true": "MAN #1 (drooling over the watch) Kinda reminds me of one I lost-- \nMAX You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on 128th a few hours ago. \nMax shuts off the water and calmly turns to face them. \nMAX (nodding to Man #2) Ask Doug. He was there with you. \nDoug frowns, deeply confused about being called by his name. \nDOUG You've been following us all night? \nMAX No. (pointing) I'm only following you. \nWhile Doug digests that, PAWNSHOP pulls a pistol and trains it on Max's forehead. The third man - not much more than a KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door. \nPAWNSHOP You a cop, or something? \nMAX Not tonight. \nPAWNSHOP Too bad. (to Doug) Go get my watch. \nDistractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING. \nIn a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol, the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe... \nDoug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door. \nIn the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking... \nIn the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall. \nDOUG (craving, eyes closed) Watch over me, watch over me... \nThe newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP, restraining a WHIMPERING Doug to the toilet pipe. \nMAX Open your eyes, now. \nDoug finds himself staring at the pistol's front sight. Max reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph... It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river. \nMAX Have you ever seen her before? \nDoug shakes his head violently, confusion and terror rising. \nMAX You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey with William Preston three-- \nDOUG Bill's dead. \nMAX That's why I'm talking to you. (moving the photo closer) Did he ever say anything about this woman? Did you ever hear anyone-- \nDOUG Bill died because their wings couldn't lift him up. \nMAX No, he got shot robbing a liquor store. What are you talking about? \nDOUG (incoherent, rambling) Their wings are golden, the feathers only look black... \nSighing, Max unlocks Doug from the pipe, hauling him up and slamming into the wall as he cuffs his hands behind his back. \nPLATFORM \nMax stalks out of the bathroom, pushing Doug ahead of him. Down on the tracks, the Kid shrinks into the shadows... \nSUBWAY TUNNEL \nThe Kid runs down the dark tracks, nervously glancing back at the receding light of the platform.   He slows gradually, relaxing as escape seems certain. \nDown to a walk, he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead: FLAPPING WINGS - a bird, lost and trapped underground? \nThe Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to drown the sound out. It grows, though, more WINGS joining... \nHe turns to retreat up the tracks, but the WINGS suddenly seem to be echoing towards him from all directions. \nPanicked, the Kid becomes disoriented in the growing RACKET, the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins... \nVisible now in the growing light, BLACK SHAPES flicker above the tracks - dozens becoming hundreds, swelling larger, their POUNDING wings joined by a train RUMBLING closer... \nFrozen, the Kid can only squint into the headlights closing in, petrified by the dark wings SWIRLING around him... I NT. COLD CASE OFFICE - DAY \nThe front room of the cold case department is a mess - desks piled high with paperwork and a week's worth of coffee cups. \nHalfway in the front door, a young DETECTIVE stands holding a box of his belongings. He looks around for signs of life. SERGEANT ADAMS wanders down the hall, frowning at the draft. \nSGT. ADAMS You my new guy? \n", "test1_id": 2760, "test2_input": "ATTENDANT via intercom) If you're coming, you better come on. Way it's looking, might be the last train tonight. \nMax takes a step into the light of the ticket booth. The attendant opens the ticket slot, letting a gust of freezing air blow inside. Max slides a few bills through. \nTicket in hand, Max starts his solitary march to the trains. \nINT. GOGNITTI'S HOTEL - BAR - NIGHT A dingy, dark bar on the first floor of an even sleazier hotel. It's nearly empty, only the dedicated DRUNKS venturing out in the storm. The front door swings open... \nThe old men shiver at the stiff blast of wind rushing in, turning to look. Napkins flutter. Snowflakes blow inside. \nFrom a booth in the corner, VINNIE GOGNITTI (50s, pudgy) shoots a hard look at the open door, not immediately recognizing the SILHOUETTE in the passage... \nVINNIE In or out, asshole. \nMona steps inside, boots heavy with ice. Her MEN follow. Flanked by MEN of his own, Vinnie freezes when he sees Mona. \nVINNIE (CONT'D) So? \nMONA We need to talk. (beat) Talk. \nGradually, Vinnie and his men relax. \nVINNIE Shut the door, then. You Ruskies may be used to it, but I'm freezing my dick off over here. \nBACK OFFICE \nThey've packed into a tiny back office - Russian gunmen on one side of the desk, Italians on the other. Mona and Vinnie represent their different sides, the only people seated. \nVINNIE Okay.     So talk. \nMONA Something was taken from me. It involves a club in Italian territory, so I need your blessing to go make it right. V INNIE You're asking my permission? smirking to his men) Well in that case, sweetheart... \nM \nV \nMona looks Vinnie over, bored to death by the whole thing. \nMONA I said `blessing.' \nVINNIE Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra. Which club are we talking about? \nMONA Ragna Rok. \ninnie tries to keep a poker face, but the name chills him. \nMONA (CONT'D) Over on Avenue-- \nVINNIE Yeah, I know. (beat, rattled) Sure, fine. You have my permission...blessing, whatever. \nMona frowns, her wishes granted a little too easily. \nMONA You do still control that block, right? It's south of-- \nVINNIE The guy's name is Jack Lupino. \nMONA Well, that sounds Italian to me. \nVINNIE He's no kind of Italian I've ever seen. Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we hear. \nONA (sneering) You're afraid of tattoos, now? \nVINNIE When the club first opened, I sent somebody down to collect the...you know, fire insurance. A day goes by, and I don't see him. Then I get two boxes delivered to me. One box's got my guy's hands and ears in it. The other box has a quarter of a million dollars in cash. \nE \nM \nMONA This neighborhood has been your family's forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes to-- \nVINNIE What got my attention, Mona, was that the boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy in uniform hands them to me in broad daylight. (beat) I'm not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or mouthy Russian bitches. But whoever's watching over Lupino, whoever it is you really need to bless you walking inside Ragna Rok...him, I am scared of. \nEXT. SUBURBAN TRAIN STATION - NIGHT \nThe platform is cleaner than the ones in the city - dressed up for the tastes of the COMMUTERS who step off of the train. \nMax threads his way through the handful of exhausted BUSINESSMEN arriving home, moving out into the darkness. \nEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT \nThe snow's driving just as hard out here, but peaceful houses with warm windows glowing make the storm feel comforting. In the yards, forgotten sleds disappear under new powder, gone for good by morning. Snowmen distort as they swell. \nMax Payne trudges up the center of the street, a black streak spoiling the peace of the evening. A trespasser. T HE HOUSE \nOne house on the block stands out: there's no neatly shoveled driveway, no colorful Christmas lights flashing from the eaves. A black void behind every window, no life inside. \n", "test2_true": "BB (V.O.) She was thirty-five. The daughter, two months. From what we could tell, it started out as a robbery. \nXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD \nA row of footprints lead around back. \nG \nM \nB \nB \nBB (V.O.) oth of the men had records, mostly bullshit - possession, petty theft. \nHanging in the overgrown hedges, an overlooked scrap of yellow police tape shimmers in the wind. \nBB (V.O.) ut that day...I don't know. They had something else on their minds. \nMax stands at the back door. He touches the unpainted wood around the glass, repairs never fully complete. \nBB (V.O.) ax was maybe ten minutes late. \nMax reaches for the handle...hesitant to actually touch... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) \nA living room in the stillness of evening, golden air packed like amber around baby bottles and toys on the coffee table. The front door opens, and a man steps inside... \nMax Payne, different in every way: the malnourishment and neglect gone from his face, a fullness in his frame from M regular home-cooked meals. Shave and a haircut. Nice suit. \nax picks up the mail from the floor and strolls inside... \nKITCHEN \nTie loosened, Max gets a beer from the fridge. Unwinding, he takes a long sip and begins sorting through the mail. \nlancing up from the mail, Max sees the kitchen door... \nGlass smashed.    Blinds torn.   Standing open. \nSTAIRWAY \nMax charges upstairs.    MEN'S VOICES echo down from above. \nMAX (calling out) Michelle! \nHis eyes aren't hard yet. Rushing up the stairs, we see Max's faith in the world start to crack for the first time... \nHALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nMax turns the corner into a hallway bathed in golden afternoon light, the same one he saw in the river... \nBetween Max and the end of the hall, two JUNKIES are huddled against a door. Twisting the handle, SMACKING the wood. \nMax pulls a pistol from a low-pro holster, stepping forward. \nMAX (calling out) Michelle? \nThe Junkies turn to Max, eyes black and glassy.    Sick smiles. \nMAX shouting to the door) Michelle, I'm right here... \nWithout a word, the Junkies charge. \nMax takes aim and BLASTS one of them in the forehead. The M other keeps rushing, swinging a long knife at Max's neck. \nax ducks, a quarter-second and a quarter-inch from a slit throat. The swing throws the thin man off balance... \nHe tries again - ropy muscles straining skin speckled with tracks. Max grabs his arm, throwing the thin man off balance. They go down to the hardwood floor together. \nToo close to line up a shot, Max drives the butt of the pistol into the man's nose, SPLITTING it across the bridge. Blood spatters his gaunt face, but those eyes never change... \nJUNKIE It's okay.     They're angels, now. \nStraining, he moves the knife's tip closer to Max's belly... \nMax jams the barrel under the Junkie's leering jaw and PULLS THE TRIGGER. Blood atomizes into a hanging cloud around him. \nMax jumps up and races to the door.    Locked from the inside. \n", "test2_id": 2761, "test3_input": "M \nL \nHe pulls the door shut. It won't. Something's blocking it. The guard stands up, opens it wider to build some momentum... \nMax stands on the top step. \nBACK ROOM \nLupino shoots up, gritted teeth tugging his belt tourniquet tight. Eyes clinched, beads of sweat already forming. \nThe muffled BLAST of a machine gun, out on the dance floor. The Guards surrounding Lupino spring into action. \nGUARD #1 W ait here, Mr. Lupino. \nLupino lets the belt slip free, a deep SIGH rattling out. He opens his eyes, just in time for us to see the irises retracting. Candles shine in the black holes left behind. \nUPINO I don't need protection.   I have my own. \nThe Guards at the door lock and load, moving out... \nBALLROOM \nMax walks into the ballroom, motionless Guard bleeding out on the dance floor before him. Gunsmoke hangs in the air... \nIn that final stillness, Max checks his clip.     Stone-faced. \nThundering BOOTS echo out from the belly of the building. Doors fly open - Guards racing out from the kitchen on the first floor, two more from the office CRASHING out upstairs. \nax OPENS UP, flames of automatic fire lighting his way. \nBACK ROOM \nLupino and the Guards listen to the SHOOTING grow closer. Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop. With lightning reflexes, THE GUARDS BLAST down the hallway. \nupino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle flash. Forgotten now, he fades away into the smoke. \nThe Guards crumble and fall until the room goes SILENT. M ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised.     Hunting. \nI \nC \nL \nU \nL \nThe back room is deeper than the poor light gives away. Max's boots grind over burned-out candles, occult runes... \nLupino launches out of the darkness at Max.   Before he sees it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull. \nMax stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow. Lupino draws a gleaming knife from his boot and springs on Max. \nupino swings the knife so quickly it becomes a blur, blade WHISTLING as it cuts through the smoke. He slashes the knife across Max's thigh, dropping him to the ground. \nnable to stand, Max thrusts the rifle up for protection. The blade CLANKS against the barrel, carving deep trenches in the stock, finally gashing the back of Max's fingers. \nBlood rushes from the cuts, loosening Max's grip on the weapon. Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands. \nupino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.    He CRIES OUT. \nLUPINO an you hear them, now? \nLupino drives his knee into Max's chest. Arm numb from the stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered. Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage... E XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nOutside, no voice could carry on that raging WIND. TWO FIGURES walk up the street, closing slowly on Ragna Rok. \nNT. RAGNA ROK - BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nLupino leans over Max, one hand grinding the knife deeper into his shoulder, the other wrenching the machine gun free. Max desperately tries to dig his nails into the grip... \nLUPINO We'll see which one us they're flying for. We'll see who they love best. \nSweat streams down Lupino's face, dripping down onto Max. Fingernails splitting, Max finally loses hold of the gun. The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back. \nFor an instant, they are apart. \nS \nB \nY \n", "test3_true": "Lupino drops the machine gun. Max clamps his hand over Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper. While Lupino GASPS, eyes wide, Max struggles to his feet. \nMAX Who is your contact at Aesir? \nLupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.       Fascinated. \nMAX louder) Who sent you after Michelle? L UPINO (with difficulty) You are so blessed. \nMax looks at Lupino - up close, his undyed skin is ashen and pockmarked, older than his age. Blood drools from his lips. Lupino's eyes swim around, lost in a fog of drugs and pain. \nMAX ou don't know what I'm talking about, do you? \nLupino's eyes stop swimming.    For a moment, he sees Max. \nLUPINO The angels are not done with you yet. \nLupino's skull explodes. \nMax spins towards the hall, but another SHOT rakes across his shoulder and slings him to the ground. Defenseless, Max can only lift his eyes to see who's coming to finish it... \nB steps out of the smoke. \nAs Max reels at the sight of BB, JOE SALLE (50'S) rumbles in. \nalle stomps on Max's wrist, in the same motion telescoping a metal baton and CRACKING it across his skull. With the grace of an old pro, Salle snaps on a pair of handcuffs. \nMAX (in shock) BB? \nMax is hauled to his feet - bleeding, cuffed, and trapped. \nB \nB \nG \nA \nM \nAnd BB walks right on by. \nAX What's going on here, BB? \nAs Max watches in disbelief, BB paces around the room taking stock - noting the dead Guards, crouching over Lupino's body. B B t ease, soldier. \nMax struggles to break free of Salle's grasp. \nMAX Hey! \nJOE SALLE (draws pistol, re. Max) Now? \nBB Not unless you feel like carrying him out of here. Max knows me, and I definitely don't know Mr. Lupino. \nMAX shouting) Look at me, BB.    At least face what you're doing... \nBB finally does look at Max.    Cold, dead eyes.   A stranger. \nBB row up. \nEXT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nBB steps through the door, over the guard's upturned chair. \nThe blizzard has won - streets and sidewalks no longer scraped, cars long abandoned under their icy cocoons. The fifth largest city in the world, reduced to a ghost town. \nB Happy New Year. \nB strides out in front, taking in the sight. It might as well be a desert, white sand sifting around their boots, buildings rising above like black canyon walls. \nMax shuffles along behind BB, head bent low in the wind. Plumes of his ragged breaths trailing out behind him. \nBB (cont'd) Look at it from my perspective: this thing is going to be a true epidemic. One hundred percent dependence within a few doses, and we control the only source. This is so much bigger than Lupino's little bar. This is every street corner in the City in a month, nation wide in two. \nMax keeps trudging, one foot in front of the other. BB looks annoyed that he's not getting a reaction out of him. B B I hope you're not over there blaming me. Really, this is Michelle's fault. \nMax's eyes start to burn.     BB sneaks a peek, encouraged. \nBB She had no right to put me in that situation. Asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my bosses...I'm sorry, but that's unreasonable. \nMax's head snaps up, eyes simmering with rage.     BB smiles. \nBB But then again, who could blame her for getting confused, being married to such a righteous man. So maybe it is your fault, after all. (beat) Just like your old man. Always knew you were better than everyone else-- \n", "test3_id": 2762}

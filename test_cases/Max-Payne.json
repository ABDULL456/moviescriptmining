{"train": "MAX PAYNE \nWritten by \nBeau Michael Thorne \nOVER BLACK: \nMAX'S VOICE C I don't believe in heaven, but I have this idea about it. Something I heard in a song. \nFADE IN: \nWhite. \npristine, empty frame.   Clean and peaceful. \nMAX'S VOICE Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens. \nThere's gentle motion in the blank frame, like swirling 16mm grain. A RUMBLE starts to build, low but growing louder... \nThe grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, now a dirty dishwater grey. The RUMBLE becoming a HOWLING WIND. \nChurning black water LAPS at the bottom of the frame... \nEXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAWN \nA blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks. MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore. \nMAX'S VOICE There's an army of bodies under this river. Criminals, people who ran out of time, out of friends. \nChunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's body freezing, skin turning blue. Heavy winter clothes saturating, like an anchor dragging him down... \nMAX'S VOICE The next time they drag this river, they'll find me on the bottom with the rest of them. And there won't be anybody left to say I was different. \nMax's face sinks below the surface... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nNothing to orient us to the location, the time. Just a flash of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold. Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps... \nBEDROOM \nA WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY. Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man? \nSomething's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open. \nSomething BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in... \nRESUME - HUDSON RIVER \nWind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water. \nMAX'S VOICE I could feel the dead down there, just below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me as one of their own. \nMax breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the undertow. Not simply trying to breathe...trying to swim. \nMAX'S VOICE It was an easy mistake to make. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET (NYC) - NIGHT \nAbruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight. Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway... \nOn the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them. \nTITLE CARD:      ONE WEEK EARLIER \nINT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAY \nA filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear... \nThe same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three... \nThe watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy. \nSUBWAY BATHROOM \nThe Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the edge of the sink before washing his hands... \nMAN #1 Hey, that's a really nice watch. \nNo answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head... \nDETECTIVE I didn't think anybody was here. \nSGT. ADAMS Everybody's usually a little late. \nHALLWAY \nSgt. Adams leads the detective down a hall, giving the tour. \nSGT. ADAMS All the cold investigations in the city are collected and delivered over to us. We call each witness to see if they can add anything to their original statement. \nDETECTIVE And if they can? \nSGT. ADAMS We send the file back to the original precinct for follow-up. Don't get your hopes up, though. \nThe Sergeant continues towards the center of the building, farther from the light of the windows. He stops at a door. \nSGT. ADAMS Once you've gone through the file and come up empty, bring it here... \nFILE ROOM/MAX'S OFFICE \nThey enter a windowless cave, long rows of metal cabinets stretching on forever into the heart of the building. At a desk in the corner, Max slumps over a stack of files. \nD \nM \nSGT. ADAMS Max here handles our filing. Once it hits his desk, a case is officially dead. \nax looks up, dark circles from his long night in the subway. He nods, but the Detective is too busy making a note to see. D ETECTIVE What if there's no phone number for a witness? Should I follow up in person? \nSGT. ADAMS Nope, we don't do that down here. \niscretely, Max slides his cut-up knuckles under the desk... \nDETECTIVE I don't understand, then how-- \nSGT. ADAMS How do you solve that unsolvable murder mystery and redeem yourself? \nDETECTIVE The grand jury couldn't find-- \nSGT. ADAMS Stop. Trust me, there's a tragic story behind why I'm here giving you this tour. We all did something, so just save it. (moving for the door) Follow me to the break room... \nThe Detective turns to Max, embarrassed after his reprimand. \nDETECTIVE We should get a beer after work, or something... \nMax smiles and nods, but his eyes give him away as a liar: \nMAX Yeah.   Maybe so. \nHALLWAY \nThe Detective steals a look at Max as Adams shuts his door. \nDETECTIVE So what did he do? \nW \nM \nJ \nSGT. ADAMS (sharply) Nothing. \nNaturally, this reaction piques the detective's curiosity. \nSGT. ADAMS R emember when you were a kid, and you'd hold your breath when you went past a graveyard? \nThe detective nods.     Adams glances through the window at Max. \nSGT. ADAMS ust...try to leave him alone. \nMAX'S OFFICE \nMax sneaks a sideways glance to the door, watching Adams lead the new Detective away. Once they're gone, Max reaches into his desk and removes a file... `PRESTON, WILLIAM A.' \nax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA lock POPS.     Max steps inside, only silence to greet him. \nMax lays his jacket across the back of a worn leather chair, footsteps REVERBERATING because there's little other furniture to absorb the sound. He keeps walking... \nKITCHEN \nMax doesn't answer. His eyes have drifted back to Natasha. She plucks a drink from a passing tray, revealing a dark smudge across the inside of her wrist as she does. \nTREVOR I'd invite you in, but... \nSuddenly intent, Max pushes past Trevor and into the loft. \nMAX hanks. \nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMax weaves through the party towards Natasha, out of place in his utilitarian clothes. She looks up as he gets closer... N ATASHA ou decided to stay for a while. \nShe speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous. Rather than answering, Max's eyes drop to her wrist. \nNATASHA ow it's your turn to say something... \nax takes her hand, gently turning it to reveal her tattoo: a black wing, stylized feathers tracing faint blue veins. \nMAX That's interesting. \nNATASHA Thank you. It's... (glancing past Max) Shit. \nMax follows her gaze to the front door, where Trevor is nervously greeting another new arrival: MONA SAX. She's striking, beautiful but also a little frightening. It doesn't hurt that she's flanked by BODYGUARDS. Russian Mob. \nSeeing Natasha standing with Max, Mona barrels across the room towards them. People stand aside to let her pass. \nithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian. Natasha RESPONDS in kind, clearly intimidated by Mona. \nAbruptly, Mona grabs Natasha's arm, jerking her off balance. \nMAX Why don't you let go-- \nS \nMONA (in perfect English) Mind your business. \nMona returns to Natasha, dragging her towards the door. Natasha's tone becomes PLEADING, physically no match for Mona. Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder... I t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the grip that would surely have snapped his wrist... \nFor a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised, reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd. \nMona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge. \nWith the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance. \nThe crowd begins to notice the altercation. Natasha keeps TALKING, trying desperately to make peace and reassure Mona of something. Mona's eyes cut between Natasha and Max... \ntill apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away. \nNATASHA My sister. (beat) Sort of a bitch. \nAs Max nods at the understatement, Trevor rushes over, forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests. He pulls Max's coat closed over the badge and ushers him towards the door. \nTREVOR You have to go. Now. \nMAX (pulling free) Fine. I just want to ask her something first... \nMax turns to the spot where Natasha had been.   She's gone. \nHALLWAY - LATER \nThe party has grown more crowded. Max fights his way down a dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes. Back here, the music is nothing but GROWLING BASS. \nN \nS \nA \nA flickering glow escapes the gaps around one door... \nDARK ROOM \nA ring of candles in the center of the floor provides the only light. It's not enough to really see the PEOPLE inside. We hear them CHANTING, low voices MURMURING in unison... \nQuick glimpses in the candle light, bare flesh writhing. Cast on the walls, corresponding shadows twist and shift... \nA black feather billows across the floor between candles. Spreading up the wall, a new shadow rises above the rest... \npair of wings - long and distorted in the candle light. \nMax appears in the doorway as the shadows loose their shape - Max only catching a glimpse, not sure what he's seeing... \nHALLWAY \nAs Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow. JACK LUPINO. \nmoment later, the few working lamps on the street dim... \nN \nR \nA \nALLEY \nNatasha barrels down the alley, squinting to see ahead.        The music is a little louder, BASS shaking the dumpsters. A wind picks up, garbage blowing... \nSuddenly unsettled by something, Natasha's pace slows.      She tenses, all her swagger vanishing before our eyes... \ncan RATTLES in the alley behind her.    Natasha spins... \nNothing - just the FLICKERING of moths swarming the alley's only light, their shadows black shapes against the bricks. \nThe sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley... \nEyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it: \neal winged shapes mix with the shadows, FLAPPING wildly... \nNatasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.      She turns, running... \nNATASHA ot yet!   Please, just let me... \nNatasha's SCREAMS seem lost in the chaos of wind and WINGS and distant MUSIC. She suddenly stops running... \nMore SHADOWS assemble ahead of her, their black wings open. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING \nMax hurriedly dresses, wearing the same suit from yesterday. He picks up his keys, searching around for something else - feeling the pockets of his jacket, down in the cushions... \nOFFICE \nMax moves up the sidewalk, nearly at the steps of his office. A rough-running ENGINE idles up the street, getting closer. Slowly, Max realizes that he's being followed. He turns... A LEX HILLMAN sits behind the wheel - about Max's age, but in much rougher condition, everything about him a little ashen. He watches Max turn away from the office and move closer. \nMax returns Alex's stare. We don't know if they're about to smile or open fire. They don't seem to know, either. \nAlex slides over and throws the passenger side door open. \nS \nA \nINT. ALEX'S CAR - DAY \nAlex and Max ride in silence, a palpable tension in the car. \nlex pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shakes one out. He holds the pack out to Max, who shakes his head. \nAlex nods, smiling, using his lighter and then laying it with the pack within Max's reach. Max doesn't even glance down. After a silent moment, Alex looks over at Max and frowns. \nALEX You're not serious, are you? \nShaking his head in disbelief, Alex pulls to the curb. T hey've parked at a crime scene - the alley in front of them sealed with police tape, COPS posted to keep onlookers away. \nMAX What's this? \nAlex pulls a flask from under his seat, taking a quick pull. \nALEX I need you to look at something. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nAlex approaches the alley, pulling on a leather jacket and snapping a badge onto his belt. The cops let him pass. \nMax follows Alex, slowing as he crosses the police tape. By the crowd of CSI TECHS, what started here didn't end well. There's blood everywhere, a dozen white sheets on the ground. \nMAX What happened to them? \nALEX Her.     Just one. \nConfused, Max studies the sheets. On second look, they aren't covering anything quite big enough to be a whole body. \nALEX omebody found her leg near the sidewalk, called it in a few hours later. We found the other one in the dumpster over there. \nDETECTIVE #1 (O.S.) I don't believe it. \nM \nA \nAt the moment that registers, a NOISE in the hallway behind him sends Max ducking for cover in the doorway beside him. Max crouches, gun raised, staring at Alex's motionless body. \nMAX Alex! \nFOOTSTEPS grow closer...slow, steady... \nMax uses the fragments of mirror scattered around Alex's legs, each giving a tiny view of the hallway... \nOne piece shows a FIGURE moving closer, shrouded in darkness. A nother reflection shows a set of eyes. Frozen. Frantic. It's Alex, staring at Max, seeming to silently beg for help. Max looks from the reflection to the legs. There's no way... \nThere's no way Alex's head is still attached to his body. \nThunderstruck, Max looses track of the shadows moving closer to his hiding spot, unable to pull his eyes away from Alex. The Figure lunges out of the shadows, slamming into Max... \nThe Dark Shape's slashing blows glint in the moonlight, cold metal slicing the air faster than Max can fend off... \nCUT TO: \nA RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES: \nMax drags himself up the hall, hands slicing on the shards. The air echoes with angry VOICES, LAUGHTER and SCREAMS. Blood drips down the walls, shadows teem with movement... \nB \nT \nY \nThe FLAPPING grows louder, gusting WIND scattering glass. Max SHOUTS, disoriented, instinctively pushing himself on. Alex's eyes, frozen wide, watch as Max crawls closer... \nShadows in the air above Max roil with movement. Demonic HOWLS rattle the windows. Max reaches out to Alex... \nAbove them, black wings POUND. I NT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nMax's eyes pop open. \nHe lies in a hospital bed, surrounded by flashing machinery. Beyond the soft WHIR of equipment fans, the room is silent. \nBB (O.C.) The E.R. doctor's old man was a patrolman in the 45th. I got him to get you a private room. \nIn a chair by the bed, BB HENSLEY (50s) watches Max wake up. BB's face is weathered and hard, but his smile is kind. \nBB our contact information was... pretty out of date, you know, but one of the dispatchers remembered me and your dad riding together back in the day. \nMax nods groggily, struggling to find his bearings... \nSuddenly, something breaks through. \nMAX Alex. \nBB nods, shivering at the mental image his name produces. \nBB he first unit to respond must've scared them away before they could do the same thing to you. Pretty remarkable, considering your luck. \nMAX He was trying to tell me something. \nB Was he alive when you showed up?   Did you get a look at the guys who-- \nM \nJ \nM \nMAX No.   I get Bflashes, but it's...wrong. \nB I hate to say it, but you need to come up with something better than that. They've got nothing for leads, so the whole force has you pegged as the prime suspect. \nAX You tell them where to find me. \nBB No need.   The funeral starts in an hour. \nMax pops up, tangling the IV tubes running into his hand. \nBB ust slow down.   You need to-- \nMax wraps the clear tube around his hand and SNAPS it free. \nAX What I need is to borrow some dress blues. Can you help me out? \nBB (reluctant) Yeah. My office is on the way. \nAs Max takes an unsteady step onto the cold tile floor, a concerned BB throws his overcoat across Max's shoulders. \nINT. BB'S CAR - DAY \nMax shakes his head. \nUp ahead, a young mother tends to two little girls dressed in black, escorted through the cemetery gate by the HONOR GUARD. CHRISTA HILLMAN, Alex's widow. Face blank, still in shock. \nB B suddenly anxious) Go ahead up and say something to Christa. I'll find us some seats... \nax threads his way through the mass of UNIFORMED COPS waiting to enter the cemetery. One by one they notice Max, jaws clenching. Max doesn't realize the gauntlet he's in, distracted by a glance of BB slinking into the graves... \n...where NICOLE HORNE watches the funeral from among the headstones, almost overdressed in head-to-toe black. Close at hand, JASON COLVIN holds Nicole's umbrella. \nB approaches Nicole, body language weak and deferential... \nMax glances back at the path and finds himself facing a wall of angry cops. He keeps walking, no sign of backing down. \nCHRISTA (O.C.) Let him through. \nEven with the cops making way, the walk to Christa is hard - the heartbreak and grief on her face slowing Max's gait. \nAX Christa, I'm really sorry about what-- \nCHRISTA Don't talk to me like some stranger. \nChrista's eyes bore into Max with all the weight of a long and deep friendship, momentarily shaming him into silence. \nCHRISTA Who did this to him, Max? \nMAX We don't have a lot, yet... \nChrista steps towards Max, teeth gritted with powerless rage. \nN \nI T \nCHRISTA (seething) When everything happened to you, Alex completely fell apart. He ruined his life, he cared that much. So what are you going to do for him, now? M ax could melt under those eyes, but Christa turns her back and continues up the path to Alex's waiting coffin. \nShamed, Max turns away and starts back down the path alone. \nBRAVURA Detective Payne? \nEveryone turns to see JIM BRAVURA (40s) leaning on the fence. \nBRAVURA .A.   I need you to come with me. \nhough they'd been moments from brawling, there's a common reaction from the other cops: nobody likes this guy. Max looks around, humiliated. \nMAX ow? \nBRAVURA Now. \nGRAVESIDE \nThe honor guard stands in formation by the flag-draped casket. The PRIEST waits, his bible ripping in the wind... \nChrista twists around in her chair, looking down at the cemetery gate. She sees the crowd, Max being escorted away. \nCHRISTA (sad, to the priest) Okay. \nAbove them all, Nicole Horne stands like a shadow between the graves, too far away to hear the words of the priest. \nINT. BRAVURA'S OFFICE \nA cramped office, packed with boxes - a civil servant's tomb. Wedged behind the desk, Bravura sorts through his notes. Max and BB sit across the desk, left on ice while Bravura reads. \nI \nH \nBravura slides a folder over to Max - photographs of the alley, Natasha's covered body. Bravura watches his reaction. \nBRAVURA ow'd the girl have your wallet? \nMAX She stole it. \nBRAVURA Like...picked your pocket? \nMax shrugs. \nBRAVURA So you didn't know she was a prostitute? \nThe slightest uncomfortable look passes between Max and BB. \nMAX No, I didn't.    We met through a friend. \nBRAVURA Trevor Duncan. He's your friend? \nt once, you're struck by how this is the opposite of the cold case department: desks cluttered by labor instead of neglect, DETECTIVES engaged in their telephone conversations. \nEyes start to find him. \nax marches forward, ignoring the spreading wave of shock. \nMax stops at a door marked `ALEX HILLMAN.'    It's locked. \nax JIGGLES the door knob. \nF \nM \nB \nDETECTIVE #1 (shouting) Hey! \nMax doesn't look up.       He keeps SHAKING the handle, desperate. \nDETECTIVE #1 (cont'd) Hey asshole, that door's locked for a reason. \nOne by one, the detectives climb to their feet, expressions showing outrage and anger. They close in on Max... \nDETECTIVE #2 God damn it, that means you need a-- M ax gives the knob a final twist, and the door swings open. \nMAX (to himself) There wasn't ever a key. \nMax steps inside.       Enraged, the detectives start to follow... \nut the door SLAMS again in their faces. \nALEX'S OFFICE \nThe doorknob RATTLES, no method this time. SHOUTS and BANGS ring through the door. Ignoring it, Max surveys the room... \nThe office is bare, no decorations or personal touches. Max walks deeper into the room, opening a filing cabinet. Empty. \nTrying to remain calm while the door SHAKES violently, Max turns his attention to the desk. One drawer empty... \nMax tries another drawer, and finds this one locked. \nax drives his boot into the drawer, AGAIN and AGAIN. \nDETECTIVE (O.C.) What are you doing in there? \nTeeth gritted against the pain, Max delivers a final KICK. \nThe drawer front shatters and collapses.       Max reaches inside. \niles - not criminal jackets like the ones in Cold Case. More official, somehow. Max flips through one at random... \n`GREEN, OWEN A.'       Not a mug shot, but a military ID photo. \nM \nA \nOut in the hall, the crowd of detectives seems to grow larger, the POUNDING on the door becoming more severe. T he SLAMMING sounds outside push Max deeper into the desk, frantically spilling the contents onto the floor... \nMichelle's face. \nMax's eyes go wide. \nAnother photograph of Michelle. \nnother. \nShaking, Max's hands dig deeper... \nAn impact sends CRACKS splitting up the length of the door... \nHOMICIDE OFFICE \nTwo detectives throw their shoulders into the door. The rest crowd around them, foaming at the mouth to get inside to Max. \nOne more lunge... \nThe door SHATTERS, sending the detectives tumbling inside... \nALEX'S OFFICE \nPhotos and documents are scattered across the floor, over Alex's desk, mixed in with the fragments of the broken desk. \nFrom an open window, the storm's first flurries drift inside. \nMona flashes Max a look before POUNDING on a door. \nMONA (calling through the door) Owen, open up. \nA louder, longer KNOCK. \nMONA Open-- \nA muted SCREAM filters through the door, cutting her short. Max DRIVES his boot into the door, splintering the jam... \nINT. OWEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nMax and Mona rush into the room, breath smoking from the cold. All of the windows are open. Gusts of snow blow inside, drifts of white powder extending into the room... \nMAX (calling out) Owen? \nHe SCREAMS his response from the next room.    They rush... \nLIVING ROOM \n...through the door, weapons drawn.    Both stop short: \nOWEN GREEN is all alone in the room. SCREAMING, swatting at empty air around him, each limb moving a different direction. M ax lowers his pistol - ready for anything, not for this. \nOwen's feet slip over the snow, toes curling desperately on the ice, searching for traction as they slide closer... \nOWEN (breathless, to no one) Help me. \n...to an open window on the other side of the room. \nMONA Owen? \nHe doesn't seem to hear - sweat streams down his terrified face, snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest. Owen's eyes are instead drawn through the open windows... \n..where SILHOUETTES flicker against the storm-darkened sky. \nOblivious to the shapes outside, Max and Mona watch Owen's terror intensify, his dervish dance growing more frantic... \nOutside every window, BLACK SHAPES float closer in the air above the street - vaguely human, long wings POUNDING... \n...sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows, kicking up snow and ice. Max and Mona shrink back, shielding their eyes at the blast as Owen's tortured SCREAMS fill the room... \nTwisting like he's trying to pull free from invisible hands, Owen reaches the window. As if trying to push back, his hands and feet fly up to the trim around the window... \nMAX Owen, wait... \nUnable to turn around, Owen's eyes find the reflected images of Max and Mona in the window he's being pulled to... H is attention is torn from their reflections on top of the glass by the spectres looming beyond it outside. Their claws reach in, raking his body, pulling him closer... \nRealizing that Owen isn't stopping, Max rushes towards him. \nOWEN (screaming) Make them stop, tell them I can't fly... \nMax lunges forward, trying in vain to cover yards... \n...when Owen only has inches.    He's ripped into the void... \nEXT. OWEN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nMax throws himself forward into the window, looking down... \n...where Owen falls, looking up at Max helplessly... \n... then less terrified, as the wind keeps RUSHING past... \n...and then, just before impact, relieved. \nOwen CRASHES into the sidewalk. \nB \nMona races up to join Max in the window. For a stunned beat they look down at the shattered body of Owen Green - his unblinking eyes frozen on the heavens, collecting snowflakes. \nMONA (shaken) What did we just see? \nNo answer, Max studies Owen's twisted body. Long, finger- like bruises trace out from his neck, blending with the tattoos that lace his grey skin. Grinning skulls, the USMC eagle/globe/anchor... \n...and a pair of wings, just like Natasha's. I NT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT \nMax drops a Polaroid of Owen's tattoo onto a glass counter. \nlue water ripples through translucent pipes in the walls and floor, the air of the small room glowing like the ocean. A mirrored ceiling repeats the tattoo parlor again above. \nMAX You're sure this is the place? \nMONA Natasha had all her work done here. \nATTENDANT via intercom) If you're coming, you better come on. Way it's looking, might be the last train tonight. \nMax takes a step into the light of the ticket booth. The attendant opens the ticket slot, letting a gust of freezing air blow inside. Max slides a few bills through. \nTicket in hand, Max starts his solitary march to the trains. \nINT. GOGNITTI'S HOTEL - BAR - NIGHT A dingy, dark bar on the first floor of an even sleazier hotel. It's nearly empty, only the dedicated DRUNKS venturing out in the storm. The front door swings open... \nThe old men shiver at the stiff blast of wind rushing in, turning to look. Napkins flutter. Snowflakes blow inside. \nFrom a booth in the corner, VINNIE GOGNITTI (50s, pudgy) shoots a hard look at the open door, not immediately recognizing the SILHOUETTE in the passage... \nVINNIE In or out, asshole. \nMona steps inside, boots heavy with ice. Her MEN follow. Flanked by MEN of his own, Vinnie freezes when he sees Mona. \nVINNIE (CONT'D) So? \nMONA We need to talk. (beat) Talk. \nGradually, Vinnie and his men relax. \nVINNIE Shut the door, then. You Ruskies may be used to it, but I'm freezing my dick off over here. \nBACK OFFICE \nThey've packed into a tiny back office - Russian gunmen on one side of the desk, Italians on the other. Mona and Vinnie represent their different sides, the only people seated. \nVINNIE Okay.     So talk. \nMONA Something was taken from me. It involves a club in Italian territory, so I need your blessing to go make it right. V INNIE You're asking my permission? smirking to his men) Well in that case, sweetheart... \nM \nV \nMona looks Vinnie over, bored to death by the whole thing. \nMONA I said `blessing.' \nVINNIE Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra. Which club are we talking about? \nMONA Ragna Rok. \ninnie tries to keep a poker face, but the name chills him. \nMONA (CONT'D) Over on Avenue-- \nVINNIE Yeah, I know. (beat, rattled) Sure, fine. You have my permission...blessing, whatever. \nMona frowns, her wishes granted a little too easily. \nMONA You do still control that block, right? It's south of-- \nVINNIE The guy's name is Jack Lupino. \nMONA Well, that sounds Italian to me. \nVINNIE He's no kind of Italian I've ever seen. Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we hear. \nONA (sneering) You're afraid of tattoos, now? \nVINNIE When the club first opened, I sent somebody down to collect the...you know, fire insurance. A day goes by, and I don't see him. Then I get two boxes delivered to me. One box's got my guy's hands and ears in it. The other box has a quarter of a million dollars in cash. \nE \nM \nMONA This neighborhood has been your family's forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes to-- \nVINNIE What got my attention, Mona, was that the boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy in uniform hands them to me in broad daylight. (beat) I'm not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or mouthy Russian bitches. But whoever's watching over Lupino, whoever it is you really need to bless you walking inside Ragna Rok...him, I am scared of. \nEXT. SUBURBAN TRAIN STATION - NIGHT \nThe platform is cleaner than the ones in the city - dressed up for the tastes of the COMMUTERS who step off of the train. \nMax threads his way through the handful of exhausted BUSINESSMEN arriving home, moving out into the darkness. \nEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT \nThe snow's driving just as hard out here, but peaceful houses with warm windows glowing make the storm feel comforting. In the yards, forgotten sleds disappear under new powder, gone for good by morning. Snowmen distort as they swell. \nMax Payne trudges up the center of the street, a black streak spoiling the peace of the evening. A trespasser. T HE HOUSE \nOne house on the block stands out: there's no neatly shoveled driveway, no colorful Christmas lights flashing from the eaves. A black void behind every window, no life inside. \nMAX (calling, frantic) Michelle! \nMax throws his shoulder into the door, SNAPPING the hinges... \nB \nC \nT \nM \nBEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe momentum sends Max tumbling inside... \nA MAN slips out of the window, one leg still inside... \nax OPENS FIRE at the retreating shape. \nCurtains billow in front of the open window, a summer sunset outside. Max lets the gun fall to his side, breathing hard. M ichelle huddles on the bed, baby wrapped tight in her arms. Max rushes over to her, reaching out to touch her shoulder. \nMAX Michelle... \nHer mouth is wide open, eyes unfocused.    Muscles slack. \nMichelle's not stunned.    She's not unconscious. \nhe baby isn't just sleeping. \nThe moment that hits him, the lights go out of Max's eyes. \nUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMax stands at the door, seeing the room with those same eyes. \nThe furniture is gone, all the carpet ripped out. One window is still open, no frilly curtains blocking the blackness outside. Snow gusts in, piling on the sill. \nBB (V.O.) We looked everywhere for the third guy, but there was nothing to go on. Not a hair of him left behind. \nSlowly marching across the room, Max SLAMS the window shut. \nINT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBB stands in the window, watching the storm. \nB I called in a favor before I retired, had him transferred to Cold Case while he dealt with the shock of it. I thought it we were patient, gave him time, Max would come back to his old self again. \nBravura sits in front of the desk, watching BB. When BB finally looks over, the weight of the story showing in his eyes, Bravura's face B doesn't reveal any hint of emotion. \nB Look, I called you because I thought I recognized something in you. I thought if we could talk off the record-- \nBRAVURA I'm listening. \nBB (emotional) This isn't just some job stress freak- out. This is a man who lost everything, and who deserves a little understanding from the rest of us. If you'd known him before... (beat, pained) You'd want to believe him, too. \nBRAVURA Believe him about what? \nNot expecting this turn in the conversation, Bravura sits up. \nBRAVURA Are you saying you think Max did have something to do with Alex's murder? \nBB Absolutely not. Alex was his partner, they were like brothers...he couldn't have. There's no way. \nBRAVURA Then what are we talking about? \nBB Look, Max is like a son to me. Don't put me in a position to have to hang him. (beat, pained) But you should hear the kinds of things he's saying...hallucinations, none of it makes any sense to me. I'm worried he's going to get into another situation before I can convince him to come in. B RAVURA Are you telling me he was-- \nT \nB \nB \nB \nBB I'm telling you to find him tonight, before somebody else gets hurt. \nBravura nods, reeling from the revelation of this new information. BB picks up his coat and starts for the door. \nBB Is there anything we can do to help you bring him in? Unofficially, of course... \nBRAVURA Bringing him in won't be a problem. Where I need your help will be his-- \nAX Somebody at Aesir knows what-- \nBB (thunderstruck) Oh, my God. \nSlowly, BB turns to show Max the grief in his eyes. \nBB It's me.    I killed Alex. \nB \nY \nMAX What are you talking about? \nBB He came to me about six months ago, asking about one of the executives at Aesir. At the time I had no reason to connect it to Michelle, I just thought... (beat, torn up) I tried to warn him, this guy has connections to some scary people-- \nMAX Who?   What's his name? \nBB hesitates, rattled by the rage in Max's eyes. \nBB Jason Colvin. He used to be the head of the pharmaceutical division, but he's moved up over the last few years. (beat) I guess Michelle probably reported directly to him... \nMax barely nods, jaw clenched as he scoops up the documents. \nBB ou've got copies of this stuff, right? \nThinking for a moment, Max sets the folder down again and turns away towards the dark hallway. BB picks up the folder. \nBB e careful, Max. \nMax doesn't respond, storming off into the shadows. \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAWN \nThe snow isn't deep near the charred and twisted metal of the train, melted by the fireball. Police tape rings the area. D ETECTIVES wander between yellow tarps in the train, sipping coffee. Out on the tracks, Bravura works alone. \nHOMICIDE COP Looks like ten bodies, give or take. Even in New York, that ought to be enough to earn Payne the spike. \nY \nB \nBRAVURA The blast point is outside the train. \nNone of the detectives want to encourage him by answering. \nBRAVURA ased on the spread of the wreckage... they moving very fast, either. \nHOMICIDE COP He forced them to stop, first. \nBravura nods at the explanation, but without conviction.       He continues to scan the wreckage, still not satisfied... \nBRAVURA So he had the bomb with him inside, but he decided to walk outside to detonate it? \nHOMICIDE COP Are you asking if that seems like odd behavior from a guy who cut his partner's head off? \nThe Young Cop from the storage building slips down the snowy bank and towards Bravura. His face is bruised and swollen. \nOUNG COP You wanted to see me? \nHOMICIDE COP Careful what you say to him, if you ever want to make detective... \nYOUNG COP (to Bravura, guarded) I already filled out a report. \nBravura sees the Young Cop aware of the detective's presence. \nBRAVURA Show me where it happened, then. E XT. STORAGE FACILITY - MORNING \nBravura and the Young Cop stand on the spot where he fought Max the night before - disturbed snow, the frayed cord... \nYOUNG COP He jumped out and wrapped that cord around me, and before I had a chance... \nI \nA \nBravura nods at the bullshit, focus drawn to Max's locker. \nBRAVURA (pointing) He was coming out of here? \nWhen the Young Cop nods, Bravura starts to step inside. \nHOMICIDE COP Hey, real cops are working here... \nINT. MAX'S STORAGE LOCKER - MORNING \nMAX Michelle Payne was my wife. \nWhat color there was to begin with drains out of Colvin. \nCOLVIN What-- \nMAX Before you say anything else, I want you to know who I am. \nCOLVIN Please, wait... \nMax throws his elbow up, CRUSHING Colvin's nose. \nINT. AESIR BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY \nBravura enters the soaring lobby of the Aesir building, stomping his shoes clean. He approaches the front desk. \nBRAVURA (flashing his badge) I need to talk to somebody about a woman who used to work here. \nCOLVIN'S OFFICE \nColvin's eyes flutter open.   His nose is smashed flat. \nHe's being held upright by his belt, which loops around his neck and the headrest of his ergonomic chair. His wrists are bound to the armrests with strips of his tie. \nMax sits on the edge of the desk, heavy lamp in his hand. \nCOLVIN (weakly, eyeing the lamp) Please don't hit me again. \nMax wraps the cord in his hand and jerks it free from the lamp, which he tosses with a CRASH. The cord, he keeps. M AX A week ago, I thought the universe had turned against me. Everything I loved was gone, and for some reason I'd been left here to suffer alone. \nMax strips back the insulation on the cord, exposing two frizzed bundles of wire: one brass, the other silver. Positive and negative. Colvin watches, apprehensive. \nT \nB \nMAX ut it wasn't the universe that took my family away from me. \nMax plugs in the cord. \nMAX It was you. \nHe crouches by Colvin, wire in each hand, moving them closer. \nMAX Tell me about Valhalla. \nColvin struggles to pull away from the approaching wires... \nCOLVIN There is no-- \nMax brushes the bare wires against Colvin's throat. \nhere's a bright SPARK.       Colvin SCREAMS. \nMAX Tell me. \nCOLVIN There's no Project Valhalla anymore.   I shut it down years ago. \nA timid KNOCKING starts on Colvin's door, VOICES calling in. Max waits for more, eyes frozen, wires hanging ready. \nCOLVIN (reluctant) It was a disaster. The drug was so addictive, the damage it did to the mind was so devastating that we lost our government funding. By the end, we couldn't even guarantee the safety of our scientists administering the experiment. Test subjects would follow them home and kill them for an extra dose. M AX Is that what happened to Michelle? \nCOLVIN Nobody knows what happened to her. \nMax picks up a cup of coffee from the desk and pours it over Colvin's face as he struggles more frantically. \nC \nC \nMax brings the wires closer to Colvin's wet skin. \nOLVIN terrified) People thought Michelle might be a whistle-blower. That she wasn't loyal enough to Aesir, and she might go public about the program. \nMax's eyes thaw, hit by the first true words about her death. \nLOBBY \nBravura sits in the lobby, impatiently skimming a magazine. On the far side of the enormous room, movement draws his eye: \nA line of black-clad SECURITY GUARDS swiftly moving in formation into a stairwell. SWAT precision, heavy hardware. \nBravura springs up, approaching the Guards left at the door. \nGUARD Authorized personnel only. \nM \nL \nHe pulls the door shut. It won't. Something's blocking it. The guard stands up, opens it wider to build some momentum... \nMax stands on the top step. \nBACK ROOM \nLupino shoots up, gritted teeth tugging his belt tourniquet tight. Eyes clinched, beads of sweat already forming. \nThe muffled BLAST of a machine gun, out on the dance floor. The Guards surrounding Lupino spring into action. \nGUARD #1 W ait here, Mr. Lupino. \nLupino lets the belt slip free, a deep SIGH rattling out. He opens his eyes, just in time for us to see the irises retracting. Candles shine in the black holes left behind. \nUPINO I don't need protection.   I have my own. \nThe Guards at the door lock and load, moving out... \nBALLROOM \nMax walks into the ballroom, motionless Guard bleeding out on the dance floor before him. Gunsmoke hangs in the air... \nIn that final stillness, Max checks his clip.     Stone-faced. \nThundering BOOTS echo out from the belly of the building. Doors fly open - Guards racing out from the kitchen on the first floor, two more from the office CRASHING out upstairs. \nax OPENS UP, flames of automatic fire lighting his way. \nBACK ROOM \nLupino and the Guards listen to the SHOOTING grow closer. Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop. With lightning reflexes, THE GUARDS BLAST down the hallway. \nupino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle flash. Forgotten now, he fades away into the smoke. \nThe Guards crumble and fall until the room goes SILENT. M ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised.     Hunting. \nI \nC \nL \nU \nL \nThe back room is deeper than the poor light gives away. Max's boots grind over burned-out candles, occult runes... \nLupino launches out of the darkness at Max.   Before he sees it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull. \nMax stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow. Lupino draws a gleaming knife from his boot and springs on Max. \nupino swings the knife so quickly it becomes a blur, blade WHISTLING as it cuts through the smoke. He slashes the knife across Max's thigh, dropping him to the ground. \nnable to stand, Max thrusts the rifle up for protection. The blade CLANKS against the barrel, carving deep trenches in the stock, finally gashing the back of Max's fingers. \nBlood rushes from the cuts, loosening Max's grip on the weapon. Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands. \nupino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.    He CRIES OUT. \nLUPINO an you hear them, now? \nLupino drives his knee into Max's chest. Arm numb from the stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered. Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage... E XT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nOutside, no voice could carry on that raging WIND. TWO FIGURES walk up the street, closing slowly on Ragna Rok. \nNT. RAGNA ROK - BACK ROOM - NIGHT \nLupino leans over Max, one hand grinding the knife deeper into his shoulder, the other wrenching the machine gun free. Max desperately tries to dig his nails into the grip... \nLUPINO We'll see which one us they're flying for. We'll see who they love best. \nSweat streams down Lupino's face, dripping down onto Max. Fingernails splitting, Max finally loses hold of the gun. The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back. \nFor an instant, they are apart. \nS \nB \nY \nMAX No.   Just better than you. \nBB's smile seems to double.     He considers Max for a moment. \nBB For what it's worth, he didn't know Michelle was going to die. \nMax starts walking again, doesn't raise his eyes. The seed has been planted, though. BB plays with the silence. \nBB He thought they were going out there to scare her, destroy her research. \nM \nF \nT \nF \nFLASHBACK: MAX'S KITCHEN - DUSK \nLooking up from the mail, Max sees the smashed kitchen door. R ESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMax keeps walking, trying to fight off the memories. BB strolls along beside him, taking his time with the story. \nBB I'd arranged with the other guys to finish the job. \nLASHBACK: MAX'S HALLWAY - DUSK \nMax races into the hallway bathed in golden light. \nBetween Max and the end of the hall, two JUNKIES are huddled against a door. Twisting the handle, SMACKING the wood. \nBB (V.O.) He locked them out of the bedroom, tried CPR...boy scout shit. \nhe Junkies turn to Max, eyes black and glassy.   Sick smiles. \nRESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMax looks nauseous.    BB sees it, thrilled. \nBB (smiling) And as thanks, you nearly blew his head off while he crawled out the window. \nLASHBACK: MAX'S HALLWAY - DUSK \nMax throws his shoulder into the door, SNAPPING the hinges... \nBEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA MAN slips out of the window, one leg still inside... \nax OPENS FIRE at the retreating shape. \nRESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMax's gait begins to falter, lost in the memory he's played a thousand times, the images shifting to show something new... B B watches eagerly, waiting for what comes next... \nS \nM \nFLASHBACK: MAX'S BEDROOM - DUSK \nMax charges in, again firing on the man escaping... \n...but this time, we watch the glass behind the billowing curtains. The fabric ripples, revealing a reflection... \nAlex. \nBB (V.O.) That's funny, to me. \nA momentary flash of his profile, a mask of guilt and shame. \nRESUME - EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMax stops walking.   All of his will gone. \nBB steps closer, drinking in the pain in Max's eyes. \nBB You really didn't know? \nWith a shrug, BB turns away from Max's fury and moves on... \nINTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS \nAbove them, traffic signals strain under thick icicles. Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering. \nSalle grabs Max's arm. Max looks down at Salle's feet, hard- soled shoes slipping. Salle anticipates his next thought... \nAbruptly, Max jerks his arm away. \nNot able to let go in time, Salle's feet fly out from under him. The big man crashes down hard on his side. \nMax ducks and stumbles forward... \nBB FIRES, missing. Max looks back. Beached on his side, Joe Salle draws his pistol, the next shot coming any moment... \nMax slips. Struggling to right himself, hands scraping over rough planks, another shot CRACKS inches from Max's legs... \nWith nowhere else to go, Max turns to the water. Boots slipping, he lunges for the edge, careening over... \nRIVER - CONTINUOUS \nMax SPLASHES down into the dark water, body twisted in an awkward position, wind blasted from his lungs by the impact. SHOTS from the pier above CUT into the water around him... \nMax dives under as much as he can stand it in the frigid water, swimming farther from shore. Shots continuing to SPLASH around him, the current pulls him into deeper water... P IER \nBB and Salle FIRE with less conviction. In the water, the disturbance made by Max grows smaller as he's swept away. \nBB lowers his gun, motioning for Salle to do the same. \nBB It's fine, as cold as that water is... (beat) Just in case, though. Make sure. \nSalle frowns, shoots BB a look. \nJOE SALLE How? \nRIVER \nMax lifts his head. The wide expanse of the river stretches around him, surface broken by swirling pocks of falling snow. \nThe current caries him farther from piers and buildings receding into snow, as black as the water they rise above. Turning, Max sees that the opposite shore is even farther. \nSlowly, the exhilaration of escape begins to change. Icy water bites his skin. Muscles beginning to tremble... \nLimbs heavy with saturated clothing, joints seized by cold, Max tries to swim against the current with little success. \nMax sinks lower, churning water lapping his face.    GASPING BREATHS becoming SPUTTERING COUGHS... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - TWILIGHT (VISION) \nMax moves down the hallway, the familiar golden light.    Boots A stepping quiet, past the bloody and motionless bodies. \nt the bedroom's door, Max pauses.   Unable to go through. \nMichelle's body faces away, bundle cradled in her arms. \nAs Max stands watching, Michelle's body stirs... \nEXT. RIVER - NIGHT \nMax breaks the surface: COUGHING, GASPING, flailing his arms. It's hopeless; he immediately begins to sink again. Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing. \nMax Payne slips under without so much as a ripple. \nINT. HALLWAY - TWILIGHT (VISION) \nTentatively, Max crosses the threshold into the bedroom. \nMichelle's eyes open, aware that she's being watched from the doorway. She looks up at Max, a lazy smile forming. \nThe bundle of blankets stirs. Michelle grins down at their infant daughter, offering her finger to the tiny pink hand. \nMax edges closer, overwhelmed by the sight. Michelle pats the bed beside them, inviting Max to sit. He doesn't move. \nM \nH \nC \nH \nC \nMICHELLE Are you home? \nFor a long moment, Max drinks in the sight of his family... \nEXT. RIVER - PRE-DAWN \n...where a row of more GUARDS are handcuffed to a bench. \nU         RANKING OFFICER nder what authority are you interrogating these men? \nRAVURA An investigation into departmental corruption. They're material witnesses-- \nRANKING OFFICER Just between you and me, I wouldn't count on these men being any kind of witnesses at all. I served with a few of them, and remember what kind of officers they were. \nFrom the bench, Bravura sees the smirks from the Guards. \nBRAVURA What kind would that be? \nRANKING OFFICER Cops.   Real cops. \nAt the far end of the hall, a group of serious-looking men in DARK SUITS file out of the elevator. Bravura cracks a smile. \nRANKING OFFICER o offense. \nThe Suits get closer, revealing badges on their belts.   FBI. \nBRAVURA None taken. (to the lead agent) Agent Taliente, I'd like you to meet a real cop. \nThe Ranking Officer and the Agent shake hands.    Icy. \nStanding in the doorway of an office down the hall, a DETECTIVE shrinks back to his desk and picks up the phone. \nDETECTIVE (on phone) Let me talk to BB. \nEXT. ASGARD BUILDING - NIGHT \nWith dead streetlights, the hulking black shape of the Asgard building looms like a mountain at the end of the block. \nax moves up the street, steam rising from his clothes as they dry from the heat of his skin. Sweat beads on his face. \nMax enters Asgard's courtyard, the Gothic facade rising high above. He passes through its security lights, shadow casting down onto the clean white snow like a projection screen... \nInvisible to the naked eye, more shadows of winged shapes dart and swoop in the air above Max's outline on the snow. \nINT. ASGARD BUILDING - BB'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBB POUNDS the receiver down onto the phone, CRACKING the base. Joe Salle watches him angrily pulling on his coat. \nJOE SALLE What's going on downtown? \nBB Bravura called in the Feds. \nBB storms for the door, surprised to turn back and see that Salle hasn't followed him. The big man scowls, nervous. \nBB or God's sake, come on. Max is dead, they've got nothing else. \nENTRY HALL \nBB and Salle storm down the steps into the main entry hall. \nB Get up to the armory, hide the-- \nSalle grabs BB by the arm. \nOn the floor between them and the front door, two guards sprawl face-down in enormous pools of their own blood. \nJOE SALLE He's not dead. He's here. \nBB Bullshit.    There's no way-- \nAt that moment, they both see movement in the shadows... \nMax steps forward into the light - soaked in blood up to his elbows, eyes black and animalistic. No longer himself. \noe Salle reaches for his pistol. With freakish reflexes, Max raises one of the guard's machine guns and OPENS FIRE. \nBB and Salle fall back, diving into an ancient elevator car. Slugs ricocheting, BB and Salle struggle to shut the doors. \nFrom Max's POV: as the elevator doors slam shut, a glimpse of BB's face stretching and distorting into a demonic grin... \nELEVATOR \nBB and Salle watch the floor number rise.       BB finds his cell. \nJOE SALLE Who are you calling? \nBB Her. \nBy Salle's face, that's a thought scarier than Max. \nINT. AESIR BUILDING - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT \nCrashing back into Max's perspective, a RUSHING WIND presses down from the black clouds above, the darkness spreading. Max's legs buckle, his machine gun scattering SHOTS... \nThe room goes darker as it gets louder, light blotted out by WINGED CREATURES drifting down from above, circling closer... \nMax stumbles, buffeted by their POUNDING WINGS. CHOKING on sulfurous smoke, hair smoldering, skin starting to singe... \nANOTHER HALLWAY \nA small group of Guards race forward, dodging the bodies of others Max met along the way. They hesitate, form ranks... \nGREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS \n...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room. \nIt is silent. Smokeless. Just a hall. Blood streaks the walls, flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead GUARDS. At the far end of the hall, something moves: \nMax. On his hands and knees, rivers of sweat flowing. Confused, the group of Guards approach Max. Weapons ready. \nMAX'S HALLUCINATION \nCrushed inside the DEAFENING blackness, Max lifts his eyes to see LEERING DEMONS gazing down, distorted versions of... \nGREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS \n...the four Guards, who look down on Max's trembling, sweat- logged body on the floor. He's MUTTERING, CHANTING... \nSo easy it almost doesn't seem fair, a Guard aims his pistol. \nSuddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind. No chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of machine gun fire. They fall around Max, joining the rest. \nGun smoking, Mona rushes up the hallway to Max. \nMAX'S HALLUCINATION \nThe Demons fade away, their howling SCREAMS lingering behind. Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else: White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two. \nGREAT HALL \nMona kneels down over Max, lifting up his head. Max's skin is pale, slick like melting wax. His eyes are empty. \nThere's nothing gentle in her touch - she SLAMS Max's head back onto the cold marble, jerking him up again by his hair. \nMONA Max! \nGradually, Max's black eyes start to find Mona's face. M AX'S HALLUCINATION \nThe white light grows brighter, blasting away shadows and smoke. In its center, traces of Mona's face appear. \nGREAT HALL \nMax starts to sit up, gazing with confusion at the hallway. \nMONA You don't have much time. \nMax nods.    No idea if he understands, Mona helps him up. \nMONA I'll do what I can to slow them down, but you have to hurry. \nMax looks back at Mona, clearly having some idea of what that means for her. They look at each other for a long moment. \nMONA You're not done yet. \nEXT. ASGARD BUILDING - ROOF - DAWN \nSickly light glows in the east. The snow has all but stopped. BB strides across the roof, hope in his eyes. \nBB (on phone) The weather's broken, your pilot is going to have no problem landing. \nINT. AESIR SKYSCRAPER - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - DAWN \nNicole Horne sits at her desk, watching the storm recede. \nA red light flashes on her phone.     She ignores it. \nINT. ASGARD BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAWN \nJoe Salle kneels over a pile of C4 bricks, wiring a bomb. He tenses, hearing something in the hall behind him. Raising his hands and turning slowly, he finds Mona waiting. \nMONA Where's the detonator? \nSlowly, Salle holds it out for Mona.     She grabs the remote. \nJOE SALLE There's more like this all over. Even if the building doesn't collapse, this floor is gone. (beat) Careful with that thing, is what I'm saying. I'm sure you and I can work something out. \nSuddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. RAGNA ROK - DUSK \nIn a block of abandoned storefronts, only one retains a spark of life, its red sign burning in the dying light: RAGNA ROK. T he streets are more crowded there, people shuffling towards that sign and the sounds of DARK MUSIC filtering from inside. \nINT. MAX'S CAR - DUSK \nMax's car turns onto the block, slowly approaching Ragna Rok. Max and Mona silently absorb the scene on the street. Even from halfway down the block, BASS from the club reaches them. \nMONA They all look... \nAcross the street, Max watches someone dragging a limp body by one leg. Nobody he walks past seems to notice. \nMAX Like Owen. \nMax keeps his speed slow, idling away up the block. \nMAX This isn't anything I've seen before. \nM \nRagna Rok recedes in the mirror, the block between it and the car studded with more smoldering cars and dead-eye faces, their numbers seeming to grow even as Mona watches. \nONA (CONT'D) You ever been to Rome? \nMax doesn't answer, the coming plague before him registering. Mona glances up at a passing street sign - \"LITTLE ITALY.\" \nMONA (CONT'D) Better cities than this one have fallen. (pointing to the curb) This is far enough. \nMona opens her car door and climbs out, leaning back inside. \nMONA (CONT'D) Sorry about the chain. \nMona SLAMS the door and moves off down the sidewalk, blending into the crowd. Max drops the car into gear, giving one last glance to Ragna Rok before pulling away. T here's some flicker of movement on the rooftop... \nU EXT. RAGNA ROK - ROOFTOP - DUSK \np on the roof, MUSIC inside the club RATTLES old pipes. Perched at the edge of the roof, a figure CHANTS along... \nJack Lupino - the tattooed face we caught   a glimpse of in the candle light of Trevor's party, now fully   visible in the failing sun and no less frightening. His    colorless eyes absorb the street, the SCREAMS, Max's car   pulling away... \nOn his back, the tattoos of two elaborate black wings. Steam rises from ink-blackened skin, snow melting before it lands. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMax sits in his chair in the silent room, turning the pages of Michelle's book. There's more than grief on his cut and bruised face tonight, hands not trembling the way they were. \nFruit bowls, delicate charcoal nudes flip past... \nFrustrated, Max lets the images drift by with less sentiment: images no longer speaking to the questions he needs answered. With an exasperated sigh, Max slams the book closed... \nA faint white sliver appears in the cover. \nT \nMax leans closer. It's the corner of a piece of paper, protruding from a razor-thin cut in the spine of the sketchbook, invisible under all but the closest inspection. \nMax runs his thumbnail into the gap, spreading glue CRACKLING - he flinches, almost afraid to cause the book pain. F or a moment, Max is caught between his desire to protect the memento and to see what's hidden inside. A deep breath... \nWith a sharp pull, the cover of the book SHEARS away. \nThe pages wad and wrinkle, old paint flaking off. The cover he'd caressed RIPS. Fluttering to the floor, a sheaf of yellowed pages hidden in the cover flutter to the floor. \nMax opens the folded pages. The first is nearly identical to what we saw inside: a bouquet of flowers, unfinished. Max scrutinizes the pencil strokes...suddenly, his eyes go wide: \nA little pair of bat-like wings. In the corner of the page, having nothing to do with the rest of the still life. \nMax turns to the next page. There's a another drawing of wings - larger this time, pencil strokes more energetic. \nHorrified by what he's seeing, Max's hands tremble as they turn the page. On the next, the wings are the main drawing. \nOn the next, they're scrawled in smeared ink. \nMAX (nauseous, to himself) No... \nThe wings begin to lose their shape, overlapping. \nGrowing together. \nThe last page is completely black. \nINT. COP BAR - NIGHT \nEven with everybody out of uniform, the builds and body language mark this as a cop bar. BB rushes inside, hair giving him away as having been asleep shortly before. \nhe bar is still decorated with plastic mistletoe and fake snow. BB looks at the BARTENDER, who motions to the back... \n", "test1_true": "BB fights his way to a corner booth, where Max is slumped over a beer and a shot. A matching set wait for BB across the table. BB pulls off his coat and sits, forced casual. \nBB It was sitting at this very table that your father told me I needed to retire. (beat) For about a minute, I just sat here thinking about knocking him out of his chair. The job was everything to me, to the point that I couldn't see the writing on the wall - what it was doing to my marriage, my health. Your old man knew if I was going to listen to reason, it B            could only happen in here. \nB stoops down to find Max's eyes, trying for a connection. \nBB There's nothing you can't say in here. It's like hallowed ground. \nFor a long beat, Max works up the nerve to speak. \nMAX I watched a guy throw himself out of a window tonight. The things he was saying- \nBB Any guy who throws himself out a window, I wouldn't pay any attention to the things he said. \nMAX The problem is, I knew what he was talking about. \nBB tries to nod his understanding, but concern creeps in. \nMAX I haven't been really afraid of anything since...that night. \nBB And you are now? \nMAX There's something going on, and I can't find a rational explanation for it. (MORE) \nB \nM \nB \nMAX(CONT'D) There's...something out there, hurting people-- \nBB Okay, calm down. \nMAX It's real.     I'm not crazy. \nBB Then stop acting like it. Max, you're breaking into offices, I.A. is all over you, you won't even show up for work... \nMAX The night Alex died, there was something else in the room with us. I saw it. \nB B goes a bit pale, smile fading as Max's words continue. \nB It's really important that you be careful how you talk to people about this, okay? You're already under suspicion-- \nMAX It's the same thing these people are seeing right before they die. (beat, pained) I think Michelle saw it, too. \nBB For God's sake, don't drag her into this. \nax stands up, storming towards the exit. BB pulls out a thick money clip and overpays before following... \nEXT. COP BAR - NIGHT \nBB rushes out, struggling to keep up with Max's longer legs. \nBB What's really going on here? \nMAX Alex found something out about what happened to her. Something new. \nB There's no way.    He would have told us. \nMAX He was trying, right before he died... \nBB Listen, okay? Why don't you come back with me, let Beth make up the guest room for you. Just for tonight. \nMax nods, but keeps moving away from BB. \nBB You need to take some time. Get some sleep, heal up. See if it still feels real after that... \nMAX It's real. \nMax crosses against the light, cutting through the driving snow. BB tries to follow, but traffic pushes him back. H elpless, BB can only bury his hands in his pockets and watch Max fade away. After a moment, he pulls something out... \nA business card: `J. BRAVURA, I.A.' \nEXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT \nIn a ticket booth, an elderly ATTENDANT shivers by a space heater, ticket windows plugged with make-shift insulation. \nThe attendant looks up from his book and sees Max approaching through the snow. Max slows as he gets closer, looking up at the glowing threshold to the trains beyond. He stops. \nATTENDANT (via intercom) You riding? \nMax holds for a moment. For all the danger he's faced, this is the most hesitation we've seen from him so far. \n", "test1_id": 2760, "test2_input": "YOUNG COP Yeah? Is that what you said to your partner? \nMAX You don't understand. \nYOUNG COP (gesturing with the gun) Lay down on your face. \nMax studies the cop - stiff legs unsteady on the deep snow, his frostbitten fingers wrapped around the trigger. Trapped between two rows of locked doors, Max has no cover to run. \nPeeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor. \nT \nMAX (bending down) Okay, just take it easy. \nMax starts to lay down, causally laying his hand over the power cord. The cop edges closer, smirking as Max complies. \nYOUNG COP Word's gotten around about the sick shit you did to him, too. If I were you, I'd get ready for sort of a long ride back into the city... \nMax wraps his hand around the cord and whips it tight... \nThe cop pitches backward, squeezing off a SHOT as he falls. Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a T knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away. \nhe cop twists in the extension cord, unplugging the lights. Max DRIVES the butt of the pistol into the side of his head. \nhe cop goes limp. Max pulls the clip, clears the chamber and lets the gun fall in the snow beside the unconscious cop. \nStruggling to his feet, Max races down the corridor and scaling the icy chain link. He drops into the snow, immediately breaking into a dead run on the other side. \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nAn express elevator HISSES upwards at great speed, the sleek interior like a European sports car. Alone inside, Jason Colvin watches the blur of numbers with dread. \nA muted CHIME, and the doors draw back... \nINT. AESIR SKYSCRAPER - PENTHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT \nThin steel beams loft through the air, three stories of open air encased by glass, a silent void projected into the heart of the storm. In the center of the room, a single black bar. \nIt's a desk, obsidian, polished to a mirrored sheen. Aesir International's cool blue logo reflects across its surface. \nJason Colvin approaches the desk, nervously watching the shadowed figure of Nicole Horne read through a document. Every hair, every stitch of clothing perfect. F ootsteps ECHOING, he reaches the desk and waits for a beat. \nO \nM \nN \nCOLVIN We have a problem. \nicole cuts her eyes to Colvin - withering, a current of fear passing through him. With great effort, she smiles. \nINT. TRAIN - NIGHT \nMax slumps in his seat, watching the black sky whip past. The manila folder closed in his hands, fingers tracing the edges. Slowly, carefully, he lets the folder fall open. \nMax's eyes skim across the handwritten notes, lingering over underscored phrases and circled words. Drinking it in. \nOn the next page, a sketch of black wings pulls Max's attention. With dread, he reads a note below the drawing: \nSUBJECTS DESCRIBE DEMONIC VISIONS, HYSTERICAL RAGE...' \nMAX (to himself) Subjects? \nThe hypnotic motion of the train begins to change, the rhythm of the RAILS faltering a little. \nax turns the page. More wings, each in a slightly different style, each version surrounded by descriptive notes... \nMax skims, excited, as the train's HICCUPS grow worse... \nAs the blue and black world sweeps past outside the window, Max's face softens almost into a smile... \nAll the lights go out.    The train rapidly loses speed... S tartled voices MURMUR. Windows that had been black glow to life as the passengers' eyes adjust to the dark car... \nutside, the moonless night becomes a hazy expanse of blue snow, covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and the broken-down houses in the distance. \nThe darkness changes Max, too, hardening his face again. He tucks the folder safely into his coat and zips it up tight. \nAt the front of the car, the windows begin to fill with light. The door opens, a flashlight beam sweeps inside... \nPistol between his knees, Max pulls the hammer back... \nC \nAn obese CONDUCTOR (40s) steps inside. Immediately, all of the other passengers begin to QUESTION HIM at once. \n", "test2_true": "Movement outside catches Max's eye. A FIGURE in the shadows alongside the train. Gravel CRUNCHES. Voices WHISPER. \nCONDUCTOR (cont'd) Our policy is to move everyone up to the front car until the lights come on again. It'll be a little warmer if we're all together... M ax splits his attention between the other passengers and the window, watching for more movement outside... \nSuddenly, the Figure breaks in the opposite direction - no attempt at quiet, a POUNDING run away from the train. \nonfused, Max straightens up.    The temperature has changed... \nTHREE MORE FIGURES, running in the opposite direction.    Away from the train, up the snowy tracks it's yet to cross. \nMAX (recognizing) Get out of the train. \nPASSENGERS fill the aisle. High school girls sneaking into the city... An old man going to work... Drunk yuppies in red and green scarves, on their way back from a Holiday party... \nMAX (shouting) Get out-- \nAn EXPLOSION rips through the front of the car and swells, a ball of fire smashing through the car and blowing it apart... \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nUp and down the dark street, shadowed GHOULS break windows and claw at abandoned cars, searching for anything of value. \nF \nW \nM \nMoving comfortably through the shadows, Mona follows the general movement towards a BASSY QUAKE farther up the block. \nA red neon `RAGNA ROK' bloodies the snow in the air, marking the entrance to the club responsible for the RUMBLE... I NT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nInside, that music is EARSPLITTING - a jet engine at 200 beats per minute. Lights strobe past red gels, frozen glimpses of thin limbs and black pupils on the dance floor. \nona melts into a corner, inconspicuously watching the room. \ninding around the dance floor, CLUBGOERS - some ragged, some in nice clothes - queue at a metal door in the back wall. One after another, they wait for their moment to enter... \nThere's a disturbance at the front door. Black-clad Guards force open a rift in the crowd on the dance floor... \nJack Lupino walks inside the rift - his tattooed face red and black, eyes calmly sweeping out across the riotous crowd... \nROM THE DANCEFLOOR \nLupino moves through bodies roiling like a parted sea, sheer walls of twisting flesh towering above him to the rafters. \nMixed within, the wings POUND and SWEEP, blotting the light. \nHell. \nINT. BB'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBB crawls out from under the quilts, careful not to wake his WIFE. He passes windows frosted with ice, on his way to... \nHALLWAY \nBB shuffles down the hall, shivering in his boxers. He pauses at the thermostat, frowning to find the heat cut off. B B turns, startling as Max steps out of the shadows - steps stiff with pain, clothes dripping icy water across the floor. \nBB (terrified) Max? What are you doing? \nMax opens his coat and pulls out the file, now badly wrinkled and soggy. He opens it and hands BB a newspaper clipping. \nM I \nB \nM \n`25 CIVILIANS KILLED IN AL-HASAMAH MASSACRE' \nBB Those grunts who went crazy in Iraq? \nAX Go a little further, read what they did to the bodies. It's the same as what happened to Alex and that girl. \nBB reads on, frowning. \nB Where did you get this? \nMAX Michelle. \nBB looks up, startled, as Max pages through Michelle's notes. \nMAX It's all in her notes: people describing fevers, hallucinations...their lymph nodes swell until their necks bruise like something's been choking them. (pointing to the drawings) The angels they all talk about? Michelle talks about eye spasms that make things seem to flutter. Mixed with the other delusions, that starts looking like wings... (beat) She wasn't seeing them. She was trying to figure out why other people were. B B thought she was working on allergy medicines. \n", "test2_id": 2761, "test3_input": "Max launches himself into the air, pistol CRACKING as he falls. Bullets RIP through the retreating Guards... \nMax hits the ground hard, scrambling through the exit... \nANOTHER HALL \n...and around the corner. \nBRAVURA (shouting) Put your hands up! \nMax slides to a stop, startled to see Bravura aiming at him. While he doesn't exactly comply, Max does lower the barrel. \nBRAVURA (more human) You need to come in now, before anything else gets pinned on you. \nax shakes his head.       HEAVY BOOT STEPS rumble closer... \nMAX She was trying to stop it. \nBRAVURA Stop what?     Tell me what's happening-- \nS \nA \nG \nBullets STRAFE the wall just above Max's head.

Bravura and the Guards search... \n..but Max has disappeared into the smoke. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMona struggles up a narrow street, buffeted by the wind. Ahead, flashing blue and red lights electrify the snow. \nsquad car idles towards her, searchlight flashing into dark shadows. Mona ducks her head away as the spotlight finds her at her building door. For a moment, she's in a whiteout. \nlowly, the cop car moves on. Mona starts to use her key... but the lock has already been forced open. \nINT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMona steps inside, ready for ambush.    She turns the corner... \nMax sits on her couch, scraped and scorched from his escape. M AX (pointing to the TV) You need to see this. \nON SCREEN: \nOver black, the Aesir corporate logo flashes up, quickly replaced by a simple block-letter title card: \nPROJECT VALHALLA: PROMOTIONAL SPOT #3' \nS \nS \nO \nA \nO \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) From the beginning of time, great generals have all wrestled with one undeniable truth - morale wins battles. \nver an up-tempo ROCK SOUNDTRACK, a slick montage of war imagery: tanks roaring over sand dunes, missiles ripping through palace walls, American troops firing machine guns... \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fear, fatigue, loss of focus...the future of combat medicine lies in the mind of the soldier. \nA cutting-edge lab, SCIENTISTS working complex machinery. \nNNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D) Thanks to breakthroughs made by Aesir Pharmaceuticals, the military of tomorrow will be able of unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier. \nn screen, the shot cuts to the interview of a YOUNG SOLDIER in uniform. He smiles easily, confident, eyes alert but maybe a little distant. Something familiar about him... \nH         YOUNG SOLDIER (V.O.) ow has my experience in combat changed since being selected for Project Valhalla?

There's already something in his eyes, though. \nAs Mona sits back down, Max brushes past her to get his coat. \nONA So what do we do now? \nMax stands up from the couch and starts away. Confused, Mona tries to follow, but stumbles when something pulls her back: \nhe looks down to see she's been handcuffed to her chair. \nMONA What are you doing? (beat, louder) Uncuff me. (beat, louder still) Hey! \nOn screen, Lupino smiles, beads of sweat forming on his face. Deliberately, Max stops the DVD and cuts off the television. \nW         MONA hat is this? You think just because he killed your partner, you can decide whether I-- \nWhen Max finally speaks, the sound scrapes out of his throat like he hasn't used his voice in years: \nMAX He killed my wife. \nMona struggles at the cuff, chain CLANKING but holding. \nMONA I've been inside that club.   You don't have a chance on your own. (realizing) But you don't care. \nMax stoops down to pick up Mona's machine gun where it leans against the base of the couch.

RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nThe red neon sign is only an ember, muted under caked ice. \nn a chair blocking the front door, a GUARD watches the silent street, shivering uncontrollably. \nNT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nInside, the dance floor is empty. Sitting at the top of the stairs, another GUARD sleeps, rifle propped beside him. \nACK ROOM \nA room like the inside of a smoker's lung - walls painted black, haze from candles and whatever else blurring the air. Jack Lupino sits on the floor surrounded by candles, watching the flames with manic focus. Two GUARDS stand above him. I nto a bent spoon, Lupino taps greenish powder from a small glass vial. He uses the candle to heat the spoon. Checking his watch, one of the guards produces a cell phone and dials. \nGUARD #1 (on phone) All quiet, 4 a.m. \nLupino dips a needle into the spoon, drawing the bubbling green liquid into the body of the syringe. \nXT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT \nThe guard stomps his feet, trying in vain to keep some blood flowing. Blowing in his hands, he looks both ways down a street that is still just as empty as it has been for hours. \nGUARD (chattering, to himself) Screw this... \nFrozen fingers fumbling with the keys, the Guard opens the door.

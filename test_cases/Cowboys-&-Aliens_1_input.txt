SWEET JESUS!!! 
THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN 
SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND -- ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE. So are the COWS. PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range. 
INT. GOLD LEAF SALOON - NIGHT 
THE BATWING DOORS SWING OPEN: The Man In Black enters with the dog, tips his hat to a couple WHORES. They GRIN, liking what they see. RANCH HANDS drink their pay. Behind the bar, a MAN and WOMAN argue. DOC and MARIA; she's a buxom Mexican beauty; he's 300 roly-poly pounds of ANXIOUS CASTILIAN JEALOUSY: 
DOC -- I know you are, don't lie to me! 
MARIA How many times do we have to do this, Arturo? J. love you. 
DOC Really? Do you?!? (holds up a POCKETWATCH) I found this in our bed! And I don't k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon! She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this: 
MARIA We have customers. And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses: 
DOC 
AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!! Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS. The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate: 
ATTICUS That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down. 
MARIA Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde. Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods: 
THE MAN IN BLACK I'm looking for a woman. She gestures to the WHORES -- 
MARIA What kind? 
THE MAN IN BLACK This kind. He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN. 
MARIA Never seen her before. But she is beautiful. (pours him whiskey; then one for herself) Here's to you finding her, Senor. ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another: 
MARIA (CONT'D) You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into? 
THE MAN IN BLACK No. But I figured I'd be safe in here seein' as how that boy I tossed off his horse didn't wanna burn your saloon. Maria's eyes go down. Somehow GUILTY. But then: 
MARIA It's not the boy you should worry about. 
(OMINOUS) It's his papa. 
EXT. RANCH - NIGHT 
POV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp: 
DOLARHYDE Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough. 
His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER: 
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been working for me two weeks now, and I haven't had the pleasure. Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE: 
CLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't 
STEAL YOUR-- -- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses -- STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS -- 
DOLARHYDE Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish. 
(THEN) You partial to history? Here's a primer, 
LISTEN CLOSE: He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE. Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL: 
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Following the War Of Northern Aggression -- what some ironically refer to as the "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation- wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail. (stops: the WHIP) Watched him work this lash, driving those steer til his fingers bled... but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy? And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt... 
ROY CLANTON Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a light in the sky -- blue -- and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone!

LAIRD We were satisfied. 
Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and disappoints them. 
JOE Were you satisfied, or were you pleased? 
Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering. 
LAIRD We were satisfied. 
Joe refers to legal documents. 
JOE Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct? 
LAIRD That's correct. 
JOE According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that? 
LAIRD I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment. 
Joe takes on a street-tough tone: 
JOE Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not? 
LAIRD We won. 
JOE Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you? 
LAIRD It satisfied me. 
Joe STARES at the guy. 
JOE It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree? 
LAIRD I might. 
JOE Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind. 
LAIRD Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
JEROME GREEN CROSS-EXAMINING LAIRD (INT./DAY). 
JEROME GREEN Partner Robert Seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit? 
MR. LAIRD That's right. 
JEROME GREEN Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial? 
MR. LAIRD Often, he does. 
JEROME GREEN As far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was simply following orders. 
LAIRD That's a fair assessment of the situation. 
Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who meets his gaze.

Jill's POV on a placard: "AIDS Cures Homosexuality!" 
A TV CREW shines HOT LIGHTS on Andrew. 
TV REPORTER (ANGELA MEDINA) Do you see this as a gay rights issue? 
ANDREW I'm not political. I just want compensation for being fired. 
REPORTER MEDINA But you are gay, aren't you?

ON THE TV SCREEN: A microphone is shoved at Joe. 
REPORTER MEDINA "Do you believe that homosexuals deserve special treatment?" 
FILKO Hell, no! 
JOE (on TV) "Angela, we're standing in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, the birthplace of freedom, where our Founding Fathers authored the Declaration of Independence. And I don't remember that glorious document saying "All straight men are created equal." I could have sworn it says, "All men are created equal." 
CHARLIE THE COP Give me a goddamn break!

CLOSE ON a Heavy Kid leans over the pool PUKING. Wider...Mike beside him while Kids cheer the Heavy Kid on. 
MIKE I'm so dead. 
Mike turns, finds SCARLET making her way through the crowd. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Oh no! 
Mike rushes over to her. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Scarlet, what are you doing here? 
SCARLET I'm looking for Alex. It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone. Is he here? 
MIKE Yeah, he's fine.   He's with his girlfriend. 
SCARLET Alex has a girlfriend? 
MIKE He does and she's really cute. Come on. 
Mike leads Scarlet away from the pool. 
INT. FERRARI - NIGHT 
Ed and Julie drive through the upscale neighborhood. 
JULIE How did you get your hands on the 5th edition? That's not due out for another three years. 
ED I have two words for you.    Russian mafia. 
JULIE Drive faster. 
He steps on the gas. He fishtails around a corner. Cars pack Ed's street and driveway. Boys and girls trample the front lawn. One BOY urinates in a flower bed. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Calm thyself, Marius. 
ED That little-!   I'll kill him! 
Ed double parks the car, jumps out. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ed storms up the driveway.    Julie hurries after him.   A KID spies Julie, calls out- 
KID It's Ms. Goodwin!    Run! 
All the Kids on the lawn SCATTER in different directions. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ed and Julie enter the crowded, loud room. Kids dance, stomp around on the furniture. A furious Ed screams- 
ED Everybody out!   Get out!   Get out! 
Nobody flinches.   Julie WHISTLES loudly.   The Kids stop. 
JULIE This party is over! If you don't want to spend the next 3 months in detention you will leave...now! 
The Kids BEELINE for the door.    Ed stops a GIRL. 
ED Do you know where Mark Freedman is? 
GIRL I think I saw him go outside. 
SPLAT. A slice of pizza falls from the ceiling onto Ed's head. The Girl laughs, exits. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Maggie enters, weeds through the crowd, bumps into the Bras. 
MAGGIE Have you seen Mark? 
SAMANTHA We're looking for him too. 
Maggie scowls, heads for the back door.     The Bras chase.

NORMAN "Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids... 
BETH Squids? 
NORMAN "... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster." 
He looks up from the book, realizing something... 
BETH Norman? 
SNAPS the book closed. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
CLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks.  Turning pages. 
TEARS off the first Jerry transmission. 
Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall. 
BETH Norman, what is it? 
Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER. 
CUT TO: 
THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor. 
Norman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM 
Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of paper... 
NORMAN After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. 
BETH Manifested? 
NORMAN Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And -- 
Norman stops, staring at the pad. 
NORMAN He translated it wrong. 
BETH What? 
Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads... 
NORMAN Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?...  My name is Harry. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters... 
NORMAN (O.S.) Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. 
BETH (O.S.) What do you mean, a part of Harry? 
BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM 
NORMAN When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. 
BETH You think, in the sphere -- 
NORMAN He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things. 
BETH But how? 
NORMAN I don't know. 
BETH How can the sphere do that? 
NORMAN I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... 
BETH Which I told Barnes was attacking -- 
NORMAN It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. 
BETH But why is he doing it? 
NORMAN He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream. 
BETH His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? 
NORMAN (shaking his head) No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible? (off her look) It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are. 
CUT TO: 
IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS 
It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep. 
BETH (O.S.) And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested. 
NORMAN (O.S.) Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control. 
Harry opens his eyes, stares at us. 
WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING... 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across... 
"CQX VDX MOP LKI... " 
Beth and Norman watch... 
NORMAN Looks like some sort of code. 
BETH Why would Harry go back to using a code? 
HARRY (O.S.) You mean Jerry, don't you? 
Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room. 
BETH Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I? 
HARRY That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.

{"test1_input": "WALTER Yeah, why? \nPILOT He saw I worked my controls with it. He's shooting photos of people working. That's why he's on that ship. I'm taking some radio parts out there in fifteen minutes. Their radio's fucked. \nWALTER Man, I really need to contact him. We're in a transition period and-- \nPILOT You could contact him by coming with me. Then contacting him. In person. On the boat. \nWALTER ...Can't we just call them? I could ask him on like the boat phone. \nPILOT The Ship to shore. \nWALTER Can I just ask him on the \"ship to shore?\" Instead of going on that old-looking helicopter? \nPILOT Well, their radio's fucked. That's why I'm flying out. \nWALTER You're leaving now? \nPILOT After I finish my beer. \nThat makes Walter pause. \nWALTER The weather doesn't seem great. Feels like there a storm \"moving in.\" \"Brewing.\" \nMAN Yeah. \nWALTER But you're just going to finish YOUR BIG-GLASS-WOMAN'S-BEER-BOOT and then fly? \nPILOT Yeah. \nWALTER Okay. I'm not going to go with you. \nINT. PUB, NUUK, GREENLAND - LATER \nThe pilot sits at the bar finishing his boot beer. Walter's in the background, looking in through the window, watching the pilot drink. \nEXT. FIELD BESIDE THE PUB - LATER \nA little while later, the pilot's in the pilot's chair of the helicopter. The blades are spinning. \nHe's about to lift off out of Nuuk. Walter's in the distance, standing thirty yards away near the pub, looking over. He's not going. Then the helicopter starts to lift at the same moment Walter has a change of heart and starts to run toward it to come along. \nThe helicopter begins to ascend (the environment around the pub is pretty, different than what we've seen). We also haven't seen Walter sprinting before, which he is now (briefcase), arriving, then leaping three feet up into the passenger seat of the helicopter. \nINT. HELICOPTER, FLYING - LATER \nWalter's high above Greenland, flying over a fjord. It's breathtaking. He yells to be heard from the passenger seat to the pilot. \nWALTER Is that a fjord? \nPILOT Yeah. \nWALTER I've seen pictures of fjords. But I've never actually seen a fjord. I don't think I've ever even said the word fjord out loud-- \nPILOT Stop saying fjord. It's annoying. \nWALTER Okay. \nEXT. VIEW DOWN ON ATLANTIC - LATER \nThis is a look from way up at an international shipping vessel mid-sea. The weather around it's getting rocky. On deck, they're prepping a life raft. \nINT. HELICOPTER, GREENLAND, SKY, MOVING - LATER \nWalter's getting rocked a little in the helicopter passenger seat. The weather's getting rough. They're in some low lying storm clouds. \nPILOT (yelling over the blades) We're not going to be able to land on the freighter. I've got to drop the radio parts and you in a life raft. (MORE) \nPILOT (CONT'D) It's a short drop, but your decision. You can just fly back with me. \nWALTER (yelling over the blades) I'd really like to get my hands on this property. They're making some changes at the office. It's going to reflect poorly on my work. I might get let go. And I have a mounting piano situation that's-- (rocked big time) Whoa... \nThe pilot carries on to the freighter. Walter seems to be calling on his reserves to see this through. \nINT. HELICOPTER - LATER \nIt's noisy. The weather's rough. There is lots of lifting and dropping. Walter's steadying himself in the cargo hold, preparing to jump.. \nPILOT You're doing great. We're only six feet up. Just jump out the door, Walter. \nEXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SAME \n", "test1_true": "EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATER \nWalter's treading water a fair distance from the freighter. The crew (Chilean) has gathered at the bow of the freighter. The captain calls out to Walter through a megaphone. \nCAPTAIN We're sending a pontoon. Try to remain calm. \nAt this point a fin passes behind Walter. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) Okay, if that's a porpoise-- \nWALTER (sort of to himself, LOOKING AROUND) If what's a-- (noticing the fin) what? \nCAPTAIN If that is a porpoise, befriend it. Porpoises are mammals with rare intelligence and sympathy. They often protect swimmers from predators. \nThe fin circles by again. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) If that's a shark, strike it. Their snouts are sensory hubs. \nWALTER (CALLING OUT) How do you-- I just see a fin. Can you get a bead on some more information? \nOn board the crew has a brief consultation. \nCAPTAIN (then, to Walter through THE MEGAPHONE) We're confident that's a shark. \nThe fin comes nearer. Walter steels himself. Then he finds some presence of mind and power and is able to deter the thing away by thrashing at it with a few decent punches. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) (after a moment) Okay, now we think that was a porpoise. \nAfter another moments, another fin shows up. \nCAPTAIN (CONT'D) That probably is a shark. \nAt this point, though, the pontoon arrives and Walter scrambles into it (he still has his briefcase). \nINT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - LATER \nWalter has dried off. He's being tended to by some young Chilean sailors. He's been sounding them out about where Sean O'Connell is. \nCHILEAN SAILOR Sean O'Connell? He was picked up. \nWALTER From your ship? \nCHILEAN CAPTAIN A pilot boat came. They took him. Four hours ago. \nWALTER Took him where? \nCHILEAN CAPTAIN I don't know. \nIt's dawned on Walter that he's missed Sean. Just by a little. \nWALTER Can we radio them? There's something I need to discuss with-- \nCAPTAIN You jumped into the ocean with our radio components. No. We are, as you say, \"on our own.\" \nEXT. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FREIGHTER THE DOLORES - LATER \nThe freighter's hauling automobiles. The surface of the ship looks like a mall parking lot. One of the Chilean sailors accompanies Walter on a walk among the car rows. \nCHILEAN SAILOR You can sleep where Sean did. \nThey stop alongside a Subaru. The Sailor opens the driver's door. He means this is where Sean slept. In this Subaru. Walter's confused. \nWALTER Sean slept here? \nCHILEAN SAILOR Yes. \nWALTER In this Subaru Outback? \nCHILEAN SAILOR Yes. That's where our undocumented laborers sleep. Our Stevedores. He was photographing our workers. \nWALTER He was photographing Chilean Stevedores? \nCHILEAN SAILOR Yeah. \nWALTER (about the Outback) This was his room/car? \nCHILEAN SAILOR Now it will be your room/car. \nINT. SUBARU OUTBACK - SAME \nWalter has gotten in. There are five Chilean Stevedores in the back in different states of rest - sleeping, reading, playing chess. \n", "test1_id": 1929, "test2_input": "WALTER Hey. Walter. \nThey wave. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Did you guys, were you living in this car back seat when Sean O'Connell lived in the front seat? \nWalter starts miming taking photographs. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Sean? \nBACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia.... \nThe guy's pointing to where Walter is in the front seat. \nSECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia. \nWALTER Is that-- Are you saying quin-- \nSECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia... \nWALTER Are you saying Quintessence? In the Spanish form? Yeah. Sean says that. \nA deck Squall Alarm sounds. These guys leave the car quickly (to perhaps batten something down). Walter notices the breaktime snack they were enjoying - half's been left behind. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Is that Clementine cake? My mom makes-- I didn't know anyone else made that. \nWalter's alone in the Subaru. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Clementine cake. Wow. \nHe reaches for some cake, it's been sliced into pieces, wrapped bakery style in some stray paper from the backseat. Walter takes one such slice. While the storm lifts and lowers the ship, Walter enjoys some clementine cake, then he notices something about the paper scrap it's wrapped in. There's handwriting on it. Walter examines it. \nWhat Walter's holding is a half-torn page bearing cursive handwriting. There is a date beside the word: Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. Then TTL shoemount flash. Zoom bounce flash. Nikon Camera.... \nWALTER (CONT'D) This is Sean's. \nThere is a later destination and date on the paper - and some scrawl beside it. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (EXCITED) ...this is an itinerary. \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE UP OF THE WORD EYJAFJALLAJ\u00d6KULL \nEXT. SHIP CROW'S NEST - LATER \nDuring this storm, Walter has climbed up the crow's nest ladder and stands in the crow's nest with the English- Speaking Chilean Sailor who escorted him to the Subaru. Walter's showing him the paper - Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull \nWALTER That's where Sean is. Tomorrow. This gibberish. I have to crack it. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR Crack? \nWALTER I have to crack the gibberish. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR You don't have to crack anything. It's a volcano. In Iceland. That's the name. Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. \nWALTER ...Sean's in Iceland. We're going past there, right? Can we land there? \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR We can get you there. \nWALTER Can you get me there tomorrow? \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR We can get you there tomorrow, yes. \nWALTER Would you like some Clementine cake? \nWalter's brought the cake up with him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) It's very good. It tastes, man, exactly like my mom's. I didn't know Chilean mom's made this. Small world. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR No thank you. I have to actually perform a function up here, during the storm. That's why I'm up here. \nWALTER Oh. Sorry. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR I have to monitor the mooring winches and wind Lasses. (MORE) \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR And you're standing, I'm sorry, like right where I'm supposed to be looking. \nWALTER Okay, I'm going to go, take my cake and..... \nWalter starts to descend the crow's nest ladder. \n", "test2_true": "The storm has broken. The sea is calm. The sun is out. This is a huge ship. Walter's sitting on the bow, all by himself. His briefcase is beside him. It's quiet. He's looking out at the water, then (oddly) his cell phone rings. \nWALTER ...Hello? \nMAN'S VOICE Walter. \nWALTER Yeah. \nMAN'S VOICE Todd Mahar. From eHarmony. \nWALTER ...Oh. Hey. (like it's weird to be getting a call out here from Todd Mahar) Um, do I owe you guys money? Because your supervisor was clear I can't get my 400 dollars back. But I don't think I'm going to renew- \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR No, I just wanted to see how you were doing. You didn't sound great last time. \nWALTER The last time we talked? The time you told me I have no personality? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, you know, you just left your application so empty. Share something about yourself. It doesn't have to be major league. (MORE) \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR (CONT'D) Life's full of small accomplishments. What do you strive to do everyday, that you take pride in? Can I ask you that? \nWALTER Well, I take my work seriously. Also keeping a tidy apartment. I help my sister out paying her bills now and then. But can we not list that? None of that stuff really seems like an accomplishment. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR You know there's a way to consider it where the tasks you accomplish (paying some of your sister's rent-- \nWALTER Braces. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR What's that? \nWALTER She hasn't asked me for rent money. For like a year. But I did pay for her braces. She's 36. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, taking care of yourself and your household, your mom, after you do that without ever failing, for a long time, hey that becomes an accomplishment. \nSome time passes. A bird flies by. \nWALTER I fought a dolphin. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Today? \nWALTER Yeah. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Aren't they supposed to be nice? \nWALTER They are. I think they're probably the best mammal. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR (meaning like aren't we THE BEST) We're mammals. \nWalter doesn't say anything about us being the best. Life's heavy for him right now. \nWALTER This mammal tried to protect me. And most of the other mammals I know, like the mammals at the office, they're dicks. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Why are you near dolphins? \nWALTER I'm on a ship. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Where? \nWALTER Near Greenland. I tracked a thumb here. To Nuuk, Greenland. I located the thumb. Now I'm fortunately going to Iceland to correct an oversight. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, I'm going to tweak your profile, add \"sailing\" or whatever to your Done Thats. I'll put Swims with Dolphins, too. \nWALTER It was just one. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR I can really put Swims with Dolphin. That sounds like you have a pet dolphin you swim with everyday. Can I handle this please? It's my job. \nWALTER Okay, Todd. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR You sound a little better? \nWALTER Do I? Because I think I'm a little worse. \nEXT. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FREIGHTER - DAY (LATER) \nWalter's been equipped with a kayak pole and life vest. Some of the crew assist him down a ladder to the ocean; others keep watch over a kayak waiting there. \nCAPTAIN (TO WALTER) It's a mile and half to Iceland. It's as far in as we can get with our hull size. \nWALTER So. Okay. I'm supposed to kayak in? \nCAPTAIN Reykjavik is due north. You'll be there by 9 am. \nEXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATER \n", "test2_id": 1930, "test3_input": "WALTER You know what, we don't. I've looked in every neg box and even every camera bag and we have in the warehouse. I even double-checked the Teaneck warehouse. \nSEANN You have it. \nWALTER I really don't. \nSEAN (PROUD) No, it's not in the neg box. That one was special. Favorite ever. You have it. Seriously. Loan me five bucks. \nWALTER Loan you... what? \nSEAN Loan me five bucks. \nWalter doesn't know why this became important to Sean just now. But he reaches for his wallet, but when he looks up, he finds that Sean and the Korean guys he's attached to have been lifted as a group briskly into the air. They've been tethered to a hovering rescue helicopter that's withdrawing quickly. Sean's yelling something down. It's unclear. They ascend further as a unit, way up, way out of reach, getting smaller. Walter, though remains down on the soccer field. \nWALTER (QUIETLY) Fuck... \nSOCCER FIELD - LATER \nMoments later, Walter remains there, holding five bucks that's flapping in the wind. He's watching the Koreans and Sean floating away. They're very small and very far away. \nEXT. MOGADISHU - LATER \nWalter is skateboarding through Mogadishu. There are random tire fires going on in the distance. A tire on fire rolls by. \nEXT. MOGADISHU - LATER \nWalter's back in the city park, talking to the same Somalian who told him where to find the Koreans. \nWALTER Do you have any sense how I could get back to America if I can't afford a plane ticket right now? Totally? \nRODNEY ...Yeah, my brother William. Two dollars. \nWALTER I give your brother two dollars and then he'll tell me how to get back to America? \nRODNEY Two dollars. To go to America. \nWALTER ...I can go to America for two dollars? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAR - DAY \nWalter's behind the wheel of a small car. But as the camera pulls back, we see that he's behind the wheel of a small car parked on another large shipping vessel (Chinese this time). \nEXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER \nStill sitting in one of the cars, Walter's made a phone call. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Eharmony. Todd Mahar. \nWALTER Hey, Todd. It's Walter. Mitty. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR What's up, Walter? \nWALTER Hey I wanted to add a couple items? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay. \nWALTER To my Been There, Done Thats. If that's cool. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR It's really cool. What do you got? \nWALTER Okay. Mogadishu? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Yeah. \nWALTER Been there. \nThe shot lifts up and we see the full scope of what Walter is willing to do to keep his job, sleep in a Chinese car on a Chinese boat, on a slow trip back home. \nINT. LOBBY, APARTMENT HIGHRISE, NEW YORK - LATER \nWalter walks up to the front desk of a residential apartment building. \nWALTER Cheryl Mellhoff. \nFRONT DESK LADY Your name? \nWALTER Walter Mitty. \nShe dials the inner-building phone, then has a brief conversation with Cheryl. Walter waits quietly. \n", "test3_true": "WALTER Thanks. \nWalter's holding the Arabic skateboard. \nINT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER \nCheryl and her son Rich have entered the lobby waiting area to greet Walter.  We're only on her for the top of the FOLLOWING EXCHANGE \nCHERYL Hey. \nWALTER (O.S.) Hey. \nCHERYL Did you find the Quintessence of Life? \nWALTER (O.S.) Almost... \nCHERYL Man, I'm sorry. (concerned about him) How are you feeling? \nWALTER (O.S.) ...I'm okay. \nNow we see Walter; he's a short distance away in the seating area, but he's not seated because he's a human cubicle. He's shaped like a cubicle. \nWALTER AS A CUBICLE (gesturing with the Arabic SKATEBOARD) Hey, I picked this up for you, Rich. It's got some cool Arabic writing on it. I don't know what it means. But it looked cool. \nEXT. AVENUE A, NYC - LATER \nThey've gone out among the throngs of New Yorkers, walking up the sidewalk of Avenue A. Walter is with Cheryl and Rich but he's remained a cubicle. \nEXT. SKATE PARK, WEST SIDE, NYC - LATER \nWalter (real Walter again) and Cheryl are sitting on the lip. Rich is out using the Arabic skateboard. \nCHERYL (impressed about the BOARD) ...Walter. You go to Mogadishu, and you think about bringing a gift home to my son? \nWALTER I got the board in Dubai. Hey, Rich. Here watch. The board's going to come up. You don't have to try to lift it. \nWalter has walked out to show Rich how to ollie. Walter does it pretty well. \nWALTER (CONT'D) You really just have to think about landing. Both feet. Same time. \nRICH Thanks, Walter. \nRich starts trying his best. Walter sits back down. \nCHERYL (about Sean O'Connell) Do you have any idea where Sean is now? \nWALTER No, I lost him. He said I had it though. Like he knew. He smiled. He said \"you have it.\" \"You.\" What's he talking about? \nAt this point, Rich wipes out. He's scared. He slid on the pavement pretty far and he's shaken up. He bumped his shoulder pretty hard, and he's privately started to cry. \nCHERYL Honey. Hey. Come here. That was great. \nRich has come over. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) That was really great. Here. \nShe means Rich to sit beside her. She puts her arm around him. He's trying not to cry, but he's crying. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Hey. Don't worry. You're going to feel fine in five minutes. Don't worry. Hey. \nShe wraps him up. She starts rubbing his back. Then she starts singing. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Don't worry, about a thing, `cause every little thing is going to be all right. Don't worry..... \nWalter's sitting right there with them. He knew she knew this song, and that she used it with Rich. He doesn't know why he knew it, but he did. They just sit there for a while, while Rich calms down. The song's pretty much worked, Walter's enjoyed being there as much as Rich. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) (quietly, to Walter) You know, all hell broke loose this week, while you were gone. \nEXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - DAY \nWalter walks south up 6th amid foot traffic. Coming past him, though is a huge black and white Morgan Freeman (it's a mover carting off the Life Morgan Freeman photo, but he's hidden behind the picture, so this Morgan Freeman has a surreal, lifelike quality. \nElsewhere up 6th, Walter is passed likewise by the Beatles, Winston Churchill and a huge Warhol Soup can color photo. \nINT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, CORRIDOR - LATER \nWalter tries his pass key to enter the division floor. It's not working.  More huge photos have been carried past Walter during this time: \"Nixon eating with chopsticks.\" Then \"Ruby shooting Oswald.\" Then Ted Hendrick's colleague comes out, he's with a guy we haven't seen yet. They're both dressed for squash. \nWALTER Excuse me. Can you pass key me in? I need to see Ted. My pass key isn't working. I need to let him know I verified that I have negative 12. I just didn't verify where I have it. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE You're Walter Mitty? \n", "test3_id": 1931}

{"train": "THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY \nWritten by \nSteve Conrad \n\"Too much happens... Man performs, engenders so much more than he can or should have to bear. That's how he finds that he can bear anything.\" \n- William Faulkner \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BROOKLYN - MORNING \nWalter Mitty (30s) sits at his small kitchen table, balancing his check book. We see his last several expense entries: \nMom's new apt. deposit \nEHARMONY SIGN-UP \nO's braces (2nd installment) \nPIANO MOVERS \nPIANO STORAGE \nPiano delivery to Mom's new apt. \nIn-piano humidity control system \nEXT. CORNER 5TH AVENUE, 43RD STREET, NYC - DAY \nDuring the morning rush hour, a crowd of businessmen waits on the corner to cross the street. Walter is among them, dressed in a short-sleeve business shirt and tie and with a briefcase on hand. Nothing happens. Then Walter's head explodes. \nCREDITS BEGIN \nUp toward the clouds, propelled skyward, were the contents (ideas and images) of Walter's head; they've begun to float toward the ground. \nINT. SKYSCRAPER, NYC - SAME \nSome office work is going on. Then past the window (outside) comes floating down, in slow motion, Juan Valdez the Colombian Coffee guy (his donkey's floating down way in the distance). \nThis happens outside other high-rise and professional building windows - a floating Bishop Desmond Tutu, the silver Monopoly piece Top Hat, Statler and Waldorf (the two elderly curmudgeons from The Muppet Show) and additional detritus from Walter's mind such as Manute Bol, The Beastie Boys, etc. CREDITS PLAY. \nINT. STARBUCKS, MIDTOWN NYC - MOMENTS LATER \nWalter sits at a Midtown Starbucks. He's got his laptop out and he's in the middle of a phone call. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR You know, you didn't really provide much detail about your occupation. Most people put theirs on their eHarmony page. You don't care to? \nWALTER Is that like a must? Can't I just say like \"I'm employed\" or something? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR (like okay but that's not a great idea) Sure. \nWALTER My work's not really that interesting. To women. Um. Or men. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR What do you do? \nWALTER I'm a Practical Asset Manager. For a corporation. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR (sounds like he agrees it's not interesting) ....okay. What do you do when you're not working? \nWALTER Mostly I guess I commute to work? It's like an hour and-- \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay. No worries. I'll submit this information, then check back in the afternoon for your possible eHarmony matchups. That's exciting, huh? \nWALTER It is, Todd. Yeah. Hey, when can I leave a \"wink\" for someone? To see if they \"wink\" back, or..? \nWalter's looking at his laptop. On screen is the eHarmony dating page for CHERYL M. (34), pretty but she looks like the sort of pretty girl who takes the bus; text beside her photo reads \"Leave a wink for Cheryl M. to indicate your interest...\" \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR I'll have your eHarmony profile all uploaded in a minute. \nWALTER Cool. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR So like in two minutes. But hey, you're a little light, if you don't mind me saying this, in your \"Been There, Done that\" column. \nPart of the eHarmony client profile has a section Been There, Done That - where people list their accomplishments, travels, etc. \nWALTER I forgot what I put there? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR ...Nothing. \nWALTER Oh, okay. \nGARY MANNHEIM (AWKWARD) Gary Mannheim. Um. Vice President of Acquisitions. Too. So what are you going to be doing at the company, Ted? \nTED HENDRICKS Managing the acquisition. Identifying overlap. Reducing staff where we find redundancy. What's your focus been here, Gary? \nGARY MANNHEIM ...I've been managing acquisitions. Identifying overlap. Then reducing staff where I find redundancy. \nFurther awkward moments pass. \nTED HENDRICKS Wow, okay. That's not... \nGARY MANNHEIM Yeah, that's not good. \nTED HENDRICKS No. (TO WALTER) What do you do? \nWALTER I'm a Practical Asset Manager. \nTED HENDRICKS Do you play an important role here? \nWALTER I do. Yeah. Totally. I work in a one-on-one basis (on a one-on-one basis I mean) with all our photographers. \nTed just looks at him for a moment. \nTED HENDRICKS I'm sorry. I was really getting into this song. What were you saying? \nWalter listens to the elevator muzak Ted just referred to. It's like Maneater in muzak; no one could get into it. \nWALTER I was just saying I manage our film negatives from the moment they arri- \nTED HENDRICKS (starting to leave) Let's talk later. We have a specific time set aside to conference with employees of the former company. \nWALTER What time is that? \nTED HENDRICKS I'm not sure. But it's not at this time. \nWALTER Okay. \nTED HENDRICKS I have to see the board and start evaluations now. \nWALTER Okay. Thank you. (flustered, feeling that was a dumb thing to say) I mean \"not thank you.\" I mean like \"looking forward to it\" I should have said. \nTed just looks over. The door's closing. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the closing DOORS) Looking forward to it. \nThe doors are almost closed. \nTED HENDRICKS I'll come by sometime this week. \nWALTER Awesome. \nGARY MANNHEIM Are you going to come by my...um? \nThe doors close. Ted's not coming by Gary's office. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWalter walks up a long hallway toward his department floor; on the walls are hugely blown up Life Magazine photographs. Twelve foot high Muhammad Ali, Morgan Freeman (Oscar pose), Moon Landings. - Walter looks small compared. The last photo he passes is familiar - a black and white of a New Orleans Jazz Funeral. \nINT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, LIFE - LATER \nThe division Walter works in has fifty employees seated around an open floor plan - fifty cubicles in view. Walter's arrived at his to find on his desk a wrapped gift with a note READING: \nHeard rumbling's Life's over. Wanted to give you something cool if this is the last photo batch. Hope when you open it and look inside you'll think it's pretty special. \nWalter's unwrapped the gift. \nIt's a leather wallet. Its front is embossed with the inscription from S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great work. \nWalter looks back at the letter; it finishes - by the way, neg 12 is my best ever. Landmark. The Absolute Quintessence of Life. .... the rest of the batch kind of sucks. Sean \nINT. RECEIVING ROOM, LIFE MAGAZINE - LATER \nWalter has been working through a Life photo order negative box - it's marked Sean O'Connell. There's a co-worker (HERNANDO) cleaning up in the distance. Walter has been examining a negative roll with his loupes (magnifiers worn as eye glasses). THEN HE NOTICES SOMETHING THAT STOPS HIM. The negative roll, where the 12th negative should be, has been cut; 12 is missing. \nWALTER Hey, Hernando- \nHERNANDO Yeah? \nWALTER This 12th neg? From this last Life roll? \nHERNANDO Yeah. \nCheryl Mellhoff sits down beside Walter. \nWALTER (CONT'D) What is this? \nHe hands her the foggy print - it's clear they have an established working friendship. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I think it's either a man with one sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a Happy Days lunch box. \nCHERYL (can't make it out clearly EITHER) It's... is it two badminton racquets? What's it supposed to be? \nWALTER It's the Quintessence of Life. So I don't think it's two badminton racquets. Sean O'Connell took this just before he took another one we lost. \nCHERYL (like that's significant) You lost a Sean O'Connell? \nWALTER (looking at the out of FOCUS PRINT) ...I'm trying to figure out what this picture is. I think he focused, set his lens then took the missing picture. It's just a better picture of this. What is this? \nCHERYL Maybe Sean has it. \nWALTER The negative? Yeah, I tried to reach him. He's always in Bahrain. Or a shanty town or somewhere - I got one email off. \nWalter shows Cheryl an email exchange from Sean O'Connell - \nIt reads - in need of info for neg 12 of neg roll three, box \nSean's reply - Best picture I've taken. The total F'ing Quintessence of Life. I hope you're as happy with it as I am. \nWalter's reply = Cool, but can't find it. \nSean's reply - Out of Office. This is an auto reply. Sean O'Connell will be out of the office through the month of November. \nWALTER (CONT'D) No cell phone. He's out on a freelance. I'd really like to find him. \nWalter has taken further photographs from his briefcase \nWALTER (CONT'D) These are pictures from the last roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw a bead on his location by analyzing these. \nCHERYL Have you figured anything out? \nWALTER Not yet. Because my trail is... water. \nWalter starts showing Cheryl the photographs. The first of which is water - just a picture of water, could be an ocean, lake, or pool (puddle). \nWALTER (CONT'D) A Starbucks, which I don't know which one. (flipping to the next one) And a man (or woman's) thumb. \nThis is a picture of a thumb. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I've been trying to figure out the gender (of the thumb), as I sat here. How many people in the world? \nCHERYL Six billion. \nWALTER Everyone's got two, too. \nCHERYL Two, too, what? \nWALTER Thumbs. \nCHERYL Yeah. But I think there are more Starbucks, so I don't know if that's what you'd call a hot trail-- \nWALTER Look what Sean gave me. \nWalter has taken the gift wallet out - S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great work. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Because we covered, you know, so many hotspots together the last 9 years... (a little more quietly) ...boldly \nCHERYL (having some fun with WALTER) You guys covered the hotspots together boldly? \nWALTER As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually going to the hotspots, and by me staying here waiting for the pictures of hotspots to come back so I can boldly transfer them to magazine format. \nCheryl's laughed. \nCHERYL ...What did you do this weekend? \nWALTER We're moving my mom here. I went and packed her house up. What about you? \nCHERYL My son and I went on a bike ride in Lake Valhalla. Jersey. We brought lunch. Had lunch in an actual field, of grass. We went swimming. My friend Marny lives on the lake. (getting to what's on everyone's minds around THERE) ...This is going to be the last issue. Life's going to be strictly online after this merger. No new photographs. We're just going to be an internet photo storehouse. That's what I'm hearing. They're going to let most of us go. \nWalter sits there for awhile. That's tough news. He's got a lot on his mind. Then he gets a text: From Odessa, it reads: \n- piano a-holes want 300 more dollars to take the piano back, come down. I have to go. Like right now. \nINT. LOBBY, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - SAME \nWalter gets a text from Odessa that says I'm leaving. \nWALTER Hey, Todd. I have to go. I have a piano situation I have to take care of. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay, man. \nWALTER Um hey, can I have my four hundred dollars back? \nEXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER \nWalter walks up to Battery Park to find (really) a grand piano sitting in the park. He stops and stares at it awhile. \nEXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER \nWalter sits at the abandoned piano (in pristine shape). Regular NY foot traffic passes around him. He absentmindedly starts playing the first bars of Cheers. Then he just keeps doing it because he's thinking of other things. \nGUY IN PARK Stop playing Cheers, Dick. \nThen Walter sees Cheryl Mellhoff and her son RICH (9), headed his way from across Bridge Street. They've got two skateboards. Walter smiles when he sees them and waves. \nEXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER \nCheryl, Walter and Rich push the grand piano toward quiet Bridge Street. It's on its wheels and a couple skateboards. It's rolling down the street pretty well. They're about to push it out onto the street. \nWALTER Rich, are you ready to push a piano down a street and get honked at by everybody in New York? \nRICH (like it's going to be FUN) Yeah. \nThey do. The honking begins right away, but they keep rolling the grand piano down Bridge Street. It looks like it might be fun. \nCHERYL I can't believe they left it in the park. How old is this? \nWALTER Her dad bought it for her when she was six. It's seventy-years-old. \nCHERYL Your sister just took off? \nWALTER My sister's not the responsible one in the family. \nCHERYL No kidding, man. \nWALTER She told them no steps. I paid them for a first floor move. But she screwed up and got my mom a apartment on the 15th floor. The movers weren't equipped to get it up there. She didn't have the money for them to take it back. She had to get her braces adjusted, so she just took off. \nCHERYL Braces. How old is she? \nWALTER \nEXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER \nIt's pretty late now. Walter has placed a tarp over the piano. They rolled it into a city parking space. \nCHERYL You're sure this is your sister's parking space? \nWALTER Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good on that. \nRich is skateboarding around a little. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I used to skateboard a little. \nCHERYL (something about the idea makes her smile) When? \nWALTER Maine. When I was a kid. (trying to unburden her of the other skateboard) Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I don't want you to have to carry it all the way home. I got it. \nCHERYL Thanks. \nWALTER You helped me move a piano. I can carry this. See you Rich. Thanks for putting your back into it. \nRICH What does that mean? \nWALTER Just, you know... helping out, man. \nCHERYL See you tomorrow. \nWALTER Yeah. \nWalter's got the piano all tarped. Cheryl and Rich take off. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Are you sure I can't walk you home? \nCHERYL I'm going to drop Rich at his Dad's. Thanks, Walter. \nWalter hangs out a moment. He's watching them go. Then he starts walking off with Rich's skateboard. \nINT. LOBBY, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - LATER \nThe French mob jogs through the lobby with Walter atop their shoulders. \nFRENCHMEN (European sports chant) Wal-ter Mi-tty. \nINT. ELEVATOR, MOVING - MOMENTS LATER \nAmong more serious-looking businessmen and woman, the raucous tour-de-France style congratulations party continues. Walter's just being mobbed by ecstatic Frenchmen. \nINT. FORTIETH FLOOR, ELEVATOR LOBBY - LATER \nNo one's around. We hear the quiet \"ding\" of the elevator arriving. Then Walter gets out. There are no crowds anywhere - just Walter in his short-sleeve dress shirt, tie and briefcase. He reaches his division floor offices door and enters his pass-key. Then his mom walks up - EDNA MITTY, 76. \nEDNA Hi, honey. \nWALTER (noticing her, surprised) Hey, Mom. \nEDNA Hi, Walter. Is it all right I'm dropping by? \nWALTER Sure, (meaning the open office AREA) we'll just go through here to my office. \nINT. DIVISION FLOOR - CONTINUOUS \nAs Walter and Edna enter the division floor, colleague Tim Naughton walks past. \nTIM NAUGHTON (TO WALTER) They just called a conference. \nWALTER (following Tim, with his mom at his side, to her) Hey, your new place is almost ready. We just had a little hiccup due to Odessa just not getting the right one. \nEDNA Well, she's the artist... \nWALTER Why did she get the cool name? She got to turn out cool. \nEDNA I named her after a wonderful visit your Dad and I had to Odessa, our family's homeland, one summer, in southern Ukraine. There's a beautiful river there also named Odessa. \nWALTER Why did you name me Walter? \nEDNA I named you after Walter Matthau \nWALTER (noticing that a conference is starting) Okay. This is starting I think. We should probably just stop here to-- \nThey've walked out onto the division floor where a group of forty or so employees has been gathered together to allow Ted Hendricks a speech (which he's forcing a colleague to make). They stand a short distance away, in the middle of letting THEM KNOW: \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE This will only take a moment. I just wanted to inform you all, reluctantly, that this month's issue will be the last. \nThe employees have been expecting this. Nonetheless, the news saddens and concerns them. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (CONT'D) You are all valued employees. But as we undergo this transition we wanted to be candid with you that some of you will be-- \nTED HENDRICKS (correcting him, a little more quietly, just to HIM) Most. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (to Ted, quietly) What's that? \nTED HENDRICKS Most of them. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE We wanted to be clear that most of you will be determined non-vital to the new partnership. The remaining few employees will carry over into the new organization. We'll be deciding which category your positions fall into over the course of the next week. \nTim Naughton, among the gathered (soon to be former) employees, has begun a quiet, high-pitched, weeping. Walter has had to field this news while his mother stands beside him. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (CONT'D) Now for some good news. We're very EXCITED TO-- \nAt this point, Ted Hendricks nudges the guy to move over so Ted can assume the speaking part for the good news portion. \nTED HENDRICKS Okay. So, we're very excited to play a part in publishing what will be the very last issue of Life Magazine, which has been an American Institution for 75 years and whose renowned covers have touched us all really touching ways. And for the final issue, our cover is going to be something which is... (he forgot the word, looks at the editor for help) What was that word? \nEDITOR (WHISPERING) Quintessence. \nTED HENDRICKS Our cover will probably be the most famous ever because it really has the awesome quintessence of Life. And we're all going to be a part of this historic happening. Even those of you who will, right after the happening, be asked to leave. Thank you. \nTed begins to clap (for some reason). So the gathered employees also begin some watered-down clapping. Walter is among them, standing beside his mom, who is clapping too. Then they all stop the fake good cheer and head back to work. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM, PRACTICAL ASSETS, LIFE - LATER \nLater, Walter's mom is with him in his work area, back in the storage area of practical assets. \nWALTER (to colleague Hernando, little rattled about the quintessence cover news) Check for negative 12 in the wash bins. \nEDNA So the moving bill came, for my move down here. I wanted to bring it by. Thank you so much Walter. \nWALTER Mom, come on. It's nothing. \nWALTER (showing them another PHOTO) Have you seen this Starbucks? \nSECOND TEEN I don't know. Possibly. \nWALTER (ANOTHER PHOTO) Have you seen this man (or woman's) thumb? \nINT. COFFEE SHOP, NUUK - MORNING \nIt's a fresh morning. Walter's sitting in a coffee shop, looking out on the capital town street. Then he sees a cab pull up for him. \nINT. CAB, MOVING - LATER \nWalter sits in back. The older female cabby cruises the car past some open, pretty fields. \nCAB DRIVER Greenland is the least densely populated country in the world. There's only 56,000 people. Lots to do. Most of us work a few different jobs, to cover everything. For example I drive this cab. \nA moment passes. \nCAB DRIVER (CONT'D) I'm also the Queen. \nWalter has been surprised. \nWALTER ...You're the Queen of Greenland? \nCAB DRIVER Yeah. Oh, there goes my meter. \nHer meter's gone out. \nCAB DRIVER (CONT'D) You want to just a call it 93 kroner? Flat rate. \nWALTER That's cool... your Majesty. \nAn awkward moment passes. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Should I call you that? \nCAB DRIVER Sure. \nWALTER Is there anything around here that a renowned photographer might be photographing? \nCAB DRIVER No. \nWALTER Are you sure? \nCAB DRIVER Yes. \nWALTER I think he was here. \nCAB DRIVER Well, possibly if he was mistaken, he might have thought the Musk Ox migration was worth photographing. \nWALTER Can we see that? \nINT. CAB, MOVING, OUTSKIRTS, NUUK, GREENLAND - LATER \nWalter and the Queen continue their peaceful drive through the outskirts of Nuuk, Greenland. \nWALTER So are you Queen for life? \nCAB DRIVER Yeah. \nWALTER That's a good gig. They're making some changes at work. My work. They're letting most of the divisions go. \nCAB DRIVER How long have you been there? \nWALTER Nine years. \nCAB DRIVER That's tough. \nWALTER How'd you get to be Queen? \nCAB DRIVER My dad was King. \nWALTER ...My dad sold ice cream. \nCAB DRIVER Here we are. \nWalter looks out the window. In a field they've parked beside, there are a few indigenous Oxen (they look like huge Jim Henson muppets) walking slowly. \nWALTER That's the Musk Ox migration? \nCAB DRIVER Yeah. \nWALTER Yeah, why? \nPILOT He saw I worked my controls with it. He's shooting photos of people working. That's why he's on that ship. I'm taking some radio parts out there in fifteen minutes. Their radio's fucked. \nWALTER Man, I really need to contact him. We're in a transition period and-- \nPILOT You could contact him by coming with me. Then contacting him. In person. On the boat. \nWALTER ...Can't we just call them? I could ask him on like the boat phone. \nPILOT The Ship to shore. \nWALTER Can I just ask him on the \"ship to shore?\" Instead of going on that old-looking helicopter? \nPILOT Well, their radio's fucked. That's why I'm flying out. \nWALTER You're leaving now? \nPILOT After I finish my beer. \nThat makes Walter pause. \nWALTER The weather doesn't seem great. Feels like there a storm \"moving in.\" \"Brewing.\" \nMAN Yeah. \nWALTER But you're just going to finish YOUR BIG-GLASS-WOMAN'S-BEER-BOOT and then fly? \nPILOT Yeah. \nWALTER Okay. I'm not going to go with you. \nINT. PUB, NUUK, GREENLAND - LATER \nThe pilot sits at the bar finishing his boot beer. Walter's in the background, looking in through the window, watching the pilot drink. \nEXT. FIELD BESIDE THE PUB - LATER \nA little while later, the pilot's in the pilot's chair of the helicopter. The blades are spinning. \nHe's about to lift off out of Nuuk. Walter's in the distance, standing thirty yards away near the pub, looking over. He's not going. Then the helicopter starts to lift at the same moment Walter has a change of heart and starts to run toward it to come along. \nThe helicopter begins to ascend (the environment around the pub is pretty, different than what we've seen). We also haven't seen Walter sprinting before, which he is now (briefcase), arriving, then leaping three feet up into the passenger seat of the helicopter. \nINT. HELICOPTER, FLYING - LATER \nWalter's high above Greenland, flying over a fjord. It's breathtaking. He yells to be heard from the passenger seat to the pilot. \nWALTER Is that a fjord? \nPILOT Yeah. \nWALTER I've seen pictures of fjords. But I've never actually seen a fjord. I don't think I've ever even said the word fjord out loud-- \nPILOT Stop saying fjord. It's annoying. \nWALTER Okay. \nEXT. VIEW DOWN ON ATLANTIC - LATER \nThis is a look from way up at an international shipping vessel mid-sea. The weather around it's getting rocky. On deck, they're prepping a life raft. \nINT. HELICOPTER, GREENLAND, SKY, MOVING - LATER \nWalter's getting rocked a little in the helicopter passenger seat. The weather's getting rough. They're in some low lying storm clouds. \nPILOT (yelling over the blades) We're not going to be able to land on the freighter. I've got to drop the radio parts and you in a life raft. (MORE) \nPILOT (CONT'D) It's a short drop, but your decision. You can just fly back with me. \nWALTER (yelling over the blades) I'd really like to get my hands on this property. They're making some changes at the office. It's going to reflect poorly on my work. I might get let go. And I have a mounting piano situation that's-- (rocked big time) Whoa... \nThe pilot carries on to the freighter. Walter seems to be calling on his reserves to see this through. \nINT. HELICOPTER - LATER \nIt's noisy. The weather's rough. There is lots of lifting and dropping. Walter's steadying himself in the cargo hold, preparing to jump.. \nPILOT You're doing great. We're only six feet up. Just jump out the door, Walter. \nEXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SAME \nWALTER Hey. Walter. \nThey wave. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Did you guys, were you living in this car back seat when Sean O'Connell lived in the front seat? \nWalter starts miming taking photographs. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Sean? \nBACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia.... \nThe guy's pointing to where Walter is in the front seat. \nSECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia. \nWALTER Is that-- Are you saying quin-- \nSECOND BACK SEAT CHILEAN La Quintasencia... \nWALTER Are you saying Quintessence? In the Spanish form? Yeah. Sean says that. \nA deck Squall Alarm sounds. These guys leave the car quickly (to perhaps batten something down). Walter notices the breaktime snack they were enjoying - half's been left behind. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Is that Clementine cake? My mom makes-- I didn't know anyone else made that. \nWalter's alone in the Subaru. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Clementine cake. Wow. \nHe reaches for some cake, it's been sliced into pieces, wrapped bakery style in some stray paper from the backseat. Walter takes one such slice. While the storm lifts and lowers the ship, Walter enjoys some clementine cake, then he notices something about the paper scrap it's wrapped in. There's handwriting on it. Walter examines it. \nWhat Walter's holding is a half-torn page bearing cursive handwriting. There is a date beside the word: Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. Then TTL shoemount flash. Zoom bounce flash. Nikon Camera.... \nWALTER (CONT'D) This is Sean's. \nThere is a later destination and date on the paper - and some scrawl beside it. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (EXCITED) ...this is an itinerary. \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE UP OF THE WORD EYJAFJALLAJ\u00d6KULL \nEXT. SHIP CROW'S NEST - LATER \nDuring this storm, Walter has climbed up the crow's nest ladder and stands in the crow's nest with the English- Speaking Chilean Sailor who escorted him to the Subaru. Walter's showing him the paper - Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull \nWALTER That's where Sean is. Tomorrow. This gibberish. I have to crack it. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR Crack? \nWALTER I have to crack the gibberish. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR You don't have to crack anything. It's a volcano. In Iceland. That's the name. Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. \nWALTER ...Sean's in Iceland. We're going past there, right? Can we land there? \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR We can get you there. \nWALTER Can you get me there tomorrow? \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR We can get you there tomorrow, yes. \nWALTER Would you like some Clementine cake? \nWalter's brought the cake up with him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) It's very good. It tastes, man, exactly like my mom's. I didn't know Chilean mom's made this. Small world. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR No thank you. I have to actually perform a function up here, during the storm. That's why I'm up here. \nWALTER Oh. Sorry. \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR I have to monitor the mooring winches and wind Lasses. (MORE) \nENGLIGH SPEAKING CHILEAN SAILOR And you're standing, I'm sorry, like right where I'm supposed to be looking. \nWALTER Okay, I'm going to go, take my cake and..... \nWalter starts to descend the crow's nest ladder. \nWalter's quietly kayaking through an empty expanse of the Atlantic. His paddle makes noise; that's it. Then Cheryl Mellhoff emerges from underwater - but she's giant. She takes up the whole horizon. She's catching her breath like she's been underwater for a while. Then her son Rich (giant) pops up from underwater beside her. He catches his breath, too, but he's pleased. \nRICH I stayed under longer. \nCHERYL Just barely. \nRICH Let's do it again. \nCHERYL Okay. One, two, three. \nCheryl fakes going underwater on three. Rich has. She's still above water. She's cheating. She stays there for a while, smiling. Then Rich pops up. \nRICH You're cheating. \nCHERYL (LAUGHING) Okay, okay. One two three. \nThey both get caught faking it this time, and they start   to laugh. Then they both go underwater. They're under for a   long time. A pretty long time, in fact. Then Cheryl surfaces.   But Rich doesn't. She's breathing again, but she expected to   see Rich and doesn't, and now she's concerned. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Rich...? \nHe's nowhere. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Rich? \nFinally, he pops up. But he's coughing, was under too long and has taken in some water; he's scared. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) It's okay. Come here. Hey come here. \nShe hugs him. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, it's okay. \nHe's freaked, he's crying a little. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, don't worry. You're good. Don't worry. Hey... \nAfter a moment, she begins to sing to distract him. She's singing Bob Marley's Three Little Birds pretty well. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) Don't worry, about a thing, `cause every little thing, is gonna be all right. Don't worry. About a thing... \nWalter looks on from (from his kayak). He's worried about a lot of things, but what he's picturing soothes him too. The day dream fades. Walter keeps kayaking. It looks desolate, then a guy in a rubber triathlon swimsuit swims by. Then another one does. \nWALTER ....shit. \nA wide shot shows that Walter has kayaked near to the coast of Reykjavik, Iceland during the swimming portion of a triathlon. Now he's in the midst of a hundred pissed guys in rubber swim suits. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Fuck. Sorry. \nINT. ICELANDIC CAB, MOVING, REYKJAVIK ICELAND - DAY \nWalter's in the heart of Reykjavik, Iceland, driven through the city. He's taking in the sights, looking around through the cab window, when his phone rings again. He checks his caller I.D \nWALTER (CLICKING OVER) Hey, Mom. \nEDNA Hi, Walter. \nWALTER What's up? \nEDNA Oh, I'm just making some yogurt. With some banana. \nWALTER Okay. Cool. \nEDNA It snowed today. Didn't expect that. Not much. Just a light little cover. Very pretty. Less than an inch even. \nWALTER That's awesome. \nEDNA My piano got towed, Walter. \nA moment goes by. \nWALTER ...Your piano got towed? \nEDNA Yes. Odessa said it wasn't there. Where you said it was going to be. (MORE) \nEDNA (CONT'D) She said possibly that it got towed. That that's not her space anymore. \nWALTER I lent her money for that space. \nEDNA Where are you, honey? \nWALTER In Iceland. \nWalter walks over, lowers himself beneath the keyboard, finds a grip, then rises and lifts the piano up by himself. \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE - LATER \nWalter's carrying the piano on his back, walking down the middle of the New Jersey Turnpike, slowing down traffic. \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION, NY - LATER \nWalter climbs a set of stairs to the subway with the piano on his back. \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - LATER \nWalter sits on a bench waiting for the train. The Grand Piano is beside him. \nINT. SUBWAY, MOVING - LATER \nWalter has brought the piano onto the subway. Then the subway hits one of those mid-tunnel stops where the train stops, and the lights go on and off. When the lights return we see the piano's gone. Walter's still there though. \nCUT TO: \nA CHECK BOOK EXPENSE ENTRY \nPiano move (third) - $1,100.00 \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nThis is an empty (small) apartment. Walter and his sister ODESSA sit on the carpet. She's pretty, good spirit, a little flighty (also she's wearing braces). She's watching Walter write this piano moving check. But she's looking at a checkbook entry a few entries above it. \nODESSA Does that say eHarmony? Four hundred dollars. \nWALTER Yes. \nODESSA (a little amused) Are you on eHarmony? \nWALTER No. \nODESSA Then why did you give them four hundred dollars? \nWALTER I tried to join, but-- I don't really even want to be on it. I'm just trying to do this thing with someone at work. \nODESSA (meaning do what) What? \nAt this point we see a piano float up into view outside the living room window beyond them, odd because they're fifteen stories up. \nWALTER I'm trying to do that Pi\u00f1a Colada thing? (singing pretty well) \"If you like Pi\u00f1a Coladas, and getting caught in the rain while wearing a cape--\" \nODESSA That's not how it goes. \nWALTER Well, the guy answers a personal ad and finds out it's his wife. They have a good laugh, then they make love on the cape while drinking Pi\u00f1a Coladas or something, and wearing capes, I think. Anyway. I'm hoping she'll click my profile and not realize that she works in my office area. Then we can realize it and have a good laugh. Then-- \nODESSA Make love on a cape? While wearing capes? Because that's not what they do in the song. \nWALTER No, then we can know that we picked each other out, you know, from the whole planet. Not just the cafeteria. \nWalter's quiet for a moment. \nWALTER (CONT'D) ... We're friends. I'd like there to be more. (MORE) \nWALTER (CONT'D) I was hoping this web site (that they won't let me be on) would show her more. \nWalter is putting his checkbook back in his briefcase. Odessa has noticed the out-of-focus photo Walter carries in it. \nODESSA (about the picture) What's that? \nWALTER I don't know. What do you think it is? \nOdessa looks the photo for a while. \nODESSA (trying to make it out) ...Triple A batteries working, as a team, to carry a fish tank up some apartment stairs. \nOut the window we see that the piano is attached to a crane. Movers have lifted it up to the fifteenth floor. Walter looks out at it from the small, small room they're in. \nWALTER We better tell them they need to shift that over to outside the big room. \nODESSA What big room? \nWALTER (sensing there is going to be some problem) The big room where the big piano is going to go. \nODESSA This is the big room. \nWalter's surprised. There's no way the piano fits in this space. \nOdessa has handed him two wrapped gifts. Walter begins to unwrap them. Inside are two toys: A Stretch Armstrong and, from yesteryear, the cheap drawing tablet where little metal filings are moved about with a magnetic wand to add features to a cartoon face. \nODESSA (CONT'D) Those were your favorite toys when you were a kid. You don't remember? \nWALTER (TOUCHED) Yeah, I do.... Thanks. \nOdessa gives Walter a kiss. \nINT. SUBWAY, MOVING, NYC - LATER \nWalter's riding the subway to work. Everything looks pretty normal except there's a small African Antelope walking around. \nINT. ELEVATOR, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - LATER \nWalter gets in the elevator - but already in there are Ted Hendricks and the executive board member guys. Walter has been caught off guard. He's holding toys - the Stretch Armstrong and drawing tablet. \nWALTER Oh. Hey. \nWalter offers his hand to Ted. \nWALTER (CONT'D) You know we haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I know you're deciding who's vital to the transition. And I wanted to let you know what I do-- \nTED HENDRICKS You're vital here? \nWALTER I am. Totally. \nTED HENDRICKS Why are you holding toys? \nWALTER ...It's my birthday. \nTED HENDRICKS ...you wanted toys. \nWALTER No... Um, my sister gave me these. \nTED HENDRICKS (nodding at Walter's STRETCH ARMSTRONG) What does that do? \nWALTER My... (doesn't want to call it a TOY) ...item? \nTED HENDRICKS Yeah, you're toy. \nWALTER His arms and legs stretch outward. Um. But that's not-- I wanted, before we have the chance to talk, I need to discuss an asset situation with you. \nWalter begins to open his briefcase to stash the toys, but he's nervous so it drops. \nINT. TED HENDRICK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nWalter's in Ted's glass partitioned work space. \nTED HENDRICKS (after being told it's lost, pissed) A photographic negative? I thought those had all been processed? \nWALTER I've processed the digitization of every single photograph in Life's library. Two million and eleven. But we haven't been able to locate this last negative. \nTED HENDRICKS I know. Because I've been asking for it. Because it's the Quintessence fucking one that I told my boss we had. It's the cover. You seriously lost a photographer's work? At Life? \nWALTER' MOM APPEARS ONCE MORE IN THE HALLWAY; she's out there, peeking into this office. \nWALTER I'm confident we'll find it. \nTED HENDRICKS Why are you confident we'll find it? \nWalter has no reason to be confident he'll find it. So he doesn't say anything. \nTED HENDRICKS (CONT'D) That doesn't give me confidence, a no-answer. You're in assets, I guess? \nWALTER Yes. \nTED HENDRICKS This doesn't reflect very well on you. \nWalter's at a loss. \nTED HENDRICKS (CONT'D) During an evaluation week. \nWALTER I've been here nine years-- \nTED HENDRICKS (gesturing out his cell PHONE) Here. Call Helmut Newton. Tell him you lost his picture. \nWALTER Helmut Newton didn't-- \nTED HENDRICKS Don't Helmut Newton me. \nWALTER I didn't Helmut Newton you. \nOf David After Dentist. \nBut Walter has been miniaturized and morphed into a little boy, so finely done he's recognizable both as Walter and as famous little drugged-up, young David from the youtube phenomenon clip David After Dentist wherein a five-year-old boy was videotaped by his dad in a post-dental-visit painkiller haze. He's in a kid-seat in the back of an SUV trying to get his mental bearings (unsuccessfully). \nWALTER AS DAVID AFTER DENTIST I feel funny. Why is this happening? (EXISTENTIALLY BEWILDERED about where he is) ...Is this real life? \nSoon after, David arches up and roars some noise meant to express kid rage that he can't control his situation - but we're watching a grown man do it and it applies specifically to the frustrations and challenges of his grown-up life. \nThen, in Starbucks, Walter takes out his gift wallet from photographer Sean O'Connell. He looks at the inscription: \nFrom S.O. To Walter Mitty - Thanks for the great work. \nThen Walter looks at a further embossment on the back. It says Life's Purpose. It's the mission statement of his company. Walter believes in it. \nCUT TO: \nWHAT FOLLOWS IS A MONTAGE OF THE MOST CLASSIC PHOTOGRAPHS \n...on proud display at Life. These aren't simply celebrities or commemorations of familiar events - these are the results of the painstaking quest to fulfill the pledge of Life at its inception. Amid the pictures we glimpse parts of Life's Purpose engraved on the lobby wall. \n\"To see life; \nto see the world; \nto eyewitness great events; \nto watch the faces of the poor \nMore photos that reach this standard pass - American faces. Faces from all over the world. \n\"to see man's work \u00ad \nhis towers, \ndiscoveries and labor \nWe see photos of men and women in pain, moments of deep pride, fear, uncertainty, glory. \nthings hidden behind walls \nThese are depictions of American plights - what devastating weather wrought, the sequestered lives of the deeply poor. \nthings dangerous to come to; \nto see and to take pleasure in seeing; \nto see and be amazed; \nThat is the purpose of Life. \nEXT. JFK, AIRPORT, TERMINAL - LATER \nWalter walks up a white terminal with his briefcase. He stops. He unsure he's going to go forward. Then he looks at his wallet again. \nSpecifically the phrase Life's Purpose - to see the World. Things dangerous to come to. He's looking hard at the things dangerous to come to part. \nINT. EMIRATES AIRLINES DESK, JFK - LATER \nWalter buys a ticket at the desk of the national airline of the United Arab Emirates at the far western edge of terminal three. \nWALTER I need to buy a ticket, I think to Dubai. Because I'm going, actually, to Mogadishu (shit) which I think, I'm not allowed to do from here, because it's illegally dangerous. \nTICKET CLERK Yeah.. (punching in some stuff) That's right more or less.. \nINT. EMERITUS AIRLINE 747 - LATER \nWalter's the only guy on here without a headdress. He's still looking at the out of focus photograph he printed way back, hoping yet, that it will give him some indication of what the missing picture is. \nEXT. BAGGAGE CLAIM, DUBAI AIRPORT - DAY \nWalter is waiting for his bags to come around on the luggage carousel. They do - it's just his briefcase he's had with him for the film's entirety. But as he retrieves it, he makes the acquaintance of a group of traveling Danish teens by helping them lift their heavy backpacks from the carousel. \nWALTER Here you go. (like it's heavy) Whoa, what do you have in there? \nULF Skateboards. Some switch out boards. \nThese teens are boys Knud, Soren and Ulf. And girls Grys and Denll. \nWALTER I like your trucks. I used to skateboard. Where are you guys headed? \nSOREN Into Dubai. \nWALTER You know what, we don't. I've looked in every neg box and even every camera bag and we have in the warehouse. I even double-checked the Teaneck warehouse. \nSEANN You have it. \nWALTER I really don't. \nSEAN (PROUD) No, it's not in the neg box. That one was special. Favorite ever. You have it. Seriously. Loan me five bucks. \nWALTER Loan you... what? \nSEAN Loan me five bucks. \nWalter doesn't know why this became important to Sean just now. But he reaches for his wallet, but when he looks up, he finds that Sean and the Korean guys he's attached to have been lifted as a group briskly into the air. They've been tethered to a hovering rescue helicopter that's withdrawing quickly. Sean's yelling something down. It's unclear. They ascend further as a unit, way up, way out of reach, getting smaller. Walter, though remains down on the soccer field. \nWALTER (QUIETLY) Fuck... \nSOCCER FIELD - LATER \nMoments later, Walter remains there, holding five bucks that's flapping in the wind. He's watching the Koreans and Sean floating away. They're very small and very far away. \nEXT. MOGADISHU - LATER \nWalter is skateboarding through Mogadishu. There are random tire fires going on in the distance. A tire on fire rolls by. \nEXT. MOGADISHU - LATER \nWalter's back in the city park, talking to the same Somalian who told him where to find the Koreans. \nWALTER Do you have any sense how I could get back to America if I can't afford a plane ticket right now? Totally? \nRODNEY ...Yeah, my brother William. Two dollars. \nWALTER I give your brother two dollars and then he'll tell me how to get back to America? \nRODNEY Two dollars. To go to America. \nWALTER ...I can go to America for two dollars? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAR - DAY \nWalter's behind the wheel of a small car. But as the camera pulls back, we see that he's behind the wheel of a small car parked on another large shipping vessel (Chinese this time). \nEXT. INDIAN OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER \nStill sitting in one of the cars, Walter's made a phone call. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Eharmony. Todd Mahar. \nWALTER Hey, Todd. It's Walter. Mitty. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR What's up, Walter? \nWALTER Hey I wanted to add a couple items? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay. \nWALTER To my Been There, Done Thats. If that's cool. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR It's really cool. What do you got? \nWALTER Okay. Mogadishu? \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Yeah. \nWALTER Been there. \nThe shot lifts up and we see the full scope of what Walter is willing to do to keep his job, sleep in a Chinese car on a Chinese boat, on a slow trip back home. \nINT. LOBBY, APARTMENT HIGHRISE, NEW YORK - LATER \nWalter walks up to the front desk of a residential apartment building. \nWALTER Cheryl Mellhoff. \nFRONT DESK LADY Your name? \nWALTER Walter Mitty. \nShe dials the inner-building phone, then has a brief conversation with Cheryl. Walter waits quietly. \nWALTER Yes. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE Practical Assets. \nWALTER Yes. \nTED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE Your pass key's not working because you've been let go. With cause. \nWalter is shaken. \nWALTER I need to speak to Ted. I found SEAN O'CONNELL-- \nNEW GUY Ted's been let go. We had an overage of 280,000 dollars. Due to this publishing delay. \nWALTER Is there someone who took over Ted's responsibilities? On a PERMANENT-- \nNEW GUY Yeah, that's me Steve Penders. (starting to leave) We're late for Squash. \nINT. SQUASH COURT, NYC - LATER \nWalter's on the squash court holding a conversation with these two guys who are trying to play squash. \nSTEVE PENDERS This is the last-Life-cover situation? \nWALTER Yes. \nSTEVE PENDERS You lost an asset. You cost that COMP-- \nWALTER I didn't lose it. I have it. The photographer told me. I just don't know where I have it. \nSTEVE PENDERS Those are grounds-- \nWALTER Those are no grounds. You can't fire me for not having something that I have. \nSTEVE PENDERS I'm not following you. \nSteve serves into Walter. \nWALTER I have it. I always have had it. When you fired me, I had it. Why are you trying to hit me with Squash balls? \nSTEVE PENDERS You're on a squash court. I'm trying to play-- \nWALTER No one's informed me that I've been let go. \nSTEVE PENDERS I'm informing you. \nWALTER I should be sent my November check. \nSTEVE PENDERS Fired with cause. No picture. No CHECK \nWALTER There's no cause to keep my salary. Ow. \nPenders just served into Walter again. \nSTEVE PENDERS Can you get off the fucking court here? \nWALTER I'd like to speak to your supervisor. \nSTEVE PENDERS You can't. \nWALTER I demand to speak to your supervisor. \nSTEVE PENDERS You can't do that either. \nWALTER I'd like to demand to speak to your supervisor. \nSTEVE PENDERS I don't work at Comcast. I don't have a supervisor you can just talk to. My supervisor is Mark Chatham. He owns The Timms Company. Which is a holding company that holds conglomerates. He's in Los Angeles for the G8 summit, and he wouldn't talk to you anyway even if you were stuck in a fucking elevator. That's my supervisor. \nWALTER The Purpose of Life-- \nSTEVE PENDERS Go. \nWALTER Hey, fuck you, man. \nThere's been a little bit of a shoving, shoulder thing. It's getting a little hot. \nINT. BUS, MOVING, NY - LATER \nWalter's on the bus. He's looking at the out of focus print again. \nWALTER (TO HIMSELF) What is this? \nEDNA Sure you do. Everybody does. \nWalter thinks about it. Then Edna kisses him. \nEDNA (CONT'D) Thanks for taking care of us, Walter. \nWalter sits there for a moment. He is the man of the family. He's got to go out into the world and get something done. \nWALTER (rising to leave) I have to go somewhere, mom. Possibly I'll be reachable by phone. \nEXT. NYC - LATER \nThis is New York at lunch hour. Walter's out there with everybody. It's the same kind of Manhattan scene we've seen before, but here everybody around Walter's walking to their dream jobs. There's a large female jockey. A black matador, an elderly magician, etc. A wider view reveals a block full of men and women headed for jobs that were not \"fall back\" jobs but longed-for walks of life - astronaut, beekeeper, rodeo clown, Supreme Court Judge, a city-block full of who are visibly living dreams. It's a colorful environment. Except for one normal looking guy beside Walter. \nWALTER What are you? \nNORMAL GUY Stay at home dad. \nWALTER Cool. \nNORMAL GUY Congratulations. \nWALTER Thanks, man. \nWalter looks normal. But he's holding a trophy. This is what he's just been congratulated over. \nNORMAL GUY Is that a Grammy? Or a Nobel-- \nWALTER Grammy. Best male R & B vocal performance. \nNORMAL GUY Way to go. \nWALTER You, too. \nWalter (with his trophy) crosses the street with the whole massive host of dream job-going New York commuters - a thousand of them. \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION, BROOKLYN - LATER \nWalter back in the working world, runs up a platform to catch a train that's nearly leaving. \nINT. TERMINAL, JFK - LATER \nWalter's at Etihad Airways booking desk. It's a shabby airline. It's a shabby-looking desk. There's only one clerk and Walter's the only one in line. \nETIHAD CLERK There's only one flight to Nepal, in the next 18 hours. \nWALTER That's okay. \nETIHAD CLERK (checking his computer) But there aren't any seats left. \nWALTER (DISAPPOINTED) None? \nETIHAD CLERK I'm afraid not. \nWALTER ...Not one? \nETIHAD CLERK Well, there's one seat, but... \nHe looks around like he shouldn't be selling it, like it's not by the books, but he'll do it. \nINT. LAVATORY, ETIHAD AIRLINE FLIGHT, FLYING - DAY \nWalter's sitting in the airplane lavatory. He's not using it. He's just riding on it. It's the seat he just bought. Someone knocks. So Walter has to get up and leave for a moment. \nWe jump cut through Walter doing this several times. Then we find him during a nice quiet stretch, where he can sit on the lavatory seat uninterrupted for a couple minutes. During this time we watch him take out his wallet - the gift from Sean O'Connell. Walter looks at it \nCLOSE ON THE \"LIFE'S PURPOSE\" CREDO \nSpecifically we're looking at the line \"...the Purpose of Life.\" \nWalter's looking at this embossment on his wallet. He's lost faith anyone besides him takes it to heart. Walter no longer does either. So he discards the wallet in the lav trash. Then someone knocks on the lav door after which Walter must rise and leave the lavatory once more. \nEXT. ZHENGMO, NEPAL - DAY \nA small bus drives slowly up the single mountain road through the town of Zhengmo, Nepal. \nINT. BUS, MOVING, ZHENGMO - SAME \nWalter rides on this bus. There is a great deal to look at and marvel over out the window. Walter's doing that. \nEXT. VILLAGE TRAVELING LODGE, VILLAGE OF QUENN, NEPAL - LATER \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Hey, Walter. Why didn't you submit any pictures? Most people have photos of them with friends, out on the town. \nWALTER I don't really do a lot of, you know, swinging. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Swinging? \nWALTER Yeah. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Swinging means fucking married people. When you're married. \nWALTER Oh. I don't mean that. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR No. \nWALTER I meant like partying, I guess. I used to like to be at work at 8. And I have some family demands that keep me pretty busy. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Your mom and sister. \nWALTER Yeah. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR You know. People don't know they're leaning on you. Until you move. And they fall. \nWALTER (not in the mood for ADVICE) Are you Chinese? You're so wise. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR I'm neither. But I know you, Walter. I've been studying you here. You seem to carry a lot of weight. \nWALTER Well, I'm not going to move and let the people who lean on me fall, because the people who lean on me are my mom and my sister. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Are you in a bad mood? \nWALTER A little. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, let's keep rounding this profile out. What do you do during your downtime? \nWALTER I don't get a lot. But I guess if I had to say - mostly I just consider thoughts... for my visions for ideas and scenarios about the world. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR (like that sentence doesn't actually mean ANYTHING) You consider thoughts for your visions for ideas and scenarios about the world? \nWALTER Yeah. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR You daydream? \nTodd has gotten to the heart of the matter. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR (CONT'D) You know, studies show that people who spend a great deal of time fantasizing and daydreaming, doodling and shit they're not really that happy. \nSEAN ...Hey, man, do you mind? \nWalter has come upon, without realizing it, some kind of snow nest camp, camouflaged among trees. Photographer Sean O'Connell is camped there with his gear. Walter looks at him. \nSEAN (CONT'D) I'm trying to photograph a snow leopard. \nWALTER ...Sean? \nSEAN Yeah. \nWALTER (TO TODD) Hey, I got to go. \nEHARMONY COUNSELOR No problem. Congratulations. You're on eHarmony. \nWALTER Cool. \nWalter hangs his phone up. He looks at Sean. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Sean O'Connell? \nSEAN Yeah. \nWALTER Walter. Mitty. \nSEAN Walter. Seriously. What the fuck? What are you-- \nWALTER I've been looking for you. \nSEAN Sit down. \nWalter sits by the fire with Sean. \nSEAN (CONT'D) ...Are you okay? \nWALTER Yeah, warming up. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) There're assets in that bag. They're my responsi-- \nTwo police officers have moved in on Walter because he's the only protestor holding his ground and not fleeing (because he wants his briefcase) \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) I'm just trying to finish my job. Ask. I'm Walter Mitty. I'm a man. \nA TEAR-GAS CANNISTER LANDS AT WALTER'S FEET. But he remains there. He starts to call over (through the megaphone) to Mark Chatham forty yards away on the hotel steps. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) Sir? I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man! \nThe cops are getting rough with him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) I am Walter Mitty! I'm a man! I need to just snag my briefcase. I'm a man! Let me do my fucking job! \nWalter has fought through the cops, now he fights through the horses to reach his briefcase. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Horses! \nWalter's choking on the teargas but he won't quit. He's finally fought his way to his briefcase. \nINT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - LATER \nThey're watching this on the news at Life. It's a riot. Like Seattle. On screen, Walter's image has a beautiful thing to it - it's like Tank Man. \nA company man standing there in a short-sleeve dress shirt, getting tear-gassed, fighting to get out of there with his briefcase. \nWALTER I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man! \nUlf and Soren arrive at his side and try to drag him back from an approaching flank of LA riot police. They want these kids stepping back. Walter's not. When they reach him, there's a dust-up with Ulf. More kids get in the mix. It's going to get out of hand; the police are too rough, the kids too dumb to move. Walter's in the middle of it all. Soon, there are some wild punches. Then everyone in the scrum must fight to keep their teeth in their mouth. It's all broken loose. Walter's fighting it out like everyone else. More kids have run in. Some others, too, older. \nPROTESTOR I'm a man! \nThe kids start yelling this, too. \nYOUNGER PROTESTORS I'm a man! \nThere's like eight people yelling this now. \nOver where there's just a lot of people safely observing, along the sidewalks, some more down to earth types, older people, family people, this message is starting to hit. There's a 60-year-old WORKING MAN there. He's admiring Walter's guts. \nWORKING MAN ...you're goddamned right. \nINT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - SAME \nBack on the boardroom TVs we see that CNN is broadcasting a report on the riot. \nREPORTER Known only as \"I'm a man Man.\" This brave protestor was tear-gassed then just \"f\"ing hammered with nightsticks. I'm sorry I'm losing some professionalism. But this guy just wouldn't back down. Let him get his briefcase. Jeez. \nOn screen, there is further footage from the G8. Walter's in the middle of a pack really getting worked over by fired-up police. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - SAME \nWe have a helicopter view of the G8 scene, there's a huge concert going on, the summit across the street and the street in between swelling with a mob of people. \nRADIO HOST (O.S.) All right Los Angeles County. You're on Talk 360. What do you think of \"I'm a man\" Man? \nCALLER (LATINO) Like the guy's style. He's just letting the world now \"don't walk all over me.\" Wasn't that on one of our old flags and shit?\" He's a human man. Those corporations own the cops, man. You know that. Do you not? \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - SAME \nOn the streets, outside the summit, lots of the crowd is yelling \"I'm a man.\" You can hear Rage Against the Machine soundchecking across the street. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER \nit's important to note that the source footage for most of what follows is the actual hand-held video captures of the cop-baiting Rage Against the Machine daytime concert staged among five city blocks outside the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Five thousand angry, anti- establishment young people - 2,000 police officers wearing riot gear, as well as additional horses, motorcycles, squad cars and police helicopters, all captured in raw frames Walter has been very naturally included in. He's trying to walk through the crowd, find his way home through it (this is the free provocative downtown concert the reporter mentioned) but he's being recognized. \nKID It's I'm a Man Man. \nWalter's trying to find his Danish friends. \nWALTER Ulf? \nWalter's being rubbed on the head by way of congratulations, recognized from what he did earlier. Pretty soon he's up (sort of against his will) on their shoulders. Rage Against the Machine has begun Bulls On Parade - it's an anti- establishment classic. On stage: \nLEAD SINGER ZACH DE LA ROCHA Brothers and sisters, Our democracy has been hijacked. All your true freedoms in this country are over, as long as it's controlled by corporations. (NOTICING WALTER) Is that that motherfucker from the fight? \nBack in the crowd, they're riled up. They start passing Walter forward (atop them) like a beach ball. \nZACH DE LA ROCHA Pass him up here. (starting the song) \nThe song kicks in. It's an electric area now. The song's powerful. The crowd's starting to feel like a mob. Walter's still a beach ball they're sending up to the stage. He crosses seventy feet on his back, passed up by a couple hundred hands. Soon the crowd has him on the stage. Right among the band. \n", "test1_input": "ODESSA (O.S.) But didn't we get the Villa so we can put Mom's piano in it? \nWALTER Yeah. \nThe situation makes no sense. But it's where they've found themselves. \nWALTER (CONT'D) It's \"f\"d up. I know. But if I don't get my severance I'm going to have to forfeit that deposit, because I can't afford the room. And I won't have enough to get her another place. Another decent place. \nODESSA (O.S.) So we may end up having to pay for a bigger room because it can hold a piano by selling that piano? And then having to pay for the bigger empty room for a year. \nWALTER Yeah. \nODESSA (O.S.) ....Did you get everything you wanted? For your birthday. \nWALTER Almost? \nODESSA (O.S.) What's left? \nWALTER Nothing I just want everyone in the world to be Morgan Freeman. So it would just be me and Morgan Freemans, in the whole world. \nODESSA (O.S.) (SMILING) What about me? \nWALTER You'd be you. But like a combo with him. Just a little calmer, more quiet. Gentler. \nODESSA (O.S.) Would I have push-back hair and freckles? \nWALTER Yeah. \nODESSA (V.O.) Where are you? \nWALTER Los Angeles. \nODESSA (O.S.) Are you okay? You sound tired. \nWALTER I'm okay. I'm going to take the train to my hotel. Try to get home tomorrow. \nODESSA (O.S.) I love you. \nWALTER I love you, too. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER \nThis is a huge shot of downtown. We pan back around and find we're in a metro train. Walter's there. He's nearing his stop. So he rises, and he walks past his rowmate to the aisle, but he's jostled her accidentally. \nWALTER I'm sorry. \nShe's a fifteen-year Puerto Rican girl (who's Morgan Freeman). \n15-YR-OLD-PUERTO-RICAN GIRL MORGAN FREEMAN (Morgan freeman's voice) Don't worry about it. \nShe's been morphed with Morgan Freeman -- still Puerto Rican but also Morgan Freeman. We notice elsewhere around Walter this has happened; everyone in his vicinity (the train he's walking off) has a combination with Morgan Freeman's features - Korean Morgan Freemans, Transit Police Freemans, six-year- olds. Black ones. Everyone around, morphed with the familiar characteristics of the dignified and peaceful actor. Walter has a hundred Morgan Freemans around him. It's a good world. Walter walks in the midst of it all. \nEXT. 2ND STREET, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER \nWalter, walking with his briefcase, has reached a street corner farther east in downtown L.A. The Morgan Freemans have left him. It's the regular world. Walter's trying to cross up 2nd Street, but he's found a police barricade there. \nCOP You can't go this way without a summit pass. \nWALTER What's a summit pass? \nCOP For the G8. \nWALTER I'm trying to get to my hotel. \nCOP ... protests are on 3rd street. \nWalter watches a series of limos drive by; they're bound for their downtown hotel and the summit there. Walter recalls an association to this. The director of his corporation's attending. \nWALTER My boss, the guy who runs my company is here. Is it cool if I talked to him. Am I allowed? \nCOP This is America. You can do whatever you want as long as you stay on the far sides of the barricades on 3rd. \nWALTER There's a work situation I want to clue him in on. I was let go with cause. But there wasn't-- \nCOP Hey. Keep walking, okay? I've got a job to do. \nINT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - LATER \nThe TVs are on in the corporate board rooms, no one's watching but if they were, they'd see news report from MSNBC from the G8 summit in Los Angeles \nFEMALE NEWS REPORTER It's a tense environment. To be sure. There are fears of a repeat of the violence in Seattle at the WTO. And there are three thousand more protestors here today. \n", "test1_true": "FEMALE NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D) There's an outdoor concert scheduled just a block away from the hotel where the summit is held, which summit organizers say is a deliberate provocation, but which concert promoters and protestors say is within their freedom to assemble. \nWalter walks by her. He's still dressed the same. Still with his briefcase, now in Los Angeles at the G8. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - SAME \nThe G8 summit attendees (business leaders and government leaders from across the industrialized world) are being hustled past the crowds of chanting young people. Some are fielding reporter's questions hastily, then heading up the hotel steps for the summit. There's a huge number of people here, protestors, reporters, police (many). It already feels a little like mayhem. \nBusiness leader MARK CHATHAM is wrapping up an exchange with CNN on the sidewalk outside the steps, then he starts being peppered with a request from Walter who's amid the chanting protestors on the other side of the barricades. \nWALTER Sir, can I have two secs? Mr. Chatham, Can I have two secs? I'm a former employee of one of your companies. Mitty? \nChatham has noticed Walter. The CNN reporter looks on. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Just two secs? Former employee? Mitty? I was let go with cause. But I don't think that's actually what should have happened. \nIt's awkward for Chatham, observed and on camera by CNN. He can't blatantly ignore Walter now. \nMARK CHATHAM Where did you work? \nWALTER The Life corporation. Two secs? \nMARK CHATHAM (gesturing for Walter to \"HOLD ON\") One minute. \nMark says something to an aide. The guy begins to make a phone call. Walter waits as Chatham finished his CNN exchange. Walter's jostled by the crowd. The police are in the midst now, trying to push people back. It's getting a little rough, ugly. \nWhen Chatham finishes with CNN, his aide hangs up his phone and he says something to Chatham that Walter overhears. \nAIDE There was a Mitty there, but she's a black woman. \nMARK CHATHAM OKAY (leaving, to Walter) Nice try. \nChatham heads up to the hotel. He's brushed Walter off. A cop's trying to move Walter back. Walter's resisting, needing Chatham. \nWALTER Wait. No. I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man! \nChatham's a little farther away. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (YELLING OUT) I'm Walter Mitty! \nWalter has passed the barrier. The cop's getting hard with him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (really having to yell NOW) I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man! \nPOLICE OFFICER Get the fuck behind the barricade. \nWALTER (meaning the young PROTESTORS) I'm not with them. \nIt's at this point one of the young Danish teens Walter befriended in Dubai comes up to Walter, glad to see him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (pleased to see Ulf even in the midst of this) Hey, Ulf. \nNow the cop's convinced Walter means harm. He's just shoved Walter in the chest with his nightstick. \nWALTER (CONT'D) What the fuck? \nSomething has snapped beyond them. Some real violence has started. The cops are bearing down. Walter gets jacked in the thigh with a nightstick. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Ow, fuck, man. Hey, I have a scaled- back co-pay medical plan. \nA phalanx of police has moved in. They're a straight-across line of force, there to push the protestors back. During this scrum, Walter becomes separated from his briefcase.  He's literally held it throughout the movie - Greenland, Dubai, Mogadishu, Nepal; now it's been torn from his hands. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Hey. \nNew desperation comes over him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Hey, my briefcase. \nWalter's being pushed farther back. There is great noise around and an antic vibe of violence brewing. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Seriously. Can I just-- I need my briefcase. \nWalter, during the mayhem finds an abandoned megaphone at his feet. He starts to use it. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone, to the gathering police) Okay. Hey can I just get my briefcase. It's behind you guys. \nWalter really has to fight to even hold his ground here. \nWALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) My briefcase? It has assets in there that belong to the company that-- a negative roll. Can all you people stop for one second so I can get my goddamned briefcase. Horses? \nA new line of mounted riot police have moved in, filling the space left between Walter, the riot police wall and Walter's briefcase laying there on the pavement. The horses endanger it. They gather around it, precariously close to damaging what it holds. \n", "test2_input": "TODD MAHAR Yeah. Traffic's tough. But it's a cool city. If you get bored here, man, it's your fault. \nWALTER You look different. \nTODD MAHAR Than what? \nWALTER Than I pictured. I pictured you wearing an old time judge's wig. The whole time. \nTODD MAHAR The whole time we talked you pictured me in a judge's wig? \nWalter's cell has started ringing. \nWALTER Hello? \nWOMAN'S VOICE Hi this is Cynthia Despihg. With Etihad Airlines. Is this Walter Mitty? \nWALTER Yeah, hey. \nWOMAN'S VOICE We found your wallet. I think. \nThis has surprised Walter. He's gone quiet. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Are you a Walter Mitty who flew to Nepal Wednesday the 15th? \nWALTER Yes I'm a Walter Mitty who did that. \nWOMAN'S VOICE We have your wallet. It's at our Los Angeles terminal office. \nWALTER I'm in Los Angeles. With pancakes. (after a moment) I don't know why I just said that. I'm excited. \nWOMAN'S VOICE It's exciting to get your wallet back when you thought you lost it. \nWALTER ...for sure. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Maintenance found it in a trash receptacle. You must have ACCIDENTALLY-- \nWALTER Yeah. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Our luggage delivery car can get it to you. She's going out now. \nWALTER (NEARLY OVERWHELMED) ...thank you. \nEXT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES, LOS ANGELES - LATER \nWalter and Todd Mahar wait out in front of IHOP, under the IHOP overhang, waiting for Walter's wallet to arrive in the parking lot.  every once in a while, when Walter looks at Todd, Todd's wearing an old time judge's wig. \nWALTER Do I look like you pictured? \nTODD MAHAR Yep. Pretty normal looking guy. \nThis didn't really jack Walter up. \nTODD MAHAR (CONT'D) You look normal. But you're not. You're a pretty interesting guy Walter. \nA car pulls up. \nTODD MAHAR (CONT'D) I'm glad you got out of the office. It's good to meet you. \nA young woman (middle-eastern, 20s) has left the small car. She's walking up to Walter; she's got his wallet. \nETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL Are you Walter Mitty? \nWALTER Yeah. \nETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL Here you go. \nShe hands Walter his wallet. \nETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL (CONT'D) That's really beautiful. \nWALTER What's that? \nETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL What it says. Life's Purpose. \nShe looks at Walter for a while. \nETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL (CONT'D) To see things hidden behind walls, to take pleasure in seeing, to see and be amazed, that is the purpose of Life. I really like that. I'm glad you got it back. \nWALTER Yeah. I appreciate it. That was cool of you guys. \nETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL (LEAVING) Have a nice night. \n", "test2_true": "They're driving through nighttime Los Angeles. Walter's just opened his wallet. He's looking at the little picture sleeve. There's a small white envelope in there. Walter removes it. Then he takes a film negative from the envelope. Just to check it's there. Then he puts it right back in the envelope without examining it. \nTODD MAHAR (in a judge's wig here) What is it? \nWALTER I don't know. I don't care. I have it. \nWalter and Todd ride along for a while. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Can you drop me off at like... where would that guy stay? Who owns my company? Mark Chatham. \nTED HENDRICKS Want to try the Four Seasons? \nINT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER \nWalter has walked up to the front desk of the Four Seasons lobby. \nWALTER Mark Chatham? \nThe young desk clerk picks up the house phone. A ring. \nFOUR SEASONS CLERK I'm a Man Man's here? \nThe clerk listens for a moment. Walter waits to see if he'll be allowed up. He will. \nFOUR SEASONS CLERK (CONT'D) Room Seven Ten. \nINT. HOTEL 7TH FLOOR - LATER \nWalter waits just outside a Four Season's hotel room door. He's just finished knocking. The guy who holds conglomerates Mark Chatham answers the door. \nWALTER Hey. Man, I'm sorry. I was hoping I could talk to you for two secs? \nA moment goes by. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I'm Walter Mitty. \nMark looks at him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I'm not a black woman, with a mustache. I'm a man who used to work for your company. \nMARK CHATHAM Your the guy from TV? I'm a Man Guy? \nWALTER I don't know. I was in jail. We didn't get TV. \nMARK CHATHAM You are. \nYou don't know which way Chatham's going to go. But he respects Walter. He extends his hand. Walter takes it. \nWALTER Can I just talk to you for two secs.? \nA moment passes. \nMARK CHATHAM Not in my room. Because you're freaking me out a little. Can we maybe sit out here. Indian style or something? \nINT. HALLWAY - LATER \nMark and Walter sit Indian Style facing each other in the Four Seasons fifth floor hallway. Chatham's holding a negative roll. \nWALTER There was one absent from the roll. But I have it. \nWalter hands the small envelope over. \nMARK CHATHAM That's the one Sean O'Connell wants for the cover? The Quintessence one? \nWALTER Yeah. For the last issue. That's the complete roll. \nMARK CHATHAM What was in the briefcase? Out on the street, when you were getting cracked in the neck by police sticks. \nWALTER (meaning the roll) Those. \nMARK CHATHAM Well, thanks. \nWALTER That last one's pretty late. Nine days late. There was an unforeseen set of unbelievable shit that happened. \nMARK CHATHAM Why do people think that you're a black woman? \nWALTER I sit way in the back. Maybe that's- \nMARK CHATHAM What does tear gas really feel like? \nWALTER It's a pretty intense burn. It's like having Cajun eyes. Spicy eyes. \n", "test3_input": "MARK CHATHAM I saw you on TV fighting a mailbox. \nA long time passes. \nWALTER Was that a question? \nMARK CHATHAM Not like in the form that I just said it. But... \nWalter still doesn't say anything about his participation in a riot. So Mark rephrases it. \nMARK CHATHAM (CONT'D) Why were you fighting a mailbox? \nWALTER I guess I was revved up. \nMARK CHATHAM From what? \nWALTER From fighting with a piano for a month and trying to get someone at my company to evaluate my position there based on understanding what I actually do. \nMARK CHATHAM You fight pianos, too? \nWALTER Not in the way that I fought the mailbox, but just in the way that I've been struggling with one. \nMARK CHATHAM (recounting Walter having told him this moments AGO) You rode in a car on a boat? \nWALTER Yes. \nMARK CHATHAM You slept on a copier in a business center? \nWALTER Yes. \nMARK CHATHAM You're an interesting guy. \nWALTER (pleased to hear this) Someone else told me that. An hour ago. Hey, I don't want to take up too much more of your time. But I'd like my severance. There's no cause to keep it from me. That's what I was trying to tell you downtown. I did my job well for nine years. \nMARK CHATHAM That's all you were trying to say downtown? \nWALTER Yeah. \nSome moments go by next, while Mark and Walter sit Indian style with the Sean O'Connell photo of Walter sitting between them. \nMARK CHATHAM I'm going to run some numbers. \nMark has stood up and started in to his hotel room. Walter's been following him. \nMARK CHATHAM (CONT'D) (meaning don't follow me IN) Not right now. I don't even know where the numbers are. There in some guy's computer. Show up Monday, let's see. \nThe door closes, Walter's left out there to wait. \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION, BROOKLYN - NIGHT \nWalter has returned to Brooklyn; he's heading up a set of Subway stairs up to a neighborhood street. \nINT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - DAY \nWalter crosses the huge lobby, dressed as always for work. \nINT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER \nWalter has entered the elevator. He's alone. It won't work without his floor elevator key (which stopped working once he was let go). Walter waits a moment. Then he tries his key. The button illuminates. Walter starts to ascend. \nINT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, CORRIDOR - LATER \nWalter has reached the floor elevator corridor door to his division floor office. He's just tried his pass key. That functions as well. \nINT. ACCOUNTING OFFICE - LATER \nWalter waits in a line at an accounting office window counter (like a DMV) behind recently let-go colleagues Tim Naughton and Gary Mannheim. Tim speaks to the accounting clerk. \nTIM NAUGHTON Tim Naughton? Severance package? \nShe hands Tim his check. He's sad, but he takes it and heads off. \nGARY MANNHEIM Gary Mannheim. Same. \nAfter a moment, Gary gets his severance. He's also blue about it. Then Walter steps up. \nWALTER Walter Mitty? Is there a... possibly there's a severance package for me? \nShe starts typing into her keyboard. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I was fired for cause, but then I think I maybe gave them cause to provide me with a severance package. \n", "test3_true": "WALTER Okay. Possibly there's that? For me? \nShe's typed additional stuff. Then she roots around in a check stash. Then she hands Walter an envelope. He takes it. He looks at it for a while. For the first time in a long while, he seems relieved. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK, NYC - LATER \nWalter's just walking through the park. He looks at peace. There are many others around, all coming and going at a normal pace, but the earth around them transforms from winter to summer smoothly over the course of thirty seconds as they naturally inhabit the park in their regular ways. So when Walter sits at a bench. It's all midsummer around him. He's smiling from relief. \nCUT TO: \nA FLOATING PIANO \nThis is a grand piano mid-air in Manhattan. \nEXT. BATTERY PARK - LATER \nThere's a winch machine, a huge rig, lifting this piano to the 7th floor of the residential building Walter secured for his mom. Walter and Odessa stand in Battery Park, looking up at the piano. The movers are setting it into the removed window space. It looks like it's going to fit. \nINT. VILLA, ROOM, RETIREMENT - LATER \nThe piano has fit easily here. Odessa and Edna are straightening up, putting the last few things away. The room's in good shape. It's really pretty nice. Edna seems at home. \nODESSA (TO WALTER) Hey, babe, come on. We'll go grab lunch. \nOdessa and Edna head out the door. \nWALTER I'll be right out. \nThey go. The room is quiet. Walter looks around again. Making it happen took considerable effort no one but Walter will know about. After a moment, he goes and sits at the piano. Some time passes. Then Walter plays the beginning of Cheers. Then he gets up and follows his sister and mom out. \nEXT. 5TH AVENUE - LATER \nWalter's walking with Odessa and Edna. They've come past a newsstand with magazine displays. Walter was going to walk right on by like Edna and Odessa did. But he's noticed something on the magazine racks that's stopped him. He stands there for a while looking at it. \nIt's the last issue of Life Magazine. Its cover is a black and white photograph of Walter siting on a cement bench out front of the Time-Life building. He's got his lunch in a brown bag beside him; he's looking over photo prints with his loupe, working carefully on some day in the past to fulfill the wishes of Life's photographers- a person who's work the world never knew took place. It's really good. You can see the word LIFE on the building sign above the bench. So the last photograph, on the last cover of Life, elegantly honors the people who quietly worked there and cared for it. \nWalter stands in front of the newsstand looking at it. It's the first time he's seeing it. It's a message that to Sean, at least, and possibly to others his work was meaningful. \nEXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - DAY \nOn another day, Walter's sitting in Battery Park across the little street where his mom lives. He's with Cheryl. Her son Rich skateboards around the park. \nCHERYL How'd the move go? \nWALTER All done. \nCHERYL Everybody's good? \nWALTER Everybody's good. \nTime passes. \nWALTER (CONT'D) How's Life? \nCHERYL The company or the... thing. \nWALTER Both. \nCHERYL The company's okay. The thing's tough. \nWALTER Yeah. \nCHERYL Are you glad you're not there anymore? \nWALTER I'm excited. About the new stuff. \nCHERYL What's the new stuff? \nWALTER I don't know yet. Would you have lunch with me? Somewhere not in the cafeteria. For once. Out somewhere? In the world. I was wondering that. \nShe smiles at Walter. \nCHERYL Yeah... \nShe starts looking in her scheduler. \nCHERYL (CONT'D) The ninth? Is that good? Two days? \nWALTER The ninth. Yeah. \nCHERYL Yeah, cool. \n"}

HENRY To be your loving and faithful husband. 
FATHER HAWKES In plenty and in want. 
HENRY In plenty and in want. 
FATHER HAWKES In joy and in sorrow. 
HENRY In joy and in sorrow. 
FATHER HAWKES In sickness and in health. 
HENRY In sickness and in health. 
FATHER HAWKES For as long as we both shall live. 
HENRY For as long as we both shall live. 
The gasket everyone is now mistaking for a ring is lifted high before the altar. 
FATHER HAWKES Bless, O Lord, this ring, that he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in your peace and continue in your favor until their life's end. 
The gasket is placed on Fay's finger. 
FATHER HAWKES Whom God has joined, let no man separate. 
The doors of the church swing open with a tremendous creak and everyone turns from the altar to see... 
Amy enter. She steps in and stands there, alarmed, clutching a long scroll of fax paper. 
HENRY Oh, shit. 
FAY Simon, do something. 
Simon walks down the aisle to see to Amy. 
The guests watch and wait. 
As Simon reaches her, Amy looks away from the altar and shows him the fax scroll. 
AMY Look. 
He studies the fax and recognizes his poem. He grows concerned. 
SIMON Where did you get this? 
AMY It's all over the Internet. 
Simon looks up the aisle at... 
Fay and Henry. They look away, caught. 
AMY They're even talking about it on the TV news. 
Confused, Simon starts for the door, shoving the fax in his pocket. Fay steps down from the altar... 
FAY Simon? 
Amy hurries along beside him. 
AMY There's a guy from the radio station over at World of Donuts and a story in the newspaper about some kids burning down a school near Boston! 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Later that evening. 
The whole neighborhood is celebrating Fay's wedding. The music is loud. The people are drunk. The place is a shambles. A big dance number is playing. Amidst all the festivities, though, Simon and Bu√±uel have the small TV propped up on top of the fridge, following the evening news... 
REPORTER (on TV) It all started right here in Queens, Jim, at World of Donuts about one year ago today, when local garbage man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper and began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious, antisocial and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and -- indeed -- the world. 
Fay leads the neighbors in the dance... 
OWEN FEER (on TV) This is outrageous! Measures must be taken. Have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet, and where the filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to turn on a computer? Is this what we have come to? Not the transmission of our highest ideals, but a cynical, atheistic delirium! 
Henry and Fay dance, surrounded by the dancing neighbors... 
POET LAUREATE (on TV) Poetry of this kind, and this poem in particular, is, I think, a worthy form of desperation; a digression on the extremes of human experience; of solitude, of community. It is perhaps alarming, even upsetting to some -- myself included -- but it must be allowed to exist. 
Henry throws an arm around Warren, who stands looking dejected in the doorway, and raises his glass to the happiness in the room. 
ANCHORMAN (on TV) Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope issued a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed the godless and lost. He did not mention Simon Grim by name, but offered a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and not the illusion of conviction offered by rock music, drugs and contemporary poetry. 
The TV is switched off. It's later now. People are passed out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are sitting around the table. Fay steps back from the TV, drains a glass of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her wedding gown. She hugs Simon, who is deeply unsettled by the news of his growing infamy. 
FAY God, Simon, I mean, like, you're a total fucking rock star. 
INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY 
A huge crowd of kids are pressed up against the doors, trying to get a peek at their hero, Simon Grim. 
Angus comes away from the window. He stands and regards Simon, who is sitting at a table tearing a napkin to shreds. 
ANGUS I'm willing to negotiate, Simon. 
SIMON I know, it's just... 
ANGUS You've had other offers. 
SIMON Well, yes. But. 
ANGUS What? 
SIMON Why have you reconsidered?

1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1 
A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath. Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing lights. The camera slows, and hovers. 
2 EXT. SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 2 
Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight. Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall. 
SUPER: 'SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA, 1940'. 
3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3 
A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian territories, still ear something of their national costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or 'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that has put them here. Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk. These men look healthier, and are further distinguished by their tattoos. 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: 3 These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters of the block. Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent, BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made cards. [All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED, 
EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH]. 
BOHDAN 
(IN RUSSIAN) What've you got? VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines it briefly. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) Think I want your stinking lice farm? 
VALKA Polish tailor. He shows the label. 
VALKA (CONT'D) See? From Krakov. Good as new. BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the coat. 
VALKA (CONT'D) And the sausage. BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I swear. I hope you die with an axe in your skull, and your balls ripped out. The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no reaction. 
VALKA (CONT'D) OK. For the bread. 
(CNNTTNTTFD ) 
3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3 BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid plays, VALKA is left coat-less. Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players, the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder, SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN. 
BOHDAN For the bread. 
VALKA For the bread, and the sausage, bastard! BOHDAN enjoying himself. 
BOHDAN Throw in that crappy shirt you're wearing and I might be tempted. Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage. Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again VALKA loses. VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then offers to BOHDAN. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) I don't play for regulation issue crap. VALKA lights a cigarette. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) All done, Valka? VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil of cool. 
VALKA I go on credit. 
BOHDAN 'Credit'? 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: ( 3) VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman.

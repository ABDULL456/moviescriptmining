Like a living wind.  A thousand screams in agony. \nFrom the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together quickly, forming the Main Title against black: \n\"EVIL DEAD\" \nThen beneath it, the Roman Numeral \"II.\" \nA SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.

This is the Book of the Dead. \nNARRATOR Legend has it, that it was written by the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES; Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead. \nThe face on the cover of the book pulls away from its skin binding and leans toward the camera.

Something evil is being unleashed. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) One by one, they fell to the possession of the dark spirits. \nAs he slams into the earth with a rain of glass.  He moans and gets to his feet. \n75    EXT.

CABIN - LOCATION                            82 POV - EVIL FORCE \nWe race into the cabin, splintering the hall door which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the rear hallway, and swings the hallway door shut.  We race right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces as we glide forward. \n83    INT. CABIN - STUDIO - \"MAZE SHOT\" - FORCE POV         83 \nCamera moves through the main room and up to the Hallway door.  It shatters in front of us.  We close in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone. The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves. \n84    INT./EXT. CABIN - LOCATION - POV EVIL FORCE           84 \nThe force begins to pull back with an ever-increasing speed, out the front door of the cabin, and deep into the blackness of the woods. \n85    INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          85 \nA static shot of the fireplace.  All is quiet.  Smoke from the near dead fire wafts up the chimney.  We hold on this for a moment. \n85A   ANGLE - MIDDLE BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT                 85A \nA static shot of a closet with it's door half open. The door begins to swing slightly open, revealing a rack of clothes inside.  We hold on this for a moment. \n85B   ANGLE - CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT       85B \nA writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that slight space between the trap door and the floor we see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes a sigh of relief. \n86    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                    86 \nThe cabin in the distance.

A man wearing a jumpsuit ties the airplane off and blocks the wheels while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie. \nED Annie! \nANNIE (smiling at sight of him) Hi. \nThey embrace and kiss. \nED How'd everything go on the expedition? \n165   OMIT                                                  165 \n166   EXT.

In the foreground is a crude burial cross and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the night air. \n166P  PLATE FOR PREVIOUS SCENE - EXT.

HILLSIDE GRAVEYARD - NIGHT (STUDIO)              168 (MINIATURE/STOP MOTION/REAR SCREEN) - 3 ANGLES \nThe WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening fog.  A waltz of the dead. \nThe style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat. The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions. \n168P  3 PLATES FOR PREVIOUS SCENE - MITCHELL CAMERA         168P EXT. HILLSIDE GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - FOG/WIND FAN \n169   INT.

And moves past the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a demon. \n187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R \nAs it is splattered with blood. \n187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S \nAsh stumbles back into frame and falls against the wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his hands; they are covered in Linda's blood. \nHe wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night. \n188   CRANE SHOT - EXT.

Sweating and nasty looking. \n192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192 MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE) \nThe reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an intimate whisper. \nREFLECTION I don't think we're \"fine\".  We're losing it...  starting to slip.  We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw.  Does that sound fine? \nThe reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and begins to strangle him. \n192P  PLATE FOR PREVIOUS SCENE                              192P INT.

KANDAR CASTLE - DUSK                             5A TRACKING SHOT - ASH \nThrough the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An image of power and light.

CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - (STUDIO)               7 TRACKING SHOT \nThe CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb. Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall, a bas relief of the \"Hero from the Sky\" holding his unusual jagged edged weapon. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) And then... \nThe grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard, and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds, illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the Book, awestruck. \nBehind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman, the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances. The CAMERA PANS down to the Book. \nDISSOLVE THRU TO: \n8     INT. STUDIO - BLACK                                   8 MED.

He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and distraught. \nRAYMOND It has only been a few hours since I've translated and spoke aloud the first of the demon resurrection passages from the Book of the Dead. \nThe sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar. It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin. He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt. \nRAYMOND And now, I fear that my wife has become host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive me for what I have unleashed onto this earth. \n13Y   REVERSE ACTION                                        13Y \nThe milky eyed possessed figure of HENRIETTA jolts quickly into the frame, and shrieks in the voice of a demon!

He looks at the off screen carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his hands; they are covered in Linda's blood. \nHe wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting himself with the stuff.

BRENDAN 
Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet. The lug's footsteps are impossibly loud. 
THE LUG 
Just about to round the corner. 
BRENDAN 
On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner. The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed. 
Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs into the lug's. The lug pitches forward with frightening momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway, and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut. A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed and a large brownie in another baggie. 
Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off. 
EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY 
Brendan breathes heavily into the phone. 
BRENDAN Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a sheepdog. 
THE BRAIN (on the phone) Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to any crowd. He's definitely not muscle for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd but doesn't hang with them. If you've got a guess I could check it out- 
BRENDAN The Pin. If he's with the Pin everything's kablooie and I gotta blow the burgh. 
THE BRAIN I'll check it. I'm in third now- Brendan spots the Pin's Cady pulling into the parking lot. 
BRENDAN Never mind. If I don't call by three call in the bulls. 
Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along the sidewalk. 
The cady pulls up beside him, and he stops walking. The door swings open and a voice comes from inside. 
VOICE Get in. 
With no perceivable hesitation, he does. 
INT. CADILAC - DAY 
Brendan sits beside the Pin. The windows are tinted and the car is very dark. The seats are pink vinyl. The car lurches forward. Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at each other. 
BRENDAN So? 
PIN So. Tangles. 
A stocky kid in the front seat turns, and reaches into his jacket. For a moment he stays like that, hand in his jacket, eyes on Brendan. Brendan's face is placid. 
Tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in Brendan's lap. 
PIN (cont'd) That's what you'll get every week for your services. Less of course there's a specific job involved, in where you get sliced in with my crew. Square? 
BRENDAN Yeah. 
Silence. The Pin holds his hat in his hands, fingering the rim. 
PIN We're doing a thing down at the Hole tonight. Know it? 
BRENDAN South of T Street, yeah. 
PIN It's sort of a welcome you in thing. Eight o'clock. 
The car stops. 
EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY 
Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked him up. The Cady drives off. Brendan checks his watch. 
BRENDAN'S WATCH 
12:32. A phone begins to ring. 
EXT. PICO & ALEXANDER - DAY 
Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone, holding the receiver to his ear in silence.

Nikon opens again. \nNIKON What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas? (to Phreak) Does he know anything? \nPHREAK Sure man, he's elite. \nNIKON (pausing, checking Dade out) Come in. \nCEREAL Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight? \nNIKON (removing his hood) Again? (pauses, then grins broadly) Yeah sure. \nNikon and Cereal do a fake Kung-fu move together. \nBOTH Ooka-pow! \nINT. NIKON'S PLACE. \nLater, the four are watching TV. On TV is a secret service agent giving a news interview. \nGILL (on TV) Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists. \nCEREAL Agent Richard Gill, You're hacker enemy number one, man. You're a boner! \nNIKON Yo, showtime, showtime! \nDADE What's going on? \nALL BUT DADE (in unison) \nCheesy music plays. Razor and Blade, androgynous asian brothers, have a community access TV show. \"Wayne's World\" in eye liner. \nRAZOR Welcome to our show! \nBLADE Hack the Planet! \nALL BUT DADE Hack the Planet! \nRAZOR For those late night hacks... \nBLADE Jolt Cola! The soft drink of the elite hacker. \nDADE Who are these guys? \nNIKON That's Razor and Blade. \nDADE Razor and Blade. \nNow Razor and Blade have a disconnected payphone in their studio. \nRAZOR That's right, this IS a payphone. \n", "test1_true": "BLADE As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. (shows the microcassette recorder)  Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters. \nRAZOR Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back! \nBLADE And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap... \nRAZOR ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons! \nBLADE Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait! \nINT. JOEY'S PLACE. \nJoey is taking a shower, wearing walkman headphones, singing along with the music. Joey finishes, turns off the shower, still singing. He draws open the shower curtain to find two secret service agents with shotguns pointed at him. \nSS AGENT FREEZE! \nJOEY What? What? What did I do? What? \nThe agents drag Joey, still naked and wet, out of the shower and into the living room. His mother is hysterical.. \nJOEY'S MOM Joey! \nAGENT Get in there! Sit down! \nANOTHER AGENT Stay down there. Don't move. \nJoey is pushed into a sofa. He sees his computer, \"Lucy\", being carried away. \nJOEY Lucy! \nJoey dives onto the agent carrying Lucy away, losing his towel.  His mother, seeing his exposed buttocks, is shocked. \nJOEY'S MOM JOEY!!! \nEXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE. \nA police-type vehicle pulls up. It's Agent Richard Gill of the Secret Service.  He stops a young agent for an update. \nGILL How's it going, Ray? \nAGENT RAY It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive. \nGILL In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot. \nAGENT RAY I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files. \nGILL Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation. \nAGENT RAY Alright sir. \nThey split up.  A reporter and her sound man run up to Gill. \nREPORTER Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your time? \nGILL Why of course, Jennifer. \nWhile Jennifer conducts the interview, agents lead Joey into an unmarked car. His mother is behind him, still hysterical. \nJOEY'S MOM Joey! \n", "test1_id": 1104, "test2_input": "Dade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead. \nFinally the crowd lets him go.  He catches up with Kate. \nKATE I lost 'em. Where were you? \nDade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words. \nThey make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's lair. Video monitors are everywhere. \nDADE I don't like this. \nA robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at Dade. \nDADE AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this! \nBLADE (through video intercom) What do you want? \nDADE Ummm... we come in peace? \nDade winces at his own corniness. \nKATE We need your help.  If you're up to it. \nRAZOR She's buff. Ballsy. \nBLADE Let's keep her. \nRAZOR Waste the dude. \nThe gun goes off. It's only a cigarette lighter! No one can accuse Razor and Blade of not having a sense of humor. \nINT. RAZOR AND BLADE'S PLACE. \nKATE A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow. \nDADE It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money. \nKATE We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program. \nRAZOR She's rabid, but cute. \nBLADE See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. \nDADE (noticing the stench of sellout) Let's go, Kate. \nRAZOR Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us. You need an army. \nBLADE That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal. \nRAZOR Hackers of the World, Unite! \nBLADE How are you going to take care of the cops? \nDade just smiles. \nINT. DADE'S ROOM. \nDade hacks into the city traffic light control system. Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York City. \n", "test2_true": "Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews. Cereal's beeper goes off. It displays the message: \nGRAND CENTRAL HACK THE PLANET \nCEREAL Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand Central. Let's hit it! \nNikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave. \nDade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets. Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green, runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off. \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION. \nThe four hackers skate into Grand Central Station and head to the lowest level. They meet up with Joey. \nCEREAL Hey Joey, you made it! \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES. \nThe hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay phones.  Dade is wearing a \"Pirate Eye\" eyepiece. \nKATE Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us time, we have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm. \nCereal screams. \nCEREAL Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright? \nKATE Cereal. \nCEREAL Yeah? \nKATE Go fix the phones. \nCEREAL Roger. \nCereal takes off to fix the phones. \nKATE Joey, take his place. \nJOEY What, me? \nKATE Take his place, man, do it. You can do it. \nJoey takes Cereal's place. \nKATE Ready? \nDADE Yeah. \nKATE Alright, let's boot up. \nThe four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens come up on the laptops. They begin to hack. We see the inside of the Gibson. Viruses of all kinds begin to pour in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye patches appear on their screens. \"Sit on my interface.\" \"Shit for Brains.\" \"Arf Arf Arf!\" Cookie monsters. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL. \nThe big monitor shows the attack in progress. \nMARGO What is it?

MURPHY Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell them. \nGILL Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that. \nMRS.

SECRET SERVICE OFFICES. \nThe news crew interviews Gill. \nREPORTER ...and attacked the Ellingson's computer network.

This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop... \nNikon and Joey are led in. \nThe monitors cut into static, then Cereal appears. \nSOMEONE That kid cut him off! \nCEREAL Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television appearance. Yes, that's right, I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral. \nRazor and Blade busily work on keeping him on the air. \nCEREAL But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program? \nCereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in Times Square. \nCEREAL But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. The password for this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head of public relations at Ellingson Mineral... \nINT.

POLICE STATION, WOMEN'S LOCKUP. \nMargo Wallace has been arrested, and is being led into the women's lockup. Some of the other women grab at her expensive Italian leather jacket as she is led to her cell. \nMARGO I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone a computer! Get off!

Kate is heavily made up, and yes, she is wearing a dress. \nDADE You look good in a dress. \nKATE You would have looked better. \nDADE Wanna go for a swim? \nEXT.

Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite. \nKATE Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. \nThey look out at the skyline.

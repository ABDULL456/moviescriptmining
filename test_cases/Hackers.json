{"train": "HACKERS \nWritten by \nRafael Moreu \nSEATTLE 1988 \nEXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY. \nSlow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast. \nNow, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula. \nINT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY. \nWOMAN (screams) Oough! Ahhh! \nSECRET SERVICE AGENT (to others) Upstairs. \nTroops pour into the house. \nWOMAN What's going on? What's the matter? Who are you? \nThe troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles ready. \nWOMAN Hey! \nUpstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops descend on a bedroom. \nWOMAN (off camera) Dade! Dade! \nAGENT Knock it down. \nThe battering ram knocks down a bedroom door. \nINT. COURTROOM. \nThe prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else. \nPROSECUTOR The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself \"Zero Cool\", has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature. This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end. His computer virus crashed one thousand five hundred and seven computer systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single handedly causing a seven point drop in the New York Stock Market. \nAs she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade Murphy. \nFast forward to the sentencing. \nJUDGE Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family forty-five thousand dollars... \nThe court gasps, Dade's father winces \nJUDGE ...and sentence you to probation, under which you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or touch tone telephone, until the day of your eighteenth birthday. \nNow Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry. \nOpening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and photographers, in slow motion, and driving away. \nSEVEN YEARS LATER. \nAboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city, which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The title logo. \nDade's screen dissolves into: \nACID BURN \nDADE Unbelievable. A hacker! \nThen the screen changes again: \nACID BURN SEZ LEAVE B 4 U R EXPUNGED \n\"The Outer Limits\" suddenly flashes off. \nDADE Yeah, okay \"Acid Burn\", that's enough. \nDade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps changing. \nThe message comes up on Dade's computer screen: \nI WILL SWAT U LIKE THE FLY U R \nMore dueling tape changers, more half second video clips. Another message. \nI WILL SNAP YOUR BACK LIKE A TOOTHPICK \nAs the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own: \nMESS WITH THE BEST DIE LIKE THE REST \nOne last from Acid Burn: \nYOU ARE TERMINATED \nThen his own computer confirms for him that the connection is terminated. \nDADE Shit on me! \nNext morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging moving boxes) for the fridge. \nMRS. MURPHY Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet? \nDADE Mm-hmm. \nMRS. MURPHY Up all night again, huh? \nDADE Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please? \nDade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the building superintendent. \nMRS. MURPHY Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. (pause) Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you? \nDADE Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet. \nMRS. MURPHY You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? (louder) Right, Dade?! \nDADE Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin! \nDade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks his room. Dade is showering. \nMRS. MURPHY (angry, through the bathroom door) You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up again and you won't get into college! \nDADE My... class. You mean I'm not in your class? \nKATE No, you're not in my class. \nKate starts away. \nDADE Give me time! \nA guy in the halls notices Dade. \nGUY Hey, you new? \nDADE Yeah. \nGUY Tell him about the pool, Kate. \nDADE Pool? \nKATE Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there. \nDADE Yeah! Sure. \nKate starts away again. \nDADE Thanks! \nEXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP. \nDade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention. One of them notices Dade. \nGEEK Hey! Hold the door! \nHe's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool. \nDade (realizing he's been had) No pool. \nDade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins raining. \nINT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. \nDade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles. \nKATE Oh my God! He found the pool. \nINT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB. \nThe kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing skeletons. \nTEACHER I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms. Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur rally. I know some of you kids got computers at home. But these are school property, people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical interface... \nMeanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking himself into her advanced English class. \nEXT. SCHOOL QUAD. \nIt's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him. \nKID So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual? \nDADE Homicidal? \nDADE Revenge. \nMRS. MURPHY Aaaah. Did we meet someone special? \nDADE No. No one special. \nMRS. MURPHY Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out? \nShe indicates a pile of college applications. \nMRS. MURPHY Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your life. \nShe starts to the door. \nDADE Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass. \nMRS. MURPHY And unpack. \nShe leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this now. \nINT. CYBERDELIA. \nDade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter Cereal. \nCEREAL FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do like absolutely nothing and... \nCereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met formally but seen around, and then continues. \nCEREAL ...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks. \nPHREAK Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things. \nDade and Cereal acknowledge each other. \nJOEY Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around... \nPHREAK (to Cereal) D'you bring those Crayola books? \nCEREAL Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow. \nCereal brings a book out of his bag. \nCEREAL Green one. \nJOEY What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What are these? \nDADE International Unix Environments. \nCereal pulls out another book. \nCEREAL Luscious orange? \nCereal hands the orange book to Phreak. \nDADE Computer security criteria, DOD standards. \nAnother book comes out. \nDADE The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover. \nCEREAL It was him, man! \nPHREAK You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit. \nCEREAL (to Joey) I'm gonna hit you! \nINT. JOEY'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nJoey is hacking. A Gibson. He gets in. Using GOD as a password. Nice graphics represent the machine's vast systems. \nJOEY YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy. We're gonna show em baby. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL. \nA system operator at Ellingson Mineral Corporation, a large oil company, notices the intrusion. He gets on the phone. \nINT. PLAGUE'S LOFT. \nThe place is a mess, typical of the hacker bachelor pad. Empty chinese food boxes and Jolt Cola cans litter the place. \nPlague's phone is ringing, waking him. \nHAL (on phone) Mr. Belford? \nPLAGUE (sleepily) My name is the Plague. \nHAL Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net. \nPLAGUE As in what, you hapless techno-weenie? \nHAL Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker. \nINT. JOEY'S ROOM. \nJOEY Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here. Right, uh... \nJoey starts looking for something to download as proof he was there. \nJOEY Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage. \nHe selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL. \nThe Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin, bearded, about 35 but still trying to be a teenage anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that ideal years ago. \nPLAGUE Never fear. I is here. \nHAL I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23. \nPLAGUE Let's echo 23, see what's up. \nThe huge monitor lights up with the display of the Gibson's resources. Hal and the Plague watch. Plague starts \"surfing\" around. \nPLAGUE \"God\" wouldn't be up this late. \nHe sees what Joey is downloading. A file called \"Garbage\". \nPLAGUE Shit! Get me the switching control center. \nNIKON Never heard of you. Done anything? \nDADE No. \nNikon slams the door. \nPHREAK Come on! \nPhreak knocks the door again. Nikon opens again. \nNIKON What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas? (to Phreak) Does he know anything? \nPHREAK Sure man, he's elite. \nNIKON (pausing, checking Dade out) Come in. \nCEREAL Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight? \nNIKON (removing his hood) Again? (pauses, then grins broadly) Yeah sure. \nNikon and Cereal do a fake Kung-fu move together. \nBOTH Ooka-pow! \nINT. NIKON'S PLACE. \nLater, the four are watching TV. On TV is a secret service agent giving a news interview. \nGILL (on TV) Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists. \nCEREAL Agent Richard Gill, You're hacker enemy number one, man. You're a boner! \nNIKON Yo, showtime, showtime! \nDADE What's going on? \nALL BUT DADE (in unison) \nCheesy music plays. Razor and Blade, androgynous asian brothers, have a community access TV show. \"Wayne's World\" in eye liner. \nRAZOR Welcome to our show! \nBLADE Hack the Planet! \nALL BUT DADE Hack the Planet! \nRAZOR For those late night hacks... \nBLADE Jolt Cola! The soft drink of the elite hacker. \nDADE Who are these guys? \nNIKON That's Razor and Blade. \nDADE Razor and Blade. \nNow Razor and Blade have a disconnected payphone in their studio. \nRAZOR That's right, this IS a payphone. \nJOEY Mom... \nJENNIFER Just how dangerous are hackers? \nGILL Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses... \nJOEY'S MOM Joey! \nGILL ...and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends. These people, they're terrorists... \nJOEY'S MOM Joey! \nINT. ELLINGSON MINERAL CORPORATION. \nA tall, impressive building. A cavernous atrium filled with busy people. \nINT. ELLINGSON BOARDROOM. \nA handsome looking woman in her late thirties walks in. \nMARGO Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene. \nPLAGUE (to Margo) Once again, don't call me Eugene. (to the board) A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system. \nMARGO Precisely what you're paid to prevent. \nPLAGUE Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, (gesturing lewdly) sex, secret and... (eyeing Margo) ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password? \nMargo just blinks prettily. \nPLAGUE A hacker planted the virus. \nMARGO Virus? \nPLAGUE Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks. \nMARGO Excuse me? \nPLAGUE (as if to a child) The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility. \nMARGO What, it left a note? \nPlague hits a button on a remote control, and the virus - a long haired male model - appears on a large screen, in psychedelic colors. The virus speaks in a hammy Italian accent. \nVIRUS Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet. \nBOARD MEMBER Is that... \nPLAGUE (interrupting) That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and we don't know which ones are infected. \nDUKE ELLINGSON Well then, put the ships' ballasts under manual control. \nPLAGUE There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These ships are totally computerized. They rely on satellite navigation, which links them to our network, and the virus, wherever they are in the world. \nMARGO So what are we supposed to do? \nPLAGUE Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it. \nINT. ELLINGSON MINERAL ATRIUM. \nGILL Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc. \nEXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE. \nJoey's apartment building is an L-shaped skyscraper about 30 storeys high, unimpressive by New York City standards. Two Secret Service agents are staking Joey out in a car outside. \nSECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still grounded... by his mother. \nHis radio crackles. \nAGENT BOB Listen to this bullshit. (he reads) \"This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto.\" Huh, right, manifesto? \"You may stop me, but you can't stop us all.\" \nAGENT RAY Now that's cool. \nAGENT BOB Cool? \nAGENT RAY Yeah, cool. \nAGENT BOB You think it's cool? \nAGENT RAY (not caring for where Bob is going with this) It's cool! \nAGENT BOB It's not cool. It's commie bullshit! \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM. \nDade, Cereal and Phreak check their faces. Cereal brushes his teeth. \nCEREAL (to Phreak) So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight? \nDADE What is it with this guy? \nPHREAK His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust? \nCEREAL Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho. \nPHREAK Do you think he could hack a Gibson? \nDADE Did you talk to him? \nPHREAK Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. (imitating her) He isn't to consort with his computer friends. (himself again) The secret service is really out to get him. (changes the subject) Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go? \nDade shakes his head. \nPHREAK It's at Kate's... \nDade just smiles. \nPHREAK Thought so! \nCereal and Phreak leave, Cereal dancing. \nINT. PLAGUE'S OFFICE. \nPlague is wearing a VR helmet and gloves, playing some sort of action game. He is unaware that Gill has just entered the room. \nGILL What the hell are you doing? Plague! \nHe thumps the VR pedestal. \nPHREAK (smiling) Uh-huh! \nKATE (her tone changing) Yeah, it is... (she comes over to it) I wanna triple the RAM... \nCURTIS Oooh, Leopard Boy... AND the Decepticons. Uh, Kate, Kate, you're not going into that computer shit now, right? \nKate barely acknowledges him. \nCURTIS (cynically) Humm, yeah. \nCurtis leaves. \nCEREAL (mockingly) Right. \nDADE The sensitive type. \nKate finally notices that Dade, whom she didn't invite, is at her party and in her bedroom. \nKATE What is he doing in here? \nPHREAK Relax, Burn, he's my guest. \nDADE Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV! \nKATE What? \nDADE I'm Crash Override. \nKATE You're the moron that's been invading my turf? \nCEREAL Whoa, whowhowhowhoa. (motioning to Dade) Crash... (motioning to Kate) and Burn! \nCereal breaks into hysterics. \nINT. PLAGUE'S LOFT. \nPlague is hacking. \nMARGO Murphy kid turn you down? \nPLAGUE (in a hammy southern accent) I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC. \nMARGO Pervert! What are you talking about? \nShe turns her back to him. He does up the zipper on her dress. Their relationship becomes apparent. \nPLAGUE The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it. \nMARGO Congratulations. \nPLAGUE From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm. \nMARGO So? \nPLAGUE So, we get the mother, we get the boy. \nINT. KATE'S ROOM. \nKate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own, some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back in. \nKate rifles through her address book. \nCEREAL The duel will last until we declare a winner. \nDade plays quick-draw with disks. \nPHREAK Use only the dialups, access codes and passwords in your collection. Can't ask for any help from us. \nDade, having mastered the quick-disk-draw in the mirror, looks satisfied. \nDADE (into mirror) Talking to me? \nAll five are together at the beginning of the challenge. \nPHREAK Any questions? \nKATE Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin? \nDade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE. \nAt a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out. \"Destroy Card\" is the final instruction. The other hackers look on. \nINT. RESTAURANT. \nA waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine, sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's horror. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE. \nDade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and changes an ad. \nKATE Alright, he's in the personal ads. (reading Dade's ad) \"Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace, and water sports. Transvestites welcome.\" \nINT. GILL'S OFFICE. \nAt his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone responding to the ad. \nGILL I... I... I know where you can stick it... I know where you can stick it... \nGill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes on. \nCALLER ...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I wanna lick your ankles... \nGILL Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this. \nGill punches another button, another caller comes on. \nCALLER That's why they call me Stallion... \nGILL Aw, that's disgusting! \nGill punches another button. \nCALLER My heart is steaming for you... \nGill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered. \nCALLER ...spank you with my... \nDADE Deal. \nKate gives Dade a look that says \"I'm going to hold you to that.\" \nINT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT. \nA shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body belongs to Dade Murphy. \nKate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed that dream. \nKATE Oooohhhh... \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY. \nKate, at her locker, stops Dade. \nKATE Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed. \nShe opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and bikini bottom. \nKATE You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you? \nDade walks off. \nINT. DADE'S PLACE. \nDade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He takes the package. \nDADE Thanks. \nHe closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks. \nPLAGUE You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well let me explain the New World Order. Governments and corporations need people like you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard cowboys. And all those other people out there who have no idea what's going on are the cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh, think about it. Enjoy the laptop, \"Cool\"! Tell me where the disk is. \nPlague's face vanishes. \nINT. JOEY'S ROOM. \nJoey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking despondent. His mother enters. \nJOEY'S MOM You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not grounded anymore. \nShe kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it in the air vent. \nEXT. PARK. \nJoey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives. Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out. \nPHREAK Yo, what's up? \nJOEY Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from... \nPHREAK Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on. \nJOEY Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know. \nPHREAK Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man. \nJOEY I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me? \nPHREAK Thank you. \nKate answers. \nKATE Hello? \nPHREAK Hey, it's me. \nKATE Phreak? \nPHREAK I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys. \nKATE You think they're going to bust us? \nPHREAK Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time? \nHe hangs up just as the cop returns. \nINT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM. \nKate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire. \nINT. DADE'S PLACE. \nKate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in. \nMRS. MURPHY Hi! (looking Kate over) Well, now I see what all the fuss is about. (she shows them to Dade's room) Dade... you have company. \nCEREAL It's a nice room. \nKATE We need your help. \nDADE Do my ears deceive me? \nKate starts to leave. \nCEREAL Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. (pause) What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on. \nKATE Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc. \nDADE I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry. \nCEREAL Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something. \nCereal leaves the room. \nKATE What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help. \nDADE I'm sorry, I can't. \nKATE Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that? \nA knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in. \nMRS. MURPHY Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has. \nShe leaves. \nKATE (to Mrs. Murphy) Thank you. \nDade takes Nikon's place. \nCEREAL Tag, you're in. \nHours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement. \nDADE This isn't a virus. It's a worm! \nNIKON What's this one eat? \nDADE It nibbles. You see this? \nDade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display. \nDADE This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas. \nKATE The worm eats a few cents from each transaction. \nDADE And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around. \nKATE Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks. \nDADE Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started. \nKATE Right, and at this rate it ends its run in... \nNIKON Two days. \nDADE And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... \nCEREAL 21.8 million bucks, man. \nNikon whistles. \nKATE Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it. \nDADE I know, I know who wrote it. \nKATE What? \nDADE This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me. \nKATE You what? \nDADE I didn't know what was on it. \nCEREAL (agitated) Oh man. That's universally stupid, man! \nNIKON Yo, man, you an amateur, man. \nKATE Why did he come to you? \nDADE I got a record. I was Zero Cool. \nNIKON Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven systems in one day? \nNikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory. \nNIKON Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit! \nCEREAL AND NIKON (in unison, pointing down the street) TRUCK!!! \nThe phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and Nikon take off. \nINT. SECRET SERVICE BULDING. \nA woman is seated at the desk.  Agent Gill walks by. \nWOMAN Find it? \nCereal emerges from the desk, between her legs. His tool belt dangles obscenely from his crotch. \nCEREAL Phone's alright. The problem must be somewhere else. \nCereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing. \nINT. ELLINGSON MINERAL OFFICES. \nNikon poses as a flower delivery boy. He winds his way through the offices of Ellingson Mineral, \"shoulder surfing\", watching the workers entering passwords. His photographic memory captures everything.  The Plague walks past him, noticing briefly but not making the connection. \nINT. PLAGUE'S LOFT. \nThe Da Vinci virus' launch/cancel prompt is up. \nMARGO (pacing) They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know? \nPLAGUE Not everything. But enough to implicate us. \nMARGO You said the worm was untreaceable! \nPLAGUE Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away. \nMARGO Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that! \nPLAGUE No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money. \nMargo starts to protest. \nPLAGUE Look, there is no right and wrong.  There is only fun and boring. A thirty year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me.  Who do you prefer serves it, us? Or them? \nPlague clicks on \"Launch\". The virus repeats its demand. \nVIRUS Unless five million dollars are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet. \nEXT. OPEN SEA. \nAs the virus speaks, a supertanker sails on a choppy sea. \nINT. PLAGUE'S LOFT. \nPlague leaves a message on Gill's answering machine. \nPLAGUE (sternly) The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30, and those hackers tried to get into our system again. At this point I insist you take more strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible. \nGill gets on the phone. \nGILL (grimly) Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override, also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. \nAs Gill gives the order, a mysterious device under his desk blinks. Cereal put it there. \nDade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead. \nFinally the crowd lets him go.  He catches up with Kate. \nKATE I lost 'em. Where were you? \nDade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words. \nThey make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's lair. Video monitors are everywhere. \nDADE I don't like this. \nA robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at Dade. \nDADE AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this! \nBLADE (through video intercom) What do you want? \nDADE Ummm... we come in peace? \nDade winces at his own corniness. \nKATE We need your help.  If you're up to it. \nRAZOR She's buff. Ballsy. \nBLADE Let's keep her. \nRAZOR Waste the dude. \nThe gun goes off. It's only a cigarette lighter! No one can accuse Razor and Blade of not having a sense of humor. \nINT. RAZOR AND BLADE'S PLACE. \nKATE A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow. \nDADE It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money. \nKATE We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program. \nRAZOR She's rabid, but cute. \nBLADE See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. \nDADE (noticing the stench of sellout) Let's go, Kate. \nRAZOR Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us. You need an army. \nBLADE That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal. \nRAZOR Hackers of the World, Unite! \nBLADE How are you going to take care of the cops? \nDade just smiles. \nINT. DADE'S ROOM. \nDade hacks into the city traffic light control system. Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York City. \nThe SS and SWAT push through crowds. \nDADE It's root slash period workspace slash period garbage period. \nThe SS are nearly there. \nJoey has found the file. \nThe SS arrive.  Gill himself has his .357 drawn. \nGILL Freeze! \nIt's an empty bank of payphones, the receivers are linked together and taped up. No hackers. They keep going. \nGILL (pissed off but determined) Ahhh Come on! \nJoey completes the download. \nKATE (to Razor and Blade) Kill the Gibson. \nRAZOR Roger that. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL. \nPLAGUE Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you got, huh? Come on, let's see what else you can do! You talking to me? Huh? Hahahaha. Are you nuts? Come at me! \nMargo and Duke are awed by Plague's imminent failure and total unprofessionalism. \nHAL They're in the kernal. \nDA VINCI VIRUS Help... me... \nThe Da Vinci virus dies. The tankers stop capsizing and right themselves. \nWOMAN (off screen) The tankers have stopped capsizing. \nSOMEONE ELSE (off screen) Ballast tanks are emptying. It'll be okay. \nThe main screen lights up: \nARF ARF! WE GOTCHA! \nMESS WITH THE BEST DIE LIKE THE REST \nPLAGUE Little pissant! \nThe Gibson dies in a flash of light. \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES. \nThe hackers cheer and congratulate each other. \nNIKON Yes! \nDADE We did it! \nKATE Let's get out of here! \nGILL FREEZE! \nGILL (grimly) Your son is in big trouble. He has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity. \nMRS. MURPHY My son happens to be a genius. He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul. \nAgent Bob enters. \nAGENT BOB The news crew you requested is here. \nMRS. MURPHY Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell them. \nGILL Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that. \nMRS. MURPHY Mister, I don't care if I face certain death. \nGILL Mrs. Murphy stays right here. \nKATE Oh, wow, she's great. \nDADE Yeah. \nINT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICES. \nThe news crew interviews Gill. \nREPORTER ...and attacked the Ellingson's computer network. Is the last we've seen of this type of high-tech espionage? \nGILL Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop... \nNikon and Joey are led in. \nThe monitors cut into static, then Cereal appears. \nSOMEONE That kid cut him off! \nCEREAL Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal Killer, making my first coast to coast, world wide, global television appearance. Yes, that's right, I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral. \nRazor and Blade busily work on keeping him on the air. \nCEREAL But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right. What could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program? \nCereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in Times Square. \nCEREAL But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. The password for this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head of public relations at Ellingson Mineral... \nINT. PLAGUE'S LOFT. \nMargo watches this and sits bolt upright in bed. \nMARGO Oh my God! \nCEREAL (continuing) ...and Eugene Belford, Computer Security Officer. \nINT. SECRET SERVICE OFFICE \nGILL (finally understanding what's been going on all along) Son of a BITCH! \nCEREAL (continuing) What's this? Is this the unnamed account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I think so! \nAn account number scrolls below Cereal's chin. \n", "test1_input": "CURTIS Is this kid bothering you, Kate? \nDADE Sorry, can I get some room here? \nCURTIS Yeah. (to Kate) Why don't you come up here? \nKate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing. He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his high score is about to come up. \nCURTIS He's good! \nDade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak is amazed. \nDADE (to Kate) Well, it looks like I'm on top. \nKate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows. \nPHREAK Congratulations. No one's ever beat her before. You just made an enemy for life. (to someone else) Boy meets world. Let's go? \nEXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT. \nKate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a little disgusted. \nDADE Who's that? \nPHREAK Curtis. \nDADE And what's he do? \nPHREAK That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day. \nKate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle. Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle speeds off into the night. \nINT. DADE'S ROOM. \nThe clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade, it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of the school sprinkler system for 9:30am. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR. \nDade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely. Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade. \nPHREAK What's up? \nDade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He realizes what is happening. \nPHREAK (amused and highly impressed) Oh my God. You... \nA bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his face. \nPHREAK Way cool! (to Dade) You saw that? \nDade nods in the affirmative. \nKate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has happened. \nKATE What the hell is going on? \nDADE Pool on the roof must have a leak. \nKate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away. \n", "test1_true": "PHREAK Man, oh man, this is gonna be good. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. \nDade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on the chalkboard. Kate finishes first. \nKATE If God gave men brains bigger than dogs', they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail parties. \nThe class giggles. \nKATE Ruth Libby. \nTEACHER I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a significant author of the twentieth century. \nKATE Her last book sold two million copies. \nCLASS (almost in unison) Woooooo! \nThe teacher reads Dade's quotation. \nTEACHER \"Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night.\" \nDADE That's Ginsburg. \nTEACHER Nice. Very nice. \nKATE He's not in this class. \nDADE I said give me time. \nKATE He's not enrolled in this class. \nTEACHER Well, he's on my list. \nKate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher moves on to Cereal. \nTEACHER \"Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most?\" \nCEREAL Ozzy Osbourne! \nTEACHER You. What is your name? \nThe teacher grabs the list back from Kate. \nCEREAL Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir? \nTEACHER You, however, are not on my list. \nCEREAL (in mock shock) Whoa, this isn't wood shop class? \nThe class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the teacher escorts Cereal to the door. \nINT. DADE'S PLACE. \nMRS. MURPHY How was school? \nDADE (eating) Hmmm. \nMRS. MURPHY What did we learn in school today? \n", "test2_input": "Plague is holding Dade's baseball bat. He shrugs, turns around, and smashes Dade's stereo to smithereens. \nDADE Shit! Come on! \nPLAGUE Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love. \nPlague replaces the baseball bat. \nPLAGUE I'll be in touch. \nPlague leaves. \nPLAGUE (to agents) I'm fine. (to Dade) Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay? \nDADE Blow me. \nPLAGUE (smiles) Thank you! \nINT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER. \nDade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind. Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room, handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as Plague looks on smugly. \nThen Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep. \nINT. KATE'S PLACE. \nThe party. A large, well-furnished apartment in an elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town. Teenagers dance and writhe to loud, bassy music. Dade and Phreak arrive. \nPHREAK Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women. Stuff like \"Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae\" \nPhreak shows Dade the book. \nDADE That explains a lot. \nKate, the lovely and gracious hostess, mingles and greets her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay. \nPHREAK (loudly) Yo, what's up Nikon! \nNIKON Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it. (to Cereal) Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock, check it... don't look right away, what's wrong with you! Look at her man... \nNikon and Cereal are checking out a truly fine babe. \nNIKON (concentrating) Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM! \nDADE How did you know that? \nNIKON I got photographic memory. (Smiling) It's a curse! (Into the crowd) Lisa! \nLISA Hey, how do you know my name? \nCereal and Phreak move through the crowd. Cereal notices something. \nCEREAL Oooo, look at that pooper man.

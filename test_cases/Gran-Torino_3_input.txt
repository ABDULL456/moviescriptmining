INT. TAO'S KITCHEN - A MINUTE LATER 
Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink. 
WALT For the love of Pete. 
TAO What? 
WALT It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off. Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head. 
INT. WALT'S GARAGE 
The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the workbench. Walt reinstalls the diverter valve. Tao looks at all of Walt's tools. 
TAO Man, where did you get all this stuff? 
WALT What are you talking about? 
TAO All the tools and stuff. 
WALT Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad? This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned. 
TAO Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant. There's just so much shit packed in here. 
WALT You need the right tool for the right job. Every single thing here has a purpose.

TAO Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool. 
WALT Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression. 
WALT Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile spacers. Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up -- 
WALT What? 
TAO I can't afford to buy all this stuff. 
WALT I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead. I've lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools. 
TAO Yeah, but... 
WALT Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this. You don't need everything to maintain a house. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE items in quick succession. 
WALT This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something.

TAO Okay. Cool. Walt coughs and covers his mouth. Both Tao and Walt see the spot of BLOOD in his hand. 
TAO What's with that? 
WALT What's with what? 
TAO The blood you just coughed up. That's not good, you should see a doctor. Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub. 
WALT So... what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night? Who are they? 
TAO A gang. Hmong gangbangers. 
WALT I gathered that. What did they want with you? 
TAO They wanted to take me away because I blew my first initiation. 
WALT You joined up with those pukes? Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the hell did you do that? 
TAO I don't know. They were persuasive. My cousin's in the gang. They just talked me into it I guess. 
WALT Well, at least you're honest about it. A LONG SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.

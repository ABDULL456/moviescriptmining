An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa! 
Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick. 
ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this mess is the way we got into it. 
ARTOO beeps a reply. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one? 
ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station. 
INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE 
The SQUADRON attacks the space station. 
RIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge. BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader. 
The attack is fruitless. 
RIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through it. 
Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks. 
ANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing! 
The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin. ARTOO screams. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit! 
ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo! 
ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa! 
ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started! 
ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red. 
ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically. 
INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY 
The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs to catch up.

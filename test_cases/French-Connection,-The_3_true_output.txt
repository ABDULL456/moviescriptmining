SAL (V.O.) I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open. 
ANGIE (V.O.) Sal -- 
SAL (V.O.) Yeah? 
ANGIE (V.O.) Don't forget anchovies. (she hangs up) 
SAL (V.O.) This broad's crazy! 
EXT. WARD'S ISLAND (UNDER WEST ABUTMENT OF THE HELLGATE BRIDGE) 
Pick up CHARNIER, MARIE and MAURICE LAVALLE 
As the camera plays over the bridge: (in French) 
CHARNIER (V.O.) It's beautiful. 
LA VALLE (V.O.) It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world. 
CHARNIER Who financed it? 
LA VALLE Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City. 
MARIE Why is it called Hellgate? 
LA VALLE The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here. 
CHARNIER If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list. 
LA VALLE Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it. 
CHARNIER Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful. 
LA VALLE Mmm. 
MARIE Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman. 
CHARNIER Not any woman, Marie.  Just one. 
EXT. OLD ROAD IN WARD'S ISLAND 
CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE walking. 
(NEAR GARAGE) 
LA VALLE I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France. 
(NEAR CREMATORIUM) 
MARIE What is that old building? 
LA VALLE Oh, it's been abandoned for years. 
MARIE What was it? 
LA VALLE It was a crematorium. 
MARIE For garbage? 
LA VALLE For dead bodies.

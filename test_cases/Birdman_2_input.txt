Riggan keeps walking up to... 
13   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          13 ...the hallway. Jake chases him. 
RIGGAN I want him gone. 
JAKE No. 
RIGGAN What? 
JAKE We can't do that. 
RIGGAN What are you-- Of course we can do that. It's our show. 
(CONTINUED) 
JAKE Riggan, listen to me-- 
Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake. 
RIGGAN No. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out of my play. Did you see him out there? 
JAKE It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about previews. Nothing matters until that old bat from the New York Times is sitting in that audience on opening night. 
RIGGAN We're getting rid of him. I'm not going to stand up on that stage and-- 
JAKE Shut up! Just shut up for once and listen to me. As soon as we announced he was taking over, the advance doubled. We can't afford to lose a preview. We can't afford to lose money. We can't afford to lose Mike. This is about being respected, validated, remember? That's what you told me. That's how you got me into this shit. Now, you're the director. Get him under control. (A beat. As a friend.) These are not the nineties anymore. 
Jake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall. 
RIGGAN (Startled.) Holy Fuck! 
Mike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. After a painful silence... 
MIKE (Like he's possessed.) You were good... 
RIGGAN Meet me in front of the theater in 10 minutes. 
Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking again. We follow him into... 
14   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             14 
...his dressing room. He goes into the bathroom and quickly washes his face. 
SYLVIA (O.S.) What the hell was going on up there? 
We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful. 
RIGGAN I didn't know you were here tonight. SYLVIA That guy's an asshole, huh? 
Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the bathroom. 
RIGGAN What are you doing here? SYLVIA Sam and I are going to grab a bite after she's finished with-- 
RIGGAN No, I mean here. Now. 
SYLVIA Well. I know how much this means to you, so-- 
RIGGAN I appreciate that. 
A beat. 
SYLVIA So, how's it going? 
RIGGAN The play? 
SYLVIA No, you and Sam. 
RIGGAN It's good. (A beat.) It's the same. 
SYLVIA Do you talk to her? 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN We talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy around here.

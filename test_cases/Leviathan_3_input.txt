FACE IN ON 
THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN 
sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER 
Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life... 
A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before. 
WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER 
Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES... 
JONES Burritos...Enchiladas... 
DEJESUS (hispanic voice) Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?... 
BOWMAN (female) I can't wait for fresh vegetables... 
Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?" "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the others. 
BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, cut the chatter.  You're not out of here, yet.  Who's the hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on container 22? 
A pause, then more voices. 
SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO (redneck drawl) The man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit. 
JONES' VOICE/ RADIO Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello, Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook, over. 
A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE SHACK.  Then a woman's voice. 
WILLIE'S VOICE (woman's voice) Six to Shack.  I'm the hook. 
INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM 
littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good- looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened. From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way. 
BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day. 
Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is moving. 
UNDERWATER 
WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. 
She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio. 
SIXPACK'S VOICE Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something?  We're all waiting on you, honey. 
WILLIE (under control) Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you'll be inside before "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on. 
OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta girl," etc... 
Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in by a winch. 
WILLIE'S VOICE Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready to winch.

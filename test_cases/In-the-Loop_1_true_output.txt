LINTON Karen must not find out about that. She is an excitable yapping she-dog. Okay get the minutes of the meeting, we need to correct the record. 
BOB ADRIANO We can do that?

LINTON Yes we can. They're an aide memoir for us. So they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said, but a more full record of what was intended to be said. I think that's the more accurate version, right? 
LATER. Bob Adriano is going through the minutes with Linton. 
LINTON (CONT'D) I don't like this section. Cut that. I don't think this is really what France are saying. Let's change that. And these. And let's reverse this. 
BOB ADRIANO That's something Karen said. LINTON It's not right. Change it. 
BOB ADRIANO Yes sir. 
LINTON And I like this. 
BOB ADRIANO Thank you. 
LINTON Let's say everyone agreed with this. BOB ADRIANO Excellent. 
33   INT. SIMON'S OFFICE/BOX ROOM - DAY                         33 
Judy's in her office on the phone, laughing. Simon's eyeing her suspiciously. 
SIMON What's she so fucking happy about? Is she laughing at me? 
Judy closes the blinds on her side of the office. 
SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd) Why's she got control of the blinds? I'm a government minister. I should have blinds.

TOBY (joking) You want me to order some blinds? Or I could get some heavy curtains with swags and a pelmet. 
SIMON Yes. I do. 
TOBY Oh. Okay ... 
SIMON Can we go somewhere else? 
They walk to Box Room. 
SIMON (CONT'D) So listen. My team for the US. Team Simon. I'm thinking of taking you and leaving Judy? 
TOBY I could work with that, definitely. Plus she can be a bit... you know? "Everything's a bit shit isn't it?" 
SIMON "So you're the President? And I'm supposed to be impressed by that? 
TOBY Yeah. "My husband works in Tower Hamlets." SIMON "That's much harder than being President". Okay. It's settled. Fuck it. She's staying behind. Go and tell her. 
INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. KAREN'S OFFICE - DAY Karen, Liza and Linton are among those seated round the table. Various staffers are standing, including Chad. And Bob Adriano.

KAREN (putting her hand over her mouth, mocking Linton's gesture from earlier) Or everything you're prepared to discuss. 
LINTON What is that, Karen 
KAREN I understand you've started up a new committee, what's it called? 
LINTON What makes you think that? 
KAREN It was mentioned in our London meeting. 
LINTON You must have misheard. 
KAREN I misheard the word committee? 
LINTON Maybe it was another word. Like Khomeini. 
KAREN You're sitting on a new Khomeini? 
LINTON Possibly. There are a lot of words, Karen. Kansas City. Kitty. BOB ARIANO Itty. 
LINTON Itty is not a word, Bob. 
CHAD Commissary?

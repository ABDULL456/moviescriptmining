MARILYN In fact, I'd like another piece of pie, right after this. Do I dare ? I like yours better than this. 
TED Are you gonna start a restaurant ? Are you serious about that ? 
MARILYN You really should. you're a great cook. 
TED Because, if you do, count me in. I wanna be part of that. Really. 
LARRY Really ? 
MARILYN You should. 
CAROL No. Well, I don't know. I mean, you... Are you serious ? 
TED Yeah. Oh, oh, God, it'd be wonderful. 
LARRY What are you encouraging her for ? It's so... 
TED She's great. She's a great cook. 
LARRY I know, but... 
CAROL Well, it's thanks to you, actually. I mean, it was his idea. The cooking lessons, so I mean... 
TED Yes, I had... 
SY Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business. I mean, you just can't take that lightly. You can't be cavalier about a restaurant. 
CAROL I'm not being cavalier about it. 
LARRY Do you know how time-consuming it is ? Yeah. You have to be there every night. 
SY Absolutely. 
LARRY You'd be stuck there, you know. 
TED Wait. Look, look. 
LARRY They steal from, if you're not... You gotta be hap... 
CAROL But it's bi... it's what I do. It's-It's what I do, Larry. 
TED She'll cook... She's great. She's-She's a pro. She's a pro. She'll be cooking... She'll be cooking in the kitchen. I'll be at the front, running the joint like Rick, you know, in «Casablanca». 
SY It's not that easy. 
MARILYN You do it anyway. Right as well get paid for it. 
LARRY Right. Directs... 
TED I'm set, I'm serious about it. I don't... I mean, it's not like a hobby. I mean, it's gotta be a serious thing. 
SY I'll be the first customer. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Medium shot of Carol coming out of the bathroom. She switches the bathroom light off. She is wearing a pink night dress. 
The camera turns toward Larry's bed, in which Larry is already lying. He has a book in his hands. 
LARRY You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin. You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an argument over penis envy, or something. 
CAROL Oh. 
LARRY The poor guy suffers from it so... 
Carol puts something on the night-table on her side of the bed. 
CAROL Did he seem a little too cheerful ? 
She looks at some pills bottles on the night table. 
LARRY No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh, when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy lit up like Mr. Glowworm. 
CAROL The restaurant ? 
She picks up a hair brush. 
LARRY Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands. Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room. The camera follows her. 
CAROL No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House. Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ? 
LARRY (voice over) Mr. House, our next-door widower ? 
Carol stops in front of a large mirror set on the wall in one corner of the room. 
CAROL Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't you think ? 
LARRY (voice over) Well, Jesus. What do you want the guy to do, walk down the street sobbing hysterically ? Carol starts brushing her hair. 
CAROL Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and, and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I... You know... 
LARRY (voice over) Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay ? I don't like those remarks. And, meanwhile, I'm the guy who needs a physical check-up. 
CAROL Oh, I don't know. 
LARRY (voice over) Uh, uh. 
Carol walks to a chest of drawers, on top of which she drops the hairbrush. Then she switches the lights off in the other section of the bedroom, and walks back to the bed. 
CAROL I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ? Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, «Have a nice time, you know, at the opera». And, my God, «We're certainly dressed up». I mean, you know. This guy should be a wreck. 
She sits down on her side of the bed, and takes her socks off. While talking, Larry puts the book and his glasses on the night- table. Carol switches the light off on her night table and gets into the bed. 
LARRY Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw. 
He switches the lights off on his bed table. The room is completely dark, and we hear the next sentences on a black screen. 
CAROL Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted. 
LARRY Yeah ? 
CAROL She's too mousey. 
LARRY Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their little rodent time. They can eat cheese together. 
Carol bursts out laughing. The phone starts ringing. LARRY Oh, Christ. 
He switches the light back on, puts his glasses on his nose and picks up the phone. 
LARRY Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning watching the porn channel. I'll put her on. 
He gives the phone receiver to Carol. 
CAROL Who is it ? 
LARRY Ted. For you. 
CAROL Ted, hi. 
RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot of Ted, dressed in a night-gown, and standing near the counter of a restaurant. The room is very dark, only lit by a lamp on the counter. 
TED I figured out how he killed her and made it look like a coronary. He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic levels. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Carols bursts out laughing. CAROL No, no. You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too perky. You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago. 
Larry is trying to get the telephone cord, stretched from his night-table to the handset hold by Carol, away from his face. 
LARRY Jesus, are you onto that ? My God, I thought you were just joking.

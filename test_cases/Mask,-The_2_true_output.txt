CUT TO: 
EXT. PENINSULA PARK 
The Mask is all over Tina like a cheap suit, stroking her hair grabbing her bod. She's definitely having second thoughts about him as he backs her up to the bench. 
THE MASK Our love is like a red red rose, and I'm feeling so thorny already, I'd like to nip you in the bud! 
She ducks his grab, but he recovers smoothly, flipping out a pack of cigarettes. He pops one in her mouth. 
THE MASK (CONT.) Cigarette? 
His hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in her mouth. 
THE MASK (CONT.) Regular? Menthol? Filter? Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo? 
He produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on the flame. 
THE MASK (CONT.) Let me get that for you! 
He grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch. With one mighty SSSUCK he smokes them all down to gray ash. 
Beat. 
The ash tumbles away. 
THE MASK (CONT.) (exhales a huge cloud of smoke) Aaaaaah. And now... amore! 
He throws his arms wide and lunges at Tina. 
KELLAWAY Freeze! 
The Mask freezes in mid-air, arms outstretched and feet suspended off the ground. 
KELLAWAY (CONT.) Put your hands up! 
The Mask's lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the side of his mouth. 
THE MASK But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze! 
KELLAWAY Alright, alright. Unfreeze! You're under arrest! 
The Mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain. 
THE MASK Under arrest! My god! The Law! I knew I'd forgotten something! (TEARS) I was so young! So foolish! So full of life! 
Tears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps. He puts his hands out and Kellaway slaps on the cuffs. 
THE MASK (CONT.) What... What'll they do with me, Sarge? 
KELLAWAY Sorry, son. That's not my department. Search him! 
Doyle reaches into the Mask's zoot suit and starts tossing stuff on the ground. 
DOYLE Comb - Flintstones vitamins - Sousaphone - Bazooka - (PAUSE) picture of Kellaway's wife... 
Kellaway looks down at the photo. It really IS a picture of his wife with a handwritten note: "Call me, lover - 555-1234!" 
KELLAWAY What the --? (PAUSE) Margaret! 
Furious, Kellaway LUNGES at Stanley/Mask's neck. Two other officers restrain him. 
KELLAWAY You son of a bitch -- ! 
STANLEY/MASK Jeez, I figured you had a sense of humor! (PAUSE) After all, you married her! 
Stanley/Mask honks Kellaway's nose which makes a loud AHOOGA noise and runs for it. 
Kellaway starts to follow, but discovers he's now handcuffed to Doyle. 
KELLAWAY Get him! 
The other police officers draw their guns and give chase as Stanley RICOCHETS off through the trees hooting laughter. 
EXT. PARK ENTRANCE 
A twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park. Stanley/Mask races through the entryway, SLAMMING the park's huge wooden gates behind him. 
CLOSER - THE GATE 
The Mask throws an iron bolt, SNAPS on a huge padlock, SLAMS down a steel plate ZZZIPS up a gigantic zipper, HAMMERS in dozens of nails at high speed and throws himself against the gate panting... 
But then his eyes BUG OUT on stalks as he sees what lies on the opposite side of the gate. 
STANLEY'S P.O.V. 
COPS... more COPS than seems humanly possible. They're in cars, armed antipersonnel carriers, hanging from trees, parachuting FROM helicopters... 
And they're all aiming serious looking guns at HIM. 
BULLHORN VOICE It's all over! Put your hands over your head or we'll open fire.

They've got me running all over town picking up these disclosure -- \nThat's when the pile in her arms slides south.

CHARLES HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nDerek and Beth sit at a table on the outside deck that overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below. In the distance, the LA basin sparkles like a diamond in the night. \nDerek and Beth are happy but exhausted. In front of them is an empty pizza box. Derek picks up a bottle of champagne and pours some for Beth and himself. They're both a little drunk. \nBETH Well, we toasted the house -- \nDEREK Toasted Kyle -- \nBETH Your promotion -- \nDEREK But I've saved the most important toast for last...

OFFICE - MORNING \nDerek arrives to find Lisa sitting at his outer desk in Patrick's place. She looks up and smiles. She's not wearing her glasses and her hair is down giving her a softer, less severe look. \nLISA Hi.   Remember me? \nDEREK Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.     Where's Patrick? \nLISA Out with the flu. I did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk. I hope that's okay. D EREK Uh... sure. \nLooking over at the assistant outside the other corner office. \nDEREK (cont'd) Hey Marge. \nMARGE Good morning, Derek. \nBack to the temp. \nDEREK Grab your pad and follow me. \nDerek goes into his office.

It says \"for employees only.\" \nDEREK It's like that in most companies. They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about. \nLISA So, does this party get pretty wild? \nDEREK Just the opposite. \nLISA Well that's no fun. \nDerek notices a container of Starbucks coffee. \nLISA (cont'd) I called Patrick. He said you like it black with two sugars. \nDerek is impressed.    He opens the container. \nLISA (cont'd) If it's cold, I can run down and nuke it in the Break Room. \nDEREK (takes a sip) No, it's perfect. \nLisa is pleased.    She raises her pad and pencil. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLISA Fire away. \nDEREK Well, it's Monday and first thing on Monday... \nLISA I took care of that. \nDEREK Took care of what? \nLISA On Mondays you always send your wife a dozen long-stemmed red roses. (off Derek's look of surprise) I called to confirm they've been delivered. \nDEREK Thanks. \nLISA I think that's incredibly sweet.   How long have you two been married? \nDEREK Three years in March. \nLISA And you still send her flowers every Monday morning? Lucky girl. \nDEREK It's kind of a tradition. \nLISA Patrick said you started sending them back when Beth worked here as your assistant. Is that how you won her heart? \nDEREK Well, it took a little more than roses. (getting down to business) We need to run some calls. \nLISA (POISED) Ready when you are. \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nCONTINUED: (3) \nDEREK AMUSED) Are you always this efficient? \nLISA Does that surprise you? \nDEREK Well, it's just that most of the temps we get here... \nLISA I think you'll find I'm not your typical temp. \nDEREK No.   Definitely not. (THEN) Okay not your typical temp... start with Phil Trendle at Emerson... set up a lunch for end of the week. Wherever he wants but push the Water Grill. Then Terry Mills at Imagio.

She glances over and sees Derek. \nHe's off to the side with Ben, sipping drinks. \nesks and furniture are shoved back and workers are free- style dancing, crowding into the center of the room. \narge grabs Derek by the arm and pulls him out. Derek makes some half-hearted dance moves, then gets into the spirit. It's crowded, people are close together and a moment later, Derek finds himself dancing face to face with Lisa. L ISA (with humor) Well, if it isn't the Office Asshole. \nDEREK That's Mister Office Asshole to you. \nLISA I'm impressed.      You can dance. \nDEREK All those years watching Soul Train. \nLISA (LAUGHS) I wasn't sure I was going to come tonight. \nDEREK Why not? \nLISA Well, it's not like I've been here that long. \nDEREK I'm sure everybody's glad you decided to show up. \nLISA Even you? \nDEREK What do you mean \"even me?\" I'm your number one supporter around here. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nD \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThis makes her smile happily. \nLISA (looking up) Uh oh. \nDerek looks up, too.       They're under the mistletoe. \nEREK How did that get there? \nThey look at each other, smile.       An awkward moment.    Derek laughs it off. \nLISA (PLAYFUL) Maybe a quick one on the cheek? If we don't, people will really suspect there's something going on. \nBut Derek steps away. \nDEREK Guess we'll just have to take that chance. \n", "test3_true": "The music changes, breaking the mood.

Sally Sloane did a table dance. H e indicates a pretty secretary LAUGHING and accepting another drink. \nBEN (cont'd) I give her one more drink, then stand back.   How about you, buddy? Need a re- fill? Come on, where's your holiday spirit? \nDEREK With Beth and Kyle.       I'm gonna take a piss and sneak out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBEN You're no fun. \nDerek heads down the hall, a little unsteady. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM \nDerek enters. No one else around. He goes to the urinal and begins to unzip. About 30 seconds later he hears the door open and close but thinks nothing of it because it is a large public Men's restroom in the workplace with 4 urinals and 2 stalls. \nBut suddenly, a hand snakes around his waist and grabs his crotch. Derek whirls around, face to face with a brazen, smiling Lisa who dangles a sprig of Mistletoe in her free hand. Her eyes flash with desire. \nDEREK (ALARMED) What are you doing? \nLisa tries to kiss him. Derek resists. He staggers away from the urinal with Lisa still holding him. \nDEREK (cont'd) Lisa -- \nThey knock open a stall door and fall in. Derek goes back against the toilet and Lisa is now practically straddling him.                 D EREK (cont'd) Lisa, stop -- \nLISA Why? \nDEREK Are you out of your -- \nThat's when someone comes in. Derek kicks the stall door shut with his foot just in time. He and Lisa freeze, pressed close together as A DRUNK MALE WORKER staggers to the urinal and unzips. \nLisa hides a GIGGLE.    Derek is horrified they'll be discovered. \nThen... \nThe Drunk begins to piss. Loudly. And then begins to sing Santa Claus is coming to town... even more loud. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nIn the stall, Lisa and Derek are face to face. His hand grabs her wrist as she squeezes his crotch. He tries to remove it but her grip is like a vice. \nDEREK (cont'd) For god's -- \nLISA Oh, come on... \nHearing something, the Drunk hesitates in mid-piss, looks back over his shoulder. \nDRUNK (BLEARY) Hey, who's there? \nDerek is trapped. Lisa gives him a naughty smile. She's in control and enjoying this, turned on by the thrill of getting caught. \nDRUNK (cont'd) Somebody in there? \nLisa is about to answer.      Derek hushes her. \nWhen there's no reply, the Drunk resumes pissing. \nLisa smears the Mistletoe sprig against Derek's face, then starts to go down on him. He clutches her head with both hands forcing her to stop. She looks up at him, eyes gleaming with passion. D EREK (HISSING) Don't do this... \nThe Drunk continues his piss. Endless. Finally.. finished. He clumsily zips back up, lurches over to the sink. He looks at himself in the mirror, runs his fingers through his hair, smiles at himself and then stumbles out the door. \nThe stall door bangs open as Derek pushes Lisa aside and staggers out, trying to zip up his fly. \nLISA (CONFUSED) Wait. Where are you going? \nDEREK (FLUSTERED) You've got the wrong idea! \n(CONTINUED) \nA \nP \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLisa doesn't seem to understand but she's amused.    Derek is already out the door. \nINT.

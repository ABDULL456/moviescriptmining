HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - EARLY MORNING \nA two-story California Craftsman with a SOLD sign in the front yard. Yukon SUV pulls into the drive and stops. \nThe driver's door opens and DEREK CHARLES steps out, a handsome and likable African-American in his early 30's; a guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business and life. Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he does is cross the lawn to the SOLD sign. \nWith a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the SOLD sign and pulls it out of the ground. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Derek? \nD erek looks over to where his pretty wife BETH is standing beside the SUV, holding their cute 2 year old son KYLE in her arms. Beth shakes her head with amusement. \nBETH What are you going to do with that? CUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER The SOLD sign, now in pieces, burns brightly in the fireplace. The rest of the room is empty except for KYLE who is nearby, asleep in his stroller. Derek and Beth's VOICES drift down from upstairs. \nBETH'S VOICE This is coming down. \nDEREK'S VOICE Why? BETH'S VOICE Do you want people to think we put it up? \nDEREK'S VOICE (soft chuckle) I don't know. I kind of like it. \nBETH'S VOICE Please tell me you're joking. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - SECOND FLOOR \nDerek and Beth stare up at their own reflections in a huge ceiling mirror. The rest of the room is vacant. \nDEREK All I'm saying, before we take it down... maybe we should try it out. (PLAYFUL) You know. Christen the new house. \nBETH And what do you suggest we use for a bed? \nDEREK What do we need a bed for when we've got a fine shag carpet? \nBETH (LAUGHS) Because I'm gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my -- \nDerek puts his arms around her waist and pulls her close. Beth resists -- but only slightly. \nBETH (cont'd) Don't you have to go to work? \nDEREK (nuzzling her neck) Told `em I'd be late. \nBETH What about... \nDEREK Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off. \nBETH Maybe not, but the movers... \nDEREK Won't be here for another hour. \nBeth smiles, giving in. They look up at themselves in the mirror like naughty teenagers. \nBETH Derek, you are so bad. \n(CONTINUED) \nM \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK Isn't THAT why you married me? \nAs they begin to kiss passionately... \nCUT TO: \nCEILING MIRROR - MINUTES LATER \nDistorted images of Derek and Beth in the mirror's reflection, naked bodies intertwined, making love on the carpet. I NT. LIVING ROOM \nKyle continues to snooze in his stroller. Outside the window, a moving van arrives and BLOWS its horn. \nINT. BEDROOM \nBeth, drowsing in Derek's arms.    They stir at the sound of the horn. \nDEREK Want me to stay?     Crack the whip on these guys? \nBETH No. Go to work and earn that promotion. Somebody's got to pay for all this. \nDerek bends down to help.     Their hands touch briefly. \n(CONTINUED) \nP \nL \nT \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDEREK No problem. Happen to anybody. \nThey straighten up, look at each other. \nhe door slides open, revealing the sleek and vast offices of GAGE BENDIX, ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT. \nISA Thanks.   I owe you one. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS Derek through a warren of cubicles where STAFF WORKERS attend phones and computers. He becomes aware that Lisa is right behind him. \nDEREK (with humor) Are you following me? \nLISA No. I'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office. They said it was this way. \nDEREK Derek Charles? \nLISA I guess you probably know him. \nDEREK Oh, yeah, I know him. (lowers his voice) Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that.     L ISA I could get you into trouble? \nDEREK Deep trouble. \nApproaching a desk where Derek's assistant, a mild-looking man in his late 30's named PATRICK looks up and smiles. Across from Patrick is another desk and another assistant, a middle-aged woman named MARGE. \nATRICK Morning, Derek. How's the new house? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nDEREK Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up. \nPATRICK Beth must have loved that. \nDEREK If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell her I'm in a meeting. \nPATRICK Remember who used to sit at this desk? She'll know I am lying. \nDEREK (with a smile) Good point. \nPatrick CHUCKLES as Derek enters his office and vanishes inside. Patrick notices Lisa standing there with her arm load of files. \nPATRICK (to Lisa) Can I help you? \nLisa stares at Derek's office. \nLISA That's Derek Charles? \nPATRICK Yes. \nLisa breaks into a smile; obviously charmed. \nPatrick takes amused notice of Lisa's interest in Derek. \nPATRICK (cont'd) (TEASING) Watch it, girl. He's married. \nLISA The good ones are always married. \nPATRICK (dramatic sigh) Or straight. \nCUT TO: \nG \nG \nINT. MEETING ROOM - LATER \nDerek sits at a long table with his silver-haired boss, JOE GAGE and his best friend and co-worker BEN KINGMAN. One wall of the room is glass, giving a view of the outer office activity.            G AGE (to Derek) Did you talk to our German friend, Herr Ganz? \nDEREK Matter of fact, I just got off the line to Berlin. \nGAGE And? \nDEREK Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest. \nAGE You think he's right? \nINT. CHARLES HOUSE - KYLE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nKyle is asleep in his crib. Derek and Beth look down on him, smiling, then move quietly toward the door. Before they can sneak out, Kyle lets out A CRY. They look at each other. \nDEREK Damn.   Almost made it. \nBETH Your turn. \nerek returns to the crib and picks up Kyle. \nDEREK Hey, little man. What's wrong?    You should be... (feeling him) Uh oh. Poopy diaper. Beth... \nBETH (in the doorway; with a laugh) I've been changing him all day. \nBeth leaves.

CHARLES HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nDerek and Beth sit at a table on the outside deck that overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below. In the distance, the LA basin sparkles like a diamond in the night. \nDerek and Beth are happy but exhausted. In front of them is an empty pizza box. Derek picks up a bottle of champagne and pours some for Beth and himself. They're both a little drunk. \nBETH Well, we toasted the house -- \nDEREK Toasted Kyle -- \nBETH Your promotion -- \nDEREK But I've saved the most important toast for last... (raising his glass) To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in the world. \nBETH And to my handsome husband. I asked for the moon and he gave me the stars. \nhey clink glasses and drink. \nBETH (cont'd) Derek... \nDEREK (YAWNS) Uh huh? \nBETH How would you feel about trying out that mirror again? This time in our own bed. \nDEREK (perks up) Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test drive? \nBETH You know how I like looking at your sexy butt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK (LAUGHS) Beth, you are so bad. \nBETH Isn't that WHY you married ME? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE - MORNING \nDerek arrives to find Lisa sitting at his outer desk in Patrick's place. She looks up and smiles. She's not wearing her glasses and her hair is down giving her a softer, less severe look. \nLISA Hi.   Remember me? \nDEREK Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.     Where's Patrick? \nLISA Out with the flu. I did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk. I hope that's okay. D EREK Uh... sure. \nLooking over at the assistant outside the other corner office. \nDEREK (cont'd) Hey Marge. \nMARGE Good morning, Derek. \nBack to the temp. \nDEREK Grab your pad and follow me. \nDerek goes into his office.       Lisa collects her things and does as told. \nINT. DEREK'S OFFICE \nDerek goes behind the desk as Lisa enters and sits down on the couch. She crosses her legs. Those great legs. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nBETH (cont'd) I've already met a dozen other women with kids the same age. One of them, Lauren something asked if we'd like to come over for a barbecue on Saturday. \nDEREK I don't know. It's shaping up to be a work weekend. \nOutside, at her desk, Lisa eavesdrops on her headset, listening with interest. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nD \nCONTINUED: \nBETH You can work at home and then we'll go to the barbecue. A s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling. Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door. He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in. Instead, she's not at her desk. She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet. She turns and smiles at him. \nLISA Do you need me? \nDerek shakes his head no and steps back into his office. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDerek finishes some work on his home computer.       In the background, Beth sits in bed reading a book. \nBETH Work at the office.     This is home.   Come to bed. \nDEREK In a sec. \nDerek finishes. He rises, walks over to the bed and climbs in beside Beth. She puts her book on the night table and switches off the light. They cuddle together. Beth CHUCKLES. \nBETH The card that came today with the roses... \nEREK Uh huh? \nBETH ... was addressed \"To Betty.\" \nEREK Betty? \nBETH (with humor) Your other wife? Yeah. Who's Betty? \n(CONTINUED) \nB \nB \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK Blame it on the new girl. Patrick called in sick and I had a temp on my desk. B ETH I thought we had a deal. No female assistants. \nDEREK Honey, I don't control the temp pool. \nBETH She pretty? \nDerek gives Beth a look. \nETH (cont'd) Just asking... \nDEREK Yeah, she's pretty... plain. \nBETH (JOKING) I don't care. I want her fired immediately. \nDEREK Actually, she did a great job... aside from the card. \nThey get comfortable.      Beth puts her head on Derek's chest. \nETH Night, Derek. \nDEREK Night... Betty. \nBeth LAUGHS, gives him a playful punch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nTWO DELIVERY GUYS come out of the stairwell, struggling with an undecorated Christmas tree. Marge directs them to a spot to put it. \nINT. DEREK'S OFFICE \nBeth and Kyle are visiting. Derek has Kyle on his desk, letting him play with his keys. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBETH Hope you don't mind us dropping in unannounced. \nDEREK (to Beth) That was intentional. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nBETH Wasn't me. Blame \"Betty.\"    So what's the deal with her? \nDEREK What do you mean? \nBETH She knew I was taking Kyle to Santa. \nDEREK So? \nBETH So she was obviously listening at the door. \nDEREK Well, she probably didn't know when to come in. \nBETH I thought you said she was plain. Derek, that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain. \nDEREK How would I know?    I only have eyes for you.      B ETH (LAUGHS) Oh, you are so slick. \nThey put Kyle in his stroller. \nDEREK Come on. I'll walk you to the elevator. You can say hi to the old gang. (BEAT) Ever miss it? \nBETH I like to think I traded up. \nDerek beams.    They share a kiss. \nEXT. ELEVATOR \nDerek, Beth and Kyle are surrounded by office workers making a fuss over Beth and Kyle. Even Joe Gage comes out of his office to embrace Beth and chat. \n(CONTINUED) \nT \nD \nL \nCONTINUED: \nLisa watches from a distance. Her face betrays no emotion. After a moment, she turns and enters Derek's office. \nisa sits behind the desk in Derek's chair and look at a framed picture on Derek's desk -- Derek, Beth and Kyle, the perfect happy family. \nNearby, Lisa sees a pile of CD's.

Patrick is back at his desk.    D EREK Hey, Patrick. Feeling better? \nPATRICK Much. Thanks. (BEAT) You know it's going to take more than the flu to keep me away from that Christmas party. \nLISA (O.S.) Not sure we can say the same for Marge... \nDerek turns to see Lisa, now sitting at Marge's desk. \nEREK You get around don't you? \nLISA (CONT'D) Poor thing called in with a fever... \nPATRICK Yeah... She's not speaking to me at the moment. \nhe three share a laugh. \n(CONTINUED) \nL \nD \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK Alright.   You two behave yourselves out here... \nerek goes into his office.       We stay with Patrick and Lisa. \nPATRICK (whispers to Lisa) So, how many times did you get busted listening in on Derek's calls? \nDEREK Not with me in charge. \nTouche.   They both smile. \nISA You want one? \nDEREK What? \nLISA A margarita? \nDEREK Oh, I don't know. \nLISA C'mon big talker... it's Christmas time.

The mood is happy and playful and people are getting a little tipsy. \n(CONTINUED) \nM \nD \nCONTINUED: \nA MALE WORKER gives A FEMALE WORKER a back massage with a computer mouse. \nJoe Gage, in a Santa suit, is passing out gag presents. \nLisa is in a group with Patrick and some other women, chatting. She glances over and sees Derek. \nHe's off to the side with Ben, sipping drinks. \nesks and furniture are shoved back and workers are free- style dancing, crowding into the center of the room. \narge grabs Derek by the arm and pulls him out. Derek makes some half-hearted dance moves, then gets into the spirit. It's crowded, people are close together and a moment later, Derek finds himself dancing face to face with Lisa. L ISA (with humor) Well, if it isn't the Office Asshole. \nDEREK That's Mister Office Asshole to you. \nLISA I'm impressed.      You can dance. \nDEREK All those years watching Soul Train. \nLISA (LAUGHS) I wasn't sure I was going to come tonight. \nDEREK Why not? \nLISA Well, it's not like I've been here that long. \nDEREK I'm sure everybody's glad you decided to show up. \nLISA Even you? \nDEREK What do you mean \"even me?\" I'm your number one supporter around here. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nD \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThis makes her smile happily. \nLISA (looking up) Uh oh. \nDerek looks up, too.       They're under the mistletoe. \nEREK How did that get there? \nThey look at each other, smile.       An awkward moment.    Derek laughs it off. \nLISA (PLAYFUL) Maybe a quick one on the cheek? If we don't, people will really suspect there's something going on. \nBut Derek steps away. \nDEREK Guess we'll just have to take that chance. \nDerek suddenly reaches across her and throws open the passenger door. \nDEREK I don't know if you're just dense or what's wrong with you but I want you to understand something. There's nothing going on between us. I would never -- never -- jeopardize my job with a co- worker. \nISA Maybe you are an asshole. Wow. \nDEREK Get out! \nDerek physically forces her out. \nDerek quickly turns the key in the ignition, REVS the engine and peels out in reverse. The passenger door bangs shut. \nLisa stands there in her overcoat staring in mute disappointment as Derek speeds out of the parking garage. C UT TO: \nINT.

They've always seemed to be so much in love, totally devoted to each other. \nDEREK Tim... told her? \nETH Just blurted it out last night when he came home from work. Then he said he was moving out. You know they've got three kids. Poor Rachel's a wreck. \nDEREK Yeah.    That's tough. \nBETH Tough?    It's a disaster.   If it was me... \nDEREK Beth, you know I'd never cheat on you. \nDerek reaches across the table and takes her hand. \nBETH I know. \ne moves closer and puts an arm around her. \nDEREK Tim's an idiot. B ETH He's a son of a bitch. (beat; then) What did you want to tell me? \nThere's no way he can tell her now. \nDEREK Forget it. Just a little problem at work.

BEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY \nDerek, agitated, has confided in Ben who's both concerned and a little turned on. \nBEN Why didn't you tell me? \nDEREK There was nothing to tell. \nBEN Nothing to tell? She grabbed your cock? Flashed her tits in your car? Come on, man. I thought I was your best friend. \nDEREK You think this is funny? \nDEREK I will. Listen. We'll have you and Kathy over some night when we're more settled. \nHANK Sounds like a plan. \nDerek opens the door and exits. \nOutside, down the hall, Ben is waiting. \nBEN Well? \nDEREK She quit. \nBEN Really? \nDEREK Yeah. \nBen grins.    He raises his hand for a high five. \nEN Come on, bro.     That's good news.

MASTER BEDROOM - A WEEK LATER - NIGHT \nDerek and Beth come in, dressed in tux and gown, exhausted from a New Years party. \nBETH God,   it's after three.

Just   you, me and Kyle. \nA \"You Have Mail\" DING comes from Derek's home computer on the other side of the room. \nDEREK I'm just gonna check my e-mail and come to bed. \nBETH Can't it wait? \nDEREK It's already tomorrow in Berlin. Ganz was supposed to send me his approval. That's probably him. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nI \nU \nCONTINUED: \nBeth goes into the adjoining bathroom. \nWith a YAWN, Derek sits down at his computer and goes to e- mail. He scans it and is instantly confused. \nDozens of e-mails, all from the same sender: TEMPGIRL. A little fearful, Derek pulls up the first e-mail. It opens up to reveal a self-taken photo of Lisa looking sexy and inviting on a bed, smiling seductively and wearing skimpy lingerie that shows off her sexy body. \nnder her photo: SEE YOU IN THE NEW YEAR. \nDerek feels a jolt of panic.    He deletes it, brings up the others. \nt's the same photo, Lisa on the bed, over and over. \nDerek stares at Lisa on screen, feeling sick and invaded. He isn't aware of Beth coming out of the bathroom behind him. She approaches as he continues to delete. \nBETH Ganz? \nShe's about to peer over his shoulder. Derek hits the delete key and the last photo of Lisa disappears. \nBETH (cont'd) What was that? \nOE Who could blame him with a wife like Beth. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK Speaking of Beth, I said I'd give her a call before she puts Kyle to bed. I'll be right back. \nDerek picks up his drink and leaves. \nJOE Hurry back. This party's just getting started. \nEXT. PATIO OUTSIDE THE BAR \nLow-lit. Empty. Derek comes out, flips open his cell to call home. He puts his drink down on a table. \nDEREK Hey, honey. It's me. \nINTERCUTTING WITH BETH in Kyle's bedroom, putting him to sleep. \nBETH How's the male bonding? \nDEREK They're all getting wasted. Any minute now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi. \nBETH Well, if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there? \nDerek freezes. Across the patio, he sees A FIGURE slowly approaching. It's a woman back-lit, a silhouette. But as she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as Lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale. D EREK I have to go. \nBETH Wait.   Kyle wants to say good night. \nDEREK (TENSE) They're yelling for me to come back. \nBETH It'll just take a second... \nBeth picks up Kyle. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBETH (cont'd) Say good night to Daddy. \nAs Lisa comes closer... \nDEREK (DESPERATE) Beth, I'll call you later. \nBETH I'll be in bed -- Derek? \nDerek clicks off and pockets his cell. \nOn the other end, Beth looks perturbed. \nNow Lisa comes face to face with Derek, smiling.     She boldly picks up his drink and takes a sip. \nLISA I can always tell from the pained look on your face when you're talking to Beth. \nDEREK (DEMANDING) How did you know I'd be here? \nLISA I've got my sources. slight frown) What's wrong? You don't look happy to see me. \nDEREK Why did you come here? \nLISA You said you could never be with someone you work with. (when he doesn't seem to \"get IT\") That's why I quit. So we could be together. \nDerek looks at her, astounded. \nDEREK (holding down panic) Lisa, you need to leave. \nLISA (teasing smile) Or what? You'll make a scene? (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nLISA(cont'd) CONTINUED: (2) Call security? What would Joe and Ben and the others think? I'll tell you what they'd think. They'd think we arranged it. And in a way, we did. \nLisa turns aside. Out of Derek's sight, she slips a capsule into his drink, then puts it back on the table. \nLISA (cont'd) This hook-up was on the books from the day we met. D EREK What are you talking about? \nLISA One of us   has to take control and I guess it's me.    So you go back, say your good nights to   the boys and I'll be waiting in my room.    610. \nDEREK I'm not coming to your room. \nLISA Would you rather I came to yours? \nDEREK You're crazy... sick.      You need help. \nLISA I know. I need help. (moves closer; seductive) Help me, Derek. \nShe presses against him. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Okay.    I come back. \nThe door closes. \nerek glances over at the clock. 10:15. Shit.    He's overslept and now he's late for the seminar. \nDerek starts to get up, looks over and -- his heart stops. \nThere's Lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach, naked under the covers. She opens her eyes and gives him a sexy, sleepy smile, stretching her body like a cat. \nLISA Morning. \nDerek goes into panic mode, jumping out of the bed like it's on fire. \nDEREK You've got to get out of here! \nLISA What are you talking about? \nDEREK Leave!   You've got to go! \nDerek grabs Lisa by the arm, drags her out of the bed at the same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting them into her arms. \nLISA Derek, come on... D EREK I want you out of here! \n(CONTINUED) \nL \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLISA Why?   You worried somebody's gonna catch us? \nDEREK Just get the hell out. \nLISA (HALF-AMUSED) We woke up a little grumpy this morning, didn't we? \nLisa barely manages to slip into her dress before Derek opens the door and pushes her out into the hall. \nISA (cont'd) Derek, what is wrong with you? \nDerek slams the door.       On the other side, we hear Lisa's musical laugh. \nLISA (cont'd) All right.     Have it your way. \nDerek locks the door. Shaking, he goes to the bed, sits on the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands. \nDEREK (in hell) Fuck... fuck... fuck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL - SEMINAR ROOM - MINUTES LATER \nDerek slips in and takes a seat next to Ben at the end of a big table. The other guys are there, also a little under the weather. They take notice of his late arrival. \nJOE (interrupting his talk) Thank god. We were about to send out a search party. \nDEREK Sorry.   Overslept. \nDerek glances over at Ben who frowns at him. Derek looks over at the wall clock as Joe resumes talking. 10:35. T IME CUT \n(CONTINUED) \nI \nCONTINUED: \nIt's now 12:50. While Joe continues his talk, A HOTEL CLERK quietly slips into the room, goes over to Derek and whispers to him. Derek perks up with concern.

How about some lunch? \nDEREK Lunch? \nLISA It's gorgeous outside and I made a reservation at -- \nCUT TO: \nINT.

HOTEL ROOM \nDerek steps inside and freezes, confronted with his worst nightmare. \nHigh heels and a path of discarded clothing leads to the bed where Lisa lies in bed, naked under the covers, her eyes shut, seemingly asleep. \nEREK (anger rising) No. No fucking way... \nDerek moves toward the bed and the sleeping girl. D EREK (cont'd) Goddamn it, Lisa. \nNo response. Her head is cocked to one side and her skin is ghostly pale. \nDerek leans over and shakes Lisa's naked shoulder. \nDEREK (cont'd) Lisa, get up. \nIt's like shaking a doll. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nCONTINUED: \nDEREK (cont'd) Get up or I'll drag you out and throw you in the hall. \nThat's when Derek sees it. On the night stand: an empty bottle of prescription pills. Derek picks up the bottle and looks at the label: Ambien. \nDerek grabs the bedside phone and punches Desk. \nDEREK (cont'd) (fighting panic) This is 622. There's a woman in my room, she's taken an overdose of prescription pills -- Ambien. You need to get the paramedics and security up here right away. Please hurry. \nDerek hangs up. Now he puts one knee on the bed and takes Lisa's face in his hands, turning her head. He might as well be handling a marionette. \nDEREK (cont'd) (SHOUTS) Lisa! \nNo response. He puts his ear to her naked chest, trying to detect a heartbeat. If there is one, he can't hear it. Derek gently slaps her cheeks. Rolls back her eye lids. Nothing. \nDEREK (cont'd) Oh god... \nNow Derek begins to perform CPR.

With no help from you? \nDEREK Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on. \nREYES And you had no idea she'd be at the hotel? \nDEREK None. I don't even know how she got in my room. \nREYES Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key. \nDEREK Doesn't that prove she did this on her own? \nREYES All it proves is she lost her key. \nDEREK She never had a key. \nREYES Look, Mister Charles, I don't care if you were or weren't banging this girl.

But that may not be necessary. \nDEREK Why not? \nLISA Lisa's left town. She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday. Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back. Lisa's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there. \nDEREK (some relief) Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear she's gone.

Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened corner looking at a small television.  He is watching Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news... 
He waves at Apollo. 
TRAINER (worried) Apollo, you oughta come see this boy you're gonna fight on TV -- looks like he means business. 
Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork. 
APOLLO I mean business, too -- (to men) The gross rental of the arena is gonna include the four hundred ushers, right? -- Gimme some coffee. 
EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT 
It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs. 
INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen. 
He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens and he staggers towards the bedroom. 
He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the otherwise darkened room. 
ADRIAN ... And he called the reporters -- 
ROCKY Yeah... Threw my whole day off. 
ADRIAN Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help. 
ROCKY Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it. 
ADRIAN ... Are you going to say anything to him? 
ROCKY ... What's to say?  I dunno what he wants from me -- 
Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the room. 
PAULIE Nothin'!  I want nothin' from you!!! 
ADRIAN Paulie! 
PAULIE Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case!  Get outta my house! 
ADRIAN It's not your house -- 
PAULIE You ain't no friend no more -- Go home!  Outta my house I want ya! 
ADRIAN Don't talk like that to him! 
PAULIE Get outta my life both of ya's. 
Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be bordering on a nervous breakdown. 
PAULIE (continuing) Outta my house I want ya!! 
ROCKY ... It's cold outside, Paulie. 
Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow. 
PAULIE I don't want ya messin' up my sister no more -- He's scum from the corner, I don't raise ya to hang with no bum! 
Adrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie. 
PAULIE (continuing; raising the bat) ... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon -- C'mon, I'll break both ya arms so's they never work... 
Rocky freezes... 
ADRIAN ... Paulie.  Stop now! 
PAULIE I want 'im outta here -- (to Rocky) Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? (spits) That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! (spits again) You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! (spits) I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too! 
ADRIAN Only a pig would say that! 
Paulie smashes a small table with the bat. 
PAULIE (to Adrian) You forget what I went through to give ya the best. 
ADRIAN You gave me what?!  Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything! 
PAULIE I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!

He sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the broken foliage. 
ACKLAND (CONT'D) It's like something came out of the crater and went that way... 
There's a TINY CLICK, and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the safety off his rifle.  ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too.  They step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to... 
YORK Another one? 
ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun. 
ACKLAND Yeah.  This's closed. 
There's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in four sections.  The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS nervously. Something organic is pulsing inside.  ACKLAND cranes his neck forward for a better look... 
There's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT.  A spindly shape with a long segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND.  It's a FACEHUGGER.  ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance.  His finger involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls.  A volley of shots describe and arc and  light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE BOOM, and we... 
CUT TO ...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.  SOMETHING is watching them from the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V.  A PREDATOR.  We see the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi- colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER, before we... 
CUT BACK TO ...One of ACKLAND's bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORK's thigh as he races forward to help his friend.  The HUGGER's tail is already around ACKLAND's throat, it's fingers scrabbling for purchase.  YORK pulls at one set of digits, and manages to raise them for just an instant.  What we see is horrific; the look of terror on ACKLAND's face, and the questing tendril on the HUGGER's underside trying to force it's way between ACKLAND's lips. In a second, it's all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK's grasp, and clamps itself firmly on ACKLAND's face with a faint SUCKING SOUND.  YORK shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few feet away.  He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving altogether. 
YORK Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God. 
The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as YORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we... 
CUT TO A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging ACKLAND's body away from the crater.  It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around the HUGGER and into ACKLAND. 
YORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue trousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely.  There's movement on the ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to another FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body.  The HUGGER's fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the movement akin to somebody drumming their fingers on a table-top. 
EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT 
As YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes, he hears a TICKING SOUND from the trees, like an engine cooling on a warm summer's day.  YORK clutches his rifle and stares upward.  There seems to be a VAGUE SHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree.  Although it might be a trick of the light, he isn't sticking around to find out.  YORK guns the bike to life and ROARS off above the swamp. 
EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT 
PREDATOR-VISION. We're looking at the site in colours:  the cold blue of empty ALIEN EGGS, and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the FACEHUGGER parasites. 
A group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity, their camouflage cloaks deactivated.  The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE curled up there.  Most of it has been madly mutilated by something erupting from inside it's body. The PREDATOR looks up and scans the swamp, ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air. 
PREDATOR-VISION. This time, an oscillating line appears to the left of our view, and a band sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing different levels of SOUND STATIC.  This abruptly stops as the oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys.  The PREDATOR is picking up radio waves.  A HUMAN VOICE; albeit grossly-distorted. 
EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT 
We hear a RAPID BEEPING; movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn against intruding animals.  The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent, bleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol.  She's suddenly wide awake when she sees YORK's hover-bike, lit by the sensors' flashing red strobe.  It skids to a halt against a mud-bank, sending up a spray of silt.  YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles, then starts to unfasten the straps holding ACKLAND's body. 
BEAUVAIS Jesus Christ!  What happened? 
YORK Give me a hand with Ack. 
She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up. 
BEAUVAIS How bad is... oh my God. 
As ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a FACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed. 
BEAUVAIS What is that? 
YORK Don't... uuh... don't know.  Help me... uuh... help me get him inside. Shit! 
YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful.  He slumps slowly to the floor. 
BEAUVAIS   (yelling) Minh!  Minh, get out here! 
INT.  TENT - NIGHT 
A portable neon light in the tent flickers, casting staccato bluish light over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER.  MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it in horrified fascination, while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his thigh.  He winces. 
BEAUVAIS Have you tried prising it off? 
YORK shakes his head. 
YORK I wanted to get him back here; get him back to base. 
MINH Forget it.  We lost the satellite link. It's dead. 
There's a long pause while everyone considers the options. 
BEAUVAIS We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off. 
MINH Oh man... 
YORK Get real, Beauvais!  That thing might chew his fucking face off for all be know!

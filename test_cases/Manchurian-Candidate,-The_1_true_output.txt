... The enemy is among us. The wolf is at the door ... the fox is in the henhouse ... the weasel is ... the weasel is ... They take his room keycard from him, open the door -- 
74   INT. RAYMOND'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                             74 
Anderson and another AGENT move through the suite, securing it -- Raymond losing steam: 
RAYMOND 
The weasel is a weasel.    Frog and Toad Are Friends. -- returning to the door and handing Raymond his keycard. The PHONE BEGINS TO RING -- 
ANDERSON 
Sir, we'll be right outside. 
RAYMOND 
I know.   Good night. He closes the door after them. Breathes out.    Glances at his watch. Then crosses to answer the phone: 
RAYMOND 
You have thirty seconds, Mother. 
75   INTERCUT - ELLIE'S SENATE OFFICE - NIGHT                          75 
Ellie behind her desk. 
ELLIE 
Am I this predictable? 
RAYMOND 
You have no idea. 
ELLIE 
I'm calling to compliment you, Mr. Grumpy. I thought you were magnificent tonight. So do all the network campaign experts. "Presidential" was a word they used. Raymond's second line flashes with another call. 
ELLIE 
This compassionate vigilance thing is working quite well for you. I might have to convert. 
RAYMOND 
I happen to believe in it. 
ELLIE 
Of course you do.    Now Raymond -- 
RAYMOND 
Goodnight, Mother. 
ELLIE 
Raymond -- Raymond punches a button and puts his mother on HOLD. 
76   INT. ELLIE'S SENATE OFFICE - NIGHT                                76 
Ellie listens to the dead air of the other end of her call. 
ELLIE 
Raymond? 
77   INT. RAYMOND'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                77 
Raymond stares -- 
THE PHONE 
Mom on hold, flashing red light.     The second call, light fluttering -- 
RAYMOND 
punches the line, lifts the receiver -- 
RAYMOND 
Yes? 
VOICE ON THE PHONE 
(British accent) Sergeant Shaw? 
RAYMOND 
(irritably) Who is this? CLOSE on RAYMOND'S EAR -- 
VOICE ON THE PHONE 
Sergeant Raymond Shaw? Beat. Raymond's puzzled. Cocks his head, eyes searching the corners of the room. SOUND: a distant desert wind, building. Then: 
RAYMOND 
Yes ...? CLOSE on RAYMOND'S EYE -- 
VOICE ON THE PHONE 
Raymond Prentiss Shaw? -- Raymond's senses appear to QUICKEN NOW, as the LIGHTING in the room changes, morphing somehow -- even as SOUNDS of steady percussion, and the zaghareet -- the wailing cry of the Arab women -- rise out of the wind -- 
RAYMOND 
(eyes alight) Yes. -- everything is brighter, sharper, more luminous -- more etched than it was just moments ago -- 
VOICE ON THE PHONE 
Listen: (then) Enter the bathroom, and go to the closet there. 
WIDE - THE SUITE 
Raymond moves with tremendous assurance across the living room and down the hallway and into the bathroom -- 
THE PHONE 
light flashing, Eleanor on HOLD -- stops --

Alex looks around, sees a two-by-four, and snags it. 
NICK (realizing) No, Alex!  Alex, wait a minute... 
Alex swings the two-by-four like a club and SMASH!!!  Down comes the glass in a shower. 
INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Alex and Nick enter and immediately sense that something is wrong. 
The LIGHT from the t.v. screen continues to flicker and a low-pitched electric HUM permeates the air...the sound a live wire might make.  And the HUM seems to be mobile too, coursing through the walls...up, down, and around Alex and Nick. 
Nick's eyes try to track the HUM as it races overhead. 
NICK (freaked) What is it? 
And as Nick speaks, his breath escapes his mouth in a frosty plume of mist.  It's cold in here too. 
Laurie, meanwhile, has failed to notice Alex and Nick's arrival.  Alex and Nick step further in, to get a view of the t.v. 
STATIC 
fills the screen.  Static and strange WHISPER/VOICES.  It's all indistinct. 
ALEX (shaking Laurie) Laurie...wake up... 
Laurie's face is a mess.  Tears are running down, but she's grinning all the same.  It's frightening. 
LAURIE (voice distant) I am awake. (grins wider) Don't you see them? 
NICK See what? 
Laurie points to the t.v. screen. 
LAURIE Angels.  There are angels inside. 
But we see only static. 
ALEX We have to turn it off, Laurie.  I'm turning it off... 
As Alex reaches for the "OFF" knob, a face coalesces out of the static. It's Greg again. 
GREG (static-laced) Alex.  Don't leave me here. 
NICK Jesus Christ! 
AND ON THE SCREEN, 
Greg's face metamorphosizes into ARCADE's! 
ARCADE (mocking Greg, electronic) "DON'T LEAVE ME HERE". 
And even as ARCADE speaks, the VOICE seems to come from all around them, from the HUMMING coursing through the walls. 
Nick backs away from the screen, petrified. 
ARCADE (seductive) HI, NICK.  READY TO KISS REALITY GOODBYE? 
The HUMMING around them has increased.  Laurie begins to shake. 
ALEX Change the channel! 
NICK What?! 
Alex snatches up the remote control and stabs the buttons. 
ON SCREEN 
Every single channel portrays the fractals. recombining and growing. 
The screen flickers and ARCADE's face appear again, reestablishing control. 
NICK (angry, scared) Who are you?! 
ARCADE GOD. 
The word reverberates through the room and HUMMING has become a ROAR around them.  An ELECTRICAL storm. 
OUTLETS 
around the room are crackling with energy, spitting out SPARKS. 
ARCADE COME INSIDE.  I ONLY WANT TO PLAY.

LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK \nA SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks up in time to see an object sear across the dusk sky.  He pulls his bike to a stationary hover. \nYORK Shit!  What's that? \nACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the ground.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before settling back into an eerie silence. \nACKLAND Meteor, I guess. \nHe raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face.  THROUGH THEM he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops. \nACKLAND D'you feel any impact shock? \nYORK   (uncertain) Not really. \n", "test1_true": "ACKLAND Me either.

I dunno.  Something about this feels funny. \nHe looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky. \nACKLAND (CONT'D) That is the damndest impact I've ever saw... \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK \nThe earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the surrounding brush still aflame.  A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to the edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly.  We HEAR a LOW HUM, and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL.  Before the SCORPION can decide what to do, it's fate is sealed.  A large METAL CLAW comes down, crushing it in an instant.  A SECOND CLAW emerges, and a MACHINE heaves itself out of the hole, it's surface smoking with heat.  It pauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey, them moves purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting.  A hatch on the underside opens, and a complex delivery mechanism extends.  After a moment there's a LOW CLUNK, and the mechanism retracts.  In it's place is an ALIEN EGG.  The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing into the long reeds. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT \nHIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMEN's crawler, her knees pulled up to her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night impenetrable.  Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the communications array strobe on-and-off.  Above the bar on the main street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with the words \"TORCHY'S\".  The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within become momentarily louder, and HIROKO glances over to see it's pressure-door CRASH back, disgorging several drunken people. KAMEN follows them through.  He spots HIROKO and heads over. \nKAMEN Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to. \nHIROKO I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head. \nKAMEN Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh? \nShe shakes her head, and manages a smile. \nHIROKO I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me. \nKAMEN Not too much of the socializing type, then? \nHIROKO No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type. \nKAMEN LAUGHS.  HIROKO is straight-faced. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations. \nKAMEN Is that a fact. \nHIROKO Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch. \nKAMEN How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months? \nHIROKO Four. \nKAMEN And before that? \nHIROKO Six month stint on Datus. \nKAMEN Only six? \nHIROKO What is this?  'Twenty Questions'? \nKAMEN Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around. \nHIROKO shrugs.  Thinks about it. \nHIROKO I don't know.  I guess I've just never found anywhere I really felt at home. \nShe hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease. KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads. \nKAMEN What is that? \nHIROKO Real man' drink. \nShe offers the glass to him.  He takes it and sniff cautiously. \nKAMEN Seltzer? \nHIROKO Want some? \nKAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle. \nKAMEN I'll stick with my own. \nHe sits with her and stares into the darkness. \nHIROKO Any luck raising Ackland's party? \nKAMEN Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us. \nHIROKO First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back. \n", "test1_id": 1236, "test2_input": "The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.  MINH catches BEAUVAIS' head-jerk. \nBEAUVAIS Minh... \nMINH Yep... \nMINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.  BEAUVAIS rounds on YORK, continuing. \nBEAUVAIS How do you know it's not already? \nYORK I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look... \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.  He studies the surrounding darkness.  There's nothing out there.  He shakes his head in disgust. \nMINH   (muttering) Take a goddamn wrench to those things... \nHe thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.  There's a gentle WHINE, and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a target.  We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.  In addition to the firing trigger, there's also a thumb button.  He squeezes it... \nThe gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking something automatically.  There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off three shots in rapid succession.  Something that was only yards from MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a mass of luminous green liquid and motion. \nMINH (CONT'D)  (dumbstruck) God. \nMINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a SPLASH, then lie motionless.  YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in an instant. \nPREDATOR-VISION. Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.  The triangular mechanism of the PREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH. \nA BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body, spraying blood across YORK.  He topples dead to the ground, a look of pained surprise on his face.  BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing across and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.  She doesn't have time to take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger guard and starts squeezing off random shots.  The air shimmers as an unseen shape races at her.  There's a loud \nSWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air. It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and impaling her against a tree. \nYORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.  A moment later her struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken marionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS disappears.  In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch trickling from a wound on it's arm.  It's head flicks around as it zeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon following suit.  YORK's quick though, already up and running when the plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg. \nHis options are limited.  The hover-bike is nearby.  He sprints for that and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.  He flips it.  The engine COUGHS and then dies.  YORK looks up.  The wounded PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.  YORK turns the key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.  The creature WHIPS an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!  The blade slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta- wings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into the swamp. \nYORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the rear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.  He sees a PREDATOR handing from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their camouflage nearby.  He's not sticking around to argue though.  YORK jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more cannon-blasts blossom around him. \nThe group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the area. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses to the tent and opens the entry flap. \nINT.  TENT - NIGHT \nPREDATOR-VISION. The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on ACKLAND for a long moment, but takes no further action. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nWe PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite.  There isn't a soul there, human or otherwise.  The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs. \nEXT.  RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN \nFirst light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon.  A 'chopper' - actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist hanging over the treetops. \nINT.  CHOPPER - DAWN \nThe cockpit is small, a two-seater with room for cargo in the back. KAMEN's in the pilot seat, and HIROKO's riding shotgun.  The controls moving by themselves, on autopilot.  A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN to look up from his magazine. \nKAMEN'S P.O.V. From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees. \nKAMEN nudges HIROKO awake. \nKAMEN Wake up.  We're at the beacon. \nHe switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down. HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN \nTwin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep across the clearing.  The encampment has been wrecked, much of is reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris.  All-terrain gear lowers from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp. \nINT.  CHOPPER - DAWN \nKAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief.  KAMEN hauls an automatic pulse-rifle from the rear. \nKAMEN Looks like trouble. \nKAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol. Passes it to her. \nKAMEN (CONT'D) Used one of these before? \nHIROKO coolly examines it. \nHIROKO Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses twelve mill hollow 'O' rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can handle this. \n", "test2_true": "KAMEN Okay.  Watch were you point it... \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN \nThe two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred canvas. Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has burned through. \nHIROKO   (quietly) Somebody picked an argument. \nKAMEN Yeah.  Somebody won. \nHIROKO Check out the tent. \nKAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the wreckage dotted around the perimeter. \nINT.  TENT - DAWN \nKAMEN opens the tent flap and peers inside.  ACKLAND's on the cot, sweating heavily.  There is no sign of the FACEHUGGER. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN \nAcross the clearing, HIROKO turns a piece of charred plating over in her hands before discarding it. \nHer foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud.  It's MINH's 'howitzer'. A dark slippery patch coats the metal.  She crouches down and rubs her fingers through it.  Blood.  KAMEN's VOICE intrudes, O.S. \nKAMEN   (O.S.) I've found Ackland! \nHIROKO Hold on... \nShe begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of rope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the face and knocking her off her feet.  HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and surprise, then freezes at what she sees. \nTwo bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS and MINH.  Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition.  KAMEN hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant.  He stops in his tracks. \nKAMEN Jesus palomino... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING \nIt's raining again at the base.  Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late thirties.  As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat.  KAMEN runs after REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag. \nKAMEN Wait a minute, Doc... \nHe hands the bag over to REVNA.  She peers at the contents curiously. The FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled. \nREVNA Is this it? \nKAMEN Yeah.  Found it curled up in a corner of the tent.  Any idea? \nREVNA shakes her head. \nREVNA Never come across one of these before. Maybe the original survey team did.  I'll run it through records and see what comes up. \nGUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLAND's body's secure on the trolley.  KAMEN raps him on the back to get his attention. \nKAMEN Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper. \nGUTTIEREZ What's the problem? \nKAMEN She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up. \nGUTTIEREZ Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself. \nKAMEN Appreciate that. \nREVNA interrupts. \nREVNA Where're the bodies? \nHIROKO Bagged and in the back.  They're not a pretty sight. \nACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator.  As KAMEN and HIROKO walk away across the rain-swept platform, a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad. \nPREDATOR-VISION. A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the towers and modules of the relay- station with great interest.  An oscillating red line appears to the LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR analyses HIROKO's voice-pattern. \nPREDATOR   (O.S., distorted) Not a pretty sight.  Not a pretty sight... \nHe reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DAY \nUnder the cathedral-like light filtering through the trees above, a row of metal spikes have been driven into the earth.  Four are topped with still-smoking ALIEN skulls.  Two and empty. \nPREDATOR-VISION. A newly decapitated ALIEN head is turned around in another PREDATOR's hands in admiration.  This PREDATOR thrusts his trophy onto the next spike, then stares at the vacant one for a long moment.  His wrist computer BLEEPS for attention... \n", "test2_id": 1237, "test3_input": "CASSIE I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up. \nPARSONS Keep trying! \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER \nBEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.  The signals pick-up speed the closer they get. CASSIE's garbled VOICE isn't helping ease HIROKO's panic.  She looks wildly around the chamber.  The only way out the way she came in... \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate access to... \nHIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control.  The COMPUTER VOICE ceases, while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume. Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her... \nHIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct.  It's position makes it virtually impossible to get back into.  She tries anyhow. \nBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!  A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber, flattening her against the wall.  DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other side of the grille like express trains in the night...going away from HIROKO.  She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor screen recede and finally disappear.  The tracker's pitch returns to it's hollow CLICKING. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nBROKEN TUSK tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through the aftermath of the battle down by the now-empty rhino pen.  He finds something. A PREDATOR face-mask, with a massive crack down one side. He turns it carefully over in his hands. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR \nHIROKO emerges from the water, a thin membrane of surface slime adhering to her helmet.  Blinded, she raises a gloved hand and wipes the mucus away... \nHIROKO'S P.O.V. She's inside the Central Reservoir, a long cylindrical concrete tunnel some eighteen feet in diameter.  The water-level comes up about half- way.  What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion... \nShe's found the main offshoot of the ALIENS' nest.  Glued into the curved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.  HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS. Other ANIMALS.  Most are dead, their innards blown open.  The rest are comatose, twitching occasionally.  Every square inch not containing bodies is filled with ALIEN EGGS.  It's like Hell for real. \nHIROKO reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout. \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) ...Brrzzt.  Traversing Central Reservoir en route to platform venturi dust DS two-six. \nHIROKO's P.O.V. She looks around and finds the exit point on the display. It's several feet away.  Under the surface.  She wades swiftly through the water, passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause.  A large PULSATING BAG, about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape.  It might be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell. \nHIROKO submerges.  Sure enough, there's the grille.  She raises the power-tool and starts extracting the bolts.  BZZZZ!  There's the first one, no problem.  BZZZZ...BZZZZ!  The second and third are just as easy.  She goes for the fourth.  BZZZ...CHUNK.  Nothing happens. \nHIROKO Come on... \nShe bears down on the trigger again.  The motor's not running.  A tiny green LED flashes on the machine's side.  It's locked solid.  A malfunction. \nCOMPUTER VOICE  (O.S., on speakers) Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate access to  venturi ducts. \nThere's only one recourse left to her.  She jams down the thumb button... \nKER-SLAM!  The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface.  She wipes the slime from her helmet yet again... \n...And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in four neat sections.  The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate... \n...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself back toward her.  It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.  HIROKO raises the power-tool, reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.  Fat rivets RIP through the FACEHUGGER's body.  It writhes around on the water's surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.  HIROKO dives into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt. \nBZZZZ!  It's out!  She levers-off the grille.  Forces herself into the confined space beyond... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT \nAnother poorly-lit shaft filled with murky water, though this one goes upwards on a diagonal slope.  HIROKO braces herself against the walls and begins to climb. \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speaker) Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface. \nWHAM!  An ALIEN's head squeezes through the opening behind her.  It's claw snakes in, groping blindly just inches from her feet.  She grits her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent. \nWALLPO!  It's hand closes around her leg, yanking her back.  She tries frantically to gain purchase on anything.  She fails.  The ALIEN draws her nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.  Fracture lines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.  Polluted water starts to flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass. \nHIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger. Rivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.  A haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.  HIROKO pushes upward, coughing.  She closes her fist around a lever above.  Pulls on it with all her might. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nInternal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork. It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK.  HIROKO hauls herself from the shaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.  She throws the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.  Yanks desperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment off. \nAs promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.  HIROKO starts towards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the ruined pressure-suit.  She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through the smoking pile of cloth.  Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws the keys. \nSLAP!  A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.  HIROKO scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.  She tears across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.  The turbines ROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.  HIROKO pivots the powerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp. Losing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck. \nHIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.  The fire over by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and- orange smoke rising into the air. \nA DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.  Yet another ALIEN.  It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the hoverbike, gaining balance in an instant. \nHIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see- sawing the bike side-to-side.  The ALIEN's got a firm hold though, crawling hand-over-hand towards her.  HIROKO releases her grip on both throttles simultaneously.  Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a halt.  The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the surrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls it back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the leading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising creature, neatly decapitating it. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT \nThe hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.  HIROKO dismounts and draws her pistol.  Takes in the sheer height of the ladder she's going to have to scale.  Thumbs her headset. \n", "test3_true": "INT.

RHUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT \nHIROKO reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the Control Cab. She narrowly misses something metallic near the base of the handrail.  If she'd taken the time to stop and look, she would have seen BROKEN TUSK's ruined wrist computer. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL \nDRISCOLL flips open an access flap on one wall of the ladder-well.

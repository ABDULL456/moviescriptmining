{"train": "Aliens vs. Predator \nDark Horse Prod. Presents \nALIENS \nVs. \nPREDATOR \nScreenplay by Peter Briggs \nEXT.  DEEP SPACE \nWe OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite depths of space.  As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and racing toward us.  Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick glimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large brownish planet.  Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere. It seems to be manmade.  Or at least artificial. \nEXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY \nThe planet is dead, barren.  Death Valley on a grand scale.  We watch the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back into an eerie silence. \nEXT.  FISSURE CANYON - DAY \nWe're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.  A howling wind whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.  About seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a cave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.  We hear a mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet tall.  They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of aborigine and ultra-hi-tech.  In their hands are circular metal discs; 'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase. \nPREDATOR-VISION. \nFrom their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES. The entrance registers as a black gaping void. \nINT.  FISSURE NEST TUNNEL \nThe five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's banshee wailing.  The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus. He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a deep breath of the air.  A curious speckled pattern runs across his wide forehead, marking him different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles has been sheared away.  We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of the hunting party.  He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the tunnel. \nSeveral feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.  He hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who has found something. \nThe other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.  Skewered on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented tail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform. BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling spears and elaborately-shaped swords.  Several shoulder-mounted plasma cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' helmets.  Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances. One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area. \nPREDATOR-VISION. \nHe switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra- violet, enhanced motion-tracking.  Nothing. \nHe's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical growth on the floor.  A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.  A gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.  The band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.  The carnage is swift and terrifying, a blur of motion. \nSteel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.  One PREDATOR is pinned against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.  The ALIEN claws away his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue, extended toward him with pile-driver speed.  He reaches down, grasping the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc that terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.  Big mistake.  The two are in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across the PREDATOR's head.  While their technology seems to be resistant to it, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into the PREDATOR's skin.  He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS PIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face. \nIt all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no question as to who were the victors.  The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.  As his companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.  The first PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other. What he finds causes him to react with pity and disgust.  His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles clicking frailly, half his head burnt away.  BROKEN TUSK watches the ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to him.  He takes it, knowing what has to be done.  Rolling the knife quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen hunter.  This unpleasant task accomplished, \nBROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.  A dark shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.  It hovers in the air with little more than a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.  The surviving PREDATORS leap aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men returning from combat. \nOne more thing need to be done.  BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a sequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.  A countdown is displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED BEEPING.  He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting. \nEXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY \nA white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.  The shuttlecraft pulls quickly away, disappearing into the clouds. \nEXT.  SPACE \nA large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the PREDATOR Mothership.  The shuttle heads swiftly towards it. \nINT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY \nAn airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the Mothership's docking bay.  An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly look up at them.  Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious mixture of old and new.  An elaborate frieze written in alien script runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed into it.  Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them. \nINT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY \nThe gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship. BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.  He peers over the protective railing. \nWHAT HE SEES is magnificent:  a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the ALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.  Each of it's limbs is tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.  To the rear, it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling. A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly defying gravity.  As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam - similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.  This done, a manipulator are carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a hatchway in the floor.  It's an assembly-line of almost frightening mechanical efficiency. \nEXT.  SPACE \nWe see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the planet into deep space.  The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt. \nINT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY \nThe blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to red, BEEPING rapidly.  BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a representation of a QUEEN's head.  The manipulator arm swiftly grasps the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor. The causes the QUEEN to go berserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.  She's obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen. The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an energy-filled blast furnace.  The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops in, and is no more. \nINT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS \nAn orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows into long-empty orbs.  BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable arsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.  He regards it for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before finally getting to his feet. \nINT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY \nHe sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid. \nPARSONS Where'd you leave them? \nKAMEN Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow. \nCASSIE MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones. \nKAMEN Shit.  When? \nCASSIE Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four. \nKAMEN looks ill. \nKAMEN Fucking great.  I invested some money in them. \nCASSIE You win some, you loose some. \nKAMEN I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with? \nCASSIE No, but I got something that might interest you. \nHIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket. \nHIROKO What've you got? \nKAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.  They turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of the neighboring solar system. \nCASSIE A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time. \nPARSONS We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure. \nCASSIE Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace. \nThe simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading towards the planet in the center of the display.  Computer notations accompany them. \nCASSIE (CONT'D) Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive. \nHIROKO Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles. \nPARSONS That's what we thought. \nHIROKO Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through? \nPARSONS Done it already.  Nothing matches. \nCASSIE And if you thought that was interesting, watch this... \nHIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change. \nKAMEN Jesus. \nPARSONS Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at. \nKAMEN Tactical nukes, maybe? \nEverybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.  It's obviously not an appealing thought. \nHIROKO Where're they headed? \nCASSIE We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion. \nThere's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant glances. HIROKO seems worried.  She scratches her forehead. \nHIROKO I don't know what to make of this.  Get a copy of the telemetry relayed back to Antarctica Traffic Control.  Better alert the nearest RimCorp Base, too. \nPARSONS nods, suddenly serious. \nPARSONS Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em? \nHIROKO Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON \nDown here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana bayou.  A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.  Seconds later, a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a swirl of spray.  The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES scatter.  ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called \"good 'ol boys\" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in the other. \nYORK   (yelling) You missed 'em, Ackland! \nACKLAND Little fuckers move too fast.  Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the other side. \nYORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.  The two bikes ROAR off in pursuit. \nKAMEN shakes his head. \nKAMEN Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother? All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control net.  That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists. \nPARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board. \nPARSONS Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS? \nCASSIE Okay, give me the numbers. \nShe flips a switch.  A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path sketched out in rectangular neon blocks. \nEXT.  SPACE \nA cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites, and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move. \nEXT.  DEEP SPACE \nThe two pods ROAR towards us at immense speed. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nThe two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked alteration in their course. \nPARSONS They've changed their heading again. \nHIROKO Compensate! \nPARSONS Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee. \nCASSIE What do you need? \nPARSONS A three-second burn to port, on my mark. \nCASSIE It's on the board. \nEXT.  SPACE \nFramed against the green backdrop of Ryushi, the PREDATOR pods rocket towards the communications platform. \nCASSIE Picking up velocity. \nHIROKO Match it! \nA bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS' temple. \nPARSONS Not gonna make it... \nEXT.  DEEP SPACE \nThe pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA, blotting out our view. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nOne of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes, and three-quarters of the monitors abruptly turn to static.  PARSONS curses. \nPARSONS Goddammit! \nHe pulls off his headset with weary resignation. \nPARSONS (CONT'D) We've lost the downlink.  It's gone. \nEXT.  SPACE \nThe mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end.  A gaping rent is torn through it; something sparks and flashes within.  The second pod accelerates off curving into the atmosphere. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK \nA SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks up in time to see an object sear across the dusk sky.  He pulls his bike to a stationary hover. \nYORK Shit!  What's that? \nACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the ground.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before settling back into an eerie silence. \nACKLAND Meteor, I guess. \nHe raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face.  THROUGH THEM he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops. \nACKLAND D'you feel any impact shock? \nYORK   (uncertain) Not really. \nKAMEN 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me? \nHIROKO Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs. \nHIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) This whole thing's got me spooked. \nKAMEN hops off the wheel. \nKAMEN Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight. \nHIROKO Do you think Ackland'll sit tight? \nKAMEN There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to. \nEXT.  SPACE \nA peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the incapacitated satellite, examining every section.  it comes to the rent torn through it, and pauses. \nFROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.  The damage registers as a cold, black mass. \nThe beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT \nShafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness. YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing. \nACKLAND Found anything? \nYORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi- purpose readout screen. \nYORK Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing. \nACKLAND Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus! \nACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running. \nYORK What is it? \nACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground. \nACKLAND It's a rhino. \nYORK Is it dead? \nACKLAND No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken. \nYORK looks at the data-stick again. \nYORK Yeah, it's fine. \nACKLAND God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus. \nYORK I told you we... what's that? \nTheir torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape. \nACKLAND Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe? \nYORK Bloody big if it is.  Top's open. \nACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside. \nYORK (CONT'D) Careful... \nThere's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed. \nACKLAND It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree with him. \nA heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair. \nYORK Let's get back and call this in. \nACKLAND Wait a minute. \nYORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to partially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over something at the bottom of the shallow pit. \nYORK What is that... is that metal fragments? \nACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now. \nThe motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.  MINH catches BEAUVAIS' head-jerk. \nBEAUVAIS Minh... \nMINH Yep... \nMINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.  BEAUVAIS rounds on YORK, continuing. \nBEAUVAIS How do you know it's not already? \nYORK I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look... \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nMINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.  He studies the surrounding darkness.  There's nothing out there.  He shakes his head in disgust. \nMINH   (muttering) Take a goddamn wrench to those things... \nHe thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.  There's a gentle WHINE, and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a target.  We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.  In addition to the firing trigger, there's also a thumb button.  He squeezes it... \nThe gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking something automatically.  There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off three shots in rapid succession.  Something that was only yards from MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a mass of luminous green liquid and motion. \nMINH (CONT'D)  (dumbstruck) God. \nMINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a SPLASH, then lie motionless.  YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in an instant. \nPREDATOR-VISION. Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.  The triangular mechanism of the PREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH. \nA BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body, spraying blood across YORK.  He topples dead to the ground, a look of pained surprise on his face.  BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing across and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.  She doesn't have time to take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger guard and starts squeezing off random shots.  The air shimmers as an unseen shape races at her.  There's a loud \nSWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air. It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and impaling her against a tree. \nYORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.  A moment later her struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken marionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS disappears.  In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch trickling from a wound on it's arm.  It's head flicks around as it zeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon following suit.  YORK's quick though, already up and running when the plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg. \nHis options are limited.  The hover-bike is nearby.  He sprints for that and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.  He flips it.  The engine COUGHS and then dies.  YORK looks up.  The wounded PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.  YORK turns the key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.  The creature WHIPS an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!  The blade slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta- wings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into the swamp. \nYORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the rear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.  He sees a PREDATOR handing from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their camouflage nearby.  He's not sticking around to argue though.  YORK jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more cannon-blasts blossom around him. \nThe group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the area. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses to the tent and opens the entry flap. \nINT.  TENT - NIGHT \nPREDATOR-VISION. The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on ACKLAND for a long moment, but takes no further action. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT \nWe PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite.  There isn't a soul there, human or otherwise.  The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs. \nEXT.  RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN \nFirst light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon.  A 'chopper' - actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist hanging over the treetops. \nINT.  CHOPPER - DAWN \nThe cockpit is small, a two-seater with room for cargo in the back. KAMEN's in the pilot seat, and HIROKO's riding shotgun.  The controls moving by themselves, on autopilot.  A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN to look up from his magazine. \nKAMEN'S P.O.V. From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees. \nKAMEN nudges HIROKO awake. \nKAMEN Wake up.  We're at the beacon. \nHe switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down. HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes. \nEXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN \nTwin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep across the clearing.  The encampment has been wrecked, much of is reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris.  All-terrain gear lowers from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp. \nINT.  CHOPPER - DAWN \nKAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief.  KAMEN hauls an automatic pulse-rifle from the rear. \nKAMEN Looks like trouble. \nKAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol. Passes it to her. \nKAMEN (CONT'D) Used one of these before? \nHIROKO coolly examines it. \nHIROKO Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses twelve mill hollow 'O' rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can handle this. \nDILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.  It's a FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second. \nDILLER Yeah... \nA hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as it hurtles towards the base.  Halfway between the trees and the ramp, it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.  It's rider flies through the air and hits the swamp face-first.  DILLER and CASSIE race down the ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead. \nCASSIE I don't believe it. \nDILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the mire. It's YORK.  Blood has caked around his wounded leg. \nDILLER He looks in a bad way.  Help me get him up to Infirmary. \nCASSIE Wait a minute... \nSomething else has caught CASSIE's eye.  A \"something\" almost two metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike. Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free.  CASSIE examines the PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head. \nCASSIE (CONT'D) Holy Mary... \nPREDATOR-VISION. The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the weapon over in her hands. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY \nREVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.  Every so often she GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal. The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of the computer screen.  The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.  ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably on his cot.  He finally sits up and massages his chest. \nACKLAND Oh.  Oh God... \nREVNA lowers her pen and looks across. \nREVNA What is it? \nACKLAND It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something. \nREVNA Do you want a tablet? \nACKLAND winces in pain.  His breathing's getting heavy.  He nods. \nACKLAND Uh-huh. \nREVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.  ACKLAND's beginning to COUGH now. \nREVNA That sounds nasty.  I'll give you a couple of Demazine. \nACKLAND nods again.  His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging his chest with a balled fist.  REVNA hurries over with three red tablets and a disposable cup of water.  ACKLAND takes them gratefully and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips. \nREVNA (CONT'D) Better? \nACKLAND Yeah... \nBefore he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.  A thin spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the process.  He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume. \nREVNA Hold on, it's alright.  I'm gonna give  you a shot... \nHer fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a vial of amber liquid attached.  ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto the floor, his hands clawing at the air.  REVNA fumbles with the injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.  ACKLAND convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the ceiling.  The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again. \nWe hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.  REVNA watches in horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.  REVNA shudders as the body moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it. \nWHAT SHE SEES.  ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, revealing a gaping cavity in his back.  Bits of spine and ribcage are just visible.  A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform - pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of still-underdeveloped arms. \nAround it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.  It kicks away from ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance. After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a table.  REVNA thinks quickly.  She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed. \nThe room is bathed in pools of shadows.  Plenty of hiding space for the creature.  REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.  She cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of probe-arms. \nThere's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery. REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.  Now she's armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER... \nThere's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.  We hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR \nHIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.  DILLER, CASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.  YORK lays unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making access difficult.  Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open revealing a circular mechanism beneath.  BREWSTER scratches at the bulkhead and WHINES.  MUFFLED THUMPS come from within. \nHIROKO What happened? \nDILLER York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary. \nHIROKO   (astonished) York... \nHIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from within the Infirmary distracts her. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) What's going on? \nCASSIE The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts. \nKAMEN claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him. \nKAMEN Don't worry about it, Yorkie.  You're safe now.  Go get come rest. \nYORK nods.  He gets to his feet and leaves the room.  HIROKO waits until the door slides shut behind him. \nHIROKO So, what do you think? \nKAMEN What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nIt's late, and the base's exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light across the metal and concrete thoroughfares.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES - a tough-looking Afrikaan woman with a think accent - looks uneasily about them. Another GROUP of PEOPLE with trackers and guns are searching around in the BACKGROUND.  Nearby, the vertical yellow column of a suspension-crane gantry towers high above. \nDE VRIES C'mon, man.  One more sweep. \nGUTTIEREZ One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip. \nDE VRIES Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it? \nGUTTIEREZ Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this. \nDE VRIES pauses, listening to the sound from the surrounding forest. \nDE VRIES Listen to that... \nGUTTIEREZ cocks his head and listens.  He has no idea what she means. \nGUTTIEREZ Listen to what? \nDE VRIES That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural. \nGUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable blackness beyond the confines of the base. \nGUTTIEREZ De Vries? \nDE VRIES Yeah? \nGUTTIEREZ Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself. \nBREWSTER the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the meshwork fence of their pens.  The animals move around in agitation. Not at her, but at something else... \nDE VRIES Something spooking the rhinos? \nGUTTIEREZ I dunno. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - DUSK \nPREDATOR-VISION. The rhino's, the dog, and the two humans can be seen way above on the platform's edge, bright red. \nIndistinct inside their camouflage cloaks, the small group of PREDATORS wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM \nDARKNESS.  DILLER and URIOSTE's VOICES heard O.S. in HUSHED TONES.  The scraping of METAL-ON-METAL. \nDILLER What is that...is that it? \nURIOSTE No.  I... think that's a regulator valve. Hold on. \nThere's more NOISE. \nURIOSTE (CONT'D) Ah, got it...! \nAbout a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber illuminate.  Three others flicker erratically, one of them remaining unlit. DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse- rifle level. He enters, followed by URIOSTE.  She's carrying a portable - but bulky - piece of machinery. \nURIOSTE Are you getting anything? \nDILLER   (sarcastic) Yeah, eyestrain.  What's with the lights? \nURIOSTE They're always like that.  Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to spares.  Wave that thing in the corner... \nDILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around.  The small screen registers nothing. \nDILLER The room's clean. \nURIOSTE Great. \nURIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the floor.  It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. Below it is what looks like a round metal plug.  Recessed into its surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on either side.  She turns the lever.  There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume of steam JETS out of the valve. \nURIOSTE (CONT'D) Give me a hand with this. \nGUTTIEREZ C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus. \nDE VRIES Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night. \nGUTTIEREZ starts to climb the ladder. \nDE VRIES What the hell are you doing? \nGUTTIEREZ Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself. \nDE VRIES runs her fingers through her hair in frustration.  Comes to a decision counter to what she wants to do... \nDE VRIES Wait a minute! \nGUTTIEREZ stops climbing. \nDE VRIES (CONT'D) Alright, okay.  Look... \nGUTTIEREZ What? \nDE VRIES I'll come with you. \nBREWSTER BARKS.  She drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties the leash around it. \nDE VRIES (CONT'D) But I'm going first... \nGUTTIEREZ Anything you say, Mammacitta. \nShe climbs around GUTTIEREZ and begins to ascend the ladder.  BREWSTER WHIMPERS and plaintively BARKS after them. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK \nThe rooftop is dark, mysterious.  Pieces of retrofitted junk can be seen in silhouette, edged in light from way below.  DE VRIES and GUTTIEREZ carefully step over the threshold.  They speak in WHISPERS. \nDE VRIES Careful of that edging there... \nGUTTIEREZ Yeah, I got it. \nAlthough we have an outstanding VIEW of the night lights of the base up here, the immediate gloom is impenetrable. \nDE VRIES Where's that flashlight? \nBy way of an answer, a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air.  DE VRIES takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground.  Circular extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom. \nDE VRIES (CONT'D) Still got him? \nGUTTIEREZ It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left. \nDE VRIES plays the flashlight across the rooftop. \nGUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) Little bit further... \nThe beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus.  A short- range antennae, about seven feet wide. \nGUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right there, right behind the antennae.  I think we're got it cornered... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nHIROKO bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with the roadway.  The broken grillework is melted outwards.  KAMEN and two other men - CALDWELL and THOMAS - stand behind. \nTHOMAS The door to the food storage locker was smashed open.  It must have come straight out of here. \nHIROKO yawns. \nHIROKO Alright.  Keep your eyes peeled. \nShe voices her concern to KAMEN. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) If it got out of the systems, it could be anywhere. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK \nIt's very quiet, and we can hear the NERVOUS BREATHING of GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES as they cautiously stalk forward. \nGUTTIEREZ Hold it, hold it... \nDE VRIES What's wrong? \nGUTTIEREZ I'm picking up another signal. \nDE VRIES looks around, unnerved. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM \nDILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch.  On the mechanism's side is a luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.  He pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from \"8\" to \"9.5\" as the cable feeds out. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT \nURIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls. Her feet almost tread water.  She's down as far as she can go. \nURIOSTE (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM \nURIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit. \nURIOSTE (CONT'D)  (O.S., muffled) That's enough. \nDILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.  The WHINE of the cable-feed stops immediately. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT \nURIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers. It's... just... about... in... reach... \nSix slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp like a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.  A sleek eyeless head follows, trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.  A SCREAM forms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps firmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM \nDILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.  He sees the winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an angler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening rate.  The digital counter flickers rapidly; \"11...11.5...12...12.5...13...\"  DILLER watches the tripod's tubular legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.  He scrambles for the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the shaft's edge.  DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by the colossal force from below.  He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.  Watches it disappear noisily into the conduit. \nDILLER Annie! \nDILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight. \nDILLER (CONT'D) Annie! \nHe feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness. \nWHAT HE SEES.  The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft walls towards him.  Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door. Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.  DILLER fumbles with the safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it back into the pit. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK \nGUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below. \nGUTTIEREZ The hell was that? \nPREDATOR-VISION. The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the platform below.  He watches the infra-red shapes of other people running towards the source of the shots... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM \nDILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER ALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.  He races across the threshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nIn a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow catwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead. DILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides with him. \nKAMEN Kev, wha...? \nDILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.  He looks as if he's about to say something, but never gets the chance. \nThere's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK \nPREDATOR-VISION. Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans... \nFrom the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.  She violently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that barges past them, launching itself from the rooftop. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nPARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed to his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam. \nPARSONS Oh my God... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nWith superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, splintering his skull and killing him instantly.  His body caromes into THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.  The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the ground.  The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people it's impossible to get a clean shot... \nHIROKO Move!  Get out of the way! \nHIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.  She flips off the safety on her rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger. It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying. CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.  It strikes like a snake. Once.  Twice.  The stinger punctures CALDWELL's chest and throat.  Nobody could survive something like that... \nThe ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.  The man's head is inches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth open...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike... \nTHOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.  He races towards GUTTIEREZ, with DE VRIES close behind... \nTHOMAS Catch this! \nFrom behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.  THOMAS heaves the rifle over the heads of the emerging ALIENS.  Although GUTTIEREZ snags it awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures. \nGUTTIEREZ Chew on this! \nDE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.  KAMEN glances down at this tracker's tiny screen.  It shows clusters of signals, lots of them. \nKAMEN   (hollering) They're all around, they're in the drainage system! \nDE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN. \nGUTTIEREZ Get your ass out of here, boss! \nALIENS are appearing everywhere.  From the overflow ducts; over the platform edges; along overhead cable supports.  Having taken on the genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid. All of them are living nightmares. \nHIROKO Oh my God... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS \nCASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her tiny bathroom-cubicle.  A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the corridor outside. \nCASSIE Shit. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK \nTHOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off.  As they race swiftly down the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.  A particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind them.  He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the outside of a module towards them. \nGUTTIEREZ De Vries! \nDE VRIES' head turns.  She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death throes. \nThe group round the corner of a building.  Across the street from them is parked KAMEN's crawler. \nGUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) Inside, inside! \nThey scramble up into the cab.  GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the driver's seat.  An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth. THOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign. \nTHOMAS Yo' momma, boneface! \nDE VRIES   (to Guttierez) C'mon, man; punch this cow! \nGUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.  They keys are there.  He flips them, and the engine GROWLS to life. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - DUSK \nPREDATOR-VISION. From way up here, we've got an outstanding view of the humans running across the platform... \nCrouching on a bright-yellow catwalk, BROKEN TUSK presses closed a panel on the small container balanced on his knee.  Inside it are rows of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them. BROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.  Satisfied, he clips the medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet. \nStanding around him are several other PREDATORS.  All but one have their camouflage cloaks activated.  The SOUND of GUNFIRE way across the station draws their attention... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nHIROKO and KAMEN bolt towards an external hatch, with KAMEN laying down a field of covering fire on full-automatic.  The blaze of light from the rifle's barrel abruptly stops. \nHIROKO What? \nKAMEN I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside! \nHIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby.  A field of cows being slaughtered by machetes would sound like this. \nHIROKO They're in with the rhino! \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK \nAn ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen, broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino.  It's yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature. \nALIEN stingers slice through the air.  Rhinos try to bolt but are intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces.  It's wholesale carnage. \nPREDATOR-VISION. We're moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below, lessening the distance with each second... \nSeveral indefinable FIGURES plunge into the fray, creating anarchy within the ALIENS' ranks.  The biomechanoids HISS with fury as the PREDATORS join battle against them... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nAn ALIEN hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawler's roof. \nINT.  CRAWLER - DUSK \nGUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic microswitches on the headset with his fingernails. \nGUTTIEREZ What? \nTHOMAS We've got company! \nTHOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger.  He gets off one shot, then nothing more happens.  He looks at the counter on the side.  It reads 'zero'. \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) Shit, I'm dry!  You're up! \nDE VRIES raises her rifle.  She aims, and... \nCLICK. \nDE VRIES I'm jammed! \nTHOMAS You're what?! \nShe works the manual slide. \nDE VRIES It's locked solid... \nTHOMAS Quick, give me the clip! \nDE VRIES fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle.  It falls from her hands onto a plastic overflow grate.  THOMAS leaps after it...about a second too late.  It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good. \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) Oh, Lord!  Please, no!  Not now! \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE \nHIROKO enters her office at a run.  She crosses to an inset control box on the far wall and presses a button.  Two exterior panels begin to slide closed behind the polycarbonate window. \nKERSMASH!  Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.  In shock, HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away. She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge outside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously raining repeated blows on the window with it's tail. \nThe ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the onslaught, showering splinters across the room.  The twin shutters secure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.  It HISSES in indignation and thrashes about.  Like a lizard, the segmented tail SNAPS in two.  The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining balance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden floorboards.  It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an unstoppable killing machine... \nHIROKO Holo on! \nHer VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the computer can recognize it.  FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.  The ALIEN halts, confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them. \nGaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.  The ALIEN locks in on this sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.  HIROKO GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength... \nShe's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does the job.  It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.  HIROKO beats a hasty retreat as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged weapon... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS \nHIROKO reels into the outside corridor.  She SHRIEKS as her shoulders are seized from behind... \nKAMEN Come on! \nHIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor. \nHIROKO That's the wrong way! \nKAMEN Detour.  Other way's blocked... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK \nBack outside, the ALIENS have sensed that something's amiss.  DE VRIES turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ. \nDE VRIES You got any slugs left? \nGUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon. \nGUTTIEREZ Yeah.  Uh... \nDE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder.  GUTTIEREZ completes his sentence. \nGUTTIEREZ (CONT'D) ...Seven. \nBLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  DE VRIES tries to make each shot count.  She sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires... \nA molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity into a blazing inferno.  The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, remaining immobile as it hits the deck.  A curtain of fire ripples across the platform... \nTHOMAS Yes! \nTheir victory is short-lived.  The other ALIENS crawl cautiously forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.  We can clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws. \nDE VRIES Try again, man... \nThe headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct channel. He YELLS into it... \nYORK Hurry up, we're losing it! \nCASSIE's eyes widen in terror... \nCASSIE Behind you! \nHIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge momentarily from out of the foam.  Something yanks at KAMEN and he disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise... \nHIROKO Kamen! \nHIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags her away. \nCASSIE It's too late! \nHIROKO Nooooo! \nThe chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself... \nYORK It's going! \nWith a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap.  YORK vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK \nThe battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.  There's only three of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK. \nA projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in flight into a wire capture net.  Barbed tips on each corner bite into the wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.  Small motors WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body... \nThe PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too long. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.  The shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and CLATTERS to the floor. \nThe PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his wrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but gets no further.  An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.  The PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight through the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer in the process. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nHIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed disbelief. \nPARSONS Miss Noguchi? \nNo reaction.  He tries again. \nPARSONS (CONT'D) Miss Noguchi! \nHIROKO snaps out of it.  She crosses over to the bank of monitoring screens. \nHIROKO What's the story? \nPARSONS runs through each of the screens. \nPARSONS Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate. \nHIROKO How many... how many people are missing? \nCASSIE Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place. \nHIROKO What's our weapons situation? \nDRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly. \nDRISCOLL Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it. \nHIROKO Auto-shop? \nCASSIE Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off. \nHIROKO Has anybody talked to them? \nCASSIE Not yet. \nHIROKO Do it. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK \nBROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a bid to escape their unstoppable opponents.  Back-to-back, they take up fighting positions.  A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS arrives. \nBoth the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley. Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's hand-to-hand...and nothing else. \nIt's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides.  BROKEN TUSK takes flight; his companion is not as lucky.  The other PREDATOR kicks an ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.  The ALIEN lashes out with lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.  Both creatures hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of the modules.  Caught like flies in a spider's web.  Both thrash about, severing cables as they do.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the air... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nEverything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and the bank of monitors turn to static.  There's an instant of silence collective concerns amongst those gathered there. \nMATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.  Everybody's eyes are on him. \nMATT Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.  That way we could put a bit of distance... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nMATT (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers) ...Between us and the station.  Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell arrive. \nHIROKO That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here? \nDRISCOLL Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running. \nHIROKO Which mean physically going outside. \nDRISCOLL looks around uneasily. \nDRISCOLL Yeah. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK \nA small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor. HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.  Across her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.  She nods at a pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands. \nHIROKO Is this the suit? \nDRISCOLL Uh-huh. \nShe takes it from him.  Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls it up.  YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his face. \nYORK This is fuckin' lunacy!  You're not gonna make it across the platform on foot! \nCASSIE Shut up, York. \nHIROKO No, he's right.  Has anyone got a bike near here? \nA REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice. \nREDHEADED GIRL I have. \nHIROKO Let me have the keys. \nThe GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.  HIROKO puts them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Which one is it? \nREDHEADED GIRL Uh... the Hyundai racer.  Yellow and black stripes. \nYORK Oh, yeah.  Real inconspicuous... \nHIROKO Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it gets me there in one piece.  Somebody loan me a headset. \nCASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.  DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO fasten up the suit.  He spots a mistake. \nDRISCOLL No, go back.  Second clasp from the bottom. \nHIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it. \nHIROKO How much air-time have I got? \nCASSIE About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery. \nHIROKO Deal. \nCASSIE We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go. \nDRISCOLL Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display. \nHIROKO Sounds great. \nPARSONS It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind. \nHIROKO What?  Why? \nDRISCOLL We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick. \nHIROKO How tight are these shafts? \nCASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks. \nCASSIE Tight.  We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running into any Aliens. \nHIROKO takes a deep breath.  Beads of perspiration dot her forehead. PARSONS nods. \nThe heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned over the hole.  YORK shakes his head. \nYORK Suicide run, man.  Fuckin' suicide run. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT \nCASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct.  It's only about half- again as wide as HIROKO.  The only illumination comes from the hazy circle above.  As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone. \nSomething flickers.  Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the murk with a faint orange haze. \nCASSIE   (O.S. on speakers) All the comforts of home. \nHIROKO Thanks, Cassie. \nCASSIE   (O.S., on speakers) Don't mention it. \nShe inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is overwhelming in the  silence... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ANTENNA ARRAY - NIGHT \nThe station's massive antenna array is being transformed.  Otherworldly shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to cover it's surface.  ALIENS drop from dizzying heights, exuding streams of gelatinous gunk from the four 'exhaust' pipes on their backs. They're building a nest of staggering proportions. \nUnnoticed by the busy biomechanoids, faint sparks flicker from the crane catwalk high above... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT \nBROKEN TUSK sits on the catwalk floor, a small shower of sparks lighting his face.  He's attempting to repair his broken wrist computer with an intricate tool.  He removes it and presses a switch.  The display glows briefly, then fades.  He inserts it again.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE across the computer's fascia, before burning out. BROKEN TUSK throws the ruined machine away in disgust. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP \nFrom our P.O.V. high up near the roof of the auto-shop we see THOMAS sitting on the raised hydraulic platform.  He GRUNTS as he pulls a valve on the crawler's underside. \nAcross the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.  One of the GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on. \nGREASE MONKEY Okay.  Back.  Back.  Little bit more... \nHe steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing. \nGREASE MONKEY (CONT'D) Whoa...shit! \nThe man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the floor. Scowls first, then frowns.  It's sticky. \nOver near the doors, MATT exhales deeply on a cigarette.  DE VRIES is nearby, listening attentively as GUTTIEREZ gets a message on his helmet. \nGUTTIEREZ She just set off! \nMATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's attention. \nMATT Okay, people.  Let's hustle... \nThere's a SCREAM from behind.  They wheel around in time to see the GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening.  THOMAS yells down from the platform. \nTHOMAS They're comin' up through the pit! \nA box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the ceiling on the end of a cable.  MATT forces down the red control, making the platform lower.  Several tons of machinery and crawler bring about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens. \nAn ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the nearby shadows.  DE VRIES sights it. \nDE VRIES Over there! \nOne of the MEN has seen it.  His head snaps up to a mammoth engine- block suspended from a winch high above.  He LEAPS for the release- catch as the ALIEN passes underneath.  Pulls hard on the grip.  Chains RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.  The ALIEN begins to look up, just a second too late.  The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into the creature, flattening it instantly. \nUnseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the platform-bound crawler.  It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.  The LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets THOMAS' attention. \nTHOMAS Mother-fucker! \nTHOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.  The ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.  The ALIEN discards the body and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up. \nThe blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.  Something happens to the PITCH of the blade, a peculiar sound... \nThe acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.  Like a metallic snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame. \nStraight at THOMAS. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT \nHIROKO elbows her way further through the cramped water-filled duct.  A wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway. \nHIROKO'S P.O.V.  Green neon flashes in her display, with accompanying notations. \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) Progress to secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven impeded. Grating must be removed to facilitate entry... \nCASSIE I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up. \nPARSONS Keep trying! \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER \nBEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.  The signals pick-up speed the closer they get. CASSIE's garbled VOICE isn't helping ease HIROKO's panic.  She looks wildly around the chamber.  The only way out the way she came in... \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate access to... \nHIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control.  The COMPUTER VOICE ceases, while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume. Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her... \nHIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct.  It's position makes it virtually impossible to get back into.  She tries anyhow. \nBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!  A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber, flattening her against the wall.  DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other side of the grille like express trains in the night...going away from HIROKO.  She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor screen recede and finally disappear.  The tracker's pitch returns to it's hollow CLICKING. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nBROKEN TUSK tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through the aftermath of the battle down by the now-empty rhino pen.  He finds something. A PREDATOR face-mask, with a massive crack down one side. He turns it carefully over in his hands. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR \nHIROKO emerges from the water, a thin membrane of surface slime adhering to her helmet.  Blinded, she raises a gloved hand and wipes the mucus away... \nHIROKO'S P.O.V. She's inside the Central Reservoir, a long cylindrical concrete tunnel some eighteen feet in diameter.  The water-level comes up about half- way.  What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion... \nShe's found the main offshoot of the ALIENS' nest.  Glued into the curved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.  HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS. Other ANIMALS.  Most are dead, their innards blown open.  The rest are comatose, twitching occasionally.  Every square inch not containing bodies is filled with ALIEN EGGS.  It's like Hell for real. \nHIROKO reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout. \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) ...Brrzzt.  Traversing Central Reservoir en route to platform venturi dust DS two-six. \nHIROKO's P.O.V. She looks around and finds the exit point on the display. It's several feet away.  Under the surface.  She wades swiftly through the water, passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause.  A large PULSATING BAG, about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape.  It might be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell. \nHIROKO submerges.  Sure enough, there's the grille.  She raises the power-tool and starts extracting the bolts.  BZZZZ!  There's the first one, no problem.  BZZZZ...BZZZZ!  The second and third are just as easy.  She goes for the fourth.  BZZZ...CHUNK.  Nothing happens. \nHIROKO Come on... \nShe bears down on the trigger again.  The motor's not running.  A tiny green LED flashes on the machine's side.  It's locked solid.  A malfunction. \nCOMPUTER VOICE  (O.S., on speakers) Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate access to  venturi ducts. \nThere's only one recourse left to her.  She jams down the thumb button... \nKER-SLAM!  The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface.  She wipes the slime from her helmet yet again... \n...And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in four neat sections.  The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate... \n...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself back toward her.  It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.  HIROKO raises the power-tool, reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.  Fat rivets RIP through the FACEHUGGER's body.  It writhes around on the water's surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.  HIROKO dives into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt. \nBZZZZ!  It's out!  She levers-off the grille.  Forces herself into the confined space beyond... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT \nAnother poorly-lit shaft filled with murky water, though this one goes upwards on a diagonal slope.  HIROKO braces herself against the walls and begins to climb. \nCOMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speaker) Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface. \nWHAM!  An ALIEN's head squeezes through the opening behind her.  It's claw snakes in, groping blindly just inches from her feet.  She grits her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent. \nWALLPO!  It's hand closes around her leg, yanking her back.  She tries frantically to gain purchase on anything.  She fails.  The ALIEN draws her nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.  Fracture lines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.  Polluted water starts to flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass. \nHIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger. Rivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.  A haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.  HIROKO pushes upward, coughing.  She closes her fist around a lever above.  Pulls on it with all her might. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nInternal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork. It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK.  HIROKO hauls herself from the shaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.  She throws the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.  Yanks desperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment off. \nAs promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.  HIROKO starts towards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the ruined pressure-suit.  She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through the smoking pile of cloth.  Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws the keys. \nSLAP!  A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.  HIROKO scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.  She tears across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.  The turbines ROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.  HIROKO pivots the powerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp. Losing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck. \nHIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.  The fire over by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and- orange smoke rising into the air. \nA DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.  Yet another ALIEN.  It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the hoverbike, gaining balance in an instant. \nHIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see- sawing the bike side-to-side.  The ALIEN's got a firm hold though, crawling hand-over-hand towards her.  HIROKO releases her grip on both throttles simultaneously.  Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a halt.  The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the surrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls it back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the leading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising creature, neatly decapitating it. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT \nThe hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.  HIROKO dismounts and draws her pistol.  Takes in the sheer height of the ladder she's going to have to scale.  Thumbs her headset. \nHIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on headset) Two... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT \nHIROKO blinks as the sweat drains into her eyes. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) One...mark! \nShe stabs the drive switch. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE - NIGHT \nSmoothly maintained engineering comes to life.  The enormous yellow crane starts to move on it's track-rails. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT \nThe control board monitor is suddenly awash with information and schematics... \nHIROKO Okay, I'm out of here! \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nPARSONS Blow those suckers, Driscoll! \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL \nDRISCOLL raises a black device shaped like a cylinder with a handgrip on the end.  Slots it into the mechanism beneath the flap and carefully turns it.  A tiny red LED comes on. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER MODULE \nComplex mechanical assemblies attach the module to it's supporting pier-platforms.  There are a number of LOUD BANGS, similar to car engines misfiring.  Explosive bolts release the tethers. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL \nDRISCOLL reports into his headset. \nDRISCOLL Bolts blown! \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT \nHIROKO runs back across the catwalk.  She might have missed the PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.  Her foot comes down on it and she slips.  The gun goes flying from her hand.  HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for a moment... \nHIROKO No! \n...Then goes over.  She drops to all fours and peers over the side. Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.  She reaches out for it... \nINT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB \nGUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.  The head-up display projected on the cab windscreen changes from 'NEUTRAL' to 'DRIVE'. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT \nThe two crawlers TEAR OUT of the auto-shop's opening doors, headlights blazing. \nINT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT \nGUTTIEREZ braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards the ditched crawler they left outside auto-shop earlier. \nGUTTIEREZ Shit! \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT \nKER-SMASM!  GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway and through the platform safety barrier.  It balances precariously for a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE. \nINT.  SECOND CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT \nMATT Yee-haa!  Demolition derby, baby! \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT \nHolding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the gigantic crane moving against the night sky. \nPREDATOR VISION. Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk. \nThe sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN TUSK's attention. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT \nHIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.  She brushes the barrel. Not good enough.  Tries again.  Success!  Her fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nShe races across to the rail and gazes downward. \nHIROKO'S P.O.V. The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see. HIROKO looks around the platform.  She's suddenly very alone. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Shit! \nShe crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT \nHIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.  BROKEN TUSK has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform piers, running directly out into the swamp.  Most of the drain is underwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water. The thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.  Broken from within. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) You've got to be joking.  No way am I going back in there! \nNo joke.  BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Hey! \nBROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.  He gives her a look, then disappears into the blackness.  HIROKO looks around.  It's no fun being the last person left alive here. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Goddammit! \nShe takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows... \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT \nHIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.  She shivers. It's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.  Several of the maintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal. \nHIROKO (CONT'D)   (quietly) Wha...? \nBROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.  She gets the message. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR \nThey exit the culvert through another smashed grate.  HIROKO finds herself back in the Central Reservoir again.  She wades through the water behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.  The two of them look very vulnerable in here.  They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC HIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.  An INSIDIOUS PULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they travel. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER \nThey come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by an enormous pump.  ALIEN gunk covers everything. \nHIROKO gasps.  High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast mechanism.  It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around it. She seems to be asleep. \nBROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.  His eyes are searching the multitude of forms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.  He finds what he's looking for.  Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.  Dead.  It's stomach blown open. \nHIROKO holds her spear tightly.  FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped around several trapped victims.  A number of empty EGGS are scattered here-and-there. \nBROKEN TUSK looks around.  No ALIENS.  He begins climbing the organic fresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.  The bellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.  He reaches the entrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of secreted resin.  BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates it. \nThe SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.  She glances up at the QUEEN. It's breathing start to change, and it's head moves... \nBROKEN TUSK sees it too.  He hesitates for a moment.  The QUEEN settles, and her breathing goes back to normal.  BROKEN TUSK resumes his work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.  He sheathes the 'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.  He withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to work... \nDOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.  She doesn't see the arm coated in slime that grasps at her hair.  She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.  Her eyes are wide as she turns... \nIt's KAMEN.  He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.  When he speaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering. \nKAMEN Hiroko... \nHIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE. \nUP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.  He slides the tip of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.  It's readout display illuminates with alien characters.  He activates a button, and the readout begins to blink... \nBELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO. \nKAMEN (CONT'D) They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next. \nHIROKO What can I do? \nKAMEN I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me. \nHIROKO I... I can't! \nKAMEN You have to... \nHIROKO No! \nBROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.  He raises his right arm. SCHNICK! The wrist knives slice outwards.  Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR \nBROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.  An ALIEN EGG on a nearby wall PEELS OPEN.  Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to spring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting through the EGG and it's writhing contents. \n", "test1_input": "INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nWith nothing to do, most of the screens are out and the remaining personnel bored.  PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the console, uninterested in HIROKO and KAMEN's conversation nearby. \nHIROKO I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder. \nKAMEN Agreed. \nHIROKO When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit. \nKAMEN Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now. \nHIROKO What do you mean? \nURIOSTE walks up, very serious.  She interrupts. \nURIOSTE Sorry.  Can I have a word? \nHIROKO Sure.  What's up? \nURIOSTE Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago.  The algae must have clogged up an intake duct. \nKAMEN Think I spoke too soon... \nHIROKO Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference? \nURIOSTE I reckon it'll be another day before the smell gets unbearable. Beauvais usually fixes it, but... ah... \nHIROKO knows what she means.  BEAUVAIS is dead. \nHIROKO Can you handle it? \nURIOSTE Sure, I can manage.  But I'm not going into the Pit on my own. \nHIROKO   (to Urioste) Alright, get somebody from the auto-shop.   (to Kamen)   Is that alright? \nKAMEN Yeah, no problem.  Ask Diller, he's good with his hands. \nURIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE. \nCASSIE I'll go along with that. \nA SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up to answer. \nPARSONS Parsons.   (long beat)   Yeah.  Hold on. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY \nA CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.  DOC REVNA's shining a hand- held light into ACKLAND's face.  ACKLAND's regained consciousness, but is far from happy.  He's sitting on the edge of a cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical equipment.  The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting blades and surgical paraphernalia. \nACKLAND Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.  Really. \nREVNA flicks off the probe. \nREVNA Headache?  Dehydration? \nACKLAND The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack. \nREVNA Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run. \nREVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN. \nREVNA (CONT'D) He's broken a fever that would kill a mule, but if he says he's alright I'm prepared to believe him.  He's all yours. \nHIROKO enters.  She watches from behind KAMEN. \nKAMEN What happened out there, Ack? \nACKLAND   (consternated) What do you mean, 'what happened'?  What am I doing back here?  Where's York? \nHIROKO   (insistent) What's the last thing you can remember? \nACKLAND thinks hard. \nACKLAND We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's. \nHIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances. \nHIROKO A meteor? \nACKLAND Yeah, it impacted really off.  We went out to the crash-site... and... uh... that's... that's all. \n", "test1_true": "ACKLAND No. \nKAMEN turns to REVNA. \nKAMEN Show him 'Fido'. \nREVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack.  She hands it to ACKLAND.  He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside with morbid fascination. \nREVNA Ring any bells? \nACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard on his mind. \nACKLAND Not really, no.  Ugly little sonuvabitch. What is it? \nKAMEN We thought you might be able to tell us. I found it by your cot at the camp.  You were out cold. \nACKLAND What did York say? \nHIROKO York's vanished. \nACKLAND Vanished? \nHIROKO Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland.  York's gone awol, unless you can help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime suspect right now. \nThe news hits ACKLAND hard.  He falters and leans back, addressing REVNA. \nACKLAND Can I... um... have some water?  Please? \nREVNA Sure. \nShe goes to fetch a cup. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMISSARY \nIt's lunchtime, and the SOUND of machinery STEAMING food mixes with the CHATTER of the twenty-or-so personnel eating there.  HIROKO and KAMEN are deep in conversation across a table. \nKAMEN Do you believe him? \nHIROKO Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here. \nKAMEN stares hard at her.  That's not much of an answer, and HIROKO knows it. She capitulates. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Alright then, For what it's worth... yes, I do. \nKAMEN digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork. \nKAMEN You should try this seasoned stuff.  It's good. \nGUTTIEREZ approaches the table carrying something. \nGUTTIEREZ Got a present for you. \nHe hands HIROKO's leather jacket over to her. \nHIROKO Oh, I've been looking for this!  Where was it? \nGUTTIEREZ You left it in the chopper.  Oh, and before I forget, Don?  I ran that test you wanted on the turbines. \nKAMEN And...? \nGUTTIEREZ And, nothing.  They checked out just fine. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON \nA metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform.  DILLER leans against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly blowing rings into the air.  BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to quietly SNARL.  DILLER glances down at her curiously. \nDILLER What's the matter, girl?  You smell something? \nNow the rhino are restless too.  CASSIE walks across the concrete roadway to join them. \nCASSIE Rhinos look a little antsy, \nBREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING. \nDILLER Yeah.  Never seem 'em act like this before. \nPREDATOR-VISION. CASSIE and DILLER are 'warm', but the rhinos are BREWSTER are 'hotter' still.  Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of unrecognizability, eerily distorted. \nCASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND. \nCASSIE Do you hear that? \n", "test1_id": 1236, "test2_input": "GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's cab. \nEXT.

The relief on HIROKO's face is enormous. \nHIROKO No 'buts'.  Just do it.  Noguchi out. \nINT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nGUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control fascia pointing out-back.  DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides into the rear.  She flicks on an overhead light.  Taped to one side is a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder. \nDE VRIES Nice buns... \nShe gives the control board a cursory once-over.  GUTTIEREZ calls back from his vantage point at the doorway. \nGUTTIEREZ Can you handle it? \nDE VRIES powers-up the console. \nDE VRIES Piece of cake. \nEXT.

It's head turn towards her.  HIROKO starts to raise her pistol... then stops.  Other ALIENS are descending the nearby navigation tower... straight for her. \nHIROKO turns tail.  She races over to a ladder running up the side of a building and begins to climb. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nThe shadow of the crane and it's cargo falls over Big Bertha's rear flatbed. Flashing warning strobes illuminate the twin hydraulic arms which rise up to meet it. \nINT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nDE VRIES twists on the 'waldo' controls operating the manipulator hands. \nEXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT \nALIENS rise up out of the swamp below, and start to scale Bertha's balloon tires. \nINT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nGUTTIEREZ fires a barrage down at the oncoming creatures.  He HOLLERS back to DE VRIES. \nGUTTIEREZ Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones! \nDE VRIES Couple more seconds! \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT \nHIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like a pack of dogs.  She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with ease. So do the ALIENS. \nShe cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the main street, trying not to lose her footing.  Just before reaching the other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.  Her headset drops thirty feet onto the concrete roadway.  Her hand rests on something red.  It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to the building.  She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch. Glances up.  The ALIENS are already starting across.  She pulls the primer cylinder out by it's handle.  Jams it into the detonator, and turns... \n", "test2_true": "She races across the building's roof.  Reaches the other side...straight into a dead end. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nThe admin module locks onto Bertha's manipulator arms with a satisfying CLUNK.  Autocouplers slot into place, and the crane releases it's load. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER \nThe connecting jolt is even greater then before.  Several larger objects CRASH to the deck. \nINT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nDE VRIES That's it!  We've got it!  Get us out of here. \nGUTTIEREZ looses one last volley at the ALIENS.  He pulls the cab door shut, and throws himself into the driver's seat. \nGUTTIEREZ C'mon sweetheart.  Do your stuff... \nEXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT \nBertha's wheels GRIND to life, spilling ALIENS and crushing them under it's treads... \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT \nHIROKO's P.O.V.  It's a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete, with no ladders or any other way down.  She looks desperately around for another avenue of escape. \nThe leering face of an ALIEN comes up over the roof's edge.  HIROKO swings her pistol over and fires.  It falls away...only to be replaced seconds later by two others. \nHer gun goes dry.  Quick as a flash, she ejects the spent magazine. She slaps the spare in and continues firing. \nINT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT \nBig Bertha's heading away from the base into the surrounding trees. GUTTIEREZ grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches. \nGUTTIEREZ Get down! \nDE VRIES hits the floor.  The thick boughs impact with the cab, SHATTERING the safety glass. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT \nBANG!  BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  CLICK.  HIROKO's gun's empty.  She reaches for another clip on her bandolier...then realises that was her last one. \nThe encircling ALIENS HISS triumphantly and close in.  With no place to go, and no means of defending herself, HIROKO's a goner.  The lead ALIEN's lethal double-barrel teeth open.  It's almost on her.  HIROKO CRIES OUT... \nWHOOSH!  The ALIEN's face is severed in half.  A circular metal object blurs through the air and loops back on itself, almost faster then the human eye can follow.  A massive form SLAMS down in front of HIROKO, pushing her out of the way.  She hits the deck hard and gasps.  BROKEN TUSK is standing before her.  He skillfully catches the frisbee-like 'smart weapon', then throws it again. \nHIROKO watches with awe as the PREDATOR joins battle against the ALIENS. HISSING ALIEN jaws are silenced by BROKEN TUSK's formidable fighting  technique.  Questing limbs are BLASTED and HACKED away by advanced PREDATOR weaponry.  Acidic blood flows freely.  The skirmish is surprisingly brief. \nBROKEN TUSK and HIROKO stare at one another.  BROKEN TUSK pulls a slung metal rod from his shoulder.  Two barbed tips SCHNICK outwards, forming a spear. The PREDATOR looks at her, and his lip curls.  It takes a second for HIROKO to realise he's offering it to her.  Bewildered, she accepts it, pulling herself up. \nA bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind, getting both of their attentions.  BROKEN TUSK regards her.  His mandibles CLICK-CLACK nervously... \nHIROKO Look.  Don't take this the wrong way, but when I imagined the cavalry coming to my rescue... they never looked like you. \nThe PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT \nAnother gout of flame BELCHES out of the churning mass in the middle of the station. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT \nHIROKO turns her recovered headset over in her hands. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Broken.  Useless! \nShe throws it aside.  BROKEN TUSK stands beside her, keeping guard. Another DETONATION goes off behind, even LOUDER. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Jesus.  I.C.C.'re gonna have to close the book on this place. \nShe SLAPS BROKEN TUSK on the arm. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Come on, Butch.  Let's go. \nShe begins to walk away.  BROKEN TUSK crosses to the safety barrier, peering over the side... \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Hey!  I said come on! \nThe PREDATOR turns a deaf ear to her.  He gauges the distance below, then throws himself off the platform's edge. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) What...? \n", "test2_id": 1237, "test3_input": "BROKEN TUSK SMASHES his foot hard into the face of an ALIEN.  A BLAST of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer.  He turns... \nHIROKO's heli-jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the tower, the door on the co-pilot's side flapping open.  She HOLLERS at the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines. \nHIROKO C'mon!  Jump! \nBROKEN TUSK looks down.  It's a long drop...but it's the best option available to him.  He jumps. \nTHWACK!  His hands grip the door frame.  The heli-jet wobbles slightly, it's center of gravity shifting.  BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and through the door as... \n...KER-BLAM!  A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the storage tanks below ignite.  The shock wave buffets the chopper against the tower. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nBROKEN TUSK's P.O.V. The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli- jet is propelled towards the metal structure. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN \nCRUNCH!  The chopper hits, knocking several ALIENS from their handholds.  One of the QUEEN's arms SHOOTS OUT, wrapping itself around the port engine mount. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nHIROKO pushes on the stick.  The heli-jet pulls away...then tilts violently to one side, engines desperately trying to compensate. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN \nThe QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft, it's weight drawing it slowly down.  In the BACKGROUND, the Navigation Tower begins to slowly collapse. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nHIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls. \nHIROKO Shit! \nBROKEN TUSK turns towards her. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) In the back!  In the back! \nThe PREDATOR may not understand her words, but he can follow the frantic jerking of her hand.  He twists around to look in the chopper's rear. \nEXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN \nHIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the station's storage tanks.  The conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand. \nEXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nThe QUEEN is starting to struggle up, it's arms flailing for purchase. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nBROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear.  He quickly takes stock of it. \nHIROKO Watch your shots!  If you hit the engine you'll blow us both to hell! \nBROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger.  His index finger won't slide into the trigger guard...it's too big!  He takes the guard in both hands and exerts pressure.  SNAP.  Problem solved. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER \nBLEEP!  There's only one set of digits left on the destruct device's display counter. \nEXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nA red dot of light runs across the QUEEN's head.  She must sense it somehow. Her head comes round to bear... \nBROKEN TUSK's got the pulse-rifle trained right on her. \nBROKEN TUSK Chew...on...this...! \nBLAM!  A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head.  She YOWLS. BLAM! A second round does the job.  The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below. \nINT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER \nThe last segment of the destruct mechanism's display disappears.  We hear a \nHIGH-PITCHED TONE. \nINT.

LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - PRE-DAWN \nBig Bertha's parked by the blinking blue beacon tower, site of the ill- fated hunting expedition.  About a dozen or so people are milling around, smoking cigarettes or talking. \nMATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATT's crawler. They feel the concussive shock-wave, and look upward. \nTheir P.O.V. Above the treetops, a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon... \nMATT Holy shit! \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nGauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the turbulence out. \nEXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nA chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the chopper's starboard engine.  There's a BURST of flame, then the extinguishers cut in. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nThe heli-jet's bucking like a bronco now, and they're losing height rapidly. \nHIROKO We've lost the starboard engine!  We're going down!  Hold on! \nEXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nThe chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nHIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls. The glass cracks with the impact. \nHIROKO'S P.O.V. Leaves, twigs, and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through the canopy of foliage. \nEXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN \nThe heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH, spraying mud all around. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nThe canopy implodes.  A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit, spraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin.  She SCREAMS. \nEXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN \nThe chopper comes to rest in the swamp.  The SQUAWKING of the local WILDLIFE O.S. gradually dies down. \nINT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN \nHIROKO moves her head, and GROANS.  There's a nasty gash across her forehead. She turns to BROKEN TUSK.  The door frame on his side is buckled and twisted. Part of the metal has sheared off, it's sharp end impaling him through the shoulder.  The PREDATOR coughs luminous green blood. \nHIROKO We've gotta get you out of here. \nEXT.  SWAMP - DAWN \nThe sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to the other side.  She manages to get the mangled door open.  BROKEN TUSK's wound looks even worse up-close. \nHIROKO (CONT'D) Hold on.  This is gonna hurt some. \nHIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSK's shoulder.  The PREDATOR braces himself, and starts to move.  The agony is excruciating; his mandibles open and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR. \nHIROKO helps him out of the seat.  The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his feet. What happens next is totally unexpected. \nBROKEN TUSK's throat BURSTS, fountaining green blood.  Shocked, HIROKO gets out of the path of the PREDATOR's tumbling mass.  She looks up. \nThe ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts it's sledgehammer tongue, it's head following her movements. \nThe PREDATOR's 'smart' weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying blade-down in the mire.  HIROKO scoops up, activating it and scrambling away.  She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her. \nThe ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet, and the two opponents face each other like sumo wrestlers.  HIROKO assumes a defensive stance, holding the disc ready to strike.  The ALIEN hisses, it's tail stinger coming around. It leaps for her, and battle is joined.  The ALIEN lashes out, but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and time again.  With each thrust, surgically thin wounds open up on the biomechanoid's body.  One of the ALIEN's attacks sends her reeling to the floor, it's stinger arching towards her.  She parries, slicing the tail in half and struggling to her feet. \nThe ALIEN strikes again.  HIROKO feints, then thrusts, lopping off one of it's hands.  The ALIEN HOWLS with pain, blinding lashing out at her and sending the 'smart' weapon flying from her grip. \nShe's lost, and the creature knows it.  It's lips curl into a SNARL. \nKER-POW!  KER-POW!  The ALIEN's head DETONATES, and it's skeletal body slumps forward to SPLASH into the swamp...revealing BROKEN TUSK pointing the pulse rifle. \nThe dying PREDATOR GURGLES, his head drooping.  HIROKO stumbles across to him.  BROKEN TUSK's in a bad way, green gore is pulsing freely from it's throat.  It gazes up at HIROKO. \nBROKEN TUSK Not...a pretty...sight... \nAnd with that, the PREDATOR dies. \n", "test3_id": 1238}

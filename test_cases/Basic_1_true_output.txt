EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO 
Row upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at attention. Their first day of boot camp. 
DUNBAR (V.O.) First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge hated him from the beginning. 
A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines. 
Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST. 
WEST You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me - give me a sir, yes, sir!

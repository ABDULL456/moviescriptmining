JACK Is Ali here? 
MARK Just left. Mark continues down. Jack whips around, looks at him, then up at Sean, who nods. 
JACK Where'd she go? 
SEAN With Marcus. 
JACK What? 
SEAN I told you, opportunity doesn't knock forever. Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs. Sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside. Then pauses, noticing: Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out: 
SEAN (CONT'D) Hey! You! 
MARK 
(LOOKS UP) It's Mark. 
SEAN Mark. You wanna have breakfast? Off Mark's smile: 
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Ali follows Marcus through the kitchen, to the fridge. 
MARCUS My mother always said there's only one thing to do when you're feeling blue... He opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of CHAMPAGNE. 
ALI She was a poet. 
MARCUS And a drunk. Ali smiles. Marcus pops the cork, fills two glasses, hands her one. Clinks. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) To your new place. 
ALI What new place? 
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY 
A lavish, 1000-square-foot guest house. Marcus ushers Ali in. 
MARCUS All yours. (off her look) Unpack. Move in. 
ALI Marcus, I can't just-- 
MARCUS Sure you can. Marcus plops her suitcase on the bed. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) Unpack. You're home. 
ALI It's not even on the bus route. 
MARCUS Okay, that is the first and last time the term "bus route" will be spoken in this house. (motions out window) Four cars. Which do you want? 
EXT. MARCUS'S GAZEBO - SUNSET 
Ali lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of L.A. against a fiery red sky. Marcus comes out of the house, with a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise. Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes. 
MARCUS Better? 
ALI 
(SMILES) Better. She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level. 
MARCUS You're gonna be on one of those someday. 
ALI Yeah, right. 
MARCUS Sooner than you think, too. Harold Saint called me today. You made quite an impression on him. 
ALI Really? What'd he say? 
MARCUS He wants to make a demo with you. 
ALI Are you serious? When?? 
MARCUS He found a little studio time on Tuesday. 
ALI This Tuesday? 
MARCUS Too soon? 
ALI No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing. You're amazing. 
MARCUS I like making you happy. Your whole face lights up. Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face. 
ALI I think you're way too nice to me. 
MARCUS And that's a problem because... 
ALI I've had a lot to drink. And my judgment is off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable. 
MARCUS Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means I'd never kiss a lady when she's... vulnerable.

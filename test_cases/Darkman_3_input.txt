WHITE. from the light pouring out the passing train windows. 
TRAIN WHEELS throw blue sparks into the darkness. 
LOW ANGLE The long subway train rolls into the distance. It's rumble fades. Quiet. Durant's cigar smoulders on the tracks. 
331 DURANT HIMSELF rises quietly into frame. His suit is still clean. He appears remarkably unscathed. He runs a hand through his hair, turns and walks slowly along the tracks. That's when we see his back: the train has raked off the fabric of his suit and pants, exposing bare back and buttocks. Somehow maintaining his dignity, Durant picks up the smouldering cigar from the tracks. He takes a puff and moves off. 
CUT TO: 
332 INT. WAREHOUSE 
Darkman sits with the phone faintly ringing against his ear. Something frantic about him, the vein in his fore- head, faintly beating. While he waits for the other party to answer, he cuts into the painless wound on his arm with a surgical instrument, digging for something . Finally Julie's voice comes on: 
DARKMAN 
JULIE We cut from Darkman's ravaged monster-face to: 
333 JULIE beautiful as ever. 
JULIE -- Peyton! Where have you been? Why haven't you called? 
334 Back to the monster face: 
DARKMAN 
(INTENSE) Can I--can I see you? CLINK! The bullet is dislodged from the wound and drops on the table. 
CUT TO: 
335 PEOPLE SCREAMING Various close shots of screaming patrons on the Tilt-A A-Whirl, their faces hideously distorted by wind, centrifugal force, and their mouths stretched wide to scream. 
MERRY-GO-ROUND HORSES Various close shots of leering horses bobbing up and down. We are at a carnival.

335 CONTINUED 
PEYTON laughing, his face restored, walking down the midway, one arm draped over Julie's shoulder. She laughs with him. Peyton glances at his watch. 
JULIE Put away that watch or I'll think you don't like me anymore. Oh, Peyton, let's spend the whole day together -- the whole week! A beat. 
PEYTON I've got to tell you, Julie... I've got to tell you something about -- about me -- how I've changed. Julie turns. 
PEYTON In the fire -- I -- I A voice offscreen rises above the general noise: 
VOICE (OS) See the mutant man, half man, half beast! Witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes! Peyton whirls around. 
PEYTON'S POV - A SIDESHOW BARKER soliciting pedestrians to a side-show. 
JULIE What? 
PEYTON 
(QUICKLY; 
NERVOUS) Never mind. 
JULIE What's going on, Peyton? What are you keeping from me? 
CONTINUED 
335 CONT (2) Peyton Ares at Julie. He can't bring himself to tell her. 
PEYTON 
(SUDDENLY 
IMPULSIVE) C'mon, I'm going to win you the biggest' fuzziest pinkiest animal doll on that rack. Something you'll-be truly embarrassed to own... and then I've got to run. They have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get tossed at bottle pyramids. Peyton lays down a dollar and is handed three balls. 
JULIE Why do you always have to run? Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He throws the first ball; misses. - 
PEYTON I. have my treatment... I'm not a hundred percent cured yet--but I soon will be. He throws the second ball; misses. 
JULIE Can I take you back to the burn center? Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly. 
PEYTON No! No, please. I don't want you to see me there. I don't want you to think of me as...an invalid or... some kind of f--ff-fff--FREAK! On that word he throws the last ball with great force. The pyramid explodes. Peyton, breathing heavily, takes a moment to collect himself, then says quietly to the booth attendant:

335 CONTINUED(3) 
PEYTON ...The pink elephant, please. The bored attendant, a cigarette dangling from his lower lip, shakes his head. 
ATTENDANT Sorry buddy. It don't count if you ain't standing behind that line. 
PEYTON I was behind the line. 
ATTENDANT Not hardly. 
336 PEYTON'S VEIN pulses. 
PEYTON I was standing right here. Next to my girlfriend. Now. The pink elephant, .if you please! 
ATTENDANT Na way. Julie tugs at his sleeve. 
JULIE Peyton, it doesn't matter. Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped words, between gasps for breath: 
PEYTON It matters. I won a pink elephant. For my girlfriend.

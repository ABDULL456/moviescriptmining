JIMMY There goes my Pulitzer Prize. 
Linda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL 
A red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof. 
EXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY 
Ethan's grip fails and he falls. 
EXT. CHIMNEY. SKY 
Supergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above. 
EXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL 
Selena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY 
Jimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs. 
JIMMY Darn! 
He turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac. 
JIMMY Hey lady, did you see that? 
Bianca gives him a glance of contempt. 
BIANCA See what? 
JIMMY The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in mid-air. 
BIANCA Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and have your head examined. 
EXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET 
Supergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love. 
ETHAN You're alive! She didn't kill you! 
SUPERGIRL Who didn't? 
ETHAN That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you. 
SUPERGIRL You love me? 
ETHAN My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms... 
SUPERGIRL We have to have a long talk about all this. 
ETHAN I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT 
Selena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera. 
BIANCA Home? 
SELENA No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. 
BIANCA (shrewdly) Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? 
Selena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity. 
SELENA I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit whenever I want. 
She gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image. 
INSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT

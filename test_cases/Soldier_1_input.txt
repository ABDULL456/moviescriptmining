CHURCH Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one? 
MEKUM (smug grin, to Church) In a minute. (turning back to Sloan) Now, see this test?  This shows what they do under sleep deprivation conditions.  Forty-eight hours awake and they can... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD RUNNING/RUINS - DAY 
Rain slashes his face as TODD runs, his eyes staring vacantly into the blinding storm, his legs pumping evenly, his feet chopping through the thick mud in a wasteland of shelled apartment buildings where rat-like CREATURES scurry out of his way as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  "STATION" - DAY 
Separated by fifteen yards, the two groups of SOLDIERS, the NEW and the VETERAN, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly into space as they await orders.  Occasionally a VETERAN will rub his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away deliberately, expressionless.  Nobody flinches when a big door opens and pale light streams in. 
MEKUM is standing there in a poncho. 
MEKUM Melton, Eight Five.  Forward. 
MELTON, one of the husky new soldiers, climbs to his feet and steps toward MEKUM, saluting. 
MELTON Eight Five, sir. 
MEKUM Ten miles, Melton, on the run. 
MELTON's face shows no expression as MEKUM continues. 
MEKUM (O.S.) You've got sixty minutes.  Go. 
MELTON Sir! 
MELTON heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY 
TODD's breath comes in even rasps as his feet splash over rough terrain, splash splash splash, hard work but nothing in his stone face indicates he's not equal to the task.  Splash splash splash! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY 
In the cluttered office, RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN look up from a conversation as MEKUM enters dripping wet and takes off his poncho, smiling smugly. MEKUM My man left exactly twenty minutes after yours.  Make a note of that. 
RUBRICK What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers? 
MEKUM (a shrug and a grin) Old soldiers never die. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY 
Running.  Splash splash splash!  TODD makes a turn, heading back, his face like stone, as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY 
MEKUM is filling his coffee cup as he speaks. 
MEKUM They'll serve as a labor force.  You can use them for physical stuff... loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that kind of thing. (a glance around the office) Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh, tidying up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY 
Breathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain. Something makes him glance back over his shoulder. 
Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain. 
TODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running. 
Then he looks back again. 
The vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer. 
TODD continues at the same even place.  He doesn't look back again until he feels closeness.  Then he looks. 
IT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly, keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's.  The bigger man moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine, inexorable. 
As TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  "STATION" - DAY 
The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK, and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but not desperately. 
MEKUM Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological.  The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind. 
A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer, takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at the same pace, his face like stone. 
TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes. 
TODD Sir. 
RUBRICK At ease, soldier. 
CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM. 
CHURCH What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired? MEKUM Tired? 
CHURCH Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube. 
RUBRICK (to Todd) Soldier!  Up the chain! TODD Sir.

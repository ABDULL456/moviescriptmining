MARVIN Hey, officer. Thought you'd be upstairs by now, hanging out with the top brass. 
MCCLANE They kind of busted me down to buck private.

187 CONTINUED - 187 
MARVIN I know that feeling. Interested in a nice coat? 
MCCLANE 
(RECOGNIZING IT) The lining's ripped and it needs some invisible mending. Keep it. Think you can get me on line upstairs again? Marvin chuckles, moves over to a table and pulls aside a cloth. All electronic stuff there. 
MARVIN I was just a kid, working those radios on the B-29's. But I kept up. Still read Popular Mechanics. These transistor things, I'm on top of 'em - Marvin realizes that McClane has'a funny expression. 
MARVIN You okay, son? 
2188 NEW ANGLE 188 FOCUS CHANGE. McClane STARES at the table... and one of the scrambled transceivers - one with a GREEN L.E.D.!

189 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH - NIGHT 189 
Stuart is in the pulpit, his men attentive. 
STUART We've pussied out around the world, over and over again. We drop the Shah, fuck Marcos, throw Noriega overboard. You know what they think around the globe? The worst thing that can happen to you is to have America as a friend. And now that stain head Gorbachov, he's got some nice English suits, and a wife without gold teeth, so now the Commies are nice? Gentlemen, we are soldiers and we do not believe in fairy tales sweet though they may seem. Well, tonight, the pattern ends. The dominos will fall no more and the ramparts will remain upri-

THOMPS ON (X) (ca 11 ing--out.3- Sir! General Esperanza's plane just came on the scope. Stuart hurries up into the choir loft, CAMERA ADJUSTING. He takes up the phone. 
STUART Attention, Dulles Tower... 
190 INT. CAB 190 
STUART'S VOICE I am lighting up a runway now. Do not - repeat, do not - attempt to land any planes. Remember, I am monitoring you. And now, like magic - one DISTANT RUNWAY twinkles on. Almost immediately the CHATTER from the sky picks up: QUESTIONS. 
DEMANDS. PLEADING. 
BARNES What do we do? 
TRUDEAU Obey.

STUART'S VOICE You are to come in on runway fifteen, (X) repeat, runway fifteen. By now the CAMERA is in the REAR CABIN. Just in time to SEE Esperanza STRANGLE the nice young corporal with the chain from his handcuffs. He lets the body drop, nice and soft so it doesn't make a sound. Taking the handcuff key from the body, he frees himself... (X)

192 INT. BASEMENT 192 
McClane is examining the Scrambler, excited. 
MCCLANE The code... the code's still punched... where did you get this? 
MARVIN Came with the coat; over near the luggage belts. Looks like one of them Japanese radios... can't hold a candle to a nice Zenith if you ask me... You like it, huh? How about twenty dollars? 
MCCLANE How about I let you live? 
MARVIN (handing it over). Man knows how to bargain...

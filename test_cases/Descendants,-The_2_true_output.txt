13   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                         13 
Approaching the door, Matt hears LAUGHTER from inside. 
14   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     14 
Matt enters to find Scottie on a sofa in the corner GIGGLING and TEXTING. 
MATT Scottie, what are you doing? 
SCOTTIE I'm hungry. Can we go? 
MATT You didn't talk to her, did you? 
SCOTTIE Yes, I did. 
MATT What did you tell her? 
SCOTTIE It's private.

MATT You're lying. And Jesus Christ, enough with the goddamn texting! Give me that phone! Give it here! 
Scottie fights him as he snatches her phone away. 
MATT (CONT'D) Jesus, Scottie. Okay, you win.       Let's go. 
Scottie springs up out of the sofa. 
MATT (CONT'D) At least say goodbye. 
SCOTTIE Bye, Mom! 
Scottie bolts out the door. Matt takes a last look at Liz, panic and sadness rippling across his face. 
MATT (V.O.) My wife -- the sportswoman, the model, the drinker. 
MATT (CONT'D) Would you please wake up already?      I need you. I can't do this alone. 
15   EXT. BRIEF MONTAGE - DAY                                              15 
Images lead us up the PALI HIGHWAY and into the lush old neighborhood of NU'UANU. 
16   EXT. KING HOUSE - DAY                                                 16 
This STATELY OLD HOUSE shows signs of neglect but feels impressive and welcoming nonetheless. 
MATT (O.S.) Is this Barb Higgins? 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) Yes, it is. 
MATT (O.S.) Hi, Matt King returning your call. I assume your daughter is a classmate of my daughter's.

BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) Yes, Lani is a classmate of Scottie's, yes. 
17   INT. KING HOUSE - DAY                                                  17 
As Matt speaks on the PHONE, he wanders out of his cluttered HOME OFFICE and into the DINING ROOM. 
MATT How can I help you? 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) Let's see, where to start? It's Scottie. She's been texting some awful things to Lani, and I'd like her to stop. 
MATT For instance. 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) Here's the latest one. "We all know you grew pubes over the summer." She sends little messages like that for no reason. She even wrote it on Lani's Facebook wall. 
MATT Huh. 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) She calls my daughter Lanikai, implying she's like the size of an entire neighborhood. Do you think that's nice? 
MATT That's not like her at all.       She's usually very sweet. 
He glances out the window at Scottie, who sits on the ground, back turned, POUNDING something with a BIG ROCK. 
MATT (CONT'D) As you may know, her mother isn't well, and maybe this is how she's dealing with it.

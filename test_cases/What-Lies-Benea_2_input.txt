NORMAN That's a little much, don't you think? 
He sees the necklace on her neck. 
NORMAN Oops.  Can't have that. 
He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around Claire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack. 
NORMAN'S POV 
His arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE. 
Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS SHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils. 
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.  The water slowly descends. 
When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of air. 
The drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She turns off the water and stands unsteadily. 
She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out of the room. 
INT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs. 
INT.  FOYER - NIGHT 
She fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty. 
She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles through the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open to see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the phone.  Then another.  It's blood. 
She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring down from the landing. 
She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in her hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself over the banister.  THUD! 
A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the corner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles over on Norman. 
EXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it. 
She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in the bed...nobody there. 
INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT 
The truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares at the door for signs of Norman. 
CLAIRE Come on...come on... 
...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway, constantly watching the door. 
When she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks into the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the open door, then clears.  Still nothing. 
EXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road. 
INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT 
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE. 
EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge. 
INT.  PICKUP - NIGHT 
ANGLE 
Claire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across the windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in 911.  It blinks:  "NO SERVICE." 
CLAIRE Shit. 
She glances into the rear view mirror. 
CLAIRE'S POV 
A stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping in the breeze. 
Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again..."NO SERVICE."  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks again:  "ROAM."  Claire punches the talk button again. 
SMASH! 
A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim visage pressed against the glass. 
She squashes down the accelerator.

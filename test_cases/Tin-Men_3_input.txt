102   INT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING COMPANY OFFICE - DAY            102 We see and hear the Girls working the telephones, as before. 
GIRL #1 Good afternoon, this is Superior Aluminum Siding. We're going to have... GIRL #2 ... a salesman in your area today... BB is sitting in a chair across from Looney. LOONEY Beeb, why don't you let Stanley work with you. I'm off to Florida at the end of the week for some sun and fun. Let Stanley work with you, and when I get back, we'll see how Moe's doing. BB I don't know. To be honest with you, I think I'd rather work alone ... he's too green. Is he a pain in the ass? LOONEY No. He don't talk much; he's a good listener, so he can't really get on your nerves. He's a lousy pool player and he can't play cards for shit, but... BB (interrupting) So what good is he? (CONTINUED) 
102   CONTINUED:                                                  102 LOONEY Studious type... takes a lot of notes. BB (smiles) If this is a sales pitch, I think you got to work a little harder 'cos I don't think you've got good product. CUT TO: 
103   EXT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE - ANGLE ON BB - DAY                     103 
As he comes out of the Superior Aluminum building and walks towards his car. We see Nora driving her Chevy in front of BB's car. She drives her car forward, and then reverses it hard into BB's Cadillac. He runs over to the driver's side of Nora's Chevy. BB What are you, crazy?! Nora drives the car forward and then backwards again almost running BB down. She rolls down the window (auto- matically) so that she can yell. NORA You're a goddamn tin man! Then she backs the car up.      BB tries to go around the front of the car. BB Wait a minute!     Wait a minute! Nora starts to move the car towards him. He moves away, and her car smashes into the side of his car. She presses the button to the window and rolls it down just a shade. NORA You wanted to win me just to get even with my husband... screw you! She rolls up the window, floors the car, and drives away. (CONTINUED) 
103   CONTINUED:                                              103 ANGLE ON LOONEY as he walks out of the building.   He sees BB's car all smashed up. LOONEY (to BB) I think you ought to get rid of this car... it's bad luck. Nora's CAR SCREECHES around the corner. LOONEY Is that the guy again? 
BB No, it's his wife. LOONEY There's some kind of sickness that runs in that family. CUT TO: 
104   INT. POOL HALL - TIGHT SHOT OF MOUSE - DAY                    104 He's singing "The Banana Boat Song." MOUSE 'Day-O! da,da,da,da,day... daylight come and he wanna go home...' 
ANGLE ON TILLEY AND GIL 
at a table playing pool. Mouse is standing next to his trusted JUKEBOX, belting out his favorite Harry Belafonte song. In b.g.: TILLEY (to Gil) Why can't they get rid of that fucking record? It's not a hit anymore... nobody cares about this song anymore... it's history. Mouse continue singing in the background. MOUSE 'Day-O!   da,da,da,da,day...' GIL We can always smash the juke box, or break in and steal the record. (CONTINUED) 
104   CONTINUED:                                             104 TILLEY (lining up a shot) He's getting on my nerves. The guy eats like an animal, and sings like an asshole. GIL Maybe it's me, but I'm beginning to like it. Tilley hits the ball and sinks the shot. TILLEY (happily) Yes, sir... yes, sir!

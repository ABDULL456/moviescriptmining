RONNIE I lied.   It is a date. 
Before she can argue, Ronnie guns the golf cart and drives away. 
EXT. MALL - MORNING 
Ronnie sees Stevie and the Skaters doing hand rails down a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting nailed by flying skateboards. Ronnie drives up on his golf cart. 
STEVIE Our suspension is over. 
RONNIE I'm not here for that.    I need to talk to you. 
A giant BODYGUARD with a shaved head stands up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BODYGUARD Anything you want to say to Stevie, you can say to me, motherfucker! 
RONNIE Who the fuck are you? 
STEVIE This is my cousin, Roy.      He's a boxer. 
BODYGUARD You got a fuckin' problem, bitch?! 
Ronnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace. He sprays it into the eyes of the Bodyguard. The guy goes down and starts SCREAMING IN PAIN. 
BODYGUARD My eyes! 
STEVIE Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are you doing? 
RONNIE I need a favor. 
STEVIE I'm listening. 
RONNIE As you know, we've had a lot of crime around here lately. Between the Flasher and all the break-ins, I've decided to go to the streets. Frankly, I'm looking for a stool pigeon and you're just the right person. 
STEVIE Why would I want to help you? 
RONNIE I could make it worth your while. You like skating at the mall. I could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted. In exchange, you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STEVIE Sorry, dude, but I'm no snitch. Go find somebody else to do your dirty work. 
RONNIE Well, let me put it another way. If you don't help me, I'm gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass. But like for real. Like I really will do that. This is the new me talking and I get what I need, you understand me, Stevie? 
STEVIE Alright, dude, I understand, you sick fuck. 
RONNIE Cool. In that case, have fun shreadin'. 
Ronnie gets into his Golf Cart and drives off. Stevie looks down at the Boxer who is still on the ground. 
STEVIE Stop crying, Roy. 
Stevie starts skating. 
INT. MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY 
Ronnie walks into the Food Court and sees Nell waiting at their table with Ronnie's morning Cinnabon. He takes a deep breath and heads over. 
NELL Hey, sweetie -- Oh, I'm sorry, good morning, Officer Barnhardt. 
RONNIE Good morning, Nell. 
NELL Where were you last night? I tried to call, but your mom said you weren't home from work yet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RONNIE Look, I got to talk to you about something. I'm not really sure how to put this. Let's see. If you drove a Toyota. 
NELL I drive a Ford. 
RONNIE I know, but let's just pretend you drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota runs really good. It always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don't have to do much to maintain it. Then you get a really important job like Astronaut, no that won't work, you get a job as the head of Wall Street. Well, you may really like that Toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right? Now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari. It may be more expensive and harder to drive, but I mean, it just looks good as hell. What would you do? 
NELL I don't get it. 
RONNIE You would trade up, Nell. Well, that's exactly what I'm doing. 
NELL Are you thinking about getting a new car? 
RONNIE No, Nell, I'm getting a new girlfriend. 
NELL What?!   Who? 
RONNIE This girl, Brandi.

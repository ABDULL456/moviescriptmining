MARLA If I fall asleep, I'm done for. You're gonna have to keep me up all night. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING) 
Tyler chuckles, shakes his head. 
TYLER Unbelievable, huh? 
JACK (V.O.) He was obviously able to handle it. 
Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack. 
TYLER I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ? 
JACK No.  Not at all. 
JACK (V.O.) I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct. 
Tyler lights his cigarette. 
TYLER You're sure? 
JACK Yeah, I'm sure. 
TYLER Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that... 
INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear. 
MARLA (whispering) I want to have your abortion. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING) 
Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's Digest just a little too tight. 
JACK (V.O.) How could Tyler not go for that? Night before last, he was splicing sex organs into "Little Mermaid." 
Tyler sits, studies Jack's face. 
TYLER You're okay with this? 
JACK I'm fine. 
JACK (V.O.) Put a gun to my head and paint the wall with my brains. 
Tyler smokes. 
TYLER She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one. 
JACK Oh, and my pace is more librarians. 
TYLER Hey... don't knock librarians. 
JACK Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker. 
TYLER She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking. 
JACK (V.O.) She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home. 
TYLER Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute... 
Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair. 
JACK What? 
TYLER You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit. 
Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare. 
TYLER If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me. 
JACK Okay. 
TYLER Promise you won't. 
JACK Yes, I promise. 
TYLER Promise? 
JACK I said I promise! 
TYLER That was three times you promised. 
Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering. 
JACK (V.O.) If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla die, none of this would have happened. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs. 
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall. 
MARLA'S VOICE (muffled through wall) Miserable fucking discharge! 
JACK (V.O.) I could've moved to another room, one on the third floor -- so I wouldn't have heard them.  But I didn't. 
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT 
SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs. 
INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME 
Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in... 
Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA. 
TYLER What are you doing? 
Jack steps back. 
JACK I... uh... just going to bed.

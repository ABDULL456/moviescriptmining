{"train": "AUTUMN IN NEW YORK \nScreenplay by \nAllison Burnett \nShooting Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON \nA COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing. Their path is dappled with leafy shadow. \nTo their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and soda, savoring the waning hours of summer. \nCLOSER ON THE COUPLE \nHe is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor. \nOnly a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself. \nWalking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her and, if the past prevails, so many will come after. \nShe listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking -- \nWILLS -- and I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding. \nWOMAN Well, you certainly didn't. \nEXT. ANOTHER CENTRAL PARK WALKWAY -- LATER \nStill talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area of the park-- \nWOMAN No, I see how you could feel this way. Of course I do. It's human. But what I don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. I mean, we just met. Feelings change. You don't even know me. \nWILLS Yes, I do. \nShe is amused by his confidence -- \nWOMAN Oh, really? \nWILLS The minute I laid eyes on you. It's the saddest thing about getting older. You know people so quickly. I even knew you'd end up hating me. \nWOMAN Well, you're wrong. I don't. \nWILLS (with a weary smile) Give it time. \nShe laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun. \nHe takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual- bohemian look to them. \nStanding and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion -- \nCHARLOTTE -- and for weeks I sat by her bed and cried. I told her I loved her and I begged her not to leave me. All I could think about was what I'd lose if she died. And then one night... she was in really bad pain... I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her. (fighting tears) I stopped crying. I said goodbye. And in less than an hour Ella was gone. \nThe woman whispers in Wills' ear -- \nWOMAN It's so sad. \nBut Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion. \nCHARLOTTE I really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying. That's what I did to Ella and I'll never do it to anyone else again. (softly) I hope no one ever does it to me. \nShe looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away. \nThe woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers -- \nWOMAN So what do you know about her? \nHe knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But his answer is nonchalant -- \nWILLS That she's just a kid. \nHe takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. He steals one last look back. \nCharlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them. \nMeanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair -- \nOLD MAN I met Ella at City College in 1938... \nWills slowly turns and walks away. \nMUSIC AND TITLES IN: \nEXT. MANHATTAN SUBWAY STOP -- AUTUMN DUSK \nHe goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly -- \nWILLS I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding. \nShe stares at him, speechless. \nINT. RESTAURANT -- THAT NIGHT \nIts decor is exquisitely tasteful, its ambiance warm and convivial. The night is in full swing. Most of the tables are taken and the bar is packed. \nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- SAME \nFrom amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI breaks free and glides to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT. \nIts facade is windowless. Only a small brass plaque on the grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM. \nWills and ERIKO, 30's, Japanese, aloof and stunning, emerge from the taxi, elegantly dressed, and move to the front door. \nINT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS \nTWO TIPSY DEBUTANTES pass Wills and Eriko as they enter. One recognizes Wills and smiles flirtatiously. \nWills stops and helps Eriko off with her jacket. JESUS, 30, the dashing Cuban-American maitre d', superbly discreet, approaches -- \nJESUS Good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us tonight? \nWILLS We certainly will. Table seven, Jesus, if it's available. \nJESUS Yes, sir. \nWills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check girl -- \nWILLS How are you, Melissa? \nMELISSA (blushing) Fine, Mr. Keane. \nCELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile. \nWILLS Good evening, Celia. And how -- \nCELIA (with forced cheeriness) Just dandy, sir, thanks! \nJESUS Table seven. \nCELIA This way, please. \nCelia, barely making eye contact with Eriko, walks quickly away. Wills is amused and a little confused by Celia's behavior. He lays a hand on Eriko's back -- \nWILLS I'll be right with you. \nEriko nods and follows Celia. \nWills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone. \nWills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear -- \nWILLS How's it going? \nJOHN (covering the phone) Chaos. \nWILLS The house specialty. \nJOHN Easy for you to say, ya prick. Waltzin' in here like you own the joint. \nWills laughs and takes a look into the bar. John gestures with his head in Eriko's direction -- \nJOHN So who's the new potential ex-wife? I thought you were still wastin' time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name. \nWILLS We wisely agreed to cut our losses. \nWills exits into the bar. John smiles and shakes his head. \nFOLLOW WILLS, as he glides along the bar. CUSTOMERS and STAFF greet him warmly. \nAs he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and kiss their cheeks. \nSuddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path -- \nCELIA Look, I have no right to say this, okay? And you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women -- tonight makes seven -- and it's really starting to get to me. \nWILLS In what way? \nCELIA I have to greet them! It's like working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because I know any minute they could be put down! \nWILLS I assure you it's an absolutely painless procedure. \nShocked, she can't help but sputter a laugh -- \nCHARLOTTE He's here. And he's staring at me again. \nSHANNON No way! \nBoth Shannon and Simon turn to look, but like lightning Charlotte grabs them both -- \nCHARLOTTE Don't! (to Simon) Wait a few seconds, then go to the bathroom. \nSIMON How will I know him? \nCHARLOTTE He's beautiful. And much older. \nSIMON Really? (getting up) If he's rich you might have a fight on your hands. \nCharlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his chair and walks over. As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive smile. Wills is confused by it. \nCHARLOTTE Okay, look. \nShannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare in Wills' direction. Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth agape -- \nSHANNON He's as old as my dad! \nCharlotte laughs. \nBACK ON WILLS. He does his best to be attentive as Dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face -- \nDOLLY Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a New Englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf. \nWILLS It only took me twenty years to come to my senses. \nDOLLY So what're you doin' now? You owned some restaurants out there, didn't you? \nON CHARLOTTE. She sits listening to Shannon -- \nSHANNON And so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! Nothing but losers and -- \nCharlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening -- \nCHARLOTTE Oh, shit. \nSHANNON What? \nDolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm -- \nDOLLY Kids! I want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment -- Wills Keane! \nThe table greets him. Wills, slightly self-conscious, looks at everyone but Charlotte. \nDOLLY And that over there's the birthday girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte. \nThe news hits Wills hard. But he does his best to hide it. He musters a casual smile -- \nWILLS Not Katie and Jay's daughter? \nDOLLY You bet. She got her height from her dad. But her talent's all Katie's. \nDolores indicates the hat that Charlotte's wearing -- \nDOLLY Made it herself from scratch. That one, too. (to Shannon) Honey, show 'im. \nShannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat she's wearing. The table laughs. \nWills levels his gaze at Charlotte -- \nWILLS Impressive. \nTry as she might to accept the compliment with grace, Charlotte can't help but grin. \nCHARLOTTE Thanks. \nThe WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him -- \nWILLS I think we can do better than that. \nThe steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the champagne with him. \nWILLS Happy birthday, Charlotte. \nCHARLOTTE Thanks. \nSHANNON (under her breath) Twenty years old and never been... \nCHARLOTTE (laughing) Shut up! \nAmused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile. \nWILLS I'll let you get back to your celebration. (kissing Dolly's cheek) A pleasure to see you again. \nWILLS (sipping his coffee) No, just plenty of it. How long will it take? \nCHARLOTTE A week or two. \nWILLS You have till Thursday. I'll need it here by seven o'clock. I'm at the Pembroke on Central Park West and 76th. \nCHARLOTTE Oh. Wow. Okay. \nWILLS What's your fee? \nCHARLOTTE (faltering) I don't really have one. I usually just make them for friends. \nWILLS How's five hundred dollars? \nCHARLOTTE Really? Wow. \nWILLS Charlotte? \nHis tone has abruptly shifted; it's intimately hushed. It both daunts and excites her -- \nCHARLOTTE Yeah? \nWILLS You say \"wow\" a lot. \nCHARLOTTE I know. \nWILLS It has to stop. You're a woman now. \nCHARLOTTE I know. \nWILLS Bye. \nCHARLOTTE Bye. \nShe clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. \nWills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. \nHe snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens as it is Caribbean -- \nOLIVIA See, now you got me worried. \nWILLS What do you mean? \nOLIVIA You slept alone last night. You must be sick or somethin'. You want me to call a doctor? \nWILLS Thank you, no, I'm fine. \nShe throws him a sly, sidelong glance, then exits. Wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee. \nFROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the sound of SQUEALING, LAUGHING, SHOUTING CHILDREN. \nINT. FAO SCHWARZ -- NIGHT \nSurrounded by swarming PARENTS and KIDS, Wills stands with John, the manager of Elysium, and his wife, SARAH VOLPE, 30, who, gazing out of frame, keeps a watchful eye on their kids -- \nJOHN Save it, pal! Don't even bother! I may not have gone to a fancy school like Bendover -- \nWILLS (to Sarah) That would be Andover. \nSARAH Sure, if his folks could have afforded it. \nJOHN -- but when Wills Keane comps three bottles of Dom to a twenty-year-old girl, then tells me he did it 'cause he likes the kid's grandma, I smell a rat! \nSARAH (looking around) Oh, is that what that is? I figured there was a dirty diaper somewhere. \nWILLS (lightly) Okay, I admit it, she interests me. \nJOHN (turning to Sarah) He's gonna do it! I don't believe it! He moved us back here for nothing! \nSARAH So much for that turned leaf. \nWILLS (amused) Come on, you're overreacting. \nJOHN Is that what you think? Buddy, since we hit town, I have done nothin' but cut you slack! Every week a new woman on your arm and I didn't say a word. Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're in the right demographic. Maybe by accident you'll trip over something substantial. But this little girl? Best she could be is Miss Right's daughter! \nWILLS (uneasily) I know. It's just that there's something about her. She's special... and I just thought -- \nSARAH \"She's young. She's hot. I'm on the verge of menopause. Why not go for it?\" \nWills and Sarah meet eyes. \nWILLS There wouldn't be much point in lying to you, would there? \nSarah shakes her head. \nKIDS' VOICES Mommy, Daddy, look, look! \nMICHAEL Watch your step, Miss. \nCHARLOTTE Thank you. \nShe emerges, moves to Wills' door, and waits for the elevator to close. When it does, she hurries back to a table over which hangs a GILDED MIRROR. \nShe takes a LOVELY OLD HAT BOX out of the garbage bag and ditches the bag under the table. Then she quickly checks herself in the glass. \nShe doesn't like what she sees. She pokes at her sopping hair and squeezes it, but it's hopeless. Remembering the time, she hurries back to the door, takes a deep breath, and rings the bell. \nShe waits. And waits. Then she hears footsteps approaching. She realizes she's left the hat box on the table. \nShe rushes over and grabs it, just in time to get back to the door when it OPENS. \nOlivia, the housekeeper, steps out, wearing her coat and carrying her purse. Her voice is low and gentle -- \nOLIVIA He's waitin' for you, Miss Fieldin'. \nThey exchange cordial smiles. Charlotte enters. \nINT. WILLS' APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS \nCharlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil paintings, carpeted with a Persian runner, and lighted by three antique sconces. She walks slowly, terribly self-conscious. \nINT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nThe room is vast, furnished with antiques, decorated with the same masculine good taste. Charlotte enters timidly, then hears -- \nWILLS What happened? \nShe looks and sees Wills standing, back turned, before a broad set of high windows. City lights glimmer in the distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central Park. \nCHARLOTTE I couldn't get a cab, so I took the subway... only it was an express and it didn't stop at -- \nWILLS You realize, don't you, that you're a full eighteen minutes late? \nCHARLOTTE I know... I'm so sorry... I -- \nWills turns around. A magnificent figure -- expertly tailored tux, every hair in place, freshly manicured. And then he offers her an amused, reassuring smile -- \nWILLS Charlotte, relax. What's the point of being a beautiful young woman if it isn't to keep your admirers waiting? In fact, you disappoint me: I was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense. \nFlattered, her face brightens -- \nCHARLOTTE I could leave and come back. \nWILLS Nope, too late. Anyway, I want to see the hat. \nHe walks over to her. Smiling, she sets down the box, unties the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat. It's sublimely simple and elegant. She looks at him with hope. His face betrays nothing -- \nWILLS Try it on. \nCHARLOTTE I can't. I'm soaked. \nWILLS It's all right. \nCharlotte, a little confused, carefully sets the hat on her head. She steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and sets it at the correct angle. \nWills appears behind her and shares the reflection. She feels his presence, hears his breathing. They speak in hushed tones -- \nWILLS It's perfect. It's like a tiny sculpture. \nCHARLOTTE I wanted it to be a tiny poem. \nShe smiles. Their eyes meet in the glass. \nWILLS If only I had some use for it. (off her look) My date canceled a few hours ago. \nCHARLOTTE Why? \nWILLS I don't know. She was vague. Would you... like to come in her place? \nCharlotte can't believe it. She smiles at his reflection. \nCHARLOTTE Like this? \nWILLS The outfit I bought her is hanging in the guest room closet. \nCHARLOTTE (anxiously) It's okay? Are you sure? \nWILLS (amused) Of course. \nHe gestures toward the half-open door on other side of the room. Charlotte turns and, biting her lip, looks at the door, then back at Wills, then back at the door. \nINT. GRAND BALLROOM, PLAZA HOTEL -- NIGHT \nA spectacular affair is in full swing, a benefit for the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART attended by FIVE HUNDRED GUESTS from HIGH SOCIETY dressed only in black and white. \nCHARLOTTE You know him? \nLISA Just by reputation. \nCHARLOTTE A major womanizer, right? \nLISA That's what they say. (beat) I'm Lisa. \nCHARLOTTE Charlotte Fielding. \nThey shake hands. Lisa looks away and sees Wills making his way toward them with two glasses of punch. \nCoolly covering, Lisa beats a hasty retreat -- \nLISA Anyway, I should keep mingling. But it was nice to meet you. \nCHARLOTTE Same here. \nLisa smiles politely and walks away. \nWills walks up, watching Lisa melt into the crowd. His brow is furrowed. He's wondering if his eyes have deceived him. He hands Charlotte a punch -- \nWILLS Who was that? \nCHARLOTTE Lisa something. \nThe name hits home. Wills is flustered, but then he covers as best he can and lifts his glass -- \nWILLS (lifting his glass) Here's to -- \nCHARLOTTE Us. \nWills smiles slowly and they toast. \nINT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe room is empty. There's laughter in the distance. The front door opens and shuts. We hear Wills and Charlotte, both a little tipsy, advancing down the hall toward us -- \nCHARLOTTE God, you talk like you're a hundred and sixteen! \nWILLS That's usually how I feel. But not tonight. Tonight I feel sixteen... just sixteen... and three-quarters. \nWills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator pulls out a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE already sitting in an ice bucket. \nWILLS Champagne? \nCHARLOTTE He asked nonchalantly. \nWills laughs, then opens the bottle as he picks up his previous train of thought -- \nWILLS You see, Charlotte, the way you know you're getting older is that you start to notice patterns. People start falling into types. Pretty soon you know a person before you've even been introduced. And if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last. And the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always right. (popping the cork) Now, what I like about you -- and I think that's actually what inspired this little lecture -- is that I find you completely unprecedented... and, therefore, wholly unpredictable. \nCHARLOTTE God, it must be a relief. \nWILLS (confused) What? \nCHARLOTTE To finally deliver that speech to a woman and actually have it apply to her. \nWILLS Now wait a minute. \nCHARLOTTE No, because coincidentally I am all those things you just said. And more. \nWills chuckles, shaking his head, charmed but a little unsettled. \nCHARLOTTE I'm a \"unique\". At least that's what my yoga teacher says. He says there are very few uniques in the world and I'm one of them. \nWILLS Well, he's a wise man. \nHe hands her a glass of champagne. \nCHARLOTTE You, on the other hand, are what he'd call a \"typical.\" \nWILLS Oh, really? \nCHARLOTTE Uh-huh. And I can prove it. Want me to? Come here. \nWills moves a few steps closer. \nCHARLOTTE Closer. \nWills walks even closer, until they are just a few feet apart. \nCHARLOTTE No, come on, really close. \nWills can't believe his good luck. He nears her until their faces are almost touching. \nCHARLOTTE Perfect. Now watch very carefully. \nSIBLEY At present? Nothing. \nWills shifts uneasily in his chair. \nSIBLEY Eventually she'll be treated for pain. In the end, surgery could become an option, but her chances of survival would be slim. Right now Charlotte's against it. She's signed a directive forbidding any sort of heroic intervention. \nA silence settles between them. Sibley opens a folder on his desk. \nSIBLEY There's more here if you're interested, but it won't mean much to you. \nWills shakes his head and rises from his chair. He turns to the door, then turns back to the doctor -- \nWILLS How long? \nSIBLEY Optimistically? A year. \nEXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- LATER \nWearing her tattered jeans from the night before, Charlotte sits on the couch doing the New York Times crossword. Wills emerges, walking slowly, pensively, as though in a trance. \nCharlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin -- \nCHARLOTTE A real charmer, isn't he? \nWills doesn't react. He keeps walking toward her. Unsettled, she holds up the puzzle. \nCHARLOTTE How are you on Cambodian money units? \nWills keeps advancing. \nCHARLOTTE Are you okay, old man? You look kinda woozy. (jokingly calling out) Is there a doctor in the house? \nIgnoring her, Wills sits down, takes her in his arms, and embraces her. At first she resists, but slowly she surrenders and hugs him back. \nINT. TAXI -- AFTERNOON \nAs the cab bounces down a cobblestone Village street, Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts. \nSlowly, Charlotte steals a sidelong look at him. His face is tense, ashen, and unreadable -- \nCHARLOTTE Hey. \nWills slowly turns his head. She smiles sweetly -- \nCHARLOTTE Look on the bright side: if I weren't sick, there's no way we could hang out together. (off his look) I'm serious. You'd be scared of hurting me and I'd be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body. \nHe can't help but smile. Encouraged, she moves closer -- \nCHARLOTTE And then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. You know, because I'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy -- and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up. (beat) But since I'm so sick it doesn't really matter what deep-seated weirdness has brought us together because there's no way we can possibly screw each other over... or up... because that takes time. And I don't have much left. \nThe cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone. She smiles archly, savoring the irony -- \nCHARLOTTE So considering everything, don't you think we should just sort of chill out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what we have... right now... no strings... just this... until it ends? 'Cause that's really all I have to offer. \nWills grimly appreciates the irony. \nCHARLOTTE Think about it, okay? But not too hard. \nShe kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab. She skips up the steps of the brownstone, then immediately turns around and runs back down to the open window. \nShe leans in and mutters sexily -- \nCHARLOTTE Last night was so incredibly hot. (beat) By the way -- it was my first time. And I picked you for the job. I hope you're flattered. \nWills is shocked. She turns and runs back upstairs. She sticks in the key, then turns and waves at Wills before banging open the door with her hip. \nDRIVER Okay, pal, where to? \nWills hasn't moved a muscle. \nFROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the pop of FLASHBULBS and the whirr of SHUTTERS -- \nINT. DOWNTOWN LOFT -- NIGHT \nYOUNG FASHION MODELS OF EVERY RACE strut down a runway, modeling a new line of WOMEN'S URBAN CASUAL WEAR. \nFIND CHARLOTTE, ignoring the show, pushing through the crowd, hurrying toward the side of the stage. She speaks to a GUARD at the entrance and he lets her pass. \nINT. BACKSTAGE -- MOMENTS LATER \nCharlotte searches amid the chaos of models dressing and undressing. Finally, she spots them. \nFIND SIMON AND SHANNON styling a BLACK FEMALE MODEL in a tank top and fatigues. \nHe applies a finishing touch, adjusting the tilt of the model's baseball cap. Shannon, lacing the girl's boots, works as Simon's assistant. \nEXT. SOHO STREET -- NIGHT \nThey move through a doorway -- \nINT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nWills is surprised by the room's run-down state. \nDOLLY Excuse the mess. My maid died fourteen years ago and it's been simply impossible to replace her. She did windows and spoke English. \nShe chuckles to herself. Wills hands her the flowers. \nWILLS For you. \nDOLLY Well, aren't they loverly. \nShe casually drops them into an EMPTY BLENDER at the bar. \nDOLLY Care for a cocktail? \nWILLS No, thanks. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- SAME \nSimon lounges on the bed. Charlotte stands before a full- length mirror, trying on a dress. \nSIMON It really is uncanny. I tell you, in that dress you're the spitting image of Michel Simon. \nCHARLOTTE (flattered) Who's she? \nSIMON A French character actor, long dead, who was not only hideous and fat, but quite male. \nCHARLOTTE So that would be a \"no.\" \nSimon nods. Charlotte takes off the dress. \nINT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAME \nWills looks around the room. Dolores splashes her drink with vodka -- \nDOLLY What can I say? Time's a thief. One day you're rich as an Arab, the next you're lucky if you can afford a god damn can of pistachio nuts. \nWills wanders over to the mantel where FAMILY PHOTOS sit in tarnished antique silver frames. He picks up a photograph of a YOUNG GIRL in TENNIS WHITES -- it's Charlotte's mother, Katie. \nWills' face is suffused with tenderness as he studies it. Dolores walks over and looks -- \nDOLLY How about that, huh? That was the summer you two -- \nWILLS I know. \nDOLLY Who'd have guessed what time had in store for her, huh? Look at that smile. \nEyes moistening, Dolores crosses to her armchair. Her tone is slightly bitter -- \nDOLLY Then again, time loves some people. Like you, for instance. Oh, time's just wild about you. \nShe plops down unsteadily and reaches for her cigarettes -- \nDOLLY Just as handsome and charming as ever. And still up to the same old tricks. \nWills sets the photo back on the mantel -- \nWILLS What do you mean? \nDOLLY First time you came to pick up Katie, you brought me flowers. Just like those. (to herself) Flower the mother; then deflower the daughter. But Katie was too smart for you... \nWILLS Dolly, look -- \nDOLLY (abruptly) Aw, why the hell don't you leave her alone? Christ, she's sick! \nBut before Wills can answer, they hear footsteps on the stairs. Neither moves. \nCharlotte enters, wearing a peasant dress and felt hat, looking pretty, pale, and excited. \nWills and Dolores slowly turn. They smile at her, then exchange a quick glance. Charlotte catches it and becomes self-conscious -- \nCHARLOTTE What? What's wrong? \nDOLLY You look like your mom is all. \nCharlotte looks to Wills to see if that's, indeed, what he was thinking. He nods his agreement. She is pleased. \nEXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET -- MINUTES LATER \nCharlotte, full of energy, hauls Wills down the block by the hand. \nWILLS What do you mean, you knew? \nCHARLOTTE I did! I just didn't think it would take so long! \nWILLS I think that goes without saying. \nCHARLOTTE It was true when that poem was written three hundred years ago and it's true today. Wouldn't it be fun to look wanton occasionally? \nWILLS It's been a lifelong dream of mine. But will a scarf do it? \nCHARLOTTE Totally. Accessories rule. But we have to be careful. I don't want you looking too young. Nothing's worse than an old guy trying to look young. \nWILLS Good advice. I'll remember that for when I get old. \nCHARLOTTE You know what I meant. \nWILLS That I'm old. \nCHARLOTTE Uh-huh. \nINT. BARNEY'S LOBBY -- LATER \nWills walks a little self-consciously. He wears around his shoulders a sloppily draped wrinkly silk scarf. \nHe walks past OTHER SHOPPERS. Among a GROUP OF WOMEN walking past him FIND CHARLOTTE who subtly checks him out as though he were a stranger. \nAs she passes by, she gives him a sexy look, then, not very subtly, she spins around to look at his ass. \nFinally, she breaks character, runs after him, and throws her arms around his neck from behind. \nCHARLOTTE Perfectly imperfect! \nLaughing, he holds her hands and hauls her on his back to the door. \nINT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nWills and Charlotte are in the middle of a candlelight dinner. Wills refills her wine glass -- \nWILLS I don't know why, but for some odd reason, I feel absolutely compelled to tell you the truth about this... even at the risk of -- \nCHARLOTTE Hey, you're giving me the creeps. Just spit it out. \nWills holds his breath for a moment, then exhales and says it -- \nWILLS I never had a date for the benefit. My plan from the beginning was for you to come with me. \nCharlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together -- \nCHARLOTTE So I made the hat for myself? (He nods.) And you bought that dress for me? (He nods.) And you did all this just so you could sleep with me? (He nods.) Why? I mean, why me? \nWills settles himself, then, meeting her eyes, speaks softly -- \nWILLS The eulogy you gave at Ella's service was so... impressive. You spoke about her death... about loss... in a way that I could never have done. You understood life emotionally in a way that I didn't. Whatever that understanding was, I wanted to get close to it. \nCHARLOTTE And sex seemed like the best way to do it. \nWILLS And the most enjoyable, yeah. \nCharlotte sips her wine and considers. Then she sets down her glass -- \nCHARLOTTE Well, first of all, let me say, you have great taste because that little Dolce & Gabbana was to die for. \nWILLS Thanks. \nCHARLOTTE And, second, don't ever lie to me again. \nWILLS All right. \nCHARLOTTE Seriously. There isn't a lie in the whole world I'd rather hear than the truth. \nWills stares at her solemnly. Her expression just as somber, she lifts a hand and points to her lips. He leans forward to kiss her. \nINT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nWills and Charlotte, kissing deeply, tumble fully clothed onto the bed. As their passion builds, Wills reaches for the bedside lamp. \nCharlotte watches curiously, thoughtfully, as he pulls the cord, plunging the room into UTTER DARKNESS. \nMUSIC UP: A SEQUENCE BEGINS \n-- Savoring the last sunny days of autumn, Wills and Charlotte walk across the green of Central Park, which swarms with happy, healthy teenagers. \n-- At night, Wills and John and his wife Sarah sit in box seats at Yankee Stadium watching the play-offs. Bernie Williams hits a colossal shot. The crowd jumps to its feet. As the ball flies over the right field wall, we see that Charlotte sits next to Wills, munching a hotdog, her nose buried in a book, utterly uninterested. \n-- In Elysium's kitchen, Wills watches on as Charlotte, wearing an apron over her clothes, prepares bisque under the approving eye of the CHEF. She quickly and expertly pours a cup of cream and a cup of broth into a large blender. Then she dumps in lobster meat and adds some saffron. Just when she, with a dramatic flourish, is about to hit the start button, Wills INTERRUPTS and puts the lid on the blender. \n-- One morning, Charlotte sits up in bed doing the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. Olivia sits on the chair next to the bed, chatting and laughing with her. Wills enters, carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast. Olivia looks up and gestures haughtily for him to set it down, as though he were the housekeeper. \n-- At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Wills and Charlotte wander amid the shadows of Egyptian ruins. \nMUSIC OUT. \nWills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each lost in thought. The lights of the city illuminate their faces in eerie flashes. \nFinally, Wills glances over and smiles -- \nWILLS I have a strange feeling that you're upset with me. \nCHARLOTTE No, I was just wondering if you had sex with that woman. \nWILLS Ever? \nCHARLOTTE No, the answer to that's pretty obvious. I meant tonight. On the roof. \nWills breaks into a grin -- \nWILLS You're not serious. \nWills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror. Wills smiles back at Charlotte -- \nWILLS Of course not. Why would I want to do something like that? \nCHARLOTTE That's what I was wondering. I thought, \"We're so happy he'd have no reason to do it. And if he did do it, he'd at least look guilty, wouldn't he? But he doesn't. He looks more relaxed than before the party started.\" \nWILLS Well, there you have it. \nCHARLOTTE But then I thought, \"He's a womanizer -- that's what they say.\" Funny word, huh? Sounds like some sorta machine. \"And how do you get to be a womanizer? Obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about it.\" \nWILLS Sure, except that -- \nCHARLOTTE Let me finish. \nAgain, Wills looks up at the driver's eyes in the mirror. They seem more serious now. \nCHARLOTTE Anyway, there's something about being sick right here -- \nShe touches her own chest. Her voice trembles slightly -- \nCHARLOTTE -- that has made me acutely aware of my heart. Nothing corny -- I mean, literally... I feel every beat. I know how sensitive it is. It reacts to everything. \nShe turns in her seat and lifts an OPEN PALM. \nCHARLOTTE If you're lying to me, I'll know it. (beat) Did you have sex with Wendy on the roof? \nHe smiles at her as though he were indulging a child. She looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt. \nShe slips her palm inside, over his heart. \nStill smiling, he doesn't move a muscle. \nTheir eyes are locked. \nEver so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes. She shakes her head -- \nCHARLOTTE My God... oh my God. \nShe slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and begins to cry. Wills looks down, then glances up at the rearview mirror. \nIlluminated in flashes, the driver's eyes have taken on an ominous, unblinking quality as though they were the outward embodiment of his own conscience. \nWills looks out the window. When he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold -- \nWILLS Look, I never pretended to be anything other than -- \nCHARLOTTE (a piteous cry) You hate yourself so much! \nWills is stunned. He looks out the window, speechless, his eyes small and frightened. \nEXT. CHARLOTTE'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT \nThe town car is stopped at the curb, motor running, lights on. \nINT. TOWN CAR -- SAME \nCharlotte and Wills sit in silence -- \nWILLS This was all a mistake. Right from the start. All of it. I'm a grown man and you're a child. (beat) Anyway, you have better things to do with your last -- With your time than spend it with me. \nCHARLOTTE (distantly) What about you? Do you have anything better? \nWills has no answer. Charlotte slowly gets out of the car. She leans back in, her eyes narrow with disdain -- \nCHARLOTTE You know, maybe you're right. Maybe this is the best time to end it. Because I was actually starting to love you, Wills, and that's the last thing I ever wanted. \nShe shuts the door. \nINT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- NIGHT \nAs Charlotte enters, we hear Wills' cab pull away. She moves to the stairs and sees a LIGHT shining beneath the living room door. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- NIGHT \nFrom amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI CAB breaks free and glides to the curb in front of Elysium. \nWills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a little too loudly. Wills seems stiff and tentative, a shadow of his former self. \nINT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS \nAN ELDERLY COUPLE passes them as they enter. Wills stops at the coat check and helps Patty with her coat. She admires the decor -- \nPATTY Oh, Wills, it's beautiful! \nAlthough his spirits are low, he is effortlessly cordial -- \nWILLS Thank you. It was designed by a team from -- \nPATTY So functional! Is that stainless steel? \nWILLS Actually, no, it's velvet. \nShe furrows her brow, squints, then laughs. \nPATTY Oh, my God, it is! \nWills hands Patty's coat to Melissa, the hat check girl, and asks under his breath -- \nWILLS How are you? \nLooking at Patty, Melissa asks with deep sympathy -- \nMELISSA How are you, sir? \nBefore Wills can respond, Patty takes his arm -- \nPATTY Well, if the food's even half as good as the moldings I'm in for a very special treat. \nJesus is surprised to see that Wills is not with Charlotte -- \nJESUS Uhhh, good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us? \nWILLS Yes, Jesus. Table seven, if it's available. \nJESUS Certainly, sir. \nCelia approaches, equally surprised not to see Charlotte -- \nWILLS Hello, Celia. \nCELIA (sincerely) How are you this evening, sir? \nWILLS I've been worse. \nCELIA (under her breath) Are you sure? \nThe NEW HOSTESS, Celia's replacement, arrives. \nJESUS Table Seven. \nNEW HOSTESS This way, please. \nWILLS (to Patty) Order a drink. I'll be right with you. \nPatty follows Celia. Wills moves to the reservation stand where John stands, stone-faced, flipping through the reservation book -- \nJOHN Where the hell you been? \nWILLS Splendid, how are you? \nJOHN Where's Charlotte? \nWILLS Deliveries on time? \nJOHN Who's the broad? She looks like a Holiday-Inn hooker from Ohio. \nWILLS Keep up the good work! \nWills walks away. \nINT. DOWNTOWN BAR -- NIGHT \nDark, smoky, and boisterous. FIND CHARLOTTE, standing with Simon. She looks around disgustedly and shouts above the roar -- \nCHARLOTTE Okay, I'm chugging Scotch, gagging on smoke, and losing my hearing! Now why is this so good for me again?! \nSIMON That's just it! The great spiritual benefit in leaving one's room is that it reminds one of how odious it is to leave one's room! \nWILLS So? \nJOHN So after the party, no thank you! I call you three times -- no call back! And for six days you don't even eat at your own god damn restaurant! What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I was ready to call the morgue! \nWILLS Relax, I'm alive. \nJOHN Well, you sure don't look it! \nEXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER \nJohn walks as quickly as he can with Wills struggling to keep up -- \nJOHN I'll tell you why it's my concern! Because I had a god damn swimming pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi! And I gave it up for you, brother! Back to a life of concrete and dirt and sirens just so you could get your shit together! \nEXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTES LATER \nJohn, walking a little more slowly now, cannot believe his ears -- \nJOHN On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'! Not on my green chair! Tell me it wasn't on the green chair. \nWills winces. \nJOHN Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean that? \nEXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER \nJohn walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious Wills -- \nWILLS Look, it doesn't matter that she's sick -- she's still a kid and there's no way we should be together. It's unhealthy... it's... it's inappropriate... \nJOHN (with disgust) What the hell is that? Some sorta shrink talk? \nWILLS Look, if she were just fun... just some sort of diversion... maybe I could justify it. But the worst part is that it's becoming more. Much more. It's embarrassing how much I like her. She gets to me. She affects me... \nHe stops and leans back against a building. He looks around, avoiding eye contact with John, as tears rise into his eyes. \nWILLS And she's gonna be gone and... I'm not sure I can... I mean... I already think about her all the time... (fighting tears) Her smile kills me... and the thought... that it'll be gone... forever... that I'll never see her again... I don't know... I can't -- I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny. It's too much. I'd rather have it be over... over now. I'll start missing her now. \nWills is still unable to look at him. John speaks softly -- \nJOHN Buddy, I hate to break it to you, but in the real world... where I live... there're only two kindsa love stories. Boy loses girl and girl loses boy. That's all there is. Somebody always gets left behind. You try to avoid that, you'll end up an old man toastin' yourself with egg nog in the mirror on Christmas Eve. You'll end up dying in your own arms. \nWills lifts his frightened eyes. John pats him on the cheek. \nEXT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT \nWills stands with Patty in the driveway in front of the glass lobby. He is distracted and terribly anxious. She looks as though she expects, at the very least, a kiss -- \nPATTY Thank you so much. I had such a great time. \nWILLS Good. I'm... I'm glad. \nPATTY Didn't you? \nWILLS Patty, I... I want to be honest with you... right now, from the start... so there's no room for misunderstanding. I didn't have a good time, but it's nothing personal. I just split up with someone and rather than admit to myself how much I miss her, I asked you out instead. And it's unfair. If I feel sad I should just feel sad and not try to use you... and your body... as some sort of painkiller, right? (beat) Anyway, I think you're a warm and engaging woman and I wish you all the best. \nRelieved to have unburdened himself of the truth, he shakes her hand. Patty, utterly baffled, doesn't know what hit her. \nEXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- LATER \nThe doorman Michael, smoking a cigarette, sees Wills walk up, his expression pensive. \nMICHAEL Mr. Keane -- \nWILLS Good night, Michael. \nMICHAEL You've got a visitor. \nWills stops and turns -- \nWILLS Who? \nMICHAEL She's been waitin' almost an hour. In the lobby. (off Wills' look) A little surprise for ya. \nHe winks. Wills realizes that it's Charlotte. It must be. He smiles and hurries inside. \nINT. WILLS' LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS \nWills bursts in and freezes. A WOMAN stands across the way, studying an oil painting. She turns quickly. It's LISA. She sees his excited expression fall. Beneath her rather composed facade, Lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions -- \nLISA Sorry to disappoint you. \nWILLS No, no. Not at all. You surprised me, that's all. I didn't expect to see you... not here... not after your letter. \nLISA Well, I didn't expect you to show up at my job. \nWILLS I followed you in. I wasn't even sure it was you. All I have is an old snapshot. \nLooking down from the second-floor landing, we see Charlotte enter and walk up the stairs toward us. \nAs she reaches the landing, she feels a STABBING PAIN IN HER CHEST and stops walking. Wincing, she waits for the pain to subside. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nCharlotte enters wearily, drops her purse on the floor, then turns and GASPS. \nWills lies sprawled in an armchair fully dressed, sound asleep. \nCharlotte is offended by the intrusion. She hurries over to awaken him. But then she stops. Her face softens slightly. \nShe studies his face... touches his cheek with the back of her hand... traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip.. smooths back a wisp of hair. \nFinally, snapping to, steeling herself, she jostles him -- \nCHARLOTTE Hey. \nWills wakes with a violent start. When he sees her, he drops his head back. He closes his eyes again and murmurs sleepily -- \nWILLS Where were you? I was worried. \nCHARLOTTE So worried you fell asleep. What're you doing here? \nWILLS I've missed you. You have no idea how much. \nShe crosses coldly to her closet and, half-shutting the door, blocking his view, starts to undress. \nCHARLOTTE How'd you get in? \nHe sits up, rubbing his eyes in the morning light. \nWILLS Dolly. We watched TV. She fell asleep. What time is it? \nCHARLOTTE I didn't know I had a curfew. \nWILLS Where were you? \nCHARLOTTE None of your business. So what is it? What do you want? \nWills sits forward, more alert now. He exhales heavily and begins: \nWILLS To tell you that you were right. I do hate myself. But not so much that I can't see how stupid and despicable and -- \nCHARLOTTE Cowardly. \nWILLS And cowardly what I did was. And even though there's no excuse for it, I want you to forgive me. \nShe turns and looks at him. She feels herself relenting. She turns away and continues undressing -- \nCHARLOTTE Why should I? \nWILLS Because, for better or worse, I'm falling in love with you, and the thought of our not being together is unbearable to me. \nShe stops, then glances at him with a flash of pain and longing. Determined not to surrender to her feelings, she crosses to the bed and throws open the covers. \nCHARLOTTE Let's sleep. \nShe crawls into bed. \nCHARLOTTE In the morning, we'll talk about what a gigantic asshole you are. \nWills, relieved, crosses to the bed and begins to undress. He asks casually -- \nWILLS So where were you? \nCHARLOTTE With Shannon and Simon and Eric. \nWILLS Who's Eric? \nCHARLOTTE An old friend who used to work at Blockbuster. \nWILLS What'd you guys do? \nCHARLOTTE Talked and drank. Simon and Shannon finally went home. Eric and I hung out. \nThinking nothing of it, Wills nods. He slips into bed. Her back is to him. He drapes an arm around her and pulls her a little closer. \nHe smiles contentedly and closes his eyes. But then something occurs to him. He opens his eyes -- \nWILLS Hung out where? \nCHARLOTTE Stop. We'll talk about it tomorrow. \nWILLS Fine. \nHe closes his eyes again. A few beats later, they open. \nINT. MACDONALD'S -- DAY \nWills sits with John, Sarah, and the twins at a plastic table overrun with food, wrappers, and squashed condiment tubes. Sarah speaks to Wills -- \nSARAH Judge you? Why would I? Screw the age difference -- I like the new you! Before Charlotte came along, do you have any idea how hard it was to get you to sit down for a Happy Meal? \nWills and John laugh. Molly, one of the twins, chimes in -- \nMOLLY Uncle Wills, how come you don't get married? \nJOHN Yeah, how come, Uncle Wills? \nWILLS I want to, Carla, but -- \nMOLLY I'm not Carla! I'm Molly! \nWILLS Well, Molly, I just haven't met the right woman yet. \nCARLA What about Charlotte? She's funny- pretty. \nSARAH (aside to Wills) It means funny and pretty. It's their highest compliment. \nWILLS I agree. (rising from the table) She's also demanding. \nJOHN Where're you goin'? \nWILLS She's decided she wants her birthday present today. \nWills gives both of the little girls hugs and kisses. \nJOHN But that was last month. \nWILLS The Dom didn't count. This is her real present. She chose it herself and it's not material. \nJOHN Now you got me curious. \nSARAH Yeah, what is it? \nWills shakes his head and smiles, reluctant to answer. \nFrom the next scene we hear the sound of TWO DOZEN PEOPLE BREATHING FURIOUSLY. \nINT. STUDIO -- AFTERNOON \nOn a slightly elevated stage, HARI SINGH, 35, an American Sikh wearing a white robe and turban, sits in the lotus position before a lighted candle, softly instructing the crowded class -- \nHARI Okay... breath of fire... now inhale deeply... hold the breath... let your heart lotus blossom... feel the energy rise... and exhale. Good. Now peacock pose. \nHari rolls forward, digs his elbows into his midsection, and pops up so that he is parallel to the floor with his legs still crossed. \nANGLE ON THE CLASS, all moving into the pose. In the center of the class are Wills and Charlotte, wearing sweats. His arms shaking, Wills is clearly in pain. He mutters -- \nWILLS When does the enlightenment start? \nCHARLOTTE When you realize that I'm God. \nWills laughs. A moment later, Charlotte winces and falls out of the pose onto the mat. Hari looks over, confused -- \nHARI Are you all right? \nCharlotte sits up quickly, smiling -- \nCHARLOTTE Yeah. No big deal. Cramp in the old fifth shakra! \nShe glances over at Wills. He sees that she's scared to death. He helps her to her feet, speaking softly in her ear -- \nWILLS Don't worry. You're gonna be okay. \nShe nods. They move toward the door. But after a few steps, her eyes flutter, her body goes limp, and she slams down on the mat, UNCONSCIOUS. \nINT. SPEEDING AMBULANCE -- AFTERNOON \nCharlotte lies on a stretcher near Wills and a PARAMEDIC -- \nCHARLOTTE It's no big deal. I just hyperventilated. Really. \nBut then she gasps as she's hit by a stab of pain. Wills throws a grave look at the medic and squeezes her hand more tightly. \nEXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT \nThe building is brightly illuminated against the night sky. \nINT. ST. VINCENT'S WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWills sits, anxiously struggling with a half-finished crossword puzzle. He hears the click of a lighter. A GRUBBY LITTLE MAN standing by the coffee machine lights a generic cigarette. \nWILLS Excuse me... do you have an extra one of those? \nHe considers for a moment, then, tears welling in his eyes, he lifts her hand to his mouth and kisses it. \nINT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nWills sits across from Simon who strokes Shannon's back as she weeps -- \nSHANNON It just didn't seem real and now that it is, I hate it! It's so unfair! \nDolores, sitting in her armchair, mutters as though by rote -- \nDOLLY Fare is what you pay on the train to Jersey. Fair is the place that smells like manure where, if you're real lucky, you win a blue ribbon for your home-made pickles. Fair is a sky without a cloud and a face with a mark. Fare is food. What fair isn't is everything else. \nSIMON Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we've heard quite enough from Dolores. \nDolores chuckles. Simon continues to Wills -- \nSIMON Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe what you're saying is that while the end may be in sight, it has not yet arrived. \nWILLS That's right. The tumor's begun to interfere with the function of her heart, but she -- \nSIMON Then why exactly have you called us here? \nWills falters, looking at him incredulously. \nSIMON I cut short a lunch date, Shannon's missing her low-impact aerobics class, and Dolores has delayed the start of her happy hour -- surely you must have had good reason. \nWILLS I thought Charlotte's health might be of some interest you. \nSIMON It is. You could have told me all about it on the telephone. \nWILLS I also thought it might be a good idea if we discussed ways to make her as comfortable as possible for the -- \nSIMON Charlotte loathes comfortable. I never sought to bore her with comfort while she was well, why should I start now that she's sick? \nWills stares at Simon, his face ashen and full of contempt -- \nWILLS Tell me, are you really so cold? Or is it just a pose that you've cultivated? \nSIMON It's a pose that I've cultivated. (beat) I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months. \nPause. \nWILLS I'm sorry. \nSIMON It's quite all right. But, honestly, it shocks me how often you people forget. Our phone books have as many numbers crossed out as written in. So that while death is certainly as painful to us as it is to you, we do not find it nearly so... extraordinary. (beat) Don't misunderstand me. I adore Charlotte and when she dies, I would... were it not already in that state... cry my heart dry. \nShannon looks at Simon and burst into tears again. Simon holds her even closer, rubbing her back. \nMUSIC UP: \nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHTFALL \nWills emerges from Charlotte's brownstone, hails a cab, then decides against it. \nEXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHTFALL \nHead down, eyes desolate, Wills walks uptown. The roaring traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon -- the great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him. \nHe can think only of Charlotte. \nEXT. HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nWills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red. \nINT. HELL'S KITCHEN WALK-UP FOYER -- NIGHT \nWills enters, checks the tenant list, then presses a buzzer. He speaks into the intercom and a moment later is buzzed up. \nINT. WALK-UP STAIRWELL -- NIGHT \nFOLLOW WILLS, running up the stairs. He arrives at a door, cold and gasping for breath. He hears footsteps. \nTHE DOOR OPENS, but we do not see who is there. \nMUSIC OUT: \nINT. WALK-UP LIVING ROOM -- LATER \nWills paces, speaking desperately to someone. He seems on the verge of a total nervous collapse -- \nWILLS She's in the hospital now. She doesn't have long. Weeks maybe and -- She... Anyway, I have something to ask you. A favor. I have no right to ask. I know. I'd do it myself, but I can't. I'm too... I'm... \nHe takes a deep breath to keep himself from crying. \nANGLE ON LISA, his daughter, sitting on the couch, listening, her face unreadable -- \nLISA What is it? \nHe smiles at her. And she smiles back. \nINT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- MORNING \nCharlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest. She opens her eyes. The room seems strange. It's the light. \nShe rises up and turns around. Her eyes narrow with curiosity. She crawls out of bed and runs to the window and looks out. \nShe can't believe her eyes. Central Park is blanketed by deep snow and more is falling. She calls out gaily -- \nCHARLOTTE Hey! How do you feel about Christmas? \nWILLS (sleepily) Bah humbug... \nShe runs back, laughing, and jumps on the bed, rousting him. \nMUSIC UP: \nA SEQUENCE BEGINS showing Charlotte and Wills during a day of holiday shopping. The deep snow has slowed the city to a crawl but filled everyone with good spirits. \nCharlotte and Wills move from store to store; they buy wreaths, garlands, ornaments, candles, and, finally, a CHRISTMAS TREE and STAND. \nWills starts to lug the tree, but when it's obvious that it's too much for him, Charlotte spots a GROUP OF KIDS spilling out of a record store. \nThe next thing we know the kids are lined up, carrying the tree over their heads like a battalion of ants. \nWills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator and squeeze in. There's no room for Charlotte. She'll take the lobby elevator. \nMUSIC OUT: \nINT. LOBBY ELEVATOR -- AFTERNOON \nCharlotte, carrying shopping bags, ascends in silence with Michael. She has no interest in chatting. He, as ever, does. \nMICHAEL Will you and Mister Keane be goin' away for the holidays? \nCHARLOTTE I doubt it. \nMICHAEL I've seen so little of America. I don't care for airplanes, you see, and I have so little time to travel. (beat) Did Mister Keane enjoy his trip then? \nCHARLOTTE What trip? \nMICHAEL Why, just yesterday. \nCHARLOTTE I wouldn't really call that a trip. \nMICHAEL Perhaps not. But I've never been to Ohio myself. They say parts of it are quite lovely. \nCharlotte goes pale. The elevator stops and he opens the door. \nINT. WILLS' FOYER -- CONTINUOUS \nCharlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing and laughing. Each holds a five-dollar bill -- \nMICHAEL (calling out) All right, you little hellions! Get in here! \nINT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nCharlotte wanders in. The tree stands erect. Wills, on all fours, tightens the screws on the stand. He crawls to his feet and studies it. \nWILLS Straight? \nThen he sees her grave expression and freezes. \nCHARLOTTE I thought we had a deal. \nWILLS I'm sure we do. About what? \nCHARLOTTE Lying. (beat) You were in Ohio yesterday. \nWills stares at her for a moment, then explains without apology -- \nWILLS I met with a heart specialist. He's willing to operate. \nFor an instant she is surprised, but then her indignation takes over -- \nCHARLOTTE But you know I don't want that! You know I've signed papers that -- \nWILLS Well, maybe I want it. \nCHARLOTTE It isn't your decision! \nWILLS Of course not, but if you'll hear me out -- \nCHARLOTTE No! I told you right from the start how I felt and you went behind my back! You lied and -- \nWILLS (exploding) Oh, Christ, knock it off! You're such a god damn saint, so above it all, but you're scared to death! You do want to live! And if you were as honest as you say you are you'd let the doctors do whatever they can to help you! \nTHE STAR LIGHTS UP. He jumps down and puts the chair away. Then he runs over and dims the lights -- \nWILLS Finishing touches! \nHe runs over and adjusts a garland. He runs back to the dimmer and adjusts it again -- \nWILLS Almost! \nHe runs back to the bedroom door and flings it open. \nWILLS Voila! \nHe looks into the room and freezes in the doorway. He backs up a step, then, crying out, lunges into the room. \nMUSIC UP: \nEXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- NIGHT \nCharlotte, lying unconscious on a stretcher, wearing an oxygen mask, is rushed into a waiting ambulance. Wills, beside himself with panic, is gently barred by a MEDIC from jumping in with her. \nINT. NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT \nIn the reflection of a projected slide, a hand offers a CELLULAR PHONE to Dr. Grandy, standing at a lectern in front of a group of doctors. He stops his lecture and takes the call. \nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT \nThe ambulance rushes, light flashing, sirens wailing, downtown. \nINT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL -- NIGHT \nCharlotte's stretcher is rushed into the emergency room at the same time that Wills' cab pulls up. \nEXT. NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT \nGrandy is rushed into a MEDICAL HELICOPTER. \nINT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWills looks up and sees Dolores and Shannon arrive. \nEXT. SKY -- NIGHT \nGrandy's helicopter speeds toward the City. \nINT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWills comforts Shannon. Dolores looks up and sees Simon standing in the doorway. Then a CORONARY CARE NURSE appears. She asks to speak to Wills. \nINT. MEDICAL HELICOPTER -- NIGHT \nGrandy looks out the window as the helicopter swoops down toward the lights of lower Manhattan. \nINT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT \nCharlotte lies, semi-conscious, on a gurney. Wills appears in the doorway with the nurse. \nEXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT \nThe helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out. \nMUSIC OUT: \nINT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT \nWills sits down next to Charlotte's bed. He touches her hand. Her eyes open then close again. Her breathing is heavy and labored. \nWills pushes a lock of hair off her brow, then whispers, half to himself -- \nWILLS Time cannot break the bird's wing from the bird. Bird and wing together Go down, one feather. No thing that ever flew, not the lark, not you, Can die as others do. \nCharlotte's eyes open dreamily. She shows a faint smile at the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly -- \nCHARLOTTE What have I done to you? \nWILLS Ruined me for other women. \nCHARLOTTE No... I saved you for them... \nHer eyes close. Wills takes her hand and presses it to his cheek. \nMALE VOICE Is she type 'n' cross for six units?! \nNURSE'S VOICE Yes, Doctor. \nWills turns around and sees Grandy standing in the doorway. \nGRANDY What're we waiting for? \n", "test1_input": "He begins to undress. His hands are uncertain as he untucks his shirt and unbuckles his belt. When he is finished undressing, he turns to face her, his arms at his side. \nAlthough we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows, Charlotte can. She looks down at his naked body and studies it. He stares back with shy wariness. \nThen she breaks into a crooked grin -- \nCHARLOTTE What's the matter, old man? Can't afford a gym? \nWILLS That's it! \nLaughing, he grabs her wrists and throws her on the bed. She dissolves into paroxysms of laughter. \nINT. WILLS BEDROOM -- LATER \nWills and Charlotte make love. As their passion builds, Charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest. \nShe grabs his back, her face twists. She holds her breath, not wanting to reveal the incident to Wills. She closes her eyes and exhales as the pain subsides. \nINT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- LATER \nWills and Charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the city glimmering in the distance. \nCharlotte's head rests on his chest. Eyes closed, he brushes his hand along her face as though he were a blind man committing every detail to memory. \nCharlotte's voice, almost inaudible, drifts up through the dark -- \nCHARLOTTE \"Counting the beats, Counting the slow heart beats, The bleeding to death of time In slow heart beats, Wakeful they lie.\" \nWills, half-asleep, murmurs deeply -- \nWILLS So many words in that wonderful head of yours... \nCHARLOTTE If I could give you anything in the whole world, that's what it would be. \nWILLS Words? \nCHARLOTTE Poetry. \nThey lie in silence. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- LATE AFTERNOON \nDusk falls on the park. Charlotte, red-cheeked and happy, carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze. \nShe smiles at a BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS, dressed in HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, being led on their trick or treating. \nINT. ELYSIUM REAR OFFICE -- AFTERNOON \nWills sits at a desk, reading the newspaper. John, inspecting a KING HENRY VIII COSTUME on a hanger, shouts into the telephone -- \nJOHN Oh no, your boy made it! At ten minutes before close! All night I got a card announcing a halibut special, only I got no halibut! Now it's Sunday and I got three dozen cats lickin' their chops in the alley! Tony, I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna -- MAN, GO TO HELL! \nHe slams down the phone. His face is beet red. Wills looks up calmly from his paper -- \nWILLS Are you familiar with the phrase, \"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?\" \nJOHN Are you familiar with the phrase, \"Mind your own god damn business?\" \nWILLS Sure, it's from Poor Richard's Almanac. But the last time I checked -- \nJOHN No, your business is to smile, make friends, and get rich! My business is the business. \nJohn heads out, then stops abruptly and looks back. His tone is suddenly calm and curious -- \nJOHN What're you doin' here, anyway? You got a girl. Go home. Carve a pumpkin. \nWILLS We can't spend every waking moment together. \nJohn looks at him strangely, with a hint of suspicion -- \nJOHN Why not? (pause) No, seriously. Why not? \nWills has no answer. John moves closer when Celia, his new assistant, enters cheerily -- \nCELIA Special delivery! \nShe tosses him a paper bag; he catches it. \nWILLS No trouble? \nCELIA None. \nWills removes a PAIR OF RED PLASTIC HORNS. John shakes his head with disbelief. \nJOHN Every year. You got no imagination. \nWILLS It's a classic. A little spirit gum and voila! \n", "test1_true": "WILLS -- young women are rendered helpless. \nCELIA It's true. I see a guy with horns growing out of his head and my knees go weak. \nWILLS Of course -- it's biological. \nThey share a laugh. A flirtatious charge passes between them. She blushes slightly and exits. John looks suspiciously at Wills. \nJOHN What's goin' on? \nWILLS What do you mean? \nJOHN At home. \nWills smiles at him as though he were insane -- \nWILLS Nothing. Honestly. We're having a lot of fun. We're very happy. \nFrom the next scene, we hear Charlotte laughing -- \nCHARLOTTE'S VOICE Don't come in! Don't! \nINT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nA fire burns in the fireplace. Still wearing his coat, wills stands by the mantel, sorting through a stack of mail -- \nWILLS I'm not even tempted! \nCHARLOTTE'S VOICE (from another room) I'll be right out! \nOlivia enters with a steamy mug -- \nOLIVIA You like hot cider? \nWILLS Sure, thanks. \nShe carefully takes his coat off him as he sips the cider -- \nWILLS Mmmm. \nOLIVIA Charlotte made it. I just poured it in the cup. \nShe exits. As Wills sips the drink, he sits on the leather sofa and continues to glance through his mail. \nSuddenly, shocked, he stops on a letter. He sets his mug down. He hears Charlotte making noise in the next room. He opens the letter and begins to read. \nHis eyes dart down the page, but he quickly sees that the letter is not friendly. His face shows disappointment. \nHe hears footsteps in the hall. He folds the letter up, slips it back into its envelope, and jams it in his back pocket. \nCharlotte enters and throws her hands out to her side -- \nCHARLOTTE Ta-da! \nShe stands before him, dressed in a WHITE SPINSTERLY VICTORIAN OUTFIT with braids coiled at her ears. Wills smiles with appreciation -- \nWILLS Incredible. \nCHARLOTTE Don't I look just like her? \nWILLS Absolutely incredible. \nPause. \nCHARLOTTE You have no idea who I am. \nWILLS Give me a hint. \nCHARLOTTE \"Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul.\" \nWILLS Was that the hint? \nCHARLOTTE You dummy! Emily Dickinson! Only the greatest American female poet ever! \nShe hugs and kisses him -- \nCHARLOTTE Uncultured swine. \nWILLS The truth is out. I've lost you forever. \nCHARLOTTE Wanna bet? \nShe lays her head on his chest, smiling contentedly. A subtle shadow of apprehension passes over Wills' features. Eyes closed, she asks -- \nCHARLOTTE When do I get to see your costume? \nEXT. BROOKLYN BROWNSTONE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT \n", "test2_input": "A cardboard ghost hangs on the door. A Jack-o'-lantern grins in the window. A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing. \nINT. BROOKLYN LIVING ROOM -- SAME \nJohn's wife, Sarah, dressed as QUEEN ELIZABETH, walks through the crowd, picking up empty glasses and bottles. \nAs she moves among COSTUMED GUESTS and their CHILDREN, we notice a few of Elysium's customers and staff, including Celia, dressed as GLINDA, talking to the maitre d', Jesus, dressed as a COWBOY -- \nJESUS No, I think we make a great couple. A good witch and a bad hombre. That could make for some very interesting sex. \nCelia laughs. \nINT. BROOKLYN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nWills stands off to the side, wearing his devil's horns, sipping a drink, watching an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY bob for apples, while other BOYS and GIRLS cheer him on. \nJohn, wearing his king costume, supervises, as the boy, wildly sputtering, struggles to bite into a renegade Granny Smith. \nJOHN O, Ricky, chill out! You're gonna get snot in the water! \nThe boy laughs even harder. John facetiously grabs his collar -- \nJOHN That's it -- outta the pool! \nThe boy, choking with laughter, plunges his face into the water again. Sarah enters and calls out over the din -- \nSARAH Where're the girls? I thought you were tucking them in! \nJOHN We got a volunteer! \nSarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell. \nShe sees Wills standing there. Watching the kids, his eyes are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she noticed at the toy store -- \nShe gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as she passes by and disappears upstairs. \nFinally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends. \nThen he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites out of it until he uncovers a SILVER DOLLAR. \nWills laughs at the kids' excitement. A moment later a WOMAN'S GLOVED HANDS cover his eyes. \nWOMAN Guess who? \nWills feels her LONG GLOVES. \nWILLS Wonder Woman? \nWOMAN No. \nWILLS Batgirl? \nWOMAN I'll give you a hint. You dumped me. \nWILLS Princess Di? \nShe laughs and playfully strangles him. \nWILLS Wendy? \nHe turns and sees that it's the woman from the film's opening, dressed as HOLLY GOLIGHTLY. \nWILLS Yup, I'd know that throttle anywhere! \nINT. BROOKLYN SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY -- SAME \nSarah stops silently at an AJAR DOOR and looks inside. Charlotte sits on a bed between the twin girls who are nestled up against her -- \nMOLLY Just one more. \nCARLA Please? \nCHARLOTTE All right, but this is the last last one! \nShe clears her throat and settles herself. The twins listen with rapt attention as she recites from memory, slowly as though it were a suspenseful bedtime story -- \nCHARLOTTE \"Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality. We slowly drove, he knew no haste, And I had put away My labor, and my leisure too, For his civility.\" \nCharlotte looks up and sees Sarah, who face is beaming with affection. They share a smile and Charlotte keeps reciting -- \nCHARLOTTE \"We passed the school where children played At wrestling in a ring; We passed the fields of grazing grain, We passed the setting sun.\" \nSarah eases the door shut and steps away. \nINT. BROOKLYN LIVING ROOM -- HOUR LATER \nTHE CAMERA makes a CIRCUIT of the THINNING CROWD. Sarah blows out candles, dumps ash trays, and collects empties. \n", "test2_true": "CELIA Sweet dreams? \nCHARLOTTE I had no idea I was so tired. \nSARAH (from across the room) They're down? \nCHARLOTTE And out. (looking around) Where's Lucifer? \nJESUS (jokingly) Last time I saw him, he was in the kitchen going pretty heavily with Holly Golightly. \nCELIA Hey, no gossip! Holly's a valued customer. \nCharlotte pretends to be fighting mad -- \nCHARLOTTE Lemme at 'er! \nJESUS Hell hath no fury like a recluse scorned. \nCharlotte laughs and heads to the kitchen. \nINT. BROOKLYN KITCHEN -- SAME \nJohn wipes down the table which is littered with bits of apple. \nCHARLOTTE Hey, shouldn't one of your minions be doing that? \nJOHN You know, in my day, you bobbed for the apple, and, sure, maybe there was a nickel inside it and that was sweet -- but you ate the god damn apple! These little animals grab the coin and they're out the door! \nCHARLOTTE -- off to buy crack! \nJOHN Exactly my point. \nThey share a laugh. \nCHARLOTTE Seen Beelzebub around? \nJOHN The Prince of Darkness? \nCHARLOTTE Uh-huh. \nJOHN Yeah, he went upstairs. \nCharlotte is puzzled. \nINT. BROOKLYN SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY -- LATER \nCharlotte walks down the hall, opening doors and glancing inside. She opens a bathroom and THREE CATS dash out. \nCHARLOTTE Shit. \nShe gets to the end of the hall and is about to give up. When she hears FOOTSTEPS. \nShe walks around the corner and sees a NARROW STAIRCASE leading to the third floor. \nAt the dark at the top of the stairs Wills and Wendy appear. Charlotte smiles -- \nCHARLOTTE You lost your horns. \nWILLS Hey, looking for me? \nCHARLOTTE Uh-huh. \nWILLS We were checking out the roof. John's got quite a set-up. \nThey arrive at the bottom of the stairs. \nWILLS Wendy, this is Charlotte Fielding. Charlotte -- my friend Wendy Lister. \nThey smile and shake hands. Charlotte looks at them both carefully for any sign of uneasiness. There is none. \nWENDY Actually, I saw you at that memorial service in Connecticut. Your eulogy was beautiful. \nCHARLOTTE Thank you. \nWENDY (re: her outfit) Betsy Ross, right? \nCHARLOTTE You guessed it. \nWills smiles and rubs his hands together -- \nWILLS Is the party over? \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT \nA TOWN CAR speeds toward Manhattan. \nINT. TOWN CAR -- SAME \n", "test3_input": "CHARLOTTE But I want everything from you, Wills. I rely on you in every way. \nWILLS I know. \nCHARLOTTE So the only reason you don't dump me is because I'm sick? Because you know that it's all going to be over, anyway? \nWILLS Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way. (beat) It feels as though I'm not afraid anymore. \nShe looks at him and smiles. He puts an arm around her and draws her close. \nINT. TAXI -- AFTERNOON \nWills looks out the window, his arm draped around Charlotte who lies nestled against him, eyes closed. \nHe suddenly sees something. He thinks. Checks his watch. His eyes ignite and he calls out excitedly to the driver -- \nWILLS Driver! Quick! Pull over here! Right here! \nCharlotte, a little sleepy, comes to. She looks out the window and her face softens with happiness. \nEXT. THE BRICK CHURCH, 92ND AND PARK -- SAME \nOn the steps of the old church a CHOIR sings Christmas carols. All around them, a LARGE CROWD sings along. \nWills and Charlotte get out of the cab. His arm around her, Wills pulls her into the crowd. They join the carol. Wills sings well. Charlotte is tone deaf. \nIn between lines of the song, she calls out -- \nCHARLOTTE I didn't know you could sing! \nWILLS I didn't know you couldn't! \nShe laughs and continues to sing. \nTHE CAROLS ENDS to cheers and applause. THE CHOIRMASTER steps forward to a microphone -- \nCHOIRMASTER Well, you all know what time it is! \nCHARLOTTE (confused to Wills) No, I don't. Do you? \nHe grins. The choirmaster nods at someone in the distance. Then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count down. The crowd joins in -- \nCHOIRMASTER AND CROWD TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE! \nAt that instant, ALL THE WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS on the trees of the median from 96th Street to 44th Street POP ON SIMULTANEOUSLY -- an enchanted fairy-tale spectacle. \nThe crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns. Charlotte's eyes are filled with happy wonder. \nCHOIRMASTER HAPPY HOLIDAYS! \nAs another carol begins, Wills wraps his arms around Charlotte and kisses her. He pulls away, looks deeply into her eyes, and whispers with passionate sincerity -- \nWILLS I love you, Charlotte. \nFor an instant, her eyes flare as though she were surprised. Then her eyes fill with tears. She tries to speak but she is choked by a sob. \nShe buries her face in his chest and cries. Wills smiles with warm, almost paternal, indulgence. He strokes her hair. She hugs him as though she'll never let go. \nINT. ELYSIUM -- NIGHT \nThe restaurant is packed. John, overwhelmed by the crowd waiting for tables, glances angrily away when he hears the phone ringing and no one answering it. \nINT. ELYSIUM KITCHEN -- SAME \nAmid the Pandemonium, Wills watches as Charlotte teases HENRY, 30, the young chef, as he lays the beet garnishes on a fish entree. \nCHARLOTTE You call that a rose? It looks more like a hand grenade! \nHENRY Mr. Keane, you get her outta here or, I swear to God, I'm gonna butterfly and stuff her! \nWILLS I'll add it to the specials list. \nCHARLOTTE (laughing) No way! I'm too pricey! \nThe door bangs open. John enters, looking angry -- \nCHARLOTTE Hello, Sunshine! \nJOHN You seen Celia? \nWILLS What's the matter? \nJOHN The matter is I got a half-hour wait and no help up front! You got a call on Two! \nINT. ELYSIUM OFFICE -- SAME \nWills enters, picks up the phone, and hits a flashing button-- \n", "test3_true": "INT. LISA'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING \nLisa's face is flushed with excitement -- \nLISA I've got him! \nEXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- MORNING \nA TOWN CAR is parked out front. Michael, the doorman, chats with the driver. \nLISA (V.O.) His name's Tom Grandy. Harvard undergrad. Columbia Medical School. He's at the Cleveland Clinic. I know, I know. But don't laugh. It's one of the best in the world. \nWills exits the building and gets into the car. \nEXT. QUEENS -- MORNING \nThe town car speeds down the expressway. \nLISA (V.O.) He did his residency at the Brigham in Boston... his cardiac surgery training at Cleveland. \nEXT. LA GUARDIA AIRPORT -- MORNING \nWills walks quickly through the terminal. \nLISA (V.O.) He was so good they kept him on and within three years he was chief of the program. \nEXT. CLEVELAND CLINIC -- DAY \nWills gets out of a taxi and heads inside -- \nLISA (V.O.) He travels a lot. Spends lots of time lecturing. I got you an appointment tomorrow at twelve-thirty. Don't be late. He only has fifteen minutes. \nINT. CLEVELAND CLINIC CORRIDOR -- DAY \nTOM GRANDY, 35, long-hair, small beard, loose-limbed, wearing scrubs, saunters down the hall, wearing a vaguely goofy smile. Wills watches him approach with some apprehension. \nLISA (V.O.) The surgeon that recommended him said, and these are his words not mine, \"Don't let his appearance fool you. He's brilliant and has balls the size of your head.\" \nINT. GRANDY'S OFFICE -- SAME \nWills listens to Dr. Grandy who speaks casually, more like a benign hippie than a renowned surgeon. Charlotte's X-rays hang between them in an illuminated view box -- \nGRANDY Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit you. If she were a baby, she'd have a decent chance, 'cause these sorts of tumors can regress like crazy, but she's twenty and... I don't know, man... I've never seen anything like it. (pointing at the X- ray) I mean, look! It's wrapped around her vital structures like an octopus! (sitting) You know, just once I'd like to get sent something simple. A \"cabbage,\" a valve replacement. Even a good old- fashioned transplant. But it doesn't happen anymore. It's the downside of being good at my job. \nWILLS Good? They say there's no one better. \nGRANDY I don't know. I'm like most people. I do the best I can. \nWILLS Can your best save her? \nGRANDY Probably not. \nINT. CLEVELAND CLINIC CORRIDOR -- LATER \nGrandy and Wills walk together -- \nGRANDY In these sorts of cases, it's best if she signs a consent. \nWILLS (covering) No problem. \nGRANDY Good. (stopping at the main entrance) The last time Charlotte passed out, she regained consciousness almost immediately. The next time or the time after, she won't. When that happens, call me. (handing him a card) Here's my service. They'll reach me no matter where I am. In the meantime, I'll coordinate with Dr. Sibley. \nWILLS I can't thank you enough. \nGrandy smiles and pats him on the shoulder. \nGRANDY I haven't done anything yet. \nINT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nWills sits up, wearing glasses, reading a book. Charlotte enters from the bathroom wearing a flannel night shirt -- \nCHARLOTTE By the way -- where were you today? \nWILLS What do you mean? \nCHARLOTTE When you called I assumed you were at the restaurant, but when I called back later, Jesus said you hadn't been in all day. \nWILLS I was in Montclair, New Jersey. \nCHARLOTTE Why? \nWILLS (playfully vague) An opportunity. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, really? Sexual or professional? \nWILLS I was considering opening a restaurant. But the rents are too high. \n"}

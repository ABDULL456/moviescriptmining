{"test1_input": "WILLS (sipping his coffee) No, just plenty of it. How long will it take? \nCHARLOTTE A week or two. \nWILLS You have till Thursday. I'll need it here by seven o'clock. I'm at the Pembroke on Central Park West and 76th. \nCHARLOTTE Oh. Wow. Okay. \nWILLS What's your fee? \nCHARLOTTE (faltering) I don't really have one. I usually just make them for friends. \nWILLS How's five hundred dollars? \nCHARLOTTE Really? Wow. \nWILLS Charlotte? \nHis tone has abruptly shifted; it's intimately hushed. It both daunts and excites her -- \nCHARLOTTE Yeah? \nWILLS You say \"wow\" a lot. \nCHARLOTTE I know. \nWILLS It has to stop. You're a woman now. \nCHARLOTTE I know. \nWILLS Bye. \nCHARLOTTE Bye. \nShe clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. \nWills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. \nHe snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens as it is Caribbean -- \nOLIVIA See, now you got me worried. \nWILLS What do you mean? \nOLIVIA You slept alone last night. You must be sick or somethin'. You want me to call a doctor? \nWILLS Thank you, no, I'm fine. \nShe throws him a sly, sidelong glance, then exits. Wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee. \nFROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the sound of SQUEALING, LAUGHING, SHOUTING CHILDREN. \nINT. FAO SCHWARZ -- NIGHT \nSurrounded by swarming PARENTS and KIDS, Wills stands with John, the manager of Elysium, and his wife, SARAH VOLPE, 30, who, gazing out of frame, keeps a watchful eye on their kids -- \nJOHN Save it, pal! Don't even bother! I may not have gone to a fancy school like Bendover -- \nWILLS (to Sarah) That would be Andover. \nSARAH Sure, if his folks could have afforded it. \nJOHN -- but when Wills Keane comps three bottles of Dom to a twenty-year-old girl, then tells me he did it 'cause he likes the kid's grandma, I smell a rat! \nSARAH (looking around) Oh, is that what that is? I figured there was a dirty diaper somewhere. \nWILLS (lightly) Okay, I admit it, she interests me. \nJOHN (turning to Sarah) He's gonna do it! I don't believe it! He moved us back here for nothing! \nSARAH So much for that turned leaf. \nWILLS (amused) Come on, you're overreacting. \nJOHN Is that what you think? Buddy, since we hit town, I have done nothin' but cut you slack! Every week a new woman on your arm and I didn't say a word. Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're in the right demographic. Maybe by accident you'll trip over something substantial. But this little girl? Best she could be is Miss Right's daughter! \nWILLS (uneasily) I know. It's just that there's something about her. She's special... and I just thought -- \nSARAH \"She's young. She's hot. I'm on the verge of menopause. Why not go for it?\" \nWills and Sarah meet eyes. \nWILLS There wouldn't be much point in lying to you, would there? \nSarah shakes her head. \nKIDS' VOICES Mommy, Daddy, look, look! \n", "test1_true": "JOHN Hey, they're bigger than you are! \nJohn scoops both his daughters up in his arms and kisses them repeatedly. \nWills watches, his eyes filling with a vague, wistful envy. He sees Sarah staring at him. She smiles sympathetically. \nINT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nThe furniture is antique and dark. The white walls are tinged with yellow from years of cigarettes. In one corner, the paint has chipped off the ceiling in a jagged plate. \nDolores sits on a worn-out leather arm chair, smoking, sipping a cocktail, watching a DAYTIME TALK SHOW. \nIn the background, we see Charlotte working in the ADJOINING DINING ROOM which she has turned into a lovely sewing room. \nCLOSER ON CHARLOTTE. She builds her hat on a HAT BLOCK -- a wooden mannequin head. Strewn all around her are the materials of her hatmaking -- bolts of cloth, hat blocks, a sewing table. \nShannon, wearing sweats and a T-shirt, lies on the floor, eating M+M's and drinking diet soda, while heavily marking up a text book with a YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER. \nCharlotte stops and rubs her eyes, then she glances down at Shannon and smiles -- \nCHARLOTTE Why don't you mark what isn't important? That way you'll save ink. \nSHANNON Why don't you sew your mouth to my butt? That way you'll stop annoying me. \nThey both laugh. Overhearing, Dolores croaks facetiously -- \nDOLLY Now, now, if you two kids can't play nice -- \nShannon rolls over onto her back -- \nSHANNON God, I hate school. \nCharlotte pins a strip of black lace to the hat -- \nCHARLOTTE Oh, come on, just last week, you said you were on a roll. You loved it! \nSHANNON Well, now I'm on the rag and I hate it. \nCharlotte chuckles and sets the half-finished hat on her head. Still seated, she wheels her work chair over to a mirror -- \nCHARLOTTE I think you're incredibly lucky. I'd love to be going to college. \nShannon rolls over and looks at her. Suddenly her expression is inexplicably solemn -- \nSHANNON Am I the most spoiled brat in the world or what? \nCHARLOTTE Spoiled brats don't even ask questions like that. (re: the hat) What do you think? \nShe models the hat. Tears well in Shannon's eyes and she says without even a hint of irony or sentimentality -- \nSHANNON That you're the most beautiful person in the entire world. \nCharlotte smiles, looks away, and, trying not to cry, fusses with the hat. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- NIGHT \nA cold autumn rain falls. The Irish doorman, MICHAEL, 60's, melancholy, stoop-shouldered, smokes a cigarette, looking up at the unburdening sky. \nA LIMOUSINE pulls up. The passenger window glides down -- \nDRIVER Mikey! How ya doin'? \nDOORMAN A bit early, aren't you? \nDRIVER Hey, in this soup, better safe than sorry, you know what I mean? \nRUNNING FOOTSTEPS approach. Michael looks. The driver looks, too. \nIt's Charlotte, dressed in tattered jeans, a light rain coat, and sneakers, dashing at breakneck speed down the street, carrying something in a GARBAGE BAG. \nCHARLOTTE KEANE! \nShe runs right past Michael -- \nINT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT \nMichael works the shiny brass controls. Charlotte, winded, hair dripping wet, watches the numbers tick by overhead. Michael smiles at her with paternal fondness -- \nMICHAEL He's goin' to a fancy party tonight. \nCharlotte, nonplused by his lack of discretion, smiles politely -- \nCHARLOTTE Oh, really? \nINT. WILLS' PENTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER \nThe elevator doors open. \n", "test1_id": 1935, "test2_input": "A cardboard ghost hangs on the door. A Jack-o'-lantern grins in the window. A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing. \nINT. BROOKLYN LIVING ROOM -- SAME \nJohn's wife, Sarah, dressed as QUEEN ELIZABETH, walks through the crowd, picking up empty glasses and bottles. \nAs she moves among COSTUMED GUESTS and their CHILDREN, we notice a few of Elysium's customers and staff, including Celia, dressed as GLINDA, talking to the maitre d', Jesus, dressed as a COWBOY -- \nJESUS No, I think we make a great couple. A good witch and a bad hombre. That could make for some very interesting sex. \nCelia laughs. \nINT. BROOKLYN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS \nWills stands off to the side, wearing his devil's horns, sipping a drink, watching an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY bob for apples, while other BOYS and GIRLS cheer him on. \nJohn, wearing his king costume, supervises, as the boy, wildly sputtering, struggles to bite into a renegade Granny Smith. \nJOHN O, Ricky, chill out! You're gonna get snot in the water! \nThe boy laughs even harder. John facetiously grabs his collar -- \nJOHN That's it -- outta the pool! \nThe boy, choking with laughter, plunges his face into the water again. Sarah enters and calls out over the din -- \nSARAH Where're the girls? I thought you were tucking them in! \nJOHN We got a volunteer! \nSarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell. \nShe sees Wills standing there. Watching the kids, his eyes are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she noticed at the toy store -- \nShe gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as she passes by and disappears upstairs. \nFinally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends. \nThen he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites out of it until he uncovers a SILVER DOLLAR. \nWills laughs at the kids' excitement. A moment later a WOMAN'S GLOVED HANDS cover his eyes. \nWOMAN Guess who? \nWills feels her LONG GLOVES. \nWILLS Wonder Woman? \nWOMAN No. \nWILLS Batgirl? \nWOMAN I'll give you a hint. You dumped me. \nWILLS Princess Di? \nShe laughs and playfully strangles him. \nWILLS Wendy? \nHe turns and sees that it's the woman from the film's opening, dressed as HOLLY GOLIGHTLY. \nWILLS Yup, I'd know that throttle anywhere! \nINT. BROOKLYN SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY -- SAME \nSarah stops silently at an AJAR DOOR and looks inside. Charlotte sits on a bed between the twin girls who are nestled up against her -- \nMOLLY Just one more. \nCARLA Please? \nCHARLOTTE All right, but this is the last last one! \nShe clears her throat and settles herself. The twins listen with rapt attention as she recites from memory, slowly as though it were a suspenseful bedtime story -- \nCHARLOTTE \"Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality. We slowly drove, he knew no haste, And I had put away My labor, and my leisure too, For his civility.\" \nCharlotte looks up and sees Sarah, who face is beaming with affection. They share a smile and Charlotte keeps reciting -- \nCHARLOTTE \"We passed the school where children played At wrestling in a ring; We passed the fields of grazing grain, We passed the setting sun.\" \nSarah eases the door shut and steps away. \nINT. BROOKLYN LIVING ROOM -- HOUR LATER \nTHE CAMERA makes a CIRCUIT of the THINNING CROWD. Sarah blows out candles, dumps ash trays, and collects empties. \n", "test2_true": "CELIA Sweet dreams? \nCHARLOTTE I had no idea I was so tired. \nSARAH (from across the room) They're down? \nCHARLOTTE And out. (looking around) Where's Lucifer? \nJESUS (jokingly) Last time I saw him, he was in the kitchen going pretty heavily with Holly Golightly. \nCELIA Hey, no gossip! Holly's a valued customer. \nCharlotte pretends to be fighting mad -- \nCHARLOTTE Lemme at 'er! \nJESUS Hell hath no fury like a recluse scorned. \nCharlotte laughs and heads to the kitchen. \nINT. BROOKLYN KITCHEN -- SAME \nJohn wipes down the table which is littered with bits of apple. \nCHARLOTTE Hey, shouldn't one of your minions be doing that? \nJOHN You know, in my day, you bobbed for the apple, and, sure, maybe there was a nickel inside it and that was sweet -- but you ate the god damn apple! These little animals grab the coin and they're out the door! \nCHARLOTTE -- off to buy crack! \nJOHN Exactly my point. \nThey share a laugh. \nCHARLOTTE Seen Beelzebub around? \nJOHN The Prince of Darkness? \nCHARLOTTE Uh-huh. \nJOHN Yeah, he went upstairs. \nCharlotte is puzzled. \nINT. BROOKLYN SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY -- LATER \nCharlotte walks down the hall, opening doors and glancing inside. She opens a bathroom and THREE CATS dash out. \nCHARLOTTE Shit. \nShe gets to the end of the hall and is about to give up. When she hears FOOTSTEPS. \nShe walks around the corner and sees a NARROW STAIRCASE leading to the third floor. \nAt the dark at the top of the stairs Wills and Wendy appear. Charlotte smiles -- \nCHARLOTTE You lost your horns. \nWILLS Hey, looking for me? \nCHARLOTTE Uh-huh. \nWILLS We were checking out the roof. John's got quite a set-up. \nThey arrive at the bottom of the stairs. \nWILLS Wendy, this is Charlotte Fielding. Charlotte -- my friend Wendy Lister. \nThey smile and shake hands. Charlotte looks at them both carefully for any sign of uneasiness. There is none. \nWENDY Actually, I saw you at that memorial service in Connecticut. Your eulogy was beautiful. \nCHARLOTTE Thank you. \nWENDY (re: her outfit) Betsy Ross, right? \nCHARLOTTE You guessed it. \nWills smiles and rubs his hands together -- \nWILLS Is the party over? \nEXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT \nA TOWN CAR speeds toward Manhattan. \nINT. TOWN CAR -- SAME \n", "test2_id": 1936, "test3_input": "He considers for a moment, then, tears welling in his eyes, he lifts her hand to his mouth and kisses it. \nINT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON \nWills sits across from Simon who strokes Shannon's back as she weeps -- \nSHANNON It just didn't seem real and now that it is, I hate it! It's so unfair! \nDolores, sitting in her armchair, mutters as though by rote -- \nDOLLY Fare is what you pay on the train to Jersey. Fair is the place that smells like manure where, if you're real lucky, you win a blue ribbon for your home-made pickles. Fair is a sky without a cloud and a face with a mark. Fare is food. What fair isn't is everything else. \nSIMON Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we've heard quite enough from Dolores. \nDolores chuckles. Simon continues to Wills -- \nSIMON Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe what you're saying is that while the end may be in sight, it has not yet arrived. \nWILLS That's right. The tumor's begun to interfere with the function of her heart, but she -- \nSIMON Then why exactly have you called us here? \nWills falters, looking at him incredulously. \nSIMON I cut short a lunch date, Shannon's missing her low-impact aerobics class, and Dolores has delayed the start of her happy hour -- surely you must have had good reason. \nWILLS I thought Charlotte's health might be of some interest you. \nSIMON It is. You could have told me all about it on the telephone. \nWILLS I also thought it might be a good idea if we discussed ways to make her as comfortable as possible for the -- \nSIMON Charlotte loathes comfortable. I never sought to bore her with comfort while she was well, why should I start now that she's sick? \nWills stares at Simon, his face ashen and full of contempt -- \nWILLS Tell me, are you really so cold? Or is it just a pose that you've cultivated? \nSIMON It's a pose that I've cultivated. (beat) I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months. \nPause. \nWILLS I'm sorry. \nSIMON It's quite all right. But, honestly, it shocks me how often you people forget. Our phone books have as many numbers crossed out as written in. So that while death is certainly as painful to us as it is to you, we do not find it nearly so... extraordinary. (beat) Don't misunderstand me. I adore Charlotte and when she dies, I would... were it not already in that state... cry my heart dry. \nShannon looks at Simon and burst into tears again. Simon holds her even closer, rubbing her back. \nMUSIC UP: \nEXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHTFALL \nWills emerges from Charlotte's brownstone, hails a cab, then decides against it. \nEXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHTFALL \nHead down, eyes desolate, Wills walks uptown. The roaring traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon -- the great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him. \nHe can think only of Charlotte. \nEXT. HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nWills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red. \nINT. HELL'S KITCHEN WALK-UP FOYER -- NIGHT \nWills enters, checks the tenant list, then presses a buzzer. He speaks into the intercom and a moment later is buzzed up. \nINT. WALK-UP STAIRWELL -- NIGHT \nFOLLOW WILLS, running up the stairs. He arrives at a door, cold and gasping for breath. He hears footsteps. \nTHE DOOR OPENS, but we do not see who is there. \nMUSIC OUT: \nINT. WALK-UP LIVING ROOM -- LATER \nWills paces, speaking desperately to someone. He seems on the verge of a total nervous collapse -- \nWILLS She's in the hospital now. She doesn't have long. Weeks maybe and -- She... Anyway, I have something to ask you. A favor. I have no right to ask. I know. I'd do it myself, but I can't. I'm too... I'm... \nHe takes a deep breath to keep himself from crying. \nANGLE ON LISA, his daughter, sitting on the couch, listening, her face unreadable -- \nLISA What is it? \n", "test3_true": "Silence. \nLISA I'd be happy to do it. \nWills, stunned, deeply grateful, allows himself a breath. \nLISA Dad, I'm really sorry she's sick. \nWILLS (almost inaudible) I am, too. So sorry. I should be the one. It should be me. \nLisa, flooded with compassion, wants to go to him, comfort him, but she stays where she is. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CARL SCHURZ PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON \nThe darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze. Shadows descend from the trees and towering rocks. AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, reading a newspaper. A NANNY pushes a baby carriage past. \nWills and Charlotte walk together, bundled up again the cold. Charlotte walks backward, her breath shooting out into the cold air like smoke -- \nCHARLOTTE You never talk about my mother. (beat) Talk about her. \nWILLS What do you want to know? \nCHARLOTTE Everything. All I remember is that she smelled like vanilla, loved to read to me, and was really good at cutting up fruit. I couldn't believe she didn't cut her fingers off. \nWILLS Well, I remember a little more than that. Let's see... she was blonde... about your height -- \nCHARLOTTE I've seen pictures, dummy. \nWILLS Oh, okay. She... always ate her ice cream with a fork -- how's that? \nCHARLOTTE Much better. \nWILLS And she wrote great letters, but couldn't spell at all. \nCHARLOTTE Neither can I. \nWILLS She was a McGovern Democrat but also an incredible snob. She loved blueberries. She had the world's worst backhand. Her favorite singer was Stephen Stills. \nCHARLOTTE Who? \nWILLS Never mind. She was afraid of sharks. And, considering the times, she was pretty square. She only tried drugs once -- a lifeguard gave her a hash brownie and she threw it up all over him. \nCharlotte laughs. \nWILLS And she laughed just like that. And she bit her fingernails. And she couldn't tell a joke. (beat) In short, she was a unique. \nCharlotte smiles happily. \nEXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE -- MINUTES LATER \nWills and Charlotte lean down on the railing, watching the water purl and eddy around Randall's Island. \nCHARLOTTE Did you know she was in love with you? \nWILLS She told me. \nCHARLOTTE Were you in love with her? \nWILLS Yes. \nCHARLOTTE Why? Because she was the only girl in Rhode Island who wouldn't sleep with you? \nWILLS That's how she got my attention; it's not why I fell in love with her. (beat) I fell in love with her because she charmed me senseless day and night for an entire summer. \nCHARLOTTE Then why did you screw her best friend on Labor Day? \nWills looks at her darkly. She smiles and shrugs -- \nCHARLOTTE It's just a question. \nWills sighs and looks away, reflecting -- \nWILLS I have no idea. The summer was over. Your mom was going back to Smith. I was moving down here to work on Wall Street. It was our last day together. She was crying. She told me, for the first time, that she loved me. I said I loved her, too. I promised to call and visit. A few hours later I was in a cabana with Millie. (beat) When Millie told me she was pregnant and that she wanted to marry me, I escaped to L.A... and I never saw her or your mom again. \nCHARLOTTE (wryly) Well done. \nWILLS I think it's part of the reason I never came back. \nCHARLOTTE But why're you like that? What is it? I mean, you weren't born that way. \nWILLS I might as well have been. For as long as I can remember, I've always run off at the first sign of a woman wanting anything from me... relying on me in any way. \nShe considers for a moment -- \n", "test3_id": 1937}

{"test1_input": "\"I AM SAM\" \nScreenplay by \nKristine Johnson \nJessie Nelson \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nINT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M. \nWe're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets, blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry. \nWe move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling, uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes, they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars. \nSAM Double double decaf low-fat Cap. \nBRUCE You got it, buddy. \nSAM Good choice very good choice. \nSam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet 'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks. \nSAM (CONT'D) Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half low, half non.  Excellent choice.  Very good choice. \nHe stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches. \nGEORGE Sam, they called.  It's time for you to go. \nSam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Sam, did you hear me? \nSAM \"It's time for you to go.\" \nGEORGE Yes. \nSAM It's time. \nGEORGE Good luck. \nWithout another word, Sam walks straight out the door. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY \nSam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT BETWEEN THEM. \nSAM It's time.  It's time. \nSam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping. Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS. \nSAM (CONT'D) It's time, it's time for you to go. \nINT. HALLWAY - LATER \nSam plows down the hall and comes to room 324. \nSAM Rebecca! \nSam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL. \nREBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black Nurse, looks up from the monitor. \nGERTIE You the one responsible for this? \nSam nods, taking Gertie quite literally. \nSAM I'm sorry. \nGERTIE Too late for sorries, daddy, get over here and hold her hand. \nSam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS. \nNURSE You got a live one, Gert. \nINT. LABOR ROOM - LATER \n", "test1_true": "SAM (spins in circles) This is it!  This is it! \nDR. JAMISON And it's a girl... \nThe BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck. Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks over to Sam. \nGERTIE There's someone who's been waitin' an awful long time to see you, Sam. \nShe places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca, but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in quiet amazement: \nSAM This is it. \nGERTIE What's her name? \nSAM (looks at clock) Let me see let me see let me see. 12:17, March 2nd.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Recorded March 2nd.  1967. Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul McCartney.  Lucy Diamond Dawson. \nWe hear LIKE A LULLABY, \"Picture yourself on a boat in a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies...\" \nEXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING \nSam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around and no sign of her. Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He screams. \nSAM Becca!  Becca! \nThe more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding Lucy to his chest, devastated. \nWe hear, \"Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but she's gone.\" \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BUS - NIGHT \nSam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two against the world. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN \nA marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift bookshelves. \nBeatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an \"Hold Everything\" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a clothes line of baby clothes. \nThe sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back to sleep. \nSAM Didn't you just fall asleep, little girl? (Lucy cries harder) Okay, if you say it's time to get up, then it's time to get up, time to get up. (Sam sniffs the air) Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of business. \nHe rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with promotional buttons: one says \"Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals\", the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads \"Go, Lakers, Go!\"  Sam undoes it. \nSAM (CONT'D) Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me see let me see let me see. \nSam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to pin the buttons so that it at least stays on. \nSAM (CONT'D) You look very beautiful this morning, very beautiful. \nHe holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles. \nCUT TO: \nWe pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf: \nHUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS... \nINT. WALMART - DAY \nSam stares at the \"Great Wall of Diapers\", awed.  He reaches for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.  He stops.  Lucy WAILS.  WE HEAR THE SONG \"HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY\" \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 9 P.M. \nSam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 11:25 P.M. \nSam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.  He's exhausted, but she's just getting started.  He puts another blanket on her. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 1:30 A.M. \nPeace.  A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - \"YES!\"  He doesn't get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker. \n", "test1_id": 1629, "test2_input": "Hearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back. Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we -- \nINT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT \nSam on stage, with Ifty and Brad as his back-up singers, continuing the song in the oddest, most heartfelt version to Lucy who sits on Robert's lap and in heaven. \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nA beautiful blue sky.  And \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME. Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again... \nSam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and then disappears.  Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by MOTHERS and KIDS at the park. \nLUCY (V.O.) Daddy, where does the sky end? \nSAM (V.O.) Let me see, let me see.  I've never been there but they say it's somewhere near China. \nEXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER \nLucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FOUR, sitting on Sam's lap, swinging. \nLUCY (V.O.) Are lady bugs only girls or are there boys, too.  And if there are, what are they called? \nSAM (V.O.) The Beatles. \nEXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER \nThen Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FIVE, followed by Sam. \nLUCY (V.O.) Do I look more like you or Mommy? \nON SAM'S FACE \nHe knew this moment would come. \nINT. DENNY'S - THURSDAY NIGHT DINNER - EVENING \nLucy and Sam are having a serious talk over breaded Sole. \nLUCY If you and Mommy liked each other enough to have me, how come you're not together anymore? \nSAM I think she fell out of love with me. Not you, never you.  Me, just me. \nLUCY When you fall out of love where do you land? \nSAM Somewhere in Florida, I think. \nLUCY Do you think she'll ever come back? \nSAM (long pause) Paul McCartney lost his mother when he was fourteen.  John lost his mother twice.  First when Julie gave John to her sister Mimi to raise.  And then again when Julia was hit by a car.  They say God picks certain people, special people.  That's what they say. \nLucy takes this in.  Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just so... his potatoes just slightly to the left.  Lucy watches. \nLUCY Daddy, did God mean for you to be like this or was it an accident? \nSAM Do you mean - what do you mean? \nLUCY I mean you're different. \nSAM What do you mean?  I mean, what do you mean? \nLUCY You're not like the other daddies. \nSAM I'm not am I.  I'm sorry. \nLUCY Don't be sorry.  I'm lucky.  Nobody else's daddy ever comes to the park. \nON SAM'S FACE \nFilled with relief.  Bursting with love. \nSAM We are very lucky, aren't we? \nGrace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the side. \nGRACE Ice cream on the side. \nLUCY Not on top.  Not on top. \n", "test2_true": "INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - THURSDAY NIGHT VIDEO NIGHT \nSAM Brad, I know it was your turn.  I'm sure of it. \nBRAD I swear to God it was Robert's turn. \nROBERT Why is it always my fault? \nIFTY I keep track, last time, I say to myself, I say, write it down... Bank of America give away beautiful calendar, every month a picture of wild animal, look June, an Elk.  Elke Sommer...she starred in the remake of \"Prisoner of Zenda\"... Three stars Leonard Maltin video movie guide. \nAs they go on, Lucy matter-of-factly PULLS A VIDEO OUT OF HER BACKPACK, and puts it in the VCR.  She turns it on.  It's \"Kramer vs. Kramer\".  Everyone stops their arguing and stares at Lucy. \nLUCY Annie let me borrow it. \nINT. CHILDREN'S SHOE STORE - DAY \nA row of brand new children's shoes on display.  Lucy tries on dozens of school shoes, surrounded by Sam and her \"Godfathers\": Ifty, Brad and Robert. \nSAM You need a good sturdy school shoe. Arches are very important. \nIFTY Sturdy is boring.  Red shoes bring good luck. \nBRAD But red doesn't got with green. \nIFTY Except on Christmas. \nBRAD No brown clodhoppers.  Everyone will make fun of her. \nSAM NO ONE will make fun of Lucy. \nROBERT She might be stupid. \nIFTY No she's not -- \nROBERT Did they test her? \nBRAD You don't know for sure. \nSAM Yes I do. \nBRUCE But if she is, don't make her go to school. \nROBERT Don't let her in the lunch room.  Johnny Marzettie's there. \nBRAD And gym.  Get her a pass.  The rules for volleyball are so hard to remember. \"Rotate Rackman Rotate.\" \nIFTY Throw the ball at his forehead and the water on his brain will come out his nose. \nMeanwhile, Lucy has been trying on a simple brown shoe. \nLUCY I like these. \nSAM She know what she likes.  She likes these.  How much are they? \nSALESMAN Forty-nine ninety-nine. \nSAM One penny less than fifty.  These shoes are one penny less than fifty? \nLUCY It's okay, Dad.  I don't really like them. \nSAM No, no no no no. \nIFTY We'll all give ten dollars. \nBRAD I've only got three plus five.  But I need one for stamps. \nROBERT Don't pull your wad out in front of people. \nThey all dig in their pockets and begin counting very slowly. \nSAM Thank you, thank you.  We are rich in friends.  That's what our fortune cookie said.  1, 2, 3, 4, quarters that makes one. \nSALESMAN I'll count it. \nSAM Is it enough? \n", "test2_id": 1630, "test3_input": "SAM I won't let that happen. \nLUCY That's what her real mommy said.  And now they won't even let her talk to her. \nSam reels with confusion.  Lucy buries herself in his chest. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Daddy, it's the only way to be together. We'll start a new life, get new names. We'll live in a new apartment.  They'll never find us. \nThe bus has stopped.  Passengers for the park have exited. Sam doesn't move.  As the BUSDRIVER closes the door and heads on, he holds Lucy protectively to his chest. \nSAM I love you Lucy.  I love you. \nLUCY My name isn't Lucy anymore, it's Michelle. INT. BUS - NIGHT \nLucy sleeps cuddled close to Sam, who is wide awake, as he gazes out at the passing highway, far from home.  We hear the song \"Michelle\". \nEXT. PARK - 4 A.M. \nSam, totally disoriented, walks in circles around the plastic tunnels and jungle gym.  A flashlight shines in Sam's face. \nCOP Hey, buddy.  No loitering.  Move it. \nSAM Not yet not yet not yet. \nCOP You want me to get a black and white down here? \nHe moves toward Sam.  SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on. The cop backs off, but Sam doesn't move, standing in the middle of the park and getting totally wet. \nSAM Not yet not yet not yet. \nHe shines the flashlight in Sam's face and we see INSIDE THE PLASTIC TUNNEL where LUCY SLEEPS PEACEFULLY on a bed of coats, holding a discarded stuffed animal. \nCOP Jesus Christ. \nSAM She hasn't been sleeping well.  She needs a good night's rest.  Let her sleep, let her sleep. (the cop moves toward Sam) NO! \nCOP What are you, crazy? \nAll the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic tunnel. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAWN \nPolice doors swing open as Rita, coat over pj's, a sleepy DANNY by her side, storm inside.  Lucy lies on a bench with her head in Sam's lap. \nRITA What were you thinking what were you possibly thinking?! \nSAM I - \nRITA That's ridiculous!  Danny stay with me - (he moves away) What could you possibly gain by kidnapping your kid in the middle of a custody hearing?! \nSAM She - \nRITA I don't wanna hear it!  Can you possibly explain this to me?! \nSAM But Lucy said - \nRITA Who's the parent here?  Who's the goddamned parent here?  Danny!  Stay in the hallway - \nDanny turns the corner just as Margaret Brown rushes in. Rita turns to her - her expression changes on a dime. \nRITA (CONT'D) Miss Brown, I can imagine what you're thinking. \nMARGARET BROWN I'm - \nRITA But I ask you what parent in their right mind seeing their child in pain -- \nMARGARET BROWN I have seen - \nRITA Their yearning for contact - wouldn't take them in an attempt to comfort them? Where the hell is Danny? \nMARGARET BROWN You - \nRITA He - \nMARGARET BROWN There's - \n", "test3_true": "MARGARET BROWN Is that a threat? \nRITA No.  It's a plea.  Give'm a break. Give'm one goddman break. Margaret's cell phone RINGS. \nMARGARET BROWN What?!  No, Mrs. Sloan.  His temperature couldn't be 117, no not even 107.  Okay, okay, I'll come...Come on Lucy, I'll take you back. \nRITA C'mon, Danny.  We're going home. Danny!?  Danny!?!? \nThe FIRE ALARM GOES OFF and -- \nRITA (CONT'D) Goddamn it, Danny! \nRita avoids Margaret's look.  Margaret's cell phone goes off again.  She doesn't answer.  Now Rita looks at Margaret, but this time Margaret avoids looking at her.  Lucy runs to Rita and throws her arms around her waist. \nLUCY Please don't fire us.  It was all my idea.  Please don't.  Please.  Please. \nRita is disarmed.  She's moved and not used to being moved. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nBAILIFF ...the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? \nLucy's in her best dress, being sworn in.  One hand in the air. \nLUCY So help me God... \nAnd now CAMERA MOVES AROUND HER AND WE SEE THAT SHE'S HIDING HER OTHER HAND BEHIND HER BACK - FINGERS CROSSED. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nLucy is on the stand, Turner is cross-examining her. \nTURNER I heard you turned seven this year. That's pretty exciting. \nLUCY Everybody gets older.  It's not that big a deal. \nTURNER What'd you get for your birthday? \nLUCY I haven't opened my presents yet. \nTURNER Really?  That's odd.  Why not? \nLucy looks to her father and Rita. \nLUCY I opened my presents.  I got the HELP album - limited edition. \nON RITA AND SAM \nWhat is she doing? \nTURNER Oh, I'm sorry.  I was confused.  I thought you didn't open your birthday presents because you ran away from your own party when your best friend told everyone that you were adopted. \nLUCY I never said that; why would I say that? \nTURNER Why would your friends say it if you hadn't said it? \nLUCY Kids lie all the time. \nNext to her skirt, we see her fingers are crossed so hard they're practically turning purple. \nTURNER May I remind you Lucy that you're under oath? \nLUCY You may. \nTURNER And do you know that means if you lie you could be in serious trouble? \nLUCY I do. \nTURNER So now that you and I have agreed to tell the truth, where did you sleep last night? \nRita glares at Margaret.  Thanks a lot. \nLUCY In my bed at the Foster home. \nTURNER All right, Lucy.  If you're not going to tell the truth, I am.  Your dad kidnapped you last night and the police found you sleeping in a seedy park a hundred miles from here.  You're lying right now because you're afraid.  Afraid that everyone will see how scared and frustrated you really are.  You're afraid of hurting him, but now we need to tell the truth.  The truth is deep inside you know you're not getting what you need from your father.  Isn't that right, Lucy? \n", "test3_id": 1631}

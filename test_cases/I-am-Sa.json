{"train": "\"I AM SAM\" \nScreenplay by \nKristine Johnson \nJessie Nelson \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nINT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M. \nWe're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets, blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry. \nWe move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling, uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes, they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars. \nSAM Double double decaf low-fat Cap. \nBRUCE You got it, buddy. \nSAM Good choice very good choice. \nSam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet 'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks. \nSAM (CONT'D) Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half low, half non.  Excellent choice.  Very good choice. \nHe stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches. \nGEORGE Sam, they called.  It's time for you to go. \nSam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Sam, did you hear me? \nSAM \"It's time for you to go.\" \nGEORGE Yes. \nSAM It's time. \nGEORGE Good luck. \nWithout another word, Sam walks straight out the door. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY \nSam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT BETWEEN THEM. \nSAM It's time.  It's time. \nSam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping. Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS. \nSAM (CONT'D) It's time, it's time for you to go. \nINT. HALLWAY - LATER \nSam plows down the hall and comes to room 324. \nSAM Rebecca! \nSam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL. \nREBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black Nurse, looks up from the monitor. \nGERTIE You the one responsible for this? \nSam nods, taking Gertie quite literally. \nSAM I'm sorry. \nGERTIE Too late for sorries, daddy, get over here and hold her hand. \nSam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS. \nNURSE You got a live one, Gert. \nINT. LABOR ROOM - LATER \nRASPY WOMAN (O.S.) What the hell are you doing to that baby?! \nHe looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor. \nSAM Everything's so tiny, tiny.  Tiny. Everything.  Won't you please come over? Help.  I need somebody.  Won't you please please help me. \nANNIE You know I can't do that.  What does her mother say? \nSAM Her mother?  Her mother said \"This isn't my life.  I'm outta here when she comes. It didn't mean anything, Sam.  It was just one night.  The two of you.  That's all I need...\" Annie, what if she's sick? \nEXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nANNIE has her door open a crack.  Annie feels the baby's forehead.  Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated. \nANNIE She's overheated and not eating enough. How often are you feeding her? \nSAM A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber. \nANNIE What's a lot? \nSAM Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Three squares hot. \nANNIE Babies need food every two hours, Sam. \nSAM Oh.  I'm sorry Lucy Diamond. ANNIE What time does the little diamond wake up? \nSAM She never really goes to sleep. \nANNIE Okaaaay.  Well, let's assume she's up at six.  Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.  I want you to feed her first while \"Bewitched\" is on.  Then again, when \"Hogan's Heroes\" starts.  After that, well until \"Father Knows Best...\" \nCUT: \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nWe are watching \"Hogan's Heroes\".  We hear SHULTZ'S INFAMOUS RESPONSE: \"I know nothing, absolutely nothing!\"  Sam feeds a content Lucy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATER \n\"Father Knows Best\" on TV.  Lucy blissfully falls asleep in Sam's arms.  Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places her ever so gently, when suddenly, the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN. \nSam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.  BRAD, who sees himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the world's out to get him.  Lucy WAILS.  Sam RUNS to the CRIB. \nSAM What are you doing here now?!  Her first sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound. \nBRAD Eight years every Thursday Video Night and you forgot?! \nSAM Oh my god, Video Night.  First Thursday of the month.  Video night at Sam's house.  I'm sorry, I forgot. \nIFTY Becca's gone.  \"Gone with the Wind\" is a very sad movie. \nROBERT Oh here we go...Everything changes now. Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night Denny's and Friday night Karaoke.  And I got hit by a car today. \nSAM You did? \nROBERT It's probably that guy from the V.A. \nBRAD What guy? \nROBERT (closing window) I can't discuss it.  And now this. \nIfty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers.  Lucy's rapt. \nSAM She looks smart, doesn't she? \nIFTY Of course, look.  She's already reading the newspaper.  I have five smart sisters in Pakistan.  I am only brother. \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" was a wonderful movie I forgot to bring last week for Video Night... \nBRAD Did you get \"Blade Runner\" for tonight? \nROBERT Now it's all my fault?! \nBRUCE Don't tell me you forgot again.  I broke a date with a daydream to come here. \nThere's a knock at the door.  Ifty goes to get it.  Brad moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing in the doorway. \nBRAD Mom!  I told you Video Night's over at nine!  It's only six-thirty! \nHearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back. Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we -- \nINT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT \nSam on stage, with Ifty and Brad as his back-up singers, continuing the song in the oddest, most heartfelt version to Lucy who sits on Robert's lap and in heaven. \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nA beautiful blue sky.  And \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME. Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again... \nSam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and then disappears.  Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by MOTHERS and KIDS at the park. \nLUCY (V.O.) Daddy, where does the sky end? \nSAM (V.O.) Let me see, let me see.  I've never been there but they say it's somewhere near China. \nEXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER \nLucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FOUR, sitting on Sam's lap, swinging. \nLUCY (V.O.) Are lady bugs only girls or are there boys, too.  And if there are, what are they called? \nSAM (V.O.) The Beatles. \nEXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER \nThen Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FIVE, followed by Sam. \nLUCY (V.O.) Do I look more like you or Mommy? \nON SAM'S FACE \nHe knew this moment would come. \nINT. DENNY'S - THURSDAY NIGHT DINNER - EVENING \nLucy and Sam are having a serious talk over breaded Sole. \nLUCY If you and Mommy liked each other enough to have me, how come you're not together anymore? \nSAM I think she fell out of love with me. Not you, never you.  Me, just me. \nLUCY When you fall out of love where do you land? \nSAM Somewhere in Florida, I think. \nLUCY Do you think she'll ever come back? \nSAM (long pause) Paul McCartney lost his mother when he was fourteen.  John lost his mother twice.  First when Julie gave John to her sister Mimi to raise.  And then again when Julia was hit by a car.  They say God picks certain people, special people.  That's what they say. \nLucy takes this in.  Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just so... his potatoes just slightly to the left.  Lucy watches. \nLUCY Daddy, did God mean for you to be like this or was it an accident? \nSAM Do you mean - what do you mean? \nLUCY I mean you're different. \nSAM What do you mean?  I mean, what do you mean? \nLUCY You're not like the other daddies. \nSAM I'm not am I.  I'm sorry. \nLUCY Don't be sorry.  I'm lucky.  Nobody else's daddy ever comes to the park. \nON SAM'S FACE \nFilled with relief.  Bursting with love. \nSAM We are very lucky, aren't we? \nGrace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the side. \nGRACE Ice cream on the side. \nLUCY Not on top.  Not on top. \nSALESMAN (exasperated) If there's a God. \nBRAD Do we get a balloon with these? \nSALESMAN Yes. \nROBERT All of us, or just her? \nSMASH CUT TO: EXT. STREET NEAR SHOE STORE - DAY \nThose new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of man's shoes.  We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march victoriously down the street.  We MOVE IN on Lucy's little brown shoes skipping with joy and -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY \nThose same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black soccer cleats.  We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a fierce kids soccer game. \nScore's tied.  The ball comes to Lucy.  She kicks and misses. From the sidelines we hear: \nSAM Beautiful kick!  Very close! \nLucy looks up at her dad proudly.  The ball comes again. Nobody could miss this one.  But Lucy does. \nSAM (CONT'D) Thatta girl!  Thatta girl!  They're getting scared now! \nThe game continues.  The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES, handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son: \nMR. RHODES C'mon, Conner!  On your toes!  They're all counting on you! \nConner tenses up, alert under the pressure.  Meanwhile, down at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.  She kicks it! Hard.  Right into her team's own goal.  The crowd GROANS. \nSAM Hurray, Lucy!  You're getting the hang of it now!  You've got them scared now! \nLucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and NAILS IT!  The ball goes flying.  The parents in the stand are completely baffled!  Sam is completely ecstatic! \nSAM (CONT'D) L-u-c-y!  That's our battlecry! \nThe ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie, Conner.  Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan reaming his son -- \nMR. RHODES The whole game was right in front of your nose!  I leave work early to watch you blow the whole game!? \nConner slouches against the fence as his father walks away. Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nA child's hand double jumps across a checker board. \nCONNER (O.S.) Ha! \nLucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner. Two carrots cut into ten pieces. Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces each. \nCONNER (CONT'D) What's wrong with your father?  Why's he acting like a retard? \nLUCY He is. \nTheir hands graze against each other on the check board - he pulls his hand away. \nCONNER Are you? \nLUCY No. \nCONNER Are you sure? \nLUCY Yeah. \nCONNER How do you know? \nLUCY He told me. \nCONNER But he's a retard. \nLUCY Yeah well it takes one to know one! \nHe crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the first time a bit uneasily. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes. Lucy's untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table.  She doodles on the placement - drawing a man sitting with a pile of new potatoes in front of him; larger than he is. \nSAM Fish and chips fish and chips.  I will not eat fish and chips. \nLUCY (exploding) I will not eat them here or there!  I will not eat them anywhere!  I will not eat green eggs and ham!  I will not eat them, Sam I am! \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBalloons and a banner reading \"Happy Birthday, Lucy!\"  For Lucy's birthday, Sam has rented a moon bounce - which sits in the center of the apartment and filling the entire place - leaving no room for the few kids and their parents.  Brad stands too close to a young attractive mother.  Robert shakes all the presents suspiciously. \nSAM Now when they come through the door, everybody yell \"Surprise!\"  Do you want to rehearse again? \nCONNER No.  I bet she already knows. \nROBERT I didn't tell her.  Did Brad say I did? \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. \nSAM Is that Lucy?  Annie's supposed to call and warn us.  Shhhh, everyone. \nBrad hits the lights.  Sam OPENS THE DOOR and everyone yells \"SURPRISE!\"  But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker. \nMARGARET BROWN I don't know if you remember me.  I'm Margaret Brown from Children's Social Services.  We met at the police station. \nSAM Put your present over there - Hurry up! Lucy might be on her way. (the phone rings) Hello?  Annie says she's coming up the stairs.  Everyone be quiet.  Assume surprise positions! (Conner keeps talking) Be quiet!  Assume surprise positions! \nCONNER Oh brother! \nSAM Why are you such a party pooper?! Assume surprise positions! \nCONNER Make me! \nSam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against him. \nMR. RHODES Hey! \nSAM He's gonna ruin the surprise!  He's gonna ruin the surprise! \nCONNER He touched me!  I've got cooties!  I've got cooties! \nMR. RHODES Get your hands off my boy! \nConner's father hurls Sam across the room - Sam gets tangled in the MOON BOUNCE!  To get attention, Conner bursts into tears.  We hear FOOTSTEPS outside the door - Brad hits the lights.  We hear a CRASH!  And in the light, the DOOR SHEDS as it opens, Lucy and Ifty see - that MOONBOUNCE, swaying. Then from within the Moonbounce: \nSAM Surprise!  Happy Birthday! \nLucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon. \nLUCY Daddy?! \nCONNER You don't have to call him \"Daddy\". (in Sam's face) She says you're not her real father, anyway.  She's adopted! \nHumiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY!  The Social Worker watches, profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone. \nEXT. WALMART - DAY \nA police car pulls into the parking lot.  Sam and Margaret in the back.  Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling from beneath the curtain of the photo booth. \nSAM I'll go get her. \nMARGARET BROWN It would be better if you stay here. I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's clear how much you love your daughter, but we're going to have to remove Lucy from your home. \nSam's baffled.  One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder, restraining him.  The OTHER heads toward the photo booth. \nSAM No, no no no.  It's her birthday!  It's her birthday! \nMARGARET BROWN I know how hard this must be... (cell phone rings) ...Hello, Betsy.  I'm scheduled to come to your apartment at four.  No, not five every two hours.  It's two every five hours.  She only weighs thirty pounds for chrissakes... (back to Sam) The city has given me the difficult task of deciding when to intervene on behalf of the child.  Unfortunately, I've learned the hard way that it's better too soon than too late.  For now the court will decide what's in Lucy's best interest. \nSam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain. Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being. \nSAM Run, Lucy, run! \nWe see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his grasp.  She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.  She runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a cop follows.  Sam struggles. \nON SAM \nReeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking: \nRITA Because it wasn't my fault. \nPATRICIA I -- \nRITA Thank you, Patricia. \nPATRICIA This is Mr. Dawson.  There was some confusion with the temp last week and -- \nRITA Mr. Dawson, it's a pleasure.  Since somebody made a mistake, unfortunately we only have a little time.  Hold all my calls unless it's my kid - I'll have a double cap. \nSAM Good choice, very good choice. \nRITA Can we get you anything to drink? \nSAM Is it free? \nON RITA \nHmmmm? \nTEN MINUTES LATER -- \nSam is in the middle of the beginning of his story.  Rita on her second cappuccino, eyes her computer screen for calls. \nSAM (CONT'D) ...Lucy had an ice-cream cake with pink flowers - pink, not white not white...Lucy's favorite is cherry vanilla which is pink, too.  Cherries and vanilla. \nRITA Uh huh uh huh -- uh huh uh (into Amtel) If that's Jake Hiller, put him through. (picking up phone) Jake.  No no no no no no. \nPATRICIA (from speaker) Your son's on line two. \nRITA Jake, did you get that?! (to Patricia) Tell him to hold for just one second. Jake I have to go...he what? \nPATRICIA (through speaker) Deborah Chapman on line three -- \nRITA Hold on Jake. (she punches another line) No no no no no no no.  Have a nice weekend. (punches another button) Jake?! \nWe HEAR MUSIC coming from the other end of the phone -- \nSAM Burt Bacharach shared billing with The Beatles and Jose Jiminez on the Ed Sullivan Show June 5th, 1968. \nRITA Really? (then) Jake, what'd you say you tell him yes I am. (yelling; re: coffee) This tastes like low, are you sure it's non?  Okay okay okay.  I think there's been a little mistake here -- \nSAM Yes.  A little one.  Your son's on line two. \nRITA Oh my God. (pushes another line) Danny? (Danny's hung up) Patricia?  Get Danny back.  Well keep trying. \nShe unconsciously digs through the bowl of jelly beans on her desk sorting out all the yellow ones. \nRITA (CONT'D) Mr. Dawson, what I'm trying to say is I'm a divorce lawyer and as much as I'd like to, I don't handle cases like yours \nSAM Since you would like to, why don't you talk to your boss.  Maybe he would let you. \nShe pours the bowl of jelly beans onto her desk, now frantically sorting through them. \nRITA (into phone) Then keep dialing -- (to Sam) What I mean is that at this point in my career, I can't afford to. \nSAM I earn eight dollars an hour at Starbucks.  I can pay your hourly rate, rate by the hour, hourly -- \nRita stands up, ushering him to the door. \nRITA Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry, I have to be in court in eight minutes with the Kresges. You understand, good luck to you and don't give up. \nShe turns, ahhhh!  He's gone!  She begins searching the room. \nRITA (CONT'D) Patricia?!  Where are my keys?  Where the hell are my keys?!  Alright alright. (replaying) I walked into the room - I went over here - I looked at my desk - I put my coat down - Patricia?!  Where's my coat? \nSAM (O.S.) Is there a child involved in Mr. Kresges' case? \nStunned, Rita looks up and sees Sam holding up a strip of photos taken at the birthday booth. \nRITA No. \nSAM This is Lucy.  One year old.  First word, \"apple\".  December third.  3:16 p.m.  December third. \nOut of his pocket he pulls another photo strip. \nSAM (CONT'D) Here's Lucy two years old.  First merry go-round ride.  June 6th.  4:13 p.m. June 6th.  Here's Lucy.  Seven years old.  The day the police took her away. \nMuffled laughter from her colleagues. \nRITA You think I don't pro-bono?..I can do pro-bono.. I can do Goddamn pro-bono.. where the hell are my keys..hold the door! \nRita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with Sam who's been holding the door open for her. \nINT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe door closes.  Rita is trapped with Sam.  She stares forward trying to will him not there.  Rita gulps her champagne. \nSAM 32nd floor.  32 floors more.  31st floor.  31 floors more... \nAnd on and on and on.  Rita is about to spontaneously combust.  Finally, \"G\" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors, then just as suddenly turns around. \nRITA Alright, alright I'll take you. Alright, Goddammitt, I'll take you. \nSAM Oh my God oh my God!  Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams! \nSam, shaking with relief, pulls out his wallet just as the elevator door starts closing. \nRITA No, no  no.  Pro-bono.  Alright?  Pro bono. \nThe doors close.  We hear from within, as Sam goes up again: \nSAM (O.S.) Yes!  Alright!  I liked Sonny Bono too! \nINT. BUS - MORNING \nSam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and refrozen. \nEXT. BUS STOP - NOON \nSam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake. \nThe bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up. Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is starting to leak ice cream. \nINT. SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY \nLucy, Margaret, a therapist and a child psychologist wait for Sam. \nMARGARET BROWN Lucy, I'm sorry.  But it doesn't look like he's going to make it. \nLUCY (staring forward) He'll be here.  You smell like soap. \nMARGARET BROWN Lucy, he's an hour and 45 minutes late. You'll only have a few minutes left. \nSuddenly through the door comes Sam CARRYING THE MELTED, DRIPPING birthday cake.  Lucy runs to him. \nLUCY Daddy!  I told you I told you! \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SOCIAL WORKER'S SMALL GREY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nMargaret, the therapist (Ms. Geller), and the Child Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room, nervous under their scrutiny. \nSAM ...and she's a Century City lawyer - a very famous lawyer.  Guess what her name is?  Rita Harrison. \nLUCY (jaw drops) Lovely Rita Meter Maid. \nSAM Harrison.  Just like George. \nThey move to hug each other.  EVERYONE REACHES for their pens.  Sam pulls back self-consciously.  Everyone writes even harder. \nSAM (CONT'D) You've grown. \nLUCY Have I? \nSAM Your ears are larger.  And your eyes are older. \nHe's right.  Her eyes are older.  He hugs her - ALL THE PENS GO UP. \nSAM (CONT'D) I'm gonna get a phone machine.  Next paycheck.  If I'm not home, you can leave a message.  \"Hi, This is Lucy.\" \nLUCY You can't afford a phone machine. \nThe writing starts again. \nRITA No.  Well, sort of.  I talk about her the whole time I'm there. \nSAM That's nice.  Did you notice that everyone else is driving slower.  I noticed that did you? \nRITA (on the horn) Go for Chrissakes!  How about your mother?  Maybe she can help you - \nSAM She's gone.  She's at the Park Lane Mortuary.  Two from the left.  Under the big tree. \nRITA Oh.  I'm sorry.  The light is green! WOULD YOU MOVE MOVE MOVE!? \nShe cuts around the car in front of her; flips him off, and in a split second that her head is turned, almost SMASHES into the car in front of her!  She slams on the brakes. \nSAM Too many shrinks...I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson, if I were you I wouldn't waste any more time.  I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson it must be a tremendous disappointment. I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson I think you'd both be happier if Sam was in a home. \nRita looks over at Sam, forced to stop. \nINT. PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY \nSam sits across from a shrink, MS. GELLER, nervously straightening her desk. \nPSYCHOLOGIST Mr. Dawson, you do understand, that since I am a court appointed psychologist, the traditional client therapist confidentiality will be waived. (Sam looks confused) Mr. Dawson, do you understand that the confidentiality will be waived? \nSam nods nervously and waves.  With that she begins. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSam, Ifty, Brad and Robert hover over a used answering machine.  Ifty pours over the instructions. \nIFTY Before you read your message press the red button for record, when you finish, press the yellow button.  If you press the green button, it will play it back you.  Let's start with the \"ogm\". \nSAM Okay, okay.  I'm ready.  Hello, I am Sam. \nIFTY No, no.  I didn't press the red button. \nSAM Oh, yes.  False start, false start. \nIFTY It's not working.  That's what you get for buying a used machine.  Used means broken.  You're asking for other people's problems, you have enough of your own, not that everyone doesn't have problems. \nBRAD It's not used.  It's pre-owned.  Guy bought it for his auto shop and then he got a secretary. \nIFTY Testing, one two three. \nSAM That's a good code.  I'll remember that. One, two, three. \nIFTY (pressing button) Quick, you're recording. \nSAM I'm hi.  I am Sam.  I'm not home. \nROBERT No, you don't want to say that.  you don't want them to know you're not home. \nSAM But then I'm lying. \nROBERT Everybody's lying. \nSAM I'm not a liar.  It will send a mixed message to Lucy. \nIFTY (pressing the button) You're on the air! \nSAM Let me see, let me see, let me see.  Hi, how are you? \nBEEP! the tape runs out. \nIFTY That was pretty good.  That was natural. \nSAM Did I sound like a good father? \nIFTY It's the outgoing message.  You need to sound more outgoing.  Let's start again. INT. GROUP HOME - NIGHT \nMrs. Kerry unlocks the phone and dials.  She hands the phone to Lucy who waits eagerly in her pj's.  Sam's answering machine clicks on; as if on slow speed. \nANSWERING MACHINE Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop.  We'd love to show you our body work, but it's invisible.  Leave it at the beep. \nLUCY Try again.  You must have dialed the wrong number. \nINT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY \nRita and Sam walk through the lobby at Rita's Olympic pace. She passes the elevator and heads for the stairs. \nRITA I didn't say that. \nSAM You're my lawyer and you think what they think.  I don't have a chance.  No chance at all.  Even with an expert witness. \nRita looks at him.  He's right.  She chooses her words carefully. \nRITA I think...you deserve...a fair trial. \nSAM Answer the question. \nRITA Okay okay okay.  What was the question again? \nSAM Do you think what they think?  Sam can't order food.  Sam can't pay a check.  Sam can't take care of Lucy? \nRITA It doesn't matter what I think - it matters that we win. \nSAM You're my lawyer it matters what you think. \nRITA Hey, it doesn't matter to them what I think. \nSAM Me.  It matters to me. \nHe reaches for the receipt, and faces the CASHIER defiantly. \nSAM (CONT'D) Fourteen thirty three.  That's 5 ones, 2 quarters and 16 cents less than twenty. \nHe slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away. Rita watches him, with a trace of remorse and a hint of admiration. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nDR. DONOVAN, an attractive soft-spoken woman is on the stand. Rita is working the room.  Sam, having a hard time concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the ceiling. \nRITA Dr. Donovan, the American Medical Journal named you one of the country's leading oncologists.  Isn't that correct? \nDR. DONOVAN Yes. \nRITA What kept you going the twelve years you were in medical school? \nDR. DONOVAN Caffeine.  Sugar.  And my mother's confidence in me. \nRITA I wish I had a mother like that.  She must have been smart. \nDR. DONOVAN She had great instincts. \nRITA Do you have any idea what her IQ was? \nDR. DONOVAN In the lower ranges.  About eighty. \nRITA So your mother, this woman with the IQ of a nine-year old had the wisdom to recognize that you would be a great doctor.  I guess her disability didn't seem to hold you back in life. \nDR. DONOVAN No.  My mother's condition taught me what they can't teach you; compassion and patience. \nRITA Traits most doctors have in spades. Thank you, no further questions. \nSam runs to hug Dr. Donovan, bumping into Rita who sits him down. \nTURNER How'd you get through medical school? Where'd you live? \nDR. DONOVAN We lived with my mother's parents. \nTURNER Oh, Grandma and Grandpa.  Would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence? \nDR. DONOVAN Yes. \nTURNER And didn't these people - your grandparents - with normal intelligence - have the real responsibilities? \nRITA (relishing this) Objection!  I hear Mr. Turner's mother in-law lives with him!  She must help out.  Does that mean he doesn't have the real - \nTURNER Motion to strike that from the record. Irrelevant, immaterial and immature - \nRITA Irrelevant?!  Any parent has a right to a support system. \nTURNER I'm not talking about the rights of the parent, I'm talking about the rights of a child. (the gavel bangs) I'm talking about entrusting an eight year old's welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism, mental retardation... \nRITA Objection!  Motion to strike that from the record.  It's clear that one's intellectual capacity has no bearing on their ability to love.  You Honor, would you please instruct council to proceed with a modicum of sensitivity? \nTURNER Oh, I'm sensitive.  I'm real sensitive when I see people like you -- (the gavel BANGS!) come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody else's! JUDGE MCNEILY That's enough.  Both lawyers approach the bench! \nSAM I won't let that happen. \nLUCY That's what her real mommy said.  And now they won't even let her talk to her. \nSam reels with confusion.  Lucy buries herself in his chest. \nLUCY (CONT'D) Daddy, it's the only way to be together. We'll start a new life, get new names. We'll live in a new apartment.  They'll never find us. \nThe bus has stopped.  Passengers for the park have exited. Sam doesn't move.  As the BUSDRIVER closes the door and heads on, he holds Lucy protectively to his chest. \nSAM I love you Lucy.  I love you. \nLUCY My name isn't Lucy anymore, it's Michelle. INT. BUS - NIGHT \nLucy sleeps cuddled close to Sam, who is wide awake, as he gazes out at the passing highway, far from home.  We hear the song \"Michelle\". \nEXT. PARK - 4 A.M. \nSam, totally disoriented, walks in circles around the plastic tunnels and jungle gym.  A flashlight shines in Sam's face. \nCOP Hey, buddy.  No loitering.  Move it. \nSAM Not yet not yet not yet. \nCOP You want me to get a black and white down here? \nHe moves toward Sam.  SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on. The cop backs off, but Sam doesn't move, standing in the middle of the park and getting totally wet. \nSAM Not yet not yet not yet. \nHe shines the flashlight in Sam's face and we see INSIDE THE PLASTIC TUNNEL where LUCY SLEEPS PEACEFULLY on a bed of coats, holding a discarded stuffed animal. \nCOP Jesus Christ. \nSAM She hasn't been sleeping well.  She needs a good night's rest.  Let her sleep, let her sleep. (the cop moves toward Sam) NO! \nCOP What are you, crazy? \nAll the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic tunnel. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAWN \nPolice doors swing open as Rita, coat over pj's, a sleepy DANNY by her side, storm inside.  Lucy lies on a bench with her head in Sam's lap. \nRITA What were you thinking what were you possibly thinking?! \nSAM I - \nRITA That's ridiculous!  Danny stay with me - (he moves away) What could you possibly gain by kidnapping your kid in the middle of a custody hearing?! \nSAM She - \nRITA I don't wanna hear it!  Can you possibly explain this to me?! \nSAM But Lucy said - \nRITA Who's the parent here?  Who's the goddamned parent here?  Danny!  Stay in the hallway - \nDanny turns the corner just as Margaret Brown rushes in. Rita turns to her - her expression changes on a dime. \nRITA (CONT'D) Miss Brown, I can imagine what you're thinking. \nMARGARET BROWN I'm - \nRITA But I ask you what parent in their right mind seeing their child in pain -- \nMARGARET BROWN I have seen - \nRITA Their yearning for contact - wouldn't take them in an attempt to comfort them? Where the hell is Danny? \nMARGARET BROWN You - \nRITA He - \nMARGARET BROWN There's - \nA LONG SILENCE.  She stares at Turner defiantly. \nLUCY \"All you need is love.\" \nINT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - DAY \nWE HEAR THAT SONG as Sam and Rita walk out of the courtroom. Rita is breaking pieces off a candy bar she has stuffed in her purse.  They see Lucy running down the corridor toward Sam, Margaret Brown behind her. \nLUCY Daddy!  I did great, didn't I? \nSAM No, Lucy, you lied. \nLUCY Shhh!  Don't tell anyone. \nRita watches Sam.  Moved by his concern as a parent. \nMARGARET BROWN Lucy, Mrs. Kerry's here to take you back. \nLUCY I thought you'd be proud of me.  Jo Jo's mom told him to lie on the stand and say he never saw a needle in the house; and he did, and now they're back together. \nSAM Jo Jo isn't us.  The truth, the truth, when the judge hears the truth, he'll know, he'll know we should be together. \nLUCY (bursting) Nobody's interested in the truth, Daddy. Nobody cares! \nThey lead her down the hallway toward Mrs. Kerry - Sam's voice gets louder and louder - determined to make her hear. \nSAM I CARE!  DO YOU HEAR ME?  THE TRUTH. THE WHOLE TRUTH!  SO HELP ME GOD!! INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe darkness of Sam's apartment.  We see him on his knees. Saying his prayers by his bedside. \nSAM Help me, God.  Help me, God.  Help me, God... \nWe see ANNIE'S SILHOUETTE from the window of her apartment as it moves across the frame. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nTurner cross examines George, the manager of Starbucks. \nGEORGE Sam's my most reliable employee.  He's never missed a day of work in eight years.  Always warm, always friendly. \nTURNER Admirable qualities for a single father. Mr. Walker, in these eight years, have Mr. Dawson's responsibilities, which...let me see...would include bussing tables, replenishing Sweet 'n Lows, and sweeping up the place... increased? \nGEORGE No.  Not really. \nTURNER And isn't that because he's mentally incapable of learning management skills or working the cash register or even making a cup of coffee? \nRITA Objection.  Leading the witness. \nJUDGE MCNEILY You may answer the question. \nGeorge searches for a way to tell the truth. \nGEORGE Well as a matter of fact, Sam and I have been discussing a promotion that I was planning on putting into effect at the end of the week. \nSam leaps to his feet. \nSAM Oh boy!  Thank you, George! \nRita pulls him down.  Turner seizes the moment. \nTURNER Yes.  Thank you, George.  Now, after eight years, Sam can finally measure out a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water. Now, he must certainly be able to help Lucy with her geometry. \nRITA Objection - \nTURNER No further questions. \nINT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER \nRita prepares Ifty. \nRITA ...and when I ask another question? \nIFTY I answer in one sentence. \nRITA Yes.  Short and sweet. \nIFTY Yes.  One sentence.  Short and sweet. My aunt was short and sweet.  But her cooking was too spicy she... \nTURNER Excuse me, Mr. Dawson? \nSAM I said that's enough!  I will not allow it!  Overruled!  Overruled!! \nRita doesn't stop him.  The Judge hesitates, incredulous, then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts. EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nRita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam.  Annie is curled into a tight ball in the passenger seat.  Sam is tucked into the shelf in the back.  His legs kick Rita in the face with every gear shift. \nRITA Thank you again, Annie.  You were truly extraordinary. \nSAM Extraordinary.  Truly extraordinary. \nAnnie doesn't move. \nRITA Okay okay okay okay.  Well, Sam has his big day on the stand tomorrow and we need to work a little bit so that he's as effective as you were. \nSAM Effective.  Very effective. \nRITA On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle is a little hidden by that thingamajig, so if you're having a hard time finding it I'll just -- \nRita reaches across to open Annie's door when she SCREAMS! \nANNIE Noooooooo! \nSAM Annie's not quite ready to go outside yet. \nRITA Okay, we'll just take our time. \nINT. PORSCHE - TWO HOURS LATER \nIt's dark now.  Annie is still catatonic.  Rita's on the car phone, the kind that voice activates and she's yelling. \nRITA Home!  Home!  HOME GODDAMNIT!  Juanita, help Danny with his English assignment. Ayude Danny un story...story...STORIO! \nANNIE (rising from the dead) I'm ready now. \nRITA (gently) Good, fine, Sam?  Annie's ready. \nSam's fallen asleep. \nEXT. RITA'S LAVISH BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT \nRita and Sam enter. \nINT. RITA'S BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT \nSam is awestruck at the magnificent home. \nRITA Okay okay okay okay.  We'll work in the library.  It's down the hall and to the left. \nThey pass another room and see Danny zoned out in front of the wide-screen TV watching MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. \nRITA (CONT'D) Hey, Danny. (no answer) Where's your father? \nDANNY (staring at TV) Guess. \nRITA I don't want to guess.  Where is he? (Sam watches Rita) I told you I don't want to guess. \nDANNY Well where was he last night? \nRITA Working late. \nDANNY There you guessed it. \nRITA He said he was working late? \nDANNY That's what he said. \nRITA Well who did he say was taking care of you? \nDANNY You.  But you said you were working late. \nRITA I am working late. \nDANNY Then go work. \nRITA How was your day? \nSAM Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.  I didn't harass him, Mr. Turner.  Mr. Turner - (Sam can't keep a straight face) You don't look like him. \nRITA That's a blessing. \nSAM You're so much prettier. \nRITA (suddenly shy) Thank you.  Now. What makes you think you can take care of a woman - I mean a young child - when you have a hard time taking care of yourself? \nINT. RITA'S LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER \nRita is relentless.  Sam is exhausted but determined. \nRITA But who are you kidding?  Isn't Lucy already smarter than you? \nSAM In some ways.  But in other ways, she's not, I think. \nRITA You think? \nSAM I think. \nRITA Sam.  You've got to be firm on this. \nSAM I think in other ways I'm smarter than her.  Smarter than you are, Mr. Turner. In fact, in some ways I'm smarter than you, Judge McNeilly. \nRITA Whoa!  Bring it down. \nSAM What parent doesn't want more for their child?  To be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them. \nRITA Yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a little girl to love her daddy when she's a baby, but once she loses respect for you, what will you do? \nSAM (fierce) I won't let that happen.  I won't. \nRITA How can you say that? \nSAM Respect is not just about how smart someone is.  Smart is not just about how smart someone is. \nRITA But what about Lucy?  Aren't you being selfish?  Doesn't she deserve a better life?  Don't you think she's just pretending she's happy to not hurt your feelings? \nSam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger. \nSAM Lucy is happy!  We have fun!  We go to Denny's, we go to video night.  I know how to love her.  I know I'm not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person, but I know how to love.  I know how to be her father, Mr. Turner! \nBy this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard, overcome with emotion.  Rita is unexpectedly near tears. Suddenly before she knows it, she is HOLDING SAM.  The room charged.  She speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy/man. \nRITA I know you do, Sam.  I know you do. INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING \nSam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit. \nGEORGE You look great, Sam.  What time do you have to be in court? \nSAM Half day, half day.  I take the stand at two. \nGeorge leads him behind the counter.  THE STAFF BEAMS. Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines. \nGEORGE Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non fat. \nSAM Sprinkles or Cinnamon? \nINT. STARBUCKS - 11:00 A.M. \nSam is doing great.  He's humming as he prepares a triple latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. \nINT. STARBUCKS - 12:00 P.M. \nThe place is packed, including a GROUP OF JAPANESE TOURISTS. Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while glancing up at the clock.  Sam hands three cups to customers, the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out. \nA CUSTOMER takes a sip and SPITS IT OUT. \nGUY What is this?  I ordered an Americano, not a latte. \nSAM Americano, Americano, not a latte. \nWorking as fast as he can but still NOT FAST ENOUGH, Sam unconsciously drinks the latte. \nINT. STARBUCKS - 12:45 P.M. \nHyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess. Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild. Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns it ON.  A mint mocha frappuccino SPLATTERS HIM in the face. At that moment, George comes out of his office. \nSAM No. \nTURNER Well then where were you living? \nSAM (very quietly) In an institution. \nTURNER So your parents put you in an institution? \nSAM Only after my mom got sick. \nTURNER What about your father?  Where was he? \nSAM Gone with the wind when Sam was born. \nTURNER So, you weren't raised by your mother? \nSAM I saw her I saw her. \nTURNER When? \nSAM Christmas, Easter and my birthday. \nTURNER Oh, once a year on your birthday.  So in a way, the people at the institution were your parents.  Were they nice to you? \nSAM Some yes.  Some on.  Some yes. \nTURNER Did they hit you? \nSAM Sometimes.  Sometimes they did sometimes. \nTURNER Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her birthday party? \nRITA Objection!  Nobody hit anybody! \nTURNER Let me rephrase that, strong-armed.  So what role model do you call upon as a father when you're parenting Lucy?  The head of the institution?  The Principal the warden? \nSAM No.  Not Mr. Whitehead.  Not him. \nTURNER Then who? \nSAM Myself. \nTURNER you have the mental capacity of a seven year old.  So you ask yourself, a seven year old - \nSAM I am not a seven-year old. \nTURNER How to parent a fellow seven-year old? \nSAM Yes.  No.  What was the question? \nTURNER The question is: what makes you think you can be a parent?  Your background? Your IQ?  Your friends who can't even testify for you? \nRITA Objection - \nSAM My friends - \nRITA Objection - \nSAM My friends love Lucy even if Rita thought they weren't smart enough to testify.  Even if she said you'd wipe the floor with them. \nON RITA \nTrying to telepathically reach Sam. \nTURNER Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just objected; that means you didn't have to answer the question.  You can't even follow the simple rules you've watched here day after day.  You really think you can raise a seven-year old?  A ten year old?  A thirteen-year old? (in his face) That means she'll be six years more advanced than you. \nSweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar.  He searches for words.  Then from the clearest place inside himself: \nSAM I've had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent.  It has to do with constancy.  It has to do with patience. It has to do with listening.  To pretending to listen when you can't even listen anymore. \nThe court is riveted by Sam's eloquence.  Rita's amazed. \nSAM (CONT'D) It has to do with love, like she says... \nRita's antenna goes up: who's \"she?\" \nSAM (CONT'D) And I don't know where it's written that a woman has a corner on that market, that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman.  Billy has a home with me!  It's not perfect!  I'm not a perfect parent!  Sometimes I forget he's just a little kid... (whispers from the courtroom) We built a life together and we love each other and if you destroy that, it may be irrep, irrep, irrep... \nHe can't let her go.  That he can't do.  Margaret, steel herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done this. \nMARGARET BROWN Please help me. \nRita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago, shakes her head, NO.  Now, Margaret literally has to wrench Lucy away from her father's arms.  Lucy bellowing as she pulls her down the hallway.  Sam is frozen in incalculable pain. \nEXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWe hear \"Fool on the Hill\".  We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.  Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall. \nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW.  Inside, the lights are dim. Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.  Sam, curled into a ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over again against the wall, overcome with grief. \nINT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the doorway, watching her sleeping child.  This stranger that she's raised.  She moves to cover him, this tough little boy, when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.  She tucks them both in, tenderly. \nEXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY \nSaturday in idyllic suburbia.  Sam, directions and a map in his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.  A small bouquet of flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT -- \nREVERSE ANGLE \nLucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.  She stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.  There's a tiny chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her. \nCLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY \nThe tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with her. \nRANDY Your teacher told me you were an artist. \nLUCY You wear too much perfume.  You're trying too hard. \nRANDY I am, aren't I.  Maybe you could teach me how to paint. \nLUCY My daddy's coming today.  We're going to open my birthday presents.  Why don't you just go do something. \nBACK TO SAM \nFrom where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything she deserves.  He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand - feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away. \nLucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her. \nBACK ON SAM \nWhere he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in the dirt.  From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.  And waits.  And waits. \nINT. STARBUCKS - DAY \nIt's Saturday.  The place is buzzing.  Sam listlessly cleans the tables, without the usual energy and verve.  A TODDLER marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his parents. \nMAN Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee, could you clean this up? \nSam sees a FAMILY at a table covered with spilled coffee. \nMAN (CONT'D) I said I need a refill and a towel over here. \nSAM (snapping) You need a towel?  A refill?  A glass of water?  You need more than you already have?  You have everything - (all his fury and frustration) Everything.  But it's not enough.  Take my daughter, too! \nSam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged.  They CRASH onto the floor. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. CARPENTER PORCH - DAY \nPaints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS THEM OVER.  Totally out of control. \nLUCY You gave him the wrong address!  You're hiding me from him! \nAs Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her. \nEXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK \nLucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.  Her eyes swollen from crying.  Finally, she gets up and moves to the tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel and begins to paint. \nThe front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and Lucy paint in silence for a long time.  Then - \nToo long a pause.  Ifty looks at the clock. \nIFTY Oh my God!  6:35 is Video Night at my house and I'm not even there! \nROBERT If we get there before you do we'll wait for you - check! \nBRAD Sam get your dessert to go. \nSAM This is very hard to say.  I'm having my dessert here.  With Rita.  I'm not coming to video night. \nDevastated, Ifty, Robert and Brad solemnly gather their things. \nRITA Sam - if you want to go... \nSAM I said no, Rita. \nRITA I know, but if you - \nSAM What?  Do you want me to go? \nRITA I didn't say that.  But do you want to go? \nSAM Where? \nRITA Nevermind. \nSAM Fine. \nRITA Fine. \nIFTY, ROBERT & BRAD Fine. \nThey leave in a huff.  The WAITRESS delivers the check with dessert and coffee. \nRITA I've got it. \nSAM I've got it. \nLong pause.  Rita slowly eats her pie. \nSAM (CONT'D) It's good to chew.  You're eating more slowly. \nRita laughs and nods. \nSAM (CONT'D) Coconut Rhubarb.  Sidebar, we need to talk.  Sidebar. \nRITA (carefully) Yes we do. \nSAM I need to get Lucy back.  We need, we need - to be professional. \nRITA Do you know what that means? \nSAM When dealing with Starbucks' customers, be friendly but not familiar.  I can be your friend. \nRITA (oddly touched) Thank you, Sam. \nSAM You need to leave your husband. \nRITA (her armor up again) Oh, my marriage isn't so bad. \nSAM 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.' \nRITA (undone) It's just...it's just that...I've never lost anything. \nEXT. SCHOOL - DAY \nRandy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school.  We follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS IN FRONT OF LUCY.  It's an ORIGAMI BIRD.  She looks around - but doesn't see Sam anywhere.  But she feels him.  She walks toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches.  There.  They made contact. \nEXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nIt's later that week.  Lucy walks proudly down the street in a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM, selling cookies.  Randy is by her side, beaming. \nLUCY We've made $22.36.  That's seven dollars, 64 cents less than thirty. \nRANDY Well that's one way of looking at it. \nEXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER \nRandy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on the quiet street. \nSERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. -- \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street. \nEXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT \nLucy knocks on Sam's window. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house. \nEXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT \nLucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house. \nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nUntil FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house looking out the windows, which have now been completely covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly opening the door. \nINT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear -- \nRANDY (tenderly) Lucy.  Come here. \nRandy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I made us a midnight snack. \nLucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I understand that you want to see your daddy.  And I don't want to keep you from him.  I honestly don't.  So you tell me when you want to see him.  You can see him anytime you want.  But we have to arrange it first.  Do you understand? (Lucy nods) Now would you like a snack? \nLucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch. But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy. \nLUCY Thank you.  Goodnight. \nRANDY (words caught in her throat) Goodnight, Lucy. \nINT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nWe PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCK at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there, looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit. \nRITA My husband left this when he moved out. \nSAM Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid. \nRITA (entering) Nice place.  I worry.  I worry sometimes... \nSAM You worry you did the wrong thing? \nRITA I worry that I've gotten more out of this relationship than you. \nSAM No no no.  I'm the lucky one.  I have the lawyer that never loses. \nRITA (covering) That's me...okay, let me see, let me see, let me see. (pulls out notes) They're going to put Bill and Randy on the stand first and then you. \nSAM Them first, then me.  They're a nice couple.  They have a nice house.  She's pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell. The manager of the salad bar is gonna testify, isn't he?  That will help us. \nFor a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam overwhelms her. \nRITA Absolutely. \nSAM Nobody believed that George Harrison could really be a song writer.  But he wrote \"Here Comes the Sun\".  John and Paul said it was one of the best songs on ABBEY ROAD. \nRITA (tenderly) George was always my favorite Beatle. \nSAM Lucy's was Paul. INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M. \n", "test1_input": "LILY I can be a mother.  A real good mother. \nSAM Oh, good.  Good. \nLILY I could even spank you. \nSAM Oh no no no.  I don't believe in that. \nLILY Okay okay.  I can be very gentle. \nSAM Gentle.  Gentle.  Yes.  Do you tell stories? \nLILY I got stories up the wazoo.  Why don't you come with me.  I'll tell you a nice story. \nSAM I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first. \nLILY A menage a toi? \nSAM French, French the language of France. You could teach my daughter, Lucy. \nLILY Your daughter?!  Can't you pick her up after?! \nSAM After?!  No no, Lucy comes too. \nLILY Whatever. \nShe takes Sam's hand, they move to get on the bus JUST AS ANOTHER HAND brusquely lands on theirs. \nCOP Not so fast.  You're under arrest. Solicitation. \nLILY He wanted to bring his kid, I said no. \nA lightbulb flashes and we -- SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - THAT NIGHT \nSam blinks as his MUGSHOT is being taken.  Now the profile. He turns so they can get the back of his head.  Now the FINGERPRINT. \nNow Sam, in the corner of the room, on the phone making thumbprints on the wall.  While the COP discusses his case with a social worker, MARGARET BROWN.  Over the years she's seen it all, and to get through it has had to pretend it's just a job. \nCOP It's the first time in nineteen years I actually believe the guy when he says he didn't know she was a hooker -- \nMARGARET BROWN You say that like it's a good thing. \nSAM ...Your teeth don't sound like they were brushed.  Do it with me now. \nCOP Let him go.  He says he's never spent a night away from his kid... Come with me - I got a guy who beat the shit out of his two year old.  Again. \nHer cell phone beeps. \nMARGARET BROWN Yes.  I am seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Rabins.  She's still screaming?  No, McDonald's won't help...she's four months old. \nSAM Thirteen up...not on the gum line not on the gum line, 1, 2, 3. \nMargaret watches Sam as he talks to Lucy on the phone. \nINT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY \nThe WALLS are lined with CHILDREN'S ART.  Various interpretations of the family.  We stop at one of a very small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him. \nMISS WRIGHT It gives us a great deal of insight into what she must be feeling.  And in the classroom, it's becoming clear she's holding herself back.  It's as if she's literally afraid to learn. \nWe PULL BACK and see Sam staring at the picture.  Mrs. Wright and the principal watch him. \nMISS WRIGHT (CONT'D) No one doubts that you love your daughter, Mr. Dawson.  But the Department of Social Services contacted us.  They shared with us that your records show that your intellectual capacity is around that of a seven year old.  Our concern is what happens when Lucy turns eight? \nPRINCIPAL Mr. Dawson, do you understand what Miss Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy? \nSAM No one wanted The Beatles to break up. But you can hear it on the White Album. They were going in different directions. \nINT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt's bedtime.  Sam and Lucy are reading from \"STELLALUNA\". \nLUCY How can we be so dif..dif...I don't know that word. \nSAM Yes you do.  It starts with a \"d\" -- \n", "test1_true": "SAM I don't believe you. \nLUCY Are you calling me a liar? \nSAM Yes.  Now read the word. \nLUCY (crying) No...I'm stupid. \nSAM No you're not. \nLUCY I don't want to read it if you can't. \nSAM It makes me happy.  I'm happy hearing you read it. \nHe holds the book open for Lucy.  Now Lucy, pushing through a mountain of resistance, reads.  And reads beautifully. \nLUCY \"Why are we different and so much alike?\" \nINT. SCHOOL HALLOWEEN PARADE - AUDITORIUM - DAY \nTwo children, dressed as Batman, march followed by CINDERELLA.  We see Lucy dressed in NEWSPAPER - an ORIGAMI BIRD.  And behind her, marching more proudly than any child, is Sam, dressed as PAUL McCARTNEY, in the black suit era - with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest.  Sam is the only adult participating in the parade. \nMusic BLASTS over the loudspeaker.  Sam begins to dance with joyous abandon.  Lucy joins him.  They dance together happily. \nSuddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning to laugh.  She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony around the room.  Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist and begins to imitate Sam.  Another kid joins him. \nKID I'm a Super Freak! \nCONNER And I thought my dad was a dork. \nLucy's face hardens for the first time.  In a corrupt world the pure can only stay pure for so long. \nINT. HAMBURGER HAMLET - EVENING \nSam and Lucy sit in a booth.  Lucy's ecstatic.  Sam's trying. \nLUCY They have eleven different kinds of hamburgers.  This is so great. \nSAM A new place.  Your choice.  I said we'd go to a new place.  And here we are. \nSam anxiously rearranges the condiments on the table.  Lucy tries to fold a napkin into an Origami bird. \nLUCY You know what else I want for my birthday, Daddy?  I want a hundred birds. \nSAM The napkins are much stiffer at Denny's. They make better birds.  There's not so much stuff on the tables there either. Why do they have two kinds of mustard on every table? \nWAITRESS Coffee? \nSAM No, no coffee.  Sam's system can't handle coffee. \nWAITRESS Okaaay!  What can I get you folks? \nLUCY I'd like the Benito Bandito burger and a chocolate chip milkshake, please. \nSAM I'll have the fish special, side of potatoes, salad with Thousand Island Dressing, cherry pie, and... \nWAITRESS I'm sorry, sir.  We don't have a fish special.  There's fish and chips.  It comes with a dinner salad. \nSAM Chips, chips?  You mean potato chips?  I don't want potato chips.  I want a side of potatoes. \nWAITRESS You want french fries? \nSAM No, a side of potatoes, like at Denny's. A side of potatoes. \nLUCY They're little red potatoes. \nWAITRESS We don't have new potatoes... \nSAM Denny's has new potatoes.  Six new potatoes parsley garnish parsley garnish... \nON LUCY \nHer smile fades. SMASH CUT TO: \nINT. DENNY'S - HALF-HOUR LATER \n", "test1_id": 1629, "test2_input": "EXT. STREETS - DAY \nRita stands next to her Porsche.  There are Starbucks in every direction she looks. \nINT. STARBUCKS - DAY \nSam is straightening Sweet and Lows.  Rita barrels in. \nRITA Look I don't think you understand what you're up against we have to be in court in three days and we don't have a decent witness.  Now you've gotta know someone who can testify who's been to college - or has a degree of some kind - or some sort of way of expressing themselves that's gonna make the court believe that you deserve to get your daughter back I need a coffee.  Big.  Tall. \nSAM Tall's the smallest. \nRITA Of course.  Of course, whatever.  Okay okay okay.  Damn!  I forgot to call back no I did and once you think of this person and there has to be one person - I want you to call me at work - because I'm going back there now to my seven other cases -- (her cellphone RINGS) What?  Mrs. Robeck?  I'm on my way, the traffic's horrible on the 405.  Dorothy, we put in five months lets not let a three car pile up..I know it's been enormously stressful.. Your Esczema? Oh, honey, nobody notices..AH!  They opened a lane! \nSAM (too loudly) Do you want it here or to go? \nRITA (dial tone) Dorothy?  Dorothy?  No no no I didn't stare at the eczema for five months for - \nShe takes out her car beeper, clicks it towards the window and realizes that they're towing her car! \nRITA (CONT'D) Sonuvabitch! INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nAnnie is at the piano, lost in a Beethoven concerto. \nSAM Annie, it's one day.  One hour.  Maybe only 53 minutes.  Lucy needs you. (Annie keeps playing) You went to college.  You can give the right answers. \nAnnie plays even harder.  Frustrated, he POUNDS the piano. \nSAM (CONT'D) We can't lose her. \nANNIE I can't.  I'd make it worse for you.  I can't do it.  Don't you think I would if I could? \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nWe HEAR A VOICE: \nVOICE (O.S.) All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip McNeily. \nSam stands along with others in the courtroom.  The Judge enters and sits.  Everyone else sits now, too.  Except Sam. Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down.  Now we see: \nIfty, Robert, Brad - and Brad's MOTHER, who sits several seats behind Brad knitting.  Robert holds up a handmade sign from the back of the courtroom \"Free Lucy Dawson\". \nINT. COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER \nTurner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness. He's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you. This man is razor-sharp.  The THERAPIST who evaluated Sam is on the stand.  Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the desk he sits at with Rita.  Projected on a SCREEN is a SLIDE of the drawing Lucy made in school. \nTHERAPIST ...there is an unhealthy reversal of roles here. As you can see from her drawings, she has an exaggerated sense of responsibility.  Lucy feels she has to take care of her father.  Although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed. \nRITA Objection.  \"True feelings revealed\"?! \nTURNER The state is paying Miss Geller for her opinions - \nRITA Then every child who rages because they didn't get to stay up for that extra hour of TV - \nTURNER Objection your honor - \nSam TUGS at Rita's sleeve.  She ignores it. \nRITA ...in fact any child who said they hated their parents because they didn't want to take a bath would be a prime candidate for Foster Care. \nTURNER Objection. \nSAM I think they want you to stop. \nRITA Really?!  Thank you, Sam. \nJUDGE MCNEILY We all appreciate your assistance Mr. Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr. Turner. \nTURNER Now Ms. Geller, I assume in your therapy session, Mr. Dawson extolled his parenting abilities. \nTHERAPIST On the contrary, Mr. Dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate - that he was terrified he'd made and would continue to make - and I quote: \"Huge mistakes, huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge.\" \nTURNER No further questions. \nRita starts to scribble notes furiously.  So does Sam. Turner smugly sits down.  Rita confidently strides toward the witness. \n", "test2_true": "THERAPIST Yes. \nRITA Would it be fair to say that as a parent, you've felt confused from time to time, possibly overwhelmed on occasion, even though you're a wonderful mother? \nTURNER Objection.  It's Mr. Dawson's parenting. Not Ms. Geller's that's at question here. \nRITA But if Ms. Geller has never had a moment where she felt confused as a mother it would bias her opinion.  And it is her expert opinion we're all after, isn't it, Mr. Turner? \nJUDGE MCNEILY Overruled.  I'll allow it. \nRITA Thank you, your Honor.  Ms. Geller, I know there have been many moments as a parent where I've felt I've made huge mistakes - mistakes that are huge.  And I've had to admit them to myself.  My husband.  But most importantly, to my therapist.  Which is the guise Mr. Dawson thought he was seeing you under, isn't that right, Ms. Geller? \nTURNER Objection. \nJUDGE MCNEILY Get to the point, Ms. Harrison. \nRITA The point is you've never had those moments, have you Ms. Geller?  Moments that every parent I've ever spoken to has - moments when you've felt the task is so unbelievably challenging that you feel retarded, disabled in some way. Moments when you feel everyone has the key but you.  But you've never had those moments, have you Ms. Geller? \nTHERAPIST I - \nRITA Yes or no? \nTHERAPIST I - \nRITA Let me rephrase the question.  When your son od'ed - \nTURNER Objection! \nRITA But if Ms. Geller didn't feel she had made mistakes - mistakes that were huge it might bias her opinion toward Mr. Dawson. \nJUDGE MCNEILY I will - \nRITA Thank you.  So Ms. Geller - yes or no - when your son od'ed, did you feel you might have made mistakes, mistakes that were huge? \nTHERAPIST (tearfully) Yes. \nINT. COURTROOM CAFETERIA - DAY \nSam and Rita go down the cafeteria line. \nSAM You made her cry. \nRITA You got lucky. \nSAM That's not nice.  Not very nice. \nRITA Only in there. \nSAM Your secretary too.  Yellow and green in one bowl. (Sam stares at a bowl of Lima beans and corn) You separate the Lima beans from the corn please? \nThe CAFETERIA WORKER stares at him.  Yeah.  Sure he will. \nRITA Sam, don't be impossible. (then to Worker) Can I have the spinach omelet - only egg whites no fat no oil no butter and extra mushrooms. \nCAFETERIA WORKER Absolutely. \nSam is anxiously separating his Lima beans and corn into separate piles.  They arrive at the cashier.  Rita pulls out her billfold.  Sam reaches for his wallet. \nSAM My treat.  My treat. \nRITA Don't be ridiculous.  I'll get it. \nSAM I said it's my treat.  That means I'll get it. \nRITA Sam, do you really want to get it or are you just trying to -- \nSAM Trying to what? \nRITA You know, trying to act like a - \nSAM Like a what? \nRITA Like a...a... \nSAM A real man? \n", "test2_id": 1630, "test3_input": "RITA Is that what she said? \nSAM She didn't have to say it.  I may be stupid, but I know.  I know. \nRITA Well that's the first stupid thing I've ever heard you say. \nSam looks at her through the window.  A CHINK in the wall. \nRITA (CONT'D) Sam, Sam you can get her back.  The court favors reunification.  The only thing that can block you is if the foster family petitions to adopt.  And from what I've heard, Lucy's making their life miserable - that's our girl. Sam, fight for her. \nSAM I tried.  I tried. \nRITA Try harder. \nSAM You don't know.  You don't know. \nRITA I don't know? \nSAM You don't know what it is to try and try and never get there.  You were born perfect, perfect. \nRITA Is that right?  Everyone else is perfect but only Sam feels loss and pain? \nSAM That's right.  People like you don't know. \nRITA People like me? \nSAM People like you don't know, don't know what hurt feels like, people like you don't feel, don't feel anything. \nShe slaps him.  STUNNED, he slaps her back.  STUNNED, she slaps him again.  HE SLAPS HER.  She rips the newspaper wall down. \nRITA You think you got the market cornered on human suffering?  Well let me tell you something about \"People like me.\" People like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable.  People like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son, my son hates me, I try too hard and I push and he knows it and I talk in that voice, that voice I promised I'd never use, and I've screamed, I've screamed horrible things to him, a five year-old because he doesn't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and I hate him then. I know I'm failing you, I know I'm disappointing you, I know you deserve better but get in the fucking car!  It's like every morning I wake up and fail, and I look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow I can't. And I know, I know I have everything, and I'm still miserable and it's pathetic.  I know it's pathetic.  No matter how hard I try, something about me will never be enough. \nShe's crying too hard to continue.  He pulls her to him. Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him tightly.  He whispers in her ear. \nSAM You're enough.  You're so much more than enough. \nHe looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity.  And staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes, her tears.  And something ignites between them - something confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate ache. \nSAM (CONT'D) Lovely Rita... \nOn a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come together, whole again. \nEXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nSam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by SIX DOGS, all shapes, all sizes.  He heads up the walkway to Randy's house.  She comes out of the house and shuts the door behind her, stopping him. \nRANDY You're early. \nSAM All the lights were green. \nRANDY There's a reason for the court schedule. You stopped showing up.  Lucy has had to rebuild her life. \nSAM I want her back.  I can do it.  I know I can. \nRANDY That's not up to me, but I'm telling you, I will do everything in my power to prevent Lucy from getting hurt again. \nSam hangs his head.  A dog barks at Randy. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Whose dogs are these? \nSAM Supplemental income supplemental income - bathe, walk and feed.  Sam Dawson meets your canine needs. (to dogs) Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! All the dogs sit but a BIG BLACK LAB.  Randy heads into the house.  The front door opens and Lucy comes out.  She runs down the stares to Sam.  Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her. She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent up fury. \nLUCY You never came!  You never even called! You forgot about me!  How could you forget me! \nSAM I never forgot you.  I forgot me. \nSAM (CONT'D) I hate you I hate you I hate you! \nLucy pulls away.  A long charged silence.  Lucy refusing to even look at her father. \nSAM (CONT'D) Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last night... \nA BASSET HOUND SNEEZES. \nSAM (CONT'D) Gesundheit, Buster.  Buster has a cold. But the letter had too many big words. Pokey, sit. \nThe black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.  Lucy stares forward.  Sam speaks tentatively, carefully: \n", "test3_true": "Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time. \nINT. DENNY'S - DAY \nON SALAD BAR \nRows of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and - uh-oh, a tomato's in the peas.  A hand comes into frame and carefully places the tomato just so, in the tomato bin.  Now it moves to the olives.  Shouldn't all the pimentos be facing up? \nPULL BACK \nTo reveal Sam, in white apron and hat, deftly filling the containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their plates. \nSAM Napa cabbage, excellent choice.  Purple and green, purple and green.  Very rich in Vitamin C.  Good choice. Very good choice. \nINT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY \nSam walks toward the courtroom when we see Rita approaching from the other end of the hall.  They both slow down when they see each other.  Rita unconsciously fixes her hair.  Sam adjusts his tie. \nRITA Hello, Sam.  Mr. Dawson.  Sam.  Dawson. \nSAM Hello, lawyer. \nThey almost shake hands - realize that means touching each other and don't.  Rita motions toward the door. \nRITA Shall we? \nSAM No.  We already did.  Don't tell anybody. \nThey nervously walk through the door, bumping into each other. \nINT. SMALL COURT ROOM - LATER \nShe's very aware of Sam.  He looks away, over compensating obviously.  Throughout the scene, Rita's hair falls in her eyes.  She attempts to put it in place. \nRITA Furthermore, my client has found a new job, and is making every effort to find a bigger apartment so that - \nRita's hair falls in her eyes again.  Sam stands up, pulls HER BARRETTE from his pocket, the one she left at his house. \nSAM Here. \nRita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder weapon. \nRITA Oh, thank you.  What a...a lovely barrette, Mr. Dawson.  It will look great on Lucy.  Who I'm sure you bought it for.  Furthermore, so that...there will be more room for Lucy as she grows up. \nMARGARET BROWN All of that is well and good but the fact that Mr. Dawson quite his job, missed his hearing, and did not even show up for his visits with his daughter... \nRITA The fact that my client went through profound depression is the most natural reaction any parent could have. \nMARGARET BROWN But once again he had no idea how his behavior during that depression impacted on his daughter. \nRITA In these next months, Mr. Dawson will be expanding his support system to include Social Service programs, tutors -- \nMARGARET BROWN It's too late!  The foster family is petitioning the court for sole custody of Lucy and I fully support their request. \nSam turns to Rita.  This can't be happening. \nINT. DENNY'S - NIGHT \nSam, Rita, Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in a booth.  With one extra person, it's a little tight.  Rita picks at her Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at hand. \nIFTY Isn't it illegal?  It's illegal to go through stop signs.  It's illegal to cross on the red. \nRITA It's not illegal.  It's very complicated.  When a strong foster parent lobbies for a child it changes the equation. \nROBERT They're reaching right through Sam as if he doesn't exist.  As if he's a ghost. \nRITA There's one option we've never talked about, Sam. (very carefully) I know what you went through the last time you took the stand.  We could settle out of court, ask for the most incredible visitation rights - it would almost seem like joint custody. \nSAM You're saying I don't have a chance. That's what you're saying. \nRITA I'm not saying you don't have a chance. \nROBERT That's what you said last time and look where he is now. \nSAM Stop.  Rita's not saying I don't have a chance.  Are you?  Tell me I have a chance. \n", "test3_id": 1631}

JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) I have to have a brief sir? 
161   INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT                    161 
Westerby is on the phone. 
JERRY WESTERBY Ann? I'm sorry to bother you. Is George back yet? 
162   INT. CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT - PRESENT             162 
Westerby and Smiley sit opposite each other. 
SMILEY You rang my house? 
JERRY WESTERBY Just on the off chance you were back from Berlin. 
SMILEY What did you say? 
JERRY WESTERBY Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis. She said you weren't back yet. That was it. 
SMILEY Go on. 
JERRY WESTERBY All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border, Lacon and the Minister baying at the door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did. 
163   INT. CIRCUS - NIGHT - PAST                               163 
PUSHING BILL HAYDON as he walks up the corridor towards the duty room, cutting a swathe through the people gathered outside. 
BILL HAYDON Get out. 
The room clears. 
Bill sits down. He pulls out all the phone lines, decisive, taking charge. Kicks the door shut. 
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D) Tell me. 
JERRY WESTERBY I tried to get hold of you... 
BILL HAYDON I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club... Tell me. 
JERRY WESTERBY Jim Prideaux's been shot. 
Haydon goes white. 
HAYDON Get me the Hungarian Embassy. 
JERRY WESTERBY (With relief) Yes sir... 
LATER: 
Haydon is on the phones. 
BILL HAYDON You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged... 
He covers the receiver, turns to Westerby. 
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D) Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell him to pull in the Hungarian agents, anyone we're onto. Tell him to get down to the London School of Economics, sandbag some bloody students and put them on ice at Sarratt. 
LATER: 
Westerby watches Haydon on the phone from the door. Haydon listens to a voice for a moment, then hangs up. He stands, his back to Westerby. 
JERRY WESTERBY Any more news on him? 
Haydon doesn't turn around, head bowed. 
JERRY WESTERBY (CONT'D) Bill? (Beat) Oh God, is he...? 
For a moment it looks like Haydon won't answer but then he seems to master his emotions. 
BILL HAYDON We need to go to his flat. Clear out anything linked. 
164   INT. PRIDEAUX'S FLAT - NIGHT                             164 
Haydon walks around the neat rooms. A bike up on the wall, a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper, waiting to be cleaned. Haydon walks past a shelf - photographs and books. He stops, picks up an unframed black and white snap from the shelf. It's a picture of HIMSELF. 
Haydon stands with his back to us, possibly crying. Westerby turns thoughtfully away. 
165   OMITTED                                                     165

167   INT. LONDON - WIMPY - NIGHT                                 167 
Smiley and Guillam sit eating side by side at a bar, Smiley examining the hamburger - his first - doubtfully. Guillam is thinking about what he's just been told. 
PETER GUILLAM Haydon heard the news at his club?

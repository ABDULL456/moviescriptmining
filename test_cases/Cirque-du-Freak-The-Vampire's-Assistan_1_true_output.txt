DARREN Never met him. I don't think Steve ever did either. Why do you want to know? And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled. 
STEVE Darren? And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay. 
CREPSLEY Will you come with me now or do you have things to set in order first? That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every- thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking, Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley. 
CREPSLEY I see... Darren's almost to the door. Crepsley stays where he is. 
CREPSLEY Run if you want. It won't help. You're a creature of the night now, Darren Shan. Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone. Chuckling, the vampire tucks Steve's covers up under his chin. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOSPITAL DOORS - NIGHT 
BURSTING OPEN as Darren charges out. Running for his life. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DARREN'S ROOM - MORNING 
Darren asleep in his bed. The door opens and his mom enters. 
MOM Darren... Wake up, honey. Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake. As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in. 
MOM I just got off the phone. Great news. Steve's going to be okay. 
DARREN What? 
MOM The hospital says it's a miracle. Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS. Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back. 
MOM Yeah, it's great news. I know how you feel. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY 
The door opens and Darren steps out. He takes a long look up and down the street. Nervous. Then he see the sun up in the sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun. He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the bushes... SOMEONE LEAPS! 
ANNIE Boo! Darren nearly jumps out of his skin. Annie laughs. 
ANNIE Got you! I finally got you! - Darren turns on her, looks like he could kill her. 
DARREN Don't ever do that again. Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - SCHOOL - DAY 
Darren walking along, feeling isolated as he moves past the other students. Everything seems weird, off. A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then a COUPLE more coming the other way. 
KID Hey, Shan, you gotta see this. They duck into the classroom. Darren follows. 
SCIENCE LAB TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor tank. Steve holds court. 
STEVE .Doctor said it was a miracle. They say I'm unique -- Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back. 
STEVE Hey, Darren. I've been looking for you. We got a lot to talk about. 
DARREN Yeah? 
STEVE But first... Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren looks from the mouse to the snake... Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy. 
STEVE Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What happens to us all can happen to any of us. If you watch, it's by your own free will. Say farewell...

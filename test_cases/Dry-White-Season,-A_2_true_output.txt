STOLZ Don't you think this business has gone long enough? 
Ben, struggling to maintain his composure. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BEN That's for you people to decide. Isn't it? I won't be blackmailed, Captain -- not even by you. STOLZ Mind if I smoke? 
Ben answers by a gesture. STOLZ (after lighting his cigarette) Now be honest. Has all the evidence you've been collecting in connection with Gordon Ngubene brought you closer to the truth you are looking for? BEN Yes, I think so and there's more to come. A pause. STOLZ I really hoped we could talk man-to-man. 
BEN It's not possible, Captain.    Not between you and me. STOLZ It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace. I'm offering you a chance. 
BEN You mean my very last chance? 
STOLZ One never knows. It may not be important to you, but we have to survive. 
BEN If we can only survive through murder and torture, then we have forfeited our right to exist. 
Slowly and deliberately Stolz stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: STOLZ Is that your final answer? 
BEN Before you go. I'll tell this, Captain. I have a pretty good idea of what I will eventually uncover. I mean the truth. And I won't allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth. 
Ben walks up to the door to see him out. There's no response from Stolz. He calmly takes a small card out of his pocket and rests it on Ben's desk. 
STOLZ Here's my card -- my private line. If you should change your mind... Let's say before the end of the week? BEN Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt the photograph. Stolz picks up the photograph and puts it into his briefcase. 
STOLZ (leaving) Be careful, Mr. Du Toit. There are people who can make things very difficult for you. BEN They are wasting their time. They just can't hurt me anymore. I trust you'll give them the message, Captain. 
He walks out. Ben follows him 'round the garage and watches him get into his car and drive away. Johan joins his father. 
JOHAN (mischievous) A brandy, Papa? 
BEN (smiling back, ruffling his hair) A gin and tonic would be fine. 
INT. JAN SMUTS AIRPORT - DAY Ben and Johan are standing in the public enclosure on the top floor of the airport building. Ben is unshaved, he looks tired, but happy. There is the usual bustle of airport staff for the steps and luggage, two-thirds of the staff being black. 
Passengers emerge from the plane Melanie amongst them. Some waving to friends and relatives on the public en- closure. Melanie stops momentarily and looks up at the enclosure. She sees Ben and Johan and waves at them. They wave back and Ben indicates they'll be waiting for her below. She walks off as they happily await her after the ususal formalities. INT. JAN SMUTS AIRPORT - DAY 
Ben and Johan are waiting outside the arrivals exit. Several passengers stream out, some being met. Eventually there is a trickle of passengers. An INDIAN WOMAN is one of the last to come out. Ben approaches her. BEN Excuse me, I'm waiting for a lady with a red dress. Are there still, many people to come? INDIAN WOMAN I did see her. She was ahead of me. Maybe she's still in there. BEN Thank you. Just then an OFFICIAL walks out of the door.   Ben hurries to him. BEN Excuse me. OFFICIAL Can I help you? 
BEN I'm waiting for a passenger, Miss Bruwer. She's taking a rather long time to be cleared. 
OFFICIAL What did you say her name was? 
BEN Melanie Bruwer. OFFICIAL I'll go and check. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Official hurries back. 
JOHAN Is there any other exit, Papa? BEN No. They have to collect their luggage and pass through customs. JOHAN (joking) Maybe she can't find her bag. BEN (smilng back) That's possble. 
Just then Stolz appears through the door. He slowly walks up to Ben and Johan. Ben becomes apprehensive. STOLZ Afternoon, Meneer Du Toit.   Johan, isn't it? 
Ruffling his hair; Johan pulling away and glaring at him. BEN What now, Captain? 
STOLZ Word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend, Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful. Now let's take your friend, she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country. But you know something else? She has been secretly holding a British passport. A South African passport and a British pasport. Now you tell me, where is her patriotism? Her allegiance? The minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant. So she is being put on the first available plane to London. This must be heart- breaking for you. Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit, Johan. Stolz walks back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BEN (quietly) Let's go home, Johan. JOHAN I don't understand, Papa...

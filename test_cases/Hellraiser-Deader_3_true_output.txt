AMY I didn't give my soul to him... 
Amy points the knife at what's left of Winter. 
AMY ...and I'm not giving it to you. 
And with that Amy thrusts the knife into her chest. Pinhead screams out. 
PINHEAD No! 
The room starts to fill with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The Puzzle Box starts to close as- 
Pinhead and the boys are sucked back into the void, which closes behind them. 
Amy looks up from the knife planted deep in her gut- 
- AND SMILES. She tips out of frame as the screen bleaches white and we- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLES RICKMAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Where we suddenly find ourselves lost in some bright flickering space, filled with the sound of static. Abruptly, the static vanishes, the flickering space congeals -- and we realize that we are watching a television screen. 
And as we PULL BACK, we realize that we are seeing a news report on from SNN (Satellite News Network). 
We are in Charles's office. He's there watching this new report. Images of what appear to be a terrible explosion fill the frame (stock footage from a terrorist attack in London perhaps?) Cars on fire, imploded building, panic in the street, etc... The door opens and his assistant BETTY comes in. She watches Charles for a moment.) 
BETTY I just talked to the Police. Still, nothing. She's just gone. Left her hotel, left her clothes, left her money. No sign of her anywhere. 
CHARLES See no Amy. Hear no Amy... 
BETTY Just like Marla Chen. Apartment just left empty. No trace. The police say its to early to file an official report. (off his concerned look) Do you think they she with foul play? 
CHARLES (off the TV) I don't know, I just don't know. (beat) Too bad, too. It would have made a hell of a story. (beat) I'm sure she'll come walking in here any minute, carrying with her my story. 
Charles watches the report on the TV. Pandemonium in the streets. 
It's a hell of a story, too. It just gets better and better. And it looks like I just may need somebody else crazy enough to go get it. 
BETTY Maybe you have. Your three o'clock's here. 
Betty leans her head out of the room signalling someone out in the hall to come in. 
A YOUNG BOMBSHELL REPORTER enters, holds out her hand to Charles who suddenly perks up as he takes it and leads her to the couch. 
As he does we move past Charles and the young reporter to the 
TV. A REPORTER reports live from the scene of a terrible explosion in- 
REPORTER (V.O.) Bucharest, Romania. 
Over the continuing images of this destroyed building, surrounded by police cars and fire trucks , the sirens blaring over all the confusion,s Charles courts the reporter. 
CHARLES                     REPORTER (V.O.) Miss Turner. It's a pleasure    Witnesses say the building, to meet you welcome you to      located at the corner of our team. Let's cut right to    Poteilari and Minvara just it, shall we.                   imploded. Firefighters have I received this tape which I    been on the scene for several would like to show you...and    hours now. Sources say the well, I think it's a story      only thing that seemed to you could really wrap your      survive the collapse of the head around. I hope your        building was a this, (she willing to do so...             holds up the puzzle box) this small relic, found incredibly, undamaged. 
We move past the image of the puzzlebox on the TV and settle on the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of AMY AND CHARLES in happier times - - smiling. Probably the first time we've seen a smile on

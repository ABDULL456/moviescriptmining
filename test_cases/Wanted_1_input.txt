THE BUTCHER We all end up where we belong, don't we? The Butcher snickers. Sloan speaks up... 
SLOAN Fox told you about your father? Wesley looks from Sloan to Fox to the Butcher and back to Sloan. 
WESLEY 
(STAMMERS) Like I told... um... the lady here... I think you might ha ve me mixed up with someone else. I'm just an... um... account serv... uh..that is... account manager... and... my father died... He hesitates. 
SLOAN When? They look at him, imploringly, waiting for an answer. 
WESLEY I... I guess I'm not sure. Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the gun in Wesley's hand. 
SLOAN Shoot the wings off the flies. 
WESLEY What?! 
SLOAN 
(GROWLS) Shoot... the wings... off the flies. For. the first time, Wesley notices flies buzzing all around. 
WESLEY I don't... In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun off the rolling table and ',s -pointing it at Weslev's temple. He begins to count... 
SLOAN You have three seconds. Three... two... Before he can say one, Wesley reacts... blindly firing the pistol in his hand, indiscriminately, B,AM! BAM! BAM! BAM! CLICK...CLICK...CLICK... until his finger is just jamming on the trigger over and over. After a moment, he looks up, unsure why he isn't dead. 
Sloan smiles, drops his pistol on the rolling table and picks up the magnifying glass. He stoops down and signals Wesley to do the same. 
THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS: Four flies lie on - the floor. crawling o d... their wings actually separated from their bodies! 
IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE: Wesley jerks upright, trying to process this. 
FOX Like I said, you got the skills. 
SLOAN And after we fine tune those skills... His eyes lock on to Wesley's, holding them in a vice-like grip... 
SLOAN (CONT'D) .you're going to hunt the man who killed Your father. Wesley is as stunned as we've ever seen him... he blinks a couple of times. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) Walk with me. He drapes his arm around Wesley and leads him out the door. 
EXT. CITY BLOCK - DAY 
Sloan and Wesley move down a busy commercial street. 
SLOAN I know thin is hard for you to understand, Wesley, but I want you to concentrate on what I'm saying. Your father was a member of the Fraternity, a collection of the most powerful assassins the world has ever known. They weave against the flow of pedestrians out and about on the city streets. Instinctively, people step out of their way. 
WESLEY But I've never heard of... 
SLOAN We don't advertise Wesley. We blend into the environment like moths against a tree.

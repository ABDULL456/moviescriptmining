But seemingly unfazed, he just picks himself up and walks back out the front door. 
EXT. MARKET STREET 13F                                                                    13F Carnby stands in a crowd of BYSTANDERS, watching in surprise as Pinkerton exits the Bakery, his expression fierce. 
Pinkerton immediately spots Carnby and comes after him. 
Carnby bolts away, running into a Herbalist Store across the street. 
INT. HERBALIST STORE 13G                                                                    13G Jars of different shapes and sizes containing a variety of medicinal herbs and other such substances are on display. 
Carnby runs into the Herbalist Store, making his way through the displays. 
Pinkerton leaps right through the Herbalist Store's front display window in a hail of SHATTERED glass. 
He tackles Carnby, CRASHING through the jars on display. 
Pinkerton SLAMS Carnby to the ground. He grabs Carnby's head and SMASHES it against the floor once, then twice. 
Pinkerton tears open Carnby's trench-coat. He pulls out the burlap sack. He opens the sack, confirming the stone carving is inside it. 
While Pinkerton inspects the stone carving, Carnby's hand quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them. 
Carnby SMASHES the glass jar over Pinkerton's face. 
He grabs the stone carving out of Pinkerton's hand, scrambles to his feet, and runs. 
EXT. ALLEY 13H                                                                    13H Carnby BURSTS out of the Herbalist Store's back door, exiting out into a small, cluttered Alley. 
Carnby lands hard in the debris, but he rolls with the fall and is back up on his feet, running. 
The Alley ends in a high Wall with a Billboard on top of it. The Wall has a railing along one side. 
Carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running. 
The Alley is crowded with WORKERS unloading crates out of the loading dock of the Ice Factory. 
A BEAT COP walks by. Carnby runs past the Beat Cop, just barely bumping into him. 
But as Carnby passes him, he deftly grabs the Beat Cop's gun from his holster. 
The Beat Cop doesn't even notice his gun is missing as he turns, annoyed to see Carnby racing away. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BEAT COP Hey! 
Pinkerton runs out of the Herbalist Store's back door. He runs directly at the high Wall. 
Pinkerton leaps up, scrambling right up the side of the Wall. He hauls himself up the Billboard, until he's standing at the top of the Billboard itself. 
Pinkerton looks down below and spots Carnby running into the loading dock of the Ice Factory. 
Pinkerton leaps off the Billboard. 
The Beat Cop looks up, stunned to see Pinkerton leaping towards him. 
Pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates, CRUSHING the crates on it. The WORKER pushing the dolly falls back, shocked. Pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing after Carnby. 
The Beat Cop fumbles for his gun. It's not there. Pinkerton smashes the Beat Cop out of the way as he pursues Carnby. 
The Beat Cop flies into a pile of crates, knocked out. Pinkerton follows Carnby into the Ice Factory. 
INT. ICE FACTORY 13J                                                                   13J The refrigerated Ice Factory is filled with neat rows of ice blocks. FACTORY WORKERS mill about, transporting the blocks of ice through the Factory. 
Carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks. He checks the Beat Cop's gun to make sure it's loaded. It is. 
Carnby stops, sensing something. 
In one fluid motion, Carnby suddenly spins, turning in the other direction and FIRING the gun. 
We follow the bullet as it rockets through the Ice Factory. It WHIZZES along, until we see Carnby's intended target. 
Pinkerton comes through the Ice Factory, running at Carnby. The bullet flies directly at him. 
The bullet hits Pinkerton in the shoulder. But it only seems to anger Pinkerton further. He keeps running at Carnby. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Pinkerton leaps at Carnby. Carnby FIRES again. But Pinkerton dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice, SHATTERING it in a hail of ice shards.

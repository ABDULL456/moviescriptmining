URI Mrs Pentane very good of you to see me like this. 
ELLE Come in Mister Tallow. 
She wants anything but this dull little man in her apartment. 
Uri enters. He wipes his feet excessively, over and over. 
She closes the door behind him. He looks around. 
68 | P a g e URI Lovely, just lovely. This is yours? Goodness. 
He goes to a piece of art hanging on the wall. A nude. 
URI It's amazing. Such talent. Me . . . 
He shrugs as if worthless. Elle tries to hold it together. 
ELLE Can I get you anything? 
URI No ­ really I'm fine. Thank you. 
He has trouble meeting her eyes. That unsettles her even more. 
URI Such platitudes! Here we are trapped inside a Terrence Rattigan three act . . . 
He laughs. It sounds unnatural. 
Wary of him in the extreme, he gestures to a seat reluctantly. 
She sits down opposite him. Her body language is pure defence. 
URI Mrs Pentane. A delicate subject of course. Your husband. 
She blinks. He can see the unimaginable depth of her grief. 
Uri gets some correspondence out of his briefcase. 
URI Good, old fashioned paper. Nothing like it. 
He waves the sheets of paper around. She can't even react. 
URI Firstly I'm so very sorry for your loss. I know the ministry has informed you that your husband ­ Mr Nicholas . . . 
She puts her hand across her slightly swollen belly. 
69 | P a g e She's pregnant. My God. Uri frowns slightly, struggles. 
URI Misses Pentane the fact is that . . . 
She looks at him with exhausted, beautiful eyes. 
URI The truth is Misses Pentane that . . . I'm here to tell you that . . . Well this may not be what you want to hear but . . . 
He looks at her, looks away. He can't meet her gaze. 
ELLE (get the fuck out) If you'd kindly hurry. Please. 
Her phone bleeps a message alert. An isolated sound. 
URI Misses Pentane I . . . 
He can't speak. Why did he come here? This is impossible. 
URI Misses Pentane . . . 
ELLE Oh for God sake! 
She gets up, stands, walks away from him. He stands. 
URI The fact is that your husband did not die in the manner in which you have been told he died. As I alluded in my letter, my email. . . 
She opens the door for him to leave. He wants to die. 
ELLE I can't do this now. I'm sorry.

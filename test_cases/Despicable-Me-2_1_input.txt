GRU (whispers) Hey, I told you guys to get to bed. 
MARGO Oh, sorry. 
EDITH So when ya goin' on your date? 
GRU What? 
EDITH Remember? Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you. 
GRU Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And I'm not going on any date. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    17. 
EDITH Why not?    Are you scared? 
Gru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes. 
EXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY 
We flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA. 
LISA (to her friends) Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV? 
GIRLS Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so cool... 
LISA Yeah, and you know what-- 
Gru approaches her. 
LITTLE GRU Excuse me, Lisa? 
But she doesn't notice him.    He tries again. 
LISA (to her friends) I was talking to Billy the other day. 
GIRLS No way. 
LISA He is so cute. 
Gru clears his throat. 
LISA (CONT'D) And I think he likes me. 
GRU Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you-- 
Gru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer finger. 
Then one of the other little girls points to Gru's finger on Lisa's shoulder. DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT   18. 
GIRL Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru touched Lisa! 
The other girls turn and squeal, horrified. 
GIRLS Eeeeewww! 
A little buck-toothed red-haired girl shouts out to the entire playground. 
RED HAIRED GIRL Lisa's got Grooties! 
The playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and runs away. 
Little Gru is left alone.     Crushed. 
INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Gru comes out of the flashback. 
GRU Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed. 
Gru gives each girl a goodnight kiss. 
GRU (CONT'D) Goodnight, Edith. 
Then he goes over to Margo, who's already in bed. 
GRU (CONT'D) Goodnight, Margo. 
She continues texting as he gives her a kiss.

Then he turns to face Nina. As always, there is much to be said that they cannot say. She gently touches the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the cross she gave him. They embrace tightly and kiss. She gets in the car, looking at him through the back window as she is driven away. 
35   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                       35 
Darkness. As our eyes adjust we realize we are in the middle of the woods. Is this a dream? A nightmare? We are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance. 
36   EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT                            36 
From out of the darkness comes a candle held by a nervous, almost mousy young woman, FRAULEIN VON OVEN. Walking just behind her is Tresckow. He carries a small but heavy case in one hand. 
They come to a clearing in the woods and find a strange sight. In the center is a tree stump surrounded by papers, including the original orders for OPERATION VALKYRIE, next to a leather valise marked with the seal of the Reich. The orders have been meticulously annotated. 
VOICE (O.S.) Were you followed? 
Fraulein Oven gasps. Tresckow turns, pistol drawn. The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from Stauffenberg's eyepatch. Stauffenberg smiles, emerging from the shadows. 
TRESCKOW Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half to death. 
STAUFFENBERG We'll be closer than that before we're finished. 
37   EXT. FOREST - LATER                                       37 
Wearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter. She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into the machine and sets the margins carefully. Pause. Then she starts typing with remarkable speed. 
(Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene, punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each time a little louder.) 
Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes. 
TRESCKOW Looking this over, I'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely. 
STAUFFENBERG (handing over papers) Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave. 
Before Tresckow can respond, more papers: 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) I've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers. 
More papers. Tresckow can barely keep up. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested... or shot. 
CRACK. A carriage return as loud as a rifle-shot. 
38   EXT. BERLIN - STREET - LATER                              38 
A truck full of soldiers roars past. Stauffenberg, Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the middle. 
Stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter case. They stop at the center of the bridge, looking around carefully. No one is in sight, but anyone could be watching from the shadows. Eerie. 
STAUFFENBERG (to the Fraulein) If anyone comes to you, play ignorant. Just tell them- 
FRAULEIN OVEN I'll tell that I was serving the German people. Then I'll tell them to go to hell. 
Both men smile, a bit taken aback. Von Oven shakes each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the darkness. When she is gone: 
TRESCKOW To Operation Valkyrie. 
Stauffenberg nods. Tresckow heaves the typewriter case over the railing and into the water below. 
SPLASH. 
They watch in silence as the water settles, then: 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) I've been transferred to the front. 
STAUFFENBERG (shocked) Why didn't you tell me? 
TRESCKOW Would you have stayed? 
Obviously not. Then it occurs to Stauffenberg. 
STAUFFENBERG Do you think Fromm reported us? 
TRESCKOW It's more likely just... an unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it doesn't matter. You wrote the orders. You know them better than anyone. 
STAUFFENBERG You don't mean to say-

JOE Start?  This isn't a good time. 
ANN Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time. 
JOE Later on. 
ANN Then I'll come back, then. 
JOE You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance? 
ANN No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow. 
She starts to exit. 
INT. TAVERN INN HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ann digs in pocket, takes out the lure we previously saw in Joe's finger.  She re-enters the room. 
ANN It occurred to me, you'd wanna have this: sort of a memento of our... 
ANGLE ON ROOM 
Claire is standing there, basically naked.  PAUSE. 
CLAIRE Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing... 
JOE She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...wait!  She came in here...she... (to Claire) ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in bed, I told her I could not -- we don't know each other, you see... 
CLAIRE We had a script conference. 
JOE I told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because, uh, because... 
ANN You can do it. 
JOE Because I'd met someone else. 
ANN (very simply) Oh, okay. 
JOE You believe that? 
ANN I do if you do. 
PAUSE 
JOE But it's absurd. 
ANN So is our electoral process.  But we still vote. 
JOE Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd? 
ANN I used to go out with a politician. 
JOE You used to go out with him, you broke up with him? 
ANN Sure did. 
JOE Why? 
ANN Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight. 
JOE Yes. 
ANN Go you Huskies! 
INT. HALL - NIGHT 
Ann puts down the typewriter and types into it, "The truth may not always set you free, but it is always the truth - Joseph Turner White, 'Anguish.'"  She affixes the lure to it and leaves them on the typewriter.  She starts down the hall, humming.  Behind her we see the door to Bob Barrenger's room open.  Bob comes out, looks down the hall.  The coast is clear.  Carla comes out.  They kiss chastely, say goodnight. She starts down the hall, humming. 
EXT. MAYOR'S PORCH - DAY 
The postman walk sup.  We see two workmen putting up a sign over the door '1835.'  One has a copy of "The Hollywood Reporter" in his back pocket. 
MAYOR And don't you worry about that permit... 
MARTY Why, that's right fine... 
POSTMAN Mornin' George. 
MAYOR Hey, Chunky. (to Marty) Well, we're glad to have you here.  My wife, Sherry, SHER, YOUR BROTHER'S HERE. (to Marty) We're having a party, matofact, Tuesday night, for Walt and Bob Barrenger... 
MARTY Mmm.... 
MAYOR Havin' 'em over, home-cooked meal, if you'd... 
MAYOR (CONT'D) Well, I'd be awfully... 
A paint truck pulls up outside the Mayor's house.  Painters come out.  Sherry comes outside the house. 
SHERRY Where the hell have you been?  It's... 
MAYOR Sherry, this... 
POSTMAN (come back out of house with cup of coffee) Mornin' Sherry. 
SHERRY It's a quarter after nine, I've been on the phone to... 
PAINTER Morning, Mrs. Baily, Mista Bailey...

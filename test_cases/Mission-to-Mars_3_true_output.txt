Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really have much in common with these women -- before moving on. ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around. 
3RD WIFE Anybody seen Jim McConnell? 
4TH WIFE I don't think he's coming. 
1ST WIFE God, that poor man. How's he doing? 
2ND WIFE Totally losing it, from what I hear. Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her grave almost every day. (lowers her voice) They say he could lose mission status. 
3RD WIFE Oh, that's so sad. That is just so tragic. You go to a routine physical one day, and wham. 
4TH WIFE After all those years of training, too. It was their whole dream. 
1ST WIFE Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna be in the history books. First man on Mars... 
She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in agreement, following her glance... 
In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him. 
CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her with an apologetic smile. 
DEBRA He's not coming, Luke. 
LUKE Jim deserves this, too. All his friends are here. And it's my last night. 
DEBRA (gently) Your last night with us, too. 
He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his arms around her waist, kisses her forehead. 
LUKE I love you, Deb. 
DEBRA I love you too, baby. But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby. 
LUKE Yeah. I will. Where is he? 
DEBRA Up in his fort. 
He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, with a mixture of pride and sadness. 
ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into 
EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON 
Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead. 
In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to PRETTY GIRL #2. 
WILLIS Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. But I guess I'll have my memories to keep me warm... 
Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder. 
A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby on a tripod. He looks lonely. 
Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky. 
BOBBY Who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime? 
Luke is surprised by the question. A pause. 
LUKE Mommy will. 
BOBBY I like when you do it. Now we're never gonna finish our book. 
His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. Luke is moved. Another brief silence. 
LUKE Well, I'll tell you what. I've been thinking about that. And what I thought was -- how 'bout if I bring along my own copy? (Bobby looks at him) Then every night, wherever I am, I'll read a little bit more of it. And I'll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. That way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'Cause I don't know about you, but I'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island. What d'you say? 
Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. Luke is proud of his son's courage. 
LUKE Good deal. Can I have a hug? 
Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. They both turn. 
An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone. 
Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness. 
EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON 
The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards the party, then pauses again. 
Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She smiles tentatively. 
JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in. 
Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural leader. 
Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining. 
DEBRA We were afraid you wouldn't come. 
MCCONNELL I caught a whiff of your barbecue. After that I was helpless. 
DEBRA All the way out in Galveston? 
MCCONNELL Something like that. (she smiles) It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it. 
DEBRA Spoil it? He's been going crazy looking for you.

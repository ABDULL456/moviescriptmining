SCHUYLER Never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft. 
In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who moves out of the room.  Schuyler moves to his briefcase.  It's LOCKED.  He starts patting his pockets. 
BAER Can't find your keys? 
Baer has a malevolent expression.  Schuyler looks at him. 
SCHUYLER Where are they. 
BAER Up your ass? 
A couple of execs stifle chuckles.  Schuyler's suspicions mount. 
SCHUYLER Up my ass, very funny... 
His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in front of him.  He picks it up: 
INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note: "CRS CALLED."  We don't see what's written below. 
SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed. 
SCHUYLER I don't-- OK.  OK, you're with CRS... 
Baer stares at him blankly.  Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together. 
SCHUYLER So the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal... 
BAER I'm not following you. 
SCHUYLER Like hell you aren't.  How did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable. 
The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion.  As he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK.  Schuyler stares at him menacingly.  Hesitantly: 
ASSISTANT Um... sorry to interrupt.  We've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. It's all OK now. 
The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of Schuyler.  The assistant fishes in his pocket. 
ASSISTANT Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these yours?  The pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper... 
Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork.  Then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table: 
INSERT NOTE:  It actually reads "CBS CALLED."  (Schuyler's thumb or a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look like an R.)  It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..." 
SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his watch.  He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him. 
SCHUYLER Everything seems to be in order. Please disregard my last comments. The shareholders meeting is about to get underway... Shall we? 
He heads for the door.  As he leaves, the execs exchange looks. 
CUT TO: 
51.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock.  His manner now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES. 
P. A. VOICE (filter) Flight 177 to San Francisco is now boarding at Gate 14... 
Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk, Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling.  The Rasta Man steps out, now wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES. 
RASTA MAN Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention. 
Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off.  As calmly as possible: 
SCHUYLER Listen, I quit. 
RASTA MAN Free at last... you won't be needin' this, then. 
He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces.  Schuyler speaks as if to a child. 
SCHUYLER No, cretin.  I'm quitting the game. 
The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear. 
RASTA MAN Wha's that, mon?  I didna hear you. 
Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster. 
SCHUYLER I said I-- shit! 
The rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to believe this is happening.  They draw a lot of looks during the brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta. 
RASTA MAN Help, help!  The mon is crazy! 
He runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later. 
52.  I N T .   A I R P O R T   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the briefcase.  Both are out of breath.  PISSING MEN look wary. 
SCHUYLER Where is it? 
RASTA MAN Got something better. 
The rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain.  Schuyler narrows his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper.

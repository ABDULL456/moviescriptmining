INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND 
Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk -- boogers. 
Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the distorted voice of Harry Manfredini): 
BOOGERMAN Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh- heh... get it? 
Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying to put distance between herself and Boogerman. 
BOOGERMAN (continuing) Aww, don't go... we can play "Star Wars". You can be Princess Leia and I'll be Jabba the Hutt! 
Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie screams again. 
INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME 
Meagan is getting more and more agitated. 
MEAGAN We're wasting time! We've got to close down all the churches -- Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy ground! 
Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused, frightened looks. 
MEAGAN (continuing) Don't you understand?! He has to come to our reality to do it! It's our last chance to kill him! 
MURDOCH Okay, I think we've heard enough of this crap. Take her back to the lockup. 
A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming. 
MEAGAN Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up! I have to save Lizzy! 
MEAGAN'S MOM Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't even realize what you've done. 
MEAGAN I did what I had to do to try and save Lizzy! 
MURDOCH Yeah, including murdering your boy- friend and cutting his heart out. 
MEAGAN Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was already dead when I cut his heart out! 
Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror. 
MEAGAN (continuing; manic) Goddamnit, you don't understand! Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!! 
Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside. 
MURDOCH I know how you must feel... I had a dog once. I loved that dog. I treated her like my own daughter. We went camping, picnics in the park... I even had a little stocking for her nailed up on the mantle for Christmas. Then one day, she bit me... so I had to blow her brains out. (sighs) God, I loved that dog. 
INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME 
Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger knife. 
A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics. 
BOOGERMAN Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose again -- gotta go! 
Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife blade as it comes right for her, then at the last possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman. She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing ahead. 
BOOGERMAN (continuing) Well, excuse me! 
INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into his head. 
The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is pulled out, kicking and screaming. 
Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger- man across the cell. 
Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack- ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo, his nasty head still alive in the center. 
Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into Stormie's cell. 
Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she clings to life deep inside the nostril. 
Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling up -- the beginnings of a sneeze. 
FREDDY Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO! 
Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman, screaming her head off. 
Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he screams too.

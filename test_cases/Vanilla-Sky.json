In four weeks, a judge will determine your fate based on what I write. You will talk to me -- \nDAVID There is no murder! It didn't happen! I don't have to talk to anybody! A Contentious Prison Guard (AARON) swings his feet down and gets up from watching a 17-inch television on a stool. He exits into the bigger room to quiet down David Aames. \nSlight push in to show the television show he is watching, and we see a snippet of \"To Kill A Mockingbird.\" \nAARON You want me to help - \nDAVID Get the fuck away from me. \nAARON Take it easy, sunshine. \nDAVID Get the fuck away from me. \nAARON Take it easy, Face. Your whole story is full of holes! With great power, McCabe advances on the guard. His presence, when he turns on the switches, is considerable. \nMCCABE. Stop! Please leave. Right now. I'll take responsibility. \nAARON (whispering, exiting) I'm gonna get you, Daddy's boy little freak. \nDAVID My parents are dead, you fuck! \nMCCABE Enough! The Contentious Guard leaves. \nMCCABE Is it true? \nDAVID (sing-song) Good cop... bad cop. \nMCCABE That you're a Daddy's boy? \nDAVID (in darkness, by rote) Primer on David Aames, Senior. My father was not built for the 21st Century. He never ate at \nMcDonald's, not once, and never watched television. Yet his biggest magazine is still TV Digest. He and my mother threw the grandest parties of the literary world. He ballooned, jumped from planes, sought adventure... His autobiography is the manual for every cutthroat publisher in New York. It's called Defending the Kingdom. \nMCCABE I've read it. Page  127.           \"David Junior was a delight as a child.\" Did I miss something here? Is that all he wrote about you? \nDAVID I don't think he ever got over the fact that I was terrified of heights. And when he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager on New Year's Eve, ten years ago... David Aames moves closer to the light. We see a strange bland expression of his mask, at first other--worldly... and then more clearly. \nDAVID he left the keys to the Kingdom to me...    51% control,   49% going to a group of seven board members who all thought they were first in line. \nMCCABE And you believe the Board, the Seven Dwarves, put you here to take control of your company. \nDAVID What do you care? \nMCCABE We're just talking. And tonight's Wednesday night, and I go to Black Angus for dinner with my daughters on Wednesday nights, so I'll have to leave soon. You understand that our time is limited, don't you? \nDAVID If I talk, you'll just think I'm crazy. McCabe gathers his things. \nMCCABE With all the respect I can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories, David, trust me - you've crossed that bridge. \nDAVID Fine. Enjoy your dinner. Somehow the lilt in McCabe's voice draws him closer. \nMCCABE There are five basic emotions in life. Tell me. what emotion gripped... him... before he entered that cell? Was it Guilt? Shadows. There is no answer, just a rustling and a growing sense of anticipation in the darkness. \nMCCABE Hate? Shame? Shadows. Still no answer. \nMCCABE Revenge... McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has brought his client to the precipice. And now, with one word, he invites David Aames to look over. \nMCCABE Love?

DAVID'S APARTMENT/BACK ROOM OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT \nFrom the darkened back room, David Aames appears with ice, and re-enters his party. \nDAVID Who needs ice? Aames moves swirls is more like it - through into his party, which is nicely underway. Upscale. Modern. Part literary crowd. Part fashion crowd.       He's great in a crowd. Surrounded by people, David Aames comes alive. \nDAVID MOVES THROUGH PARTY catching the attention of a model.        (LYNETTE) \nLYNETTE David! Happy Birthday. \nDAVID Jesus, you have the greatest taste in shoes I've ever seen. Bar none. Anywhere. A Woman Caterer in Whites    (EMMA) slips by with a knowing smile. \nEMMA THE CATERER The old place sure looks more crowded with people in it. \nDAVID Emma, do you know Lynette? \nEMMA THE CATERER No, but I shudder to think what. we might have in common. David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest, a Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat. On first glance, she's just another girl. On second glance, she's a killer. He notes her oddly funny behavior. She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural beauty. She is SOFIA SERRANO, a 27 year-old city girl with a barely containable life-force. Enter PETER BROWN, David's male assistant with surreptitious headset. He gestures to a stereo appliance set up in David's living room. \nPETER BROWN The Living Stereo system is online and looking great. it's an \namazing prototype. They'd love an article on it if you like it... David nods, still focused on Sofia. Suddenly, he finds he can't take his eyes off her. \nPETER BROWN and happy birthday, sir. \nANGLE ON FRONT ENTRANCE as David arrives to greet Brian and his guest. \nBRIAN Hey man. Happy birthday and all the usual shit people say to each other. How you doing? \nDAVID Livin' the dream, baby. Livin' the dream. The two friends hug. David shares a quick glance with Brian's date, who still burdened with coat. \nBRIAN (to Sofia, as in 'meet the notorious...') Meet David Aames. \nDAVID (can't help but flirt) And to what do I owe this pleasure, the pleasure of -- \nSOFIA (playful) -- the pleasure of Sofia. Serrano. \nBRIAN We met today at the library, if you can believe that -- \nSOFIA I'm sorry about my coat. It's too big for your closet. \nBRIAN - we were both pretending to be intellectuals. \nDAVID No no, I think it's amazing. I love your coat. \nSOFIA I overdressed. I mean I underdressed. \nBRIAN I'll just continue like you're both actually listening to me. \nSOFIA (to David) Do you have another room to put it in? \nBRIAN (invisible, re: their chemistry) I have ceased to exist. \nDAVID Well, Madison Square Garden is nearby, it might fit there. \n", "test1_id": 1821, "test2_input": "DAVID  (V.0.) Doctors. Their power is in jargon. So you study up... \nDAVID Is that the procedure for all Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in a LeFort III fracture of a comatose patient? \nDR. POMERANZ (pleasantly surprised) In a LeFort III   - absolutely. The potential for sub-cranial brain damage was too great. \nDAVID  (V.0.) . you do your best. David consults a list he's made. \nDAVID And beyond the cheek grafts, Dr. Pomeranz is, are the pins fastened \nwith any kind of aluminum which could ionize and cause that pressure in my head? Because I'm ready for another operation. \nANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL three other doctors in the room listening. \nDR. POMERANZ Yes, we are working on processes. But it... you're specifically not at the stage where we can experiment -- \nDAVID Experiment. Use me. \nDR. POMERANZ The headaches will go away - \nDAVID These are more than headaches. This is like a steel plate slicing through my every thought. \nDR. POMERANZ We're not cowboys. We can't, just wing it. \nDAVID Because I can't think straight most of the time. \nDR. POMERANZ We can increase your medication. \nDAVID Yes. Medication. \nDR. POMERANZ And there are things we'll continue to investigate. But there are so many others who've not been able to benefit aesthetically from plastic surgery as you have -- \nDAVID This isn't about vanity, Dr. Pomeranz! (keeping rage bottled) This isn't about vanity. This is about functioning in the world. \nIt is my job to be out there functioning. I've got the money, and I'll pay any amount. Invent something. Play jazz. You say you're the best face man in New York City. Fucking prove it. \nOTHER DOCTOR We could do something about your arm -- \nDAVID Fuck my arm! Dr. Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant. \nDR. POMERANZ Nobody here takes your feelings for granted. We did prepare something for you, based on the preliminary examination. \nDAVID Tell me. Bring it on. \nDR. POMERANZ It's sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection. It's a facial prosthetic. It was two weeks in the making. The assistant opens a black-leather bound box. In it is the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a pleasant, bland expression. \nDAVID A facial prosthetic. \nDR. POMERANZ The aesthetic replacement does work. Emotionally, and actually. \nOTHER DOCTOR (helpfully) And the plastic in the aesthetic shield also filters out abusive rays, and assists in the regeneration of cells. \nDAVID So it's an aesthetic regenerative shield. \nDR. POMERANZ That's correct. Exactly. \nTHIRD DOCTOR And the ergonomics of the plate- barrier allows it to reflexively interact with the movements of your own face. \nDAVID I see -- \n", "test2_true": "DAVID Good.

MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING - NIGHT \nFamilies lined up watching the ritual blowing up of the balloons the night before Thanksgiving.

DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nDavid by the window of his darkened apartment. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade passes just outside his window. The top of Homer Simpson's head floats by. We are a world away from the lively apartment that once hosted his swinging birthday party. \nDAVID   (V.0.) I planned my re-emergence like the Normandy Invasion. Take-out boxes, catalog orders with new clothes, comic books and magazines with ripped-out pages fill the living room. \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY \nA memo is placed on the floor of David's living room. Shot pulls back to see he has covered the entire floor of his living room with memos and paperwork from Aames Publishing. He stands regarding all of this information, stooped and wearing his bathrobe. \nINTERCUT \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDavid stands in front of the bathroom mirror, practicing aloud. \nDAVID Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nDAVID POV (V.0.) I'll just say it   - I did my homework. I read every memo. Thomas Tipp was right. People will read again. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nDavid stares at his screen. Disheveled, in underwear, he eats red--vine licorice and M&Ms. \nDAVID (V.0.) I attended the monthly board meeting of the Seven Dwarves by video hook-up. Oh, baby. This was war. On screen before him, all seven, and Thomas Tipp too. Shot moves in on screen. We can feel the cool tension of their imminent takeover. David twitches, feels it physically. \nDAVID because nobody's buying books let's invest... my father was an adventurer. \nDavid sits in the middle of his office. Push in on the white tape that covers the camera on the top of the monitors. \nINTERCUT \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDavid continues practicing aloud. \nDAVID Sofiaaaaaaaaaaa. Serrano. \nDAVID   (V.0.)

The music swirls, and takes him along with it. He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the club. He approaches her. \nDAVID Hello again. \nSOFIA Hello again. \nDAVID Idea. Let's start all over. He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and discomfort. \nDAVID How about if you help me? Unless I'm horning in here - (beat, does her) You are. But the food is good. He continues, taking a step. \nDAVID See, I've got a little problem. I've got a stalker. (does her) It doesn't sound life-threatening. (does himself, self- deprecating) I need a cover. I need for you to pretend we're having a \nscintillating conversation and you're wildly entertained. I know it's tough. (does her, with head nod) I'll improvise. \nSOFIA (a touch playful) I don't talk like that. \nDAVID She's right across the room and she's burning a hole in my back right now, isn't she? \nSOFIA Red dress, strappy shoes? \nDAVID That's right! Their heads are close together, looking off into the club. David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time playing along with this game. She is overwhelmed, holding it in. David continues. \nDAVID I think she' s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini. \nSOFIA (about to burst) David -- \nDAVID Are you okay? \nSOFIA No. \nDAVID What's wrong? Is it me? \nSOFIA I'll tell you later. \nDAVID Come on. Tell me now. Something's wrong. Tell me everything. Let's talk about it right now. \nSOFIA I'll tell you in another life... when we are both cats. David looks at her. His eyes flash at her choice of words. Perhaps there is hope. Sofia stares at. him, worried about his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn of a phrase. Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal with the discomfort of this moment. \nDAVID I don't believe you just said that. That. is the best thing I've ever heard. That is hilarious. God, that just killed me. The way you said that. See - that's what I love about you. \"I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.\" \nEXT. CLUB STREET - NIGHT \nDavid, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in silence. David weaves. They are anxious to pretend it was a wonderful evening. \nSOFIA Well, this is where I leave you. \nBRIAN Wait. I'll walk you to your door. \nSOFIA No, I live just around the corner. \nBRIAN I've got my bike here. \nSOFIA I'd rather walk. \nDAVID Don't be a drag.

The word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it. \nDAVID We'll meet up soon. Sofia turns and runs away. \nDAVID (lacking all pride) We'll call you again to go out with me! \nBRIAN We'll call you. David and Brian walk on. Brian turns back to see Sofia running to the corner. \nBRIAN Well, it's been a real blast, David. I bid you good evening. \nDAVID Where you going? \nBRIAN My bike. It's back over there. We'll hang soon. Bring your mask if you want. I'm getting used to it. \nDAVID Wait a minute. \nBRIAN (stops) What? \nDAVID (shrugs) I don't know. \nBRIAN You drank a little too much. Call me tomorrow if you want. \nDAVID Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead. \nBRIAN (starts in Sofia's direction) No you won't. You just need to sleep. \nDAVID Hey! \nBRIAN (Brian's itching to go) What! \nDAVID What did you say to Julie Gianni the night of the accident? \nBRIAN What? \nDAVID You told her she was a \"fuck buddy.\" \nBRIAN Never. \nDAVID And she was a little more than pissed about it. \nBRIAN (a little guilty) Have you been harboring this shit all along? I never talked to her. \nDAVID Whatever. I mean - who am I, if I can't. be the one who tells you you're not ugly? Aw, give me a courtesy laugh. Come on! Brian shakes his head, starts running. \nDAVID Brian!! I'm so fucked up. I'm just so fucked up! Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the street. \nDAVID We're best friends! We're bros! Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in the direction of Sofia. David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard. His head hurts. His body hurts. \nDAVID Come on, man, we're bros. Beat. He sprints down the middle of the street after Brian. \n", "test3_id": 1823}

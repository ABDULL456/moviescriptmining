When I read the book, I didn't want to waste my time there anymore. I came to help the Cause. \nFREDDIE What did it say? \nCLARK I'm skeptical of everything. Always have been. All I know is I used to not be able to sleep. Now I sleep through the night. I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did. That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met Elizabeth, so... \nFREDDIE That's good. \nCLARK He changes things. And the research is hard to keep up with. None of this is done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy to get lost. \nFREDDIE He's a very smart man. I can tell that.

Master took the book and hid it where no one could get to it...it's inside this book: all the history. All the facts. All too dangerous. He re-wrote it, using what he could as the basis for what we are able to accept and learn today.. .that's Book One that we all study and know. . .but the real stuff. The things at the center...are still too dangerous. They (kill/cure) any man who reads it. It's passing through the jaws of resistance. It's the truth about all this. The book is protected and hidden. No one knows where but Master. \nFREDDIE The truth about all what? \nCLARK Life on this planet. .Freddie stares at him... then takes a good long look at the BURLESQUE DANCER AND HER BREASTS. THEN BACK TO CLARK: \nFREDDIE What is something like that worth? \nCLARK He said he was once offered $25,000 dollars for it...but the price is... . how could you figure out what the price is on something like that? Heretofore unknown. Incalculable by man. \nFREDDIE Where is it? \nCLARK It's locked away in a vault somewhere? I don't know. \nFREDDIE Where? \nCLARK No one knows for sure.

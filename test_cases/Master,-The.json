{"train": "THE MASTER \nWritten by \nPaul Thomas Anderson \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nA young man, FREDDIE SUTTON (early 20s)_ speaks to a \nDOCTOR; \nDOCTOR What are you going to do when you get out of here? You're going to have to wear a belt for six months, maybe a year... \nFREDDIE What kind of belt? \nDOCTOR A surgical belt. You won't be able to do very heavy lifting. \nFREDDIE .I try to stay away from that. \nDOCTOR But you spend time outdoors. \nFREDDIE \nMMMM \nDOCTOR What do you do? \nFREDDIE \nDOCTOR You didn't have very much on you when you were admitted. Where were you going? \nFREDDIE I was on my way to Placerville. To the Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a friend of mine. He doesn't know where I am. \nDOCTOR How old are you, Freddie? \nFREDDIE \nDOCTOR Why don't you turn honest? You seem like an intelligent fellow. 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink? \nFREDDIE It's a weakness. But I like it. \nDOCTOR I know what the other is too. \nFREDDIE How can you tell that? I'm clean. \nDOCTOR The tattoo's. \nFREDDIE Is that a weakness... \nDOCTOR No one ever made money chasing girls. \nFREDDIE You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie. \nDOCTOR Who's that? \nFREDDIE My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But that doesn't mean I don't have a weakness... \nDOCTOR College? \nFREDDIE I tried that, it didn't work. \nDOCTOR Why'd you leave? \nFREDDIE Sometimes my hypo's get the best of me, I really feel like walking into the street and hitting people's hats off. \nDOCTOR That's how you end up like this. With a burst appendix. \nFREDDIE That's when I know it's time to get to the sea.. what kind of belt? \nDOCTOR A medical belt. Similar for lifting. You're going to need some money. What do you plan to do? \nFREDDIE I'm going to pay back the hospital. And you. \nDOCTOR You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical duty. But you're expected to pay the hospital for medicines. And your belt. \nFREDDIE Alright. I intend to do that. You saying you have a job for me? What? As an orderly? \nDOCTOR You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn. But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort. \nFREDDIE I want to get out of here, but I also like it here. You think I was gonna die? \nDOCTOR I know you were, Freddie. \nFREDDIE I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't save me... . but...I can't seem to die. \nDOCTOR Too lucky? \nFREDDIE Something like that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SMALL DARK ROOM - LATER. \nFREDDIE wakes up MASTER OF CEREMONIES is here along with MARY SUE and NORMAN CONRAD does the speaking at first, Freddie in and out of consciousness: \nNORMAN CONRAD How are you doing? \nFREDDIE Alright. What is this? \nNORMAN CONRAD How'd you get on this shit? \nFREDDIE I walked. \nNORMAN CONRAD Why? \nFREDDIE I was just looking f'work... I'm working here. \nMASTER OF CEREMONIES You need to sit down. \nFREDDIE I need to sit down. Freddie is already sitting in a chair they have him in. \nFREDDIE (CONT'D) Whatdchu put in my drink? \nNORMAN CONRAD You've been sedated. \nFREDDIE I'm sleepy. \nNORMAN CONRAD I know you are. But you need to wake up now. Be sharp and wake up... can you do that for me? I want you to ask some questions about why you're here.. .how you came to be on this ship... \nFREDDIE .I just need the work. Wasinmy drink? \nNORMAN CONRAD You shouldn't be here, this is a private trip. \nFREDDIE .I'm a good worker..Iknowthese ships... BEAT. Freddie just looks at him, then MASTER SPEAKS: \nMASTER OF CEREMONIES You're an able bodied seamen? \nFREDDIE I am. \nMASTER You've had your appendix removed. \nFREDDIE \nMASTER Why didn't you just ask if you could join this ship? We're always looking for new members, we'd have been happy to have you, no need for skulking or sneaking. \nFREDDIE \nMASTER You need work? We'd love to have you work. You can work for us and our company. . .we have a wonderful company... \nFREDDIE Yeah? Whatdo you do your company? \nMASTER This is the company where past, present and future come together. \nFREDDIE \nMASTER Tell me why you're on my ship. \nFREDDIE I just want to go to sea. I am looking for a berth-- \nMASTER What's wrong with where you were? \nFREDDIE I'm a seamen. \nMASTER What wrong with the world from where you were? \nFREDDIE I like being at sea. (I am a sailor.) PAUSE. FREDDIE closes his eyes, sleepy a minute.., then: \nMASTER You're a Russian spy. Did you hear me? Wake up, Freddie. \nFREDDIE What do you want? .what's your name? \nMASTER We've told you. You're a russian spy. What are you escaping. \nFREDDIE Nothing. \nMASTER You did something. \nFREDDIE I'm here to work, I know ships... \nMASTER You don't know? \nFREDDIE No. I don't know-what? \nMASTER You're a little drunk and sleepy. \nFREDDIE More than a little watchu put in my drink. \nMASTER More than a little. You work for Dick Quinn. \nMASTER Delicious... delicious \nNORMAN CONRAD There should be nothing above suspicion. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nFREDDIE is dragged by to ASSISTANTS down the narrow hallways of the SHIP. . .down another hallway, down another... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE SHIP - PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT. \nCAMERA MOVES WITH THE SHIP, SILENTLY MOVING ALONG AT \nNIGHT.. .SEES THE LIGHTS GLOW FROM INSIDE... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROOM - MORNING. \nCU. FREDDIE. Morning sun comes in, hits him in the face. Wakes him up. He looks around. He looks out the window. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - SHIP - MOMENTS LATER \nFREDDIE walks out, looks around. . .he walks down the hall, a YOUNG GIRL passes him, smiles wide and says \"GOOD MORNING,\" ad keeps walking... He moves towards a room where he hears a TYPEWRITER. He steps in the doorway. MASTER sits at his desk, writing gear all around. MASTER looks up, sees him, stops typing... Smiles. Extends his arm out for Freddie to come in and take a seat.. .MASTER is warm, inviting. Not rushed. They sort of sit and settle with each a moment; \nMASTER Ok? \nFREDDIE Alright. \nMASTER You can't be... \nFREDDIE Is this your ship? \nMASTER I'm it's Commander, yes. \nFREDDIE Where's it going? \nMASTER New York City thru the canal. You're seamen? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nMASTER You're looking for work? \nFREDDIE .what did I say last night...? \nMASTER You said you were an able bodied seamen and you were looking for work? \nFREDDIE You have any? \nMASTER Perhaps. \nFREDDIE What was in my drink? \nMASTER You were sedated with chloral hydrate and bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if your check your butt-hole you'll find it's all in working order (he he he...) Isn't that what all men are worried about in they surrender themselves. \nFREDDIE I didn't surrender myself. \nMASTER You were acting very aggressive because you drank too much alcohol. \nFREDDIE I don't think I was. \nMASTER Yes I think you were. And I don't like strange boys jumping on my ship. \nFREDDIE So what are you gonna do? \nMASTER Why don't you just ask for work? Work can't be hard to find. \nFREDDIE Depends on when you're ready to go...do you have a job for me. \nMASTER You can't work in your condition. \nFREDDIE What condition is that? \nMASTER You're aberrated. \nFREDDIE What's that mean? \nMASTER A wandering from the path The problems you have in your life (your appendix, your work, your need to batter your body with booze...) I resolve that they can be fixed. \nFREDDIE I've got no trouble. You got a job for me to do, I can do it. \nMASTER Maybe I do, but not the kind you think. \nFREDDIE Do you own this ship? \nMASTER That's where we go. They come across ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY WALK INTO THE GROUP. Everyone is getting ready for a WEDDING. . .they greet MASTER and FREDDIE. He walks into it and is welcome'd... MASTER finds his daughter, ELIZABETH, who is to be married and her husband-to-be CLARK (20s) He introduces them to Freddie - \nEXT. DECK OF SHIP. AFTERNOON. \nZOOM BACK FROM CU. On MASTER as he presides over his DAUGHTER's WEDDING. ELIZABETH and CLARK. Everyone dressed up; Master says some sweet,. beautiful words and then; \nMASTER .as long as you hold these bodies, in this life: you may kiss the bride. THEY KISS. APPLAUSE, CHEERS. CU. FREDDIE. He listens and watches. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINNER CABIN. NIGHT. \nIt's mid-dinner, post-wedding ceremony party, everyone is celebrating, drinking. Master talking a blue streak, acting this out. \nMASTER Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE \nDRAGON, TEETH AND BLOOD DRIPPING! RED \nEYES! What do I go? A lasoooo! Whip it up, wrap it around it's neck. I wrastle, wrastle, wrastle'em to the ground - I snap up, I say: sit. Everyone laughs, Master is acting all this out, rolling around, etc as if he's training a dog... \nMASTER (CONT'D) Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays. So now he's got a leash on and he's staying on my command - THAT\"S WHAT WHERE WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on command. Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances; \nMASTER (CONT'D) Next we're gonna teach it to roll over and play DEAD. Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his days studying Judo ... FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the table is: VAL, strikes up conversation: \nVAL Freddie, I'm Val, the son. \nFREDDIE Hello. \nVAL Are you having a good time? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nVAL What are you goign to be working on? \nFREDDIE I don't really know. \nVAL Have you done any time-hole work? \nFREDDIE I don't think so. VAL is distracted by a WELL WISHER who comes over. FREDDIE looks around at everyone. All the faces having a good time and celebrating... He catches the eye of a YOUNG WOMAN. . .then sees her \nHUSBAND... The BARTENDER comes over to FREDDIE \nBARTENDER Alright, old man? \nFREDDIE Yeah. \nBARTENDER No hard feelings? \nFREDDIE No. \nBARTENDER Welcome aboard. Clif Amsbury. He serves him a drink. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) This one's alright. Chink, chink. \nANGLE, LATER. Master is saying good-night to everyone, passes FREDDIE and says quietly: \nMASTER When can we have some of your potion? \nFREDDIE Whenever you'd like. I'll get making it - \nMASTER When I'd like it - I will give you a signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my nose. What will you need? \nFREDDIE I'll take care of it. MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by \nSAYING: \nMASTER Enough! Enough! I must get back to work! Keep going! Dont stop all night long! He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it all. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROOM - LATER. \nFreddie comes down into his little room. A cot has been made for him, some fresh clothes and a BOOK (hardcover,400pages) on the bed. It reads, very simply: \nTHE CAUSE \nCU. BOOK \"THE CAUSE\" The cover is opened, CAMERA SEES IN CU the opening line from the book: \"Shall a man be master of his memories? Or shall his memories be the master?\" \nANGLE, FREDDIE He lays in bed and reads the book. He reads about to lines and his eyes slam shit, asleep, still holding the book. \nHOLD. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAIN DECK / CABIN - MORNING. \nIt's the next morning, EVERYONE IS HERE FOR BREAKFAST, BUFFET STYLE, FREDDIE mixed in amongst it all. FREDDIE sits down to eat with MARY SUE, who feeds her baby. The other children around. VAL and NORMAN CONRAD are here... \nMARY SUE He's been writing all night ...I think you've inspired something in hi,. When we're at home, on land, there's too much, pulling him in each direction. \nAID How you doing? \nFREDDIE I'm fine. \nAID Are you following alright? \nFREDDIE Well-not really-no... \nAID That's OK. You will. Don't worry - \nFREDDIE How long have you been studying \nAID A year. It takes a little time. Don't worry. \nFREDDIE What's your name? \nAID Carol Henike. You're Freddie. \nFREDDIE That's right. \nAID Just keep listening and reading. If you don't udnerstand, just keep going back over it. Headphones back on... He slips the headphones back on. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAIN CABIN - EVENING. \nA SKETCH COMEDY SHOW, DANCING after-dinner. FREDDIE on the sidelines, watching it, not really understanding some of the humor and lyrics, etc...someone has a MOP on their head and is pretending to be a PSYCHOLOGIST with a vary thick/bad German-Austiran-accent. \"zee muzzer and fazzer and zee penisss and ze nippelz..\" attempting to cure a STUDENT... everyone LAUGHS. ELIZABETH (the daughter) comes over; \nELIZABETH Hi Freddie ... \nFREDDIE Hi. \nELIZABETH .I Have a message for you. She rubs her nose and tugs her ear. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Better get along. He leaves, she watches him go. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FREDDIE'S AREA. MOMENTS LATER. \nHe puts the booze into MASON JARS. \nCUT TO: \nINT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nFOLLOWING FREDDIE HOLDING THE BOOZE IN A LITTLE MASON \nJAR. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER'S SUITE. THAT MOMENT. \nFreddie pours the liquid into two glasses. WE HEAR THE PARTY OUTSIDE THE ROOM, FROM UPSTAIRS. MASTER examines \nIT; \nMASTER What's in it? \nFREDDIE .drink just a little. It's very strong. The good stuff takes time. And there's secrets in good liquor. This is just booze for now... \nMASTER How are you feeling, Freddie? \nFREDDIE Good. \nMASTER Rested? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nMASTER Excited? \nFREDDIE Sure. \nMASTER Have you made some friends? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nMASTER Good. Good. How are you feeling? \nFREDDIE Yeah, good. They CHEERS AND DRINK. Shudder at the strength of it. \nMASTER I've been writing ... BULAGH! Feel like I went under. Dark cloud rolls in. Opens up...anxious to share new work-would you care for some informal processing? \nFREDDIE Sure... \nMASTER Well, then I gather myself... and you be my protege and guinea pig, eh? Informal processing. Master smiles, excited, moves to an OLD TAPE RECORDER, points a microphones towards Freddie, looks over some papers... \nMASTER (CONT'D) Are you ready? \nFREDDIE \nBLLLLLLLLLL GH. How's that? (laughs hysterically) \nMASTER Silly..its good to laugh in processing.. sometimes we forget. Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth: \nMASTER (CONT'D) \"Freddie Sutton, Test Session. May 5, 1952, 1800 hours. Aboard he sailing vessel Aletheia, en route to New York City. MOC logged ad approced.\" He CLICKS it off. Smiles at Freddie; he gives him a comforting hug. \nMASTER (CONT'D) Should we sample another sip before we join them upstairs? \nFREDDIE Is that it? \nMASTER For now. \nFREDDIE I'm ready for more if you want to ask me... \nHOLD BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. LONG PAUSE. \nFREDDIE (CONT'D) Ask me, Master. This is fun.. .nobody's asked me questions before -- \nMASTER Could you answer the next series of questions without blinking your eyes? To without fear and hesitation answer as quickly as you can? \nFREDDIE Sure. \nCU. TAPE RECORDER BACK ON. \nMASTER Look at me...Starting now you are not to blink. If you blink we go back to the \nSTART: .infringement. you blinked. Starting now you are not to blink. If you blink we go back to the start. Do you often ponder over your own inferiority? \nFREDDIE No. \nMASTER Infringement. Back to the start. You blink, we repeat from the start. Do you often ponder over your own inferiority? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nMASTER Do you believe that God will save you from your own ridiculousness and self contempt? \nFREDDIE No I don't. \nMASTER Have you ever had intercourse with a member of your family. \nFREDDIE Yes. \nPAUSE. \nMASTER Have you ever had intercourse with a member of your family? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nMASTER .who? \nFREDDIE My. Auntie. PAUSE. Master is stumped for the first time... \nMASTER Have you ever killed anyone? \nFREDDIE No, \nMASTER Maybe? \nFREDDIE Not me. \nTAPE RECORDING ALL THIS. DIALS MOVING. FREDDIE NOT \nBLINKING. \nMASTER Have you ever killed anyone. \nFREDDIE No. \nMASTER How many times did you have intercourse with your aunt? \nFREDDIE Three times. \nMASTER Where is your aunt now? \nFREDDIE Don't know. Probably Princeton. \nMASTER Where? \nFREDDIE 45 Province Lane. \nMASTER Would you like to see her? \nFREDDIE No. \nMASTER Would you like to sleep with her again? \nFREDDIE No. \nFREDDIE I don't know. Maybe New York, New Jersey, anywhere. Don't know. \nMASTER What is your Auntie's Name? \nFREDDIE Auntie Bertha. \nMASTER How did you come to sleep with your Auntie Bertha? \nFREDDIE She said she'd let me have my inheritance if I were to sleep with her. So I did and I never got my money. I was drunk. She looked good. \nMASTER And you did it again and again. \nFREDDIE Yes. Because I liked it. It felt good. \nMASTER She's rich? Is she? She has your inheritance, does she? \nFREDDIE She controls it all. \nMASTER You feel you're owed this? \nFREDDIE I am. \nMASTER Have you ever had any bad thoughts about her or Mary Sue? \nFREDDIE Yes. \nMASTER What do you think? \nFREDDIE I thought you were fools. But now I see that you're not \nMASTER If you could lock yourself in a house, a large mansion for the rest of your life: who would you like to be there with you? \nFREDDIE Doris Schoemann. \nMASTER Who is Doris? \nFREDDIE Best girl I ever met. The girl I am gonna marry one day. \nMASTER She's in New Jersey, is she? \nFREDDIE Lynn, Massachussets. ( I just got to get back to her.) \nMASTER Why aren't you with Doris? \nFREDDIE \nMASTER Why aren't you with her? \nFREDDIE I'm an idiot. I don't know. I got no reason. \nMASTER Do you love Doris? \nFREDDIE Yeah. \nMASTER Is she the love of your life? \nFREDDIE Yes sir. \nMASTER Close your eyes/ \nCUT TO BLACK, HOLD, THEN FADE UP AGAIN.. \nMASTER (CONT'D) Release and return to me ... Say your name. \nFREDDIE Freddie Sutton. \nMASTER Are you hear with me in 1952? \nFREDDIE Yes... \nMASTER End of session. Open/close your eyes. He laughs. They both laugh, MUSIC 'dancers in love'/piano ver. \nMASTER (CONT'D) How does it feel? Freddie laughs a little. \nFREDDIE Feels good. \nMASTER Left side of your body feels ok? \nFREDDIE Yeah. \nMASTER Right side? \nFREDDIE Yeah. \nMASTER Any headaches? \nFREDDIE \nNO \nMASTER (CONT'D) But that doesn't mean it's not there, does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy little piece of tape is just nothin' without all the other equipment lined up properly, isn't it? We CAN access the past, traumas and seeds that abberate us in present time and once we access them - we challenge them and throw them away. Previously, I'd established how to access these aberrations and painful memories to pre-birth/cellular times. But the new studies prove there is a time beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which we are now working. At last count, perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our studies show... Besides the everyday struggles of how we become better, more able, more productive homo sapiens, the uses for this new science is the location and removal of certain leukemias, apathies, manics. Depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas. This is the province and science of Cause. If you'll forgive me, I must sit down. Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg injury and limp damndest thing. You see it happens every time I come to Manhattan Island, its a wound I've never conquered and I'll tell you how I found out about, because I never knew what in the H was happening... Well I did some processing to find out. Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me back...we processed over three hours! And something came up. It was this: I lived a life before and suffered a great injury. Knee injury... It was just around 1888. A great number and year. Significant as the creation . year of the new york city sewer system if I'm not wrong... I was a thief and criminal, working late into the night robbing a bank in the western side of the island. \n(MORE) \nMASTER (CONT'D) The crime was committed with a revolver in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I made it clear across town when we were ambushed by the local authorities. -- but I made a slip away. A digression into the under constructed sewer system. It was here that I could no be found - or so my thinking went. All my confidence and all my arrogance was brought upon me. Full in the face. For I was nose to nose with a twenty-five foot alligator in the New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a scare I was in for. Now if you've veer seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR - you'll remember the fear. You see, this being an island, and in those days more inhabited by creature than man, why wouldn't I meet such a beast? In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented drain hole just around 125th Street... present day Harlem County I believe today. Yes. Yes. I stuffed it and made a getaway from both man and beast \u00e2\u0080\u009eshattered my knee in five different places-turned into a piece of glass..woke up early in the morning somewhere near the present day Times Square-which was nothing more than a farm..quite a farm..but that's another story. So what does this say? Injuries stay with us don't they??..They sure do. How's it gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna fix this knee. How are any of us going to get better? More able? We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is not enough. We have Lived Many, Many, Many Lives. So anybody tat is not processing the whole of time - is doing a disservice to man and Will Not Get Better. I cannot put it more simply. \n(MORE) \nMASTER (CONT'D) And as for me now: I just need to find the time away from all of my writing to go back down and DO IT so I don't walk around with the darndest limp everytime I come to town! This story is greeted. with equal parts excitement/complete CONFUSION. MRS. PURCELL slightly nervous. \nANGLE, LATER. MASTER and a SOCIALITE WOMAN (50s) he has her lay down on a love seat; \nMASTER (CONT'D) What is your name? \nSOCIALITE Margaret O'Brian. \nMASTER Are you sure you haven't lived here before? \nSOCIALITE I don't know. \nMASTER What's your name? \nMARGARET Margaret. \nMASTER Are you sure? \nANGLE, PURCELL APARTMENT. FREDDIE goes lurking around, slinks in and out of some rooms. HE GOES INTO THE BEDROOM, STEALS SOME JEWELRY. \nSTUFF HIS POCKETS. (OC DIAL. PLAYS...) \nANGLE, MAIN LIVING ROOM. MASTER has finished his demonstration and is opening it up for questions/discussions. An OLDER MAN (MR. JOHN MORE, 50's, scholarly, wearing a prominent HANDKERCHIEF) stands up to speak: (Throughout this another OLDER WOMAN has a terrible cough from the back of the room.) \nJOHN MORE Some of this seems quite like hypnosis, is it not? \nMASTER Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ. \nJOHN MORE What is the difference between this and psychotherapy? \nMASTER Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees. \nJOHN MORE But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not? \nMASTER No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's that. \nJOHN MORE And how long does this take? \nMASTER That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours. \nJOHN MORE 36 hours? And you're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you've just said? \nMASTER Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results. \nJOHN MORE You can understand scepticism, can you not? \nMASTER Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it. \nJOHN MORE Are you a religious people? \nMASTER We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions. \nJOHN MORE Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook? \nMASTER No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to \nMANKIND - \nJOHN MORE Do you think it can? \nMASTER I not only think it can, I know it does. \nJOHN MORE You mentioned 'good science' and what it does.. .but doesn't that, by definition, allow for more than one opinion? \nMASTER Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching - \nJOHN MORE Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult, is it not? \nMASTER T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization. \nJOHN MORE I must say that I find it quite -- \nMASTER \nAND I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHAT ELSE YOU \nHAVE TO SAY YOU SLIMY LITTLE PIECE OF CUM \nFUCK. \nYOU ARE NOTHING. AND WORTHLESS AT THAT. \nLEVEL? TO EXPLAINNNN OURSELVES? FOR WHAT? \nFOR WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE HAVE TO \nGROVEL? GROVEL LIKE A DOG, A DOG LICKING \nIT'S PISS? ANOTHER DOG OF PISS I SAY. \nTHE ONLY WAY TO DEFEND OURSELVES IS \nATTACK. ATTACK. ATTACK. WE ATTACK THAT \nMAN. IF WE DON'T DO THAT, WE WILL LOSE \nEVERY BATTLE WE'RE ENGAGED IN - WE WILL \nNEVER DOMINATE OUR ENVIRONMENT THE WAY WE \nSHOULD UNLESS WE ATTACK. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - ADJOINING SUITE - NIGHT \nWE HEAR MASTER from the next room; Everyone in here, listens, hangs their faces. \nMASTER (O.C.) .this city is just noise. Just noise and bad living. I know this place. I know it's rotten secrets... CU. FREDDIE listening. He sips some of his booze form the FLASK, gets a real surly look on his face... .VAL gets up and leaves the hotel room... FRED DIE watches him go... Everyone seems resigned, sleepy...Freddie snaps and says \nTO BILL: \nFREDDIE You have the name's and information of the guests at this lady's party? \nBILL WHITE Yes. \nFREDDIE looks at CLARK, the new son-in-law. ELIZABETH looks up... \nFREDDIE You're coming with me. Get up. I need some help and you wanna make a good show, no? Who's paying your way? CLARK looks to Elizabeth, who gives a look that says, \"He's right.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM / THE CAUSE H.O. - LATER \nBill White turns on the lights, takes Freddie and Clark over to his desk. . .they get the address and info. For MR. \nJOHN MORE. \nBILL WHITE I don't think this is right to do - \nFREDDIE You don't know what we're going to do, so don't bother thinking about this anymore... CAMERA with FREDDIE AND CLARK as they walk out of the hotel and into the streets of New York -- \nFREDDIE (CONT'D) You have any money on you? \nCLARK Some. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS / UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT - LATER \nFREDDIE and CLARK, walking down the street... They \nWALK/TALK; \nFREDDIE Where are you from, Clark? \nCLARK Los Angeles. Pasadena. \nFREDDIE What's there? \nCLARK I'm from there. Master and headquarters there for a year. \nFREDDIE .how'd you see them? \nCLARK I read the first book. I worked at Boeing for three years. When I read the book, I didn't want to waste my time there anymore. I came to help the Cause. \nFREDDIE What did it say? \nCLARK I'm skeptical of everything. Always have been. All I know is I used to not be able to sleep. Now I sleep through the night. I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did. That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met Elizabeth, so... \nFREDDIE That's good. \nCLARK He changes things. And the research is hard to keep up with. None of this is done by a long shot.

This happened to you and you are free to stop it. Their game and implants are no match for you. Laugh in their face. Laugh at it. These triggers are useless now.

Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage. 
DAD Is Pete ok? 
CHRIS He'll be fine. 
Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard. 
DAD What are you doin? 
Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it. 
DAD Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen to me. If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris! 
Chris drives to the casino, he cocks the shotgun but decides to leave it in the truck. Instead he takes a piece of wood from the back of his truck. He enters the casino with it. He smashes a fruit machine. A guard comes up and Chris beats him. A fight scene breaks out with Chris beating the guards and generally trashing the place. He takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it. Chris hurls his piece of wood at the VIP lounge window, smashing it to pieces. Jay emerges from behind it. 
JAY Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh? 
Chris leaves. As he drives off in his truck, police cars appear with sirens going. He pulls over. 
SHERIFF WATKINS You should NOT have come looking for trouble. Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris! NOW! 
INT. POLICE STATION ROOM 
LAWYER I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris. 
CHRIS But I'd have to plead guilty. 
LAWYER Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture. 
We see a montage of casino workers badmouthing Chris.

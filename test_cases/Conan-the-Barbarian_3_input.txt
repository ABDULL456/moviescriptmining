Conan meets its eye. 
CONAN (CONT'D) Do not test me, beast. 
TAMARA Is there not a living thing you can be at peace with? 
They ride into the city, past the troops. 
EXT. KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY 
Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled faces and not a hint of morality. 
STRANGER 
A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them. 
WOODEN PLATFORM 
The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising back up to the fortress above. 
CONAN It's probably only way into Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night. 
TAMARA So we must try to scale the cliff. 
CONAN And dodge arrows as we do so? 
Conan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS. 
CONAN (CONT'D) During the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb. And it would be useless to even attempt at night. No, we must find another way. 
STRANGER'S POV 
As Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS. 
ALLEYWAY 
Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village when a VOICE rings out behind them. 
VOICE (O.S.) Halt. 
Conan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara. 
CONAN Thieves. You'll regret finding me. 
VOICE (O.S.) I think not. 
From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck 
ONE EYED THIEF It took longer than you think to cut this out of Lucius' stomach. After all that work, I figured I'd keep it -- for old times' sake. 
INT. THIEVES' TAVERN - AFTERNOON 
A rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead. 
And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES. They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice. 
They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian outsider. 
The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan, caressing him. 
Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table. 
Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile women, their breasts practically framing his face. 
CONAN What? Do you wish to join in? 
CUT TO: 
Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress. 
ONE EYED THIEF --so you were right about the platform. You'll be long dead before you make it top. Same with scaling the cliff. There's no known way to break into the fortress. 
CONAN So that's it? 
ONE EYED THIEF I didn't say that. I just said there's no known way in -- because no one has ever tried to. But breaking out -- that's another story. It's not much easier, but it's possible. 
The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.

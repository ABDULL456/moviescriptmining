INT. CLUB CAR ON TRAIN 
Bruno is now seated in his accustomed place in the club car. His gloved fingers are quietly toying with Guy's lighter. A passenger next to him asks: 
PASSENGER May I have a light, please? 
Bruno looks at him for a moment and then at the lighter. With great deliberation he puts the lighter away in his pocket and takes out book-matches. Lighting a match, he holds it to his fellow passenger's cigarette.

UMPIRE Second set to Haines.   Haines leads two sets to love. 
There is a round of applause. We see the heads of the two players reach the Umpire's chair. Guy, very anxious still, as he wipes his neck with a towel. 
INT. COVERED STAND CLOSE SHOT ANNE BARBARA 
Anne is speaking. 
ANNE If he wins this next set -- you'd better have everything ready. (takes bill from her purse and hands it to Barbara) Here -- give the driver this ten dollars. 
BARBARA (puzzled) I wish understood what this is all about! 
ANNE (urgently) You don't have to understand, just do it. And for heaven's sake, act natural. 
Barbara nods and goes along. 
ENTRANCE TO COVERED STAND 
Barbara smiles winningly at Hennessy as she goes through. Her interpretation of "acting natural" is exaggerated and rather comical. Hammond's eyes narrow as he looks after her suspiciously.

{"train": "TED \nWritten by \nSeth Macfarlane, Alec Sulkin & Wellesley Wild \nEXT. SPACE - X \nAs the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States. The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes. To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever. \nEXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING \nNARRATOR (V.O.) It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston. \nWe see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids. \nAnother little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball- throwing kids points at the sled kid. \nKID #1 Hey, Greenbaum! \nGREENBAUM Uh oh. \nKID #1 It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him? \nGREENBAUM W...what? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nKID #1 My fist in your fuckin' face! \nGREENBAUM Why would Jesus want that? \nKID #2 Get him! \nThe kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends. \nJOHN Hey guys, can I play? \nThe kids all look at him. \nKID #1/#2/#3 Get outta here! / Get outta here, Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett! \nThe Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John. \nGREENBAUM Yeah, Bennett, get outta here! \nThe kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house. \nINT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER \nNARRATOR (V.O.) John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own. And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go. \nJohn sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands, looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee. \nINT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING \nA LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on, smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with delight. \nINT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING \nA LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on, smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is overjoyed. \nINT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING \nANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on, smiling. Inside is a \"Darth Vader head\" action figure case. The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of \"Star Wars\" action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically. \nEXT./ESTAB. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING \nINT. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - SAME \nNARRATOR (V.O.) And for little John Bennett, Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival. \nJohn sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear. The boy holds it with delight. \nJOHN Wow! \nHIS MOM AND DAD hug him. \nJOHN'S DAD I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh? \nJOHN'S MOM (KISSING HIM) Merry Christmas, John. \nJOHN Forever and ever? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTEDDY Sounds good to me. \nA huge grin spreads across John's face. He gets up, runs to Teddy and hugs him. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) John was just about the happiest boy in the world. And he couldn't wait to tell everyone the good news. \nINT. KITCHEN - SHORTLY AFTER \nJohn's Dad sits at the breakfast table, reading the paper as John's Mom prepares eggs and bacon, putting it on their plates. JOHN'S MOM Well, I think we had a wonderful Christmas this year. \nJOHN'S DAD One of the best. (SLYLY) And I particularly enjoyed the gift you gave me last night. \nJohn runs into the kitchen. \nJOHN Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's alive! \nJohn's Mom and Dad look at each other and smile. JOHN'S MOM (PLAYING ALONG) Really, sweetie? Well, that's exciting. \nJOHN No mom, he's alive! For real! Look! \nTeddy walks in and stands next to John. \nTEDDY Merry Christmas, everybody! \nJohn's Dad scrambles to his feet, knocking plates off the table. John's mom screams. \nJOHN'S DAD Jesus H. Fuck! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTEDDY Let's all be best friends! \nJOHN'S MOM Oh my god... \nJOHN'S DAD John, get away from that thing! Come over here, right now! \nJOHN BUT DAD-- \nJOHN'S DAD GET OVER HERE! \nJohn reluctantly walks over to his dad, who grabs him and protectively pulls him aside. \nJOHN'S DAD (CONT'D) Helen, get my gun. \nJOHN Dad, no! \nTEDDY Is it a hugging gun? \nJOHN'S DAD Helen, get my gun, and call the police! \nTEDDY I'm sorry, Mr. Bennett. I didn't mean to scare anybody. I just wanted John and I to be friends. JOHN Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true! \nJOHN'S MOM (ASTONISHED WHISPER) My god, Steve... it's a miracle. A Christmas miracle. \nThey stare at Teddy for a beat. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Well, it wasn't long before the story of John's little miracle was sweeping the nation. \nINT. NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) \nWe see an 80's NEWSCASTER behind the news desk. A graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder. \nNEWSCASTER Out of a Boston suburb comes what is, without a doubt, the most incredible story in the history of broadcast news... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DIFFERENT NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) \nWe see an 80's FEMALE NEWSCASTER. A graphic of the bear is over her left shoulder.

ANOTHER NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) AA18 \nWe see a `70S SOUTHERN NEWSCASTER with a CHYRON that says \"ACTION NEWS GEORGIA\". He points manically at the graphic of the bear above his left shoulder. \nSOUTHERN NEWSCASTER Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did! Look what Jesus did! \nINT. JAPANESE NEWSROOM - DAY (ON TV) A MALE JAPANESE NEWSCASTER and FEMALE JAPANESE NEWSCASTER sit behind the desk. Between them, at the top of the screen, is a picture of the bear. \nFEMALE NEWSCASTER (SPEAKS JAPANESE FOR A FEW MOMENTS) \nThe male newscaster turns sharply to her. \nMALE NEWSCASTER (ADDRESSES HER ANGRILY IN JAPANESE) \nJOHN I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you down, Goose. \nTHOMAS What? \nJOHN Top Gun. \nTHOMAS So? \nJOHN Tom Skerritt. \nTHOMAS Oh. \nJohn exits. \nINT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR FRONT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nJohn emerges from Thomas' office, and walks out into the front desk area. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWe see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and a little bruised. \nGUY There you go, here's your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty, drive safely. \nHUSBAND/WIFE Thank you./Thanks so much. \nThe couple exits. Guy turns to face John. \nGUY Hey, heard you got busted. \nJOHN Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened? \nGUY I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted last night, and my phone says I texted somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same person saying thanks. \nJOHN And you don't remember it? \nGUY No. Same as last time. JOHN It... it just seems gay, doesn't it? \nGUY I don't know. Maybe, yeah. \nJOHN Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs? \nGUY I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't remember any of it, I was so fucked up. I might be gay, I don't know. You mind covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go lay down in the john. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGuy starts to leave, when ALIX, a foreign guy with a vague European accent, long dark hair, and a great tan walks up. \nALIX Hey you buddies. Where's it hanging? \nGUY/JOHN Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last night? \nALIX Ah, I didn't get in because the bouncer was doucheface, but I made friends in the line. \nGUY Oh, well, that's good I guess. \nWe see TANYA, an unbelievably gorgeous salesgirl, enter from the back with a set of keys. \nTANYA Hi you guys. \nOver the following, Tanya puts the keys away, walks over to her station and sits. \nALIX You look so pretty today. \nTANYA Aw, thanks Alix, I worked out this morning. \nALIX I can tell, you are less fat than you have been. \nJOHN Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth? \nGUY For what? \nJOHN Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice. \nTANYA Oh wow, congratulations, John. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGUY You guys`ve been goin' out for four years? \nJOHN Yeah. \nGUY THAT'S IN-- (HIGH-PITCHED) --saaaane, my longest relationship was like six months, and then she farted in her sleep. I'm like, I am outta here, man. Was gone before she woke up. \nJOHN Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh. GUY Lori ever fart in front of you? \nJOHN Yes. \nTED Hey, Lori. \nJohn gets up and gives Lori a kiss. \nLORI Ooh. I think you just got me stoned. \nJOHN (RE: GROCERIES) What do we got there? \nLORI Turkey burgers. \nTED Oh. Okay. Are we having homos over for dinner or something? \nLORI (WISEASS) No, just you homos. \nTED/JOHN Whoa!!! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED She's funny, John. You got yourself a regular Toni Collette. \nLORI Wait, who's that? Is that good? \nJOHN She's a comedienne. \nLORI Oh nice. Is she pretty? \nJOHN She's as pretty as she is funny. How was work? LORI Good. \nJOHN How's your dickhead boss? \nLORI Rex is fine. He only hit on me once today, so that's good. \nJOHN I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia. \nLORI He's harmless, I can handle it. \nTED Hey Johnny, while you're up, grab me a beer, huh? \nJOHN (crossing to fridge) Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis? \nTED Yes, a Brew-stoy-ovski would be nice right about now. \nWe see Lori roll her eyes. She's heard this before. \nLORI Jesus. \nJOHN Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED Perhaps a Ted Kazyn-brewski? \nLORI Y'know, I think I might also have a Martina Navra-ti-brewski. \nJOHN/TED Ohhhh, that doesn't work!/Come on, don't ruin it, yeah, that doesn't work. \nLORI Bullshit, what do you mean? \nJOHN It doesn't work, the name has to have a \"ski\" at the end of it. You just put \"brewski\" on the end of Martina Navratolova. \nLORI I thought we were just doing funny names. \nTED No, it's gotta have a \"ski\" at the end. Otherwise where's the challenge? If there's no \"ski\" at the end of the root word, then we would just be idiots saying nonsense. \nEXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIt's raining, with an occasional roll of thunder. \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME \nLori lies in bed holding an iPad, reading a gossip news site, with the TV on. John comes out of the bathroom, and cozies up next to her. \nLORI (OFF IPAD) Oh, look, they found those missing hikers. \nJOHN They did? What happened? \nLORI It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free. \nLORI (SWEETLY) You would? \nJOHN I sure would. (BEAT) Is that cannibalism? \nLORI No, I think it's only cannibalism if you swallow. JOHN Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow. \nREX Oh, this is work, I swear. \nLORI (SIGH) Okay, fine. \nLori follows Rex and gives the girls a \"help!\" look. \nMICHELLE He's such an asshole. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGINA Out of control. Such a sleaze. \nTRACY You guys are so pathetic. You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him. \nShort beat. \nGINA/MICHELLE Like once./I was drunk. \nGINA And so did you. \nTRACY Well, I didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me. \nINT. REX'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nLori sits across from Rex, who sits at a large desk. \nLORI So... what do you need to talk to me about, Rex? \nRex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it to her. \nREX See that? That's me on the diving team in high school. We dove the shit outta that pool that year. If you look close, you can see the outline of my root. \nLORI (ANNOYED) You promised this was about work. \nREX Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don't you like me? I'm rich, I'm good-looking, my dad owns the company-- \nLORI I have a boyfriend, Rex. I think you know this. \nREX Yeah, the guy with the teddy bear, that's a cute relationship, but I'm talking about being with a real man, Lori. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REX (CONT'D) Someone who wears a blazer on an airplane. \nLORI (STANDING UP) I'm very busy. \nREX Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head? \nLORI Goodbye, Rex. \nLori exits Rex's office. Rex casually gets up, strolls over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells his hand. \nINT./ ESTAB. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT, NEWBURY STREET - NIGHT \nINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS \nJohn and Lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table. They've just finished their meal. John has the remains of a lobster shell on his plate. \nLORI (SATISFIED SIGH) That was perfect. \nA WAITRESS approaches. WAITRESS Would you like me to wrap up your leftovers? \nLORI Oh no, I'm fine, thanks. \nJohn holds up the front portion of the lobster shell, which has the face and eyes on it. \nJOHN Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody. \nWAITRESS (BEAT) Sure. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe waitress walks away. \nLORI (MILDLY AMUSED) What are you, five years old? \nJOHN Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level. \nAnother WAITER approaches with a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries. \nWAITER Senor. Senora, here is your dessert and champagne. \nLORI Ooh, Cristal. \nJOHN It's a special night. We've been dating for four years. (TAKING BOTTLE) And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right? \nLORI It doesn't seem like four years, does it? \nJOHN (affectionately taking her HAND) No, it doesn't. \nLORI You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I'm glad you were. \nINT. CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nHe puts it on his wrist. \nLORI I remember you liked it when you saw Tom Brady wearing one in GQ. \nJOHN Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Y'know, Lori... (INDICATING BOX) Someday, there's gonna be a ring in there. But I wanna wait `til I can get you something really special, y'know? I just don't have the money right now. \nLORI John, I don't need the Hope diamond, all I want is-- \nJOHN I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti. LORI Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted. \nJOHN Oh, Jesus, here we go-- \nLORI John, please get him to find his own place, so we can get on with our lives. \nJOHN Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLORI Yeah. Fine. Let's talk about it ten years from now. \nJOHN (rolling his eyes with a SIGH) Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out. \nLORI Well, it's good to know that a talking teddy bear is the only thing that kept you from gunning down your classmates, but John, you're not eight. You're thirty-five. And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore. You have me. And I love you. \nJOHN I love you, too. You know that. \nLORI Look, I've put the best physical years of my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now, but in a few years my body's gonna fall off a fucking cliff. Things'll be hanging and stretching in ways that might scare a man. I need to feel secure in the fact that you won't leave me when that happens. \nJOHN Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards. \nShe laughs. So does he. \nLORI And, my boobs and vagina will all be in the same place, so that's a lot less movin' around for you. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN I can do it all with one hand. \nLORI Exactly, and you can do whatever you want with the other hand. \nJOHN I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller. \nLORI We can achieve critical acclaim and become rich just by screwing each other. \nThey both laugh hard. \nJOHN Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship. \nLORI (SIGH) We can't put the real conversation off forever, John. \nJOHN I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes. \nEXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nTheir car pulls up. They start to get out. \nJOHN (NOTICING) Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it? \nLori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat, we hear The Imperial March from \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" \nLORI That's my ringtone? \nJOHN (laughs, embarrassed) Oh, yeah... \nLORI What is it? It sounds negative. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN No, it's from The Notebook. \nHe reaches under the seat, fishing for the phone, as she goes inside. \nJOHN (CONT'D) (STRAINING) This is gonna take some doin'. \nLORI All right, well I'll see you upstairs. \nHe continues digging for the phone, as she walks inside. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears loud music coming from inside. She approaches the door cautiously and opens it, revealing... \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nLori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women. They're watching \"Romancing the Stone,\" which plays very loudly on the TV. \nLORI What the hell is all this?! \nTED Lori! Hey, you're home early! The ladies and I were just watching \"Romancing the Stone.\" Got it on Blu- Ray. Came in a two-pack with \"Jewel of the Nile,\" but I don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one. \nLORI No! Oh my god! \nJOHN Tell me when you get it! \nLORI AAAA, I got some on my thumb! \nJOHN AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed! \nLORI Shit! \nJOHN I'll get the next one, okay? \nINT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM - DAY \nTED She's makin' you do it, isn't she? JOHN (giving up the bullshit) Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time! \nTED What about... thunder buddies for life, Johnny? \nJOHN I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted. \nTED (SIGH) I know you do, Johnny. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise. \nTED And we'll hang out a lot, right? \nJOHN Fuck, all the time. \nTED (arms wide for a hug) Bring it over here. \nJohn hugs Ted. Ted hugs him back. We hear a squeak, and a high-pitched recorded voice saying \"I wuv you.\" John and Ted pull away from each other uncomfortably. TED (CONT'D) JOHN That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know- that doesn't mean-- I'm not - gay. \nJOHN We've got to get you a job. \nEXT./ ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME \nJohn and Ted head toward the store. Ted is dressed in a coat and tie, and looks very uncomfortable. \nTED I look stupid. \nJOHN No, you don't. You look dapper. \nTED I look like Snuggles' accountant. \nThey pause as John straightens Ted's tie. \nJOHN Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment. \nTED I don't wanna work at a grocery store. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN Well, you have no skills. \nTED I told you, I can totally be a lawyer. \nJOHN As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school. \nTED I'm a special case. I'm a fucking talking bear. They might make an exception `cause they're all like, \"Aaa! This bear can talk and do stuff! Let's give him a job and maybe he'll give us a few laughs,\" but then they're surprised at what a stellar performance I'm turnin' in. And then they practically have to give me the Anderson case. \nJOHN Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after. \nJohn discreetly pulls out a baggie of weed. \nTED And if I don't get the job will we still smoke that pot? \nJOHN Probably, yes. \nTED (patting John on the leg) Yeah. Okay, good speech, coach. \nINT. GROCERY STORE MANAGER'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER \nTed sits opposite FRANK, the grocery store manager. We see his name and title on a desk nameplate. Frank sits at the desk, staring at Ted. \nFRANK So. You think you got what it takes? \nTED Nope. \nFRANK (a beat, then) No one's ever talked to me like that before. You're hired. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED Shit. \nEXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON \nJohn sits on the couch, putting his tie on as he watches TV. Lori comes over and sits down next to him. \nLORI Hey there. \nJOHN Hey. \nLORI Listen... I just wanna say thank you. What you did with Ted was a big step, and I know it wasn't easy, but I just want you to know that I love you for it. And, I think this a new beginning for our relationship. \nJOHN Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him. \nShe gives him a kiss, and starts to undo his tie. \nLORI Y'know, I don't have to be at work for another twenty minutes... \nJOHN (guiding her down onto the COUCH) Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need one. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nShe laughs, and they kiss. \nLORI You know what my favorite thing about you is? After four years, you can still surprise me. To step up and change such a big part of your life just to make your girlfriend happier... I dunno, I bet you most guys couldn't do it. \nJOHN Most guys don't have you to motivate `em. \nLORI I'm sorry if I was pushy about it... \nJOHN No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're... inevitable. \nLORI (huh?) Inevitable. Well, that's... romantic? I think? \nJOHN No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're inevitable. \nLORI That sounds like something Stephen Hawking would say to his girlfriend. JOHN But do you get what I'm saying? \nLORI Yeah, I do. And I feel exactly the same way about you. \nThey kiss. \nLORI (CONT'D) (smiling coyly, as she NOTICES) Ooh. Is that a Flash Gordon ray gun in your pocket or are you glad to see me? \nJohn pulls the Flash Gordon gun out of his pocket and shows it to her. She cracks up. \nEXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY \nINT. GROCERY STORE - SAME \nTed is at his station, finishing checking out a customer. \nTED Thank you, please come again, we have a lot more groceries. \nThe customer exits. Ted sighs with boredom. He turns to ELLEN, the large African-American woman at the next station. \nTED (CONT'D) Hey Ellen? ELLEN Yeah? \nTED Who's that over there? \nANGLE ON A VERY ATTRACTIVE blonde girl bagging groceries a few aisles away (This is TAMI-LYNN). \nELLEN That's the new bag girl. I don't know her name, but she seems cute. \nTED Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty Fozzie. Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs and shakes her head \"no.\" \nTED (CONT'D) (TO HIMSELF) Okay, so that's where we'll draw the line. \nEXT. ESTAB./ LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - DAY \nINT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - SAME \nJohn sits at his workstation, playing a TBD video game on his iPhone. Tanya approaches. \nTANYA Hey. How you holding up? \nJOHN Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used to things, that's all. \nTANYA It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went through something like this with my last boyfriend. JOHN Really? \nTANYA Yeah, we were dating for eight months, and I was really in love with him, and then he was deported back to Iran. So, I get it. \nJOHN Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy. \nTANYA Yeah. \nJohn's phone rings the theme from \"Knight Rider.\" He sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open- mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a bra on his head. John picks up. \nJOHN Hey, Ted. \nTED (V.O.) Johnny. What are you doin'? You wanna come over and catch a buzz? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED It's called Kennedy's Head. It's actually pretty mellow. \nJOHN That doesn't sound very mellow. \nTED No, it's-- it makes you cerebral. Like Kennedy. Kennedy was smart. That's what it refers to. Decisions under pressure. Cuban missile crisis. Go on, spark it up. \nJohn takes a hit off the bong, then glances around. \nJOHN Y'know, this place looks great. \nTED Yeah, it's all Ikea. Did the whole apartment for 47 dollars. \nJOHN How are the neighbors? \nTED There's an Asian family next door, but they don't have a gong or nothin', so it's fine. \nJOHN That's lucky. \nTED How's work? JOHN Sucks. \nTED Ah. \nJOHN You? \nTED It's actualy not bad. Met a girl. She's a bagger. \nJOHN No way, that's awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what's her name? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED White trash name. Guess. \nJOHN Uh, Mandy? \nTED Nope. \nJOHN Madison? \nTED Nope. \nJOHN Britney, Tiffany, Candice? TED Nope. \nJOHN Don't fuck with me on this. I know this shit. \nTED I know you do, and I am not fucking with you. \nJOHN Okay, Brandi, Heather, Channing, Breanna, Amber, Sabrina, Melody, Dakota, Sierra, Bambi, Crystal, Samantha, Autumn, Ruby, Taylor, Tara, Tamra, Tami, Lauren, Charlene, Chantel, Courtney, Misty, Jenna, Krista, Mindy, Noelle, Shelby, Trina, Reba, Cassandra, Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna, Jolene, Earline, Claudine, Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra, Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou, Becky? \nTED Nope. \nJOHN Okay, was it any one of those names with a Lynn after it? \nTED Yep. \nJOHN Okay. Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn-- \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED Tami-Lynn. \nJOHN Fuck! \nEXT. ESTAB. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nINT. RESTAURANT - SAME \nJohn, Ted, Lori and Ted's dolled-up and sort of trashy date Tami-Lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat dinner. \nTAMI-LYNN See, I was all pissed off `cause me and my friend Danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go and I was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun. \nJOHN Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then. \nTAMI-LYNN I guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y'know? \nLORI Jesus. TAMI-LYNN Or Jesus, yeah, but whatever. \nTED Hey, isn't this great? The four of us here, having dinner together? Lori, how've you been? Haven't seen you in forever. \nLORI Um, I've been good. Not much going on. My company's 20th anniversary is next week, that's something. \nJOHN (proud, to Tami-Lynn) Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLORI It's not that big a deal. \nJOHN (THROWN) W... What? \nLORI I'm just... I'm done. This isn't gonna work. We're in two different places. JOHN Lori, look, I know-- \nLORI You promised me you were gonna grow up and take our life together seriously. \nJOHN Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn't easy. \nLORI Jesus, he might as well still be living with us, John. You spend more time with him than you do with me. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance. \nLORI (BEAT) I need a man, John. Not a boy with a teddy bear. \nJOHN I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart. \nLori can't help but let a small laugh escape. She softens a bit... \nLORI John... this really is your last chance. I can't do this anymore. \nJOHN You won't have to. Trust me. I love you. \nHe kisses her. \nLORI (BEAT) Okay. JOHN Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won't be sorry, I swear. \nShe smiles at him, then: \nLORI Did you really just fart? \nJOHN Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand. \nLORI Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first. \nWIDER ANGLE on the restaurant. For a moment, nothing happens. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThen, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions. \nGUY AT TABLE (FURIOUS) Who did this to us?! \nGUY #2 AT TABLE (FURIOUS) God dammit! I'm here on business! \nEXT./ESTAB. GROCERY STORE - DAY \nINT. GROCERY STORE - DAY Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at Ellen's register. \nFRANK What the hell? \nHe walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and notices him. \nGUY IN LINE Hey, dude, you think you could open more than one register? There's like a thousand people here! \nFRANK There's supposed to be three registers open, for god's sake! \nHe looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's counter and produce area, then walk into the back storeroom. \nINT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nFrank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away, with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock and horror. \nINT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER \nFrank sits at his desk, addressing Ted. \nFRANK You had sexual intercourse with a coworker in a storeroom filled with produce that we sell to the public. \nTED Yes. \nFRANK (BEAT) That took guts. We need guts. I'm promoting you. TED Oh. \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nWe see the \"CLOSED\" sign on the door. Ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook shot into a trash can. He takes the shot: \nTED Kareem! \nThe bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters. \nTED (CONT'D) You suck, Kareem. We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and looks around. There appears to be no one in the darkness. \nTED (CONT'D) Hello? \nNo answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb. \nREX Whoa, whoa, okay, look, I think I oughtta just clear the air here a little. I... just want you to know that... I mean, yeah, I'm kind of a \"fun-time boss\" and whatnot, but... look man, I do that with everybody at the office! I'm just a kook! I have no designs on your girlfriend. We work together, and that's it. I think you're a great guy and she's very lucky. \nJohn is a bit surprised, not unpleasantly so, to hear this. \nJOHN Well... that's good to hear. \nREX Well, that's how it is, so...there we go. \nJOHN Okay. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nREX Yeah. \nThey stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's nut. John's phone rings the \"Knight Rider\" theme. John answers it. \nJOHN Hey, Ted. \nINTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the background, we see a party in full swing. \nTED (V.O.) Johnny! You gotta get over here, man! JOHN Why? What's going on? \nTED (V.O.) I'm havin' a little impromptu thing with some people, and John... Sam Jones is here. \nJOHN What?! \nTED (V.O.) Sam Jones. Flash fucking Gordon. Is here. \nJOHN Holy shit! How? \nINT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nTED Remember I said, my buddy's cousin is friends with Sam Jones? My buddy's in town with his cousin and who's with `em? Sam Jones!! \nINT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nTED (V.O.) Sam Jones is here, and John... (softly, into phone) ...his hair is parted down the middle. \nJOHN (EQUALLY SOFTLY) Just like in the movie. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED Get over here. \nJOHN Fuck! I can't... I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here. \nJohn looks down at the main area of the party, and sees Lori happily chatting with her co-workers. \nJOHN (CONT'D) (AGONIZED) I just... I can't. \nINT. TED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS TED John. There are moments in a man's life: Nathan Hale, \"I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.\" Alan Hale, \"Yes, I accept the role of the Skipper on `Gilligan's Island.'\" \nINT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nTED (V.O.) John, this is your Alan Hale moment. For god's sake, come share this with me. \nJOHN (beat, then:) I'm coming. \nJohn hangs up. JOHN (CONT'D) Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out. She absolutely cannot know I was gone. If you can cover for me... we're cool on all that other stuff. \nREX I got your back, my friend. Been there. She'll never know. \nJOHN This is one man to another. I don't really know you, but I'm trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nREX Dude. One man to another. I got you on this. \nJOHN (RELAXING SOMEWHAT) Okay. Thank you. \nJohn races O.S.... and Rex raises his scotch glass to his mouth. \nREX (SMILING) I'm gonna make traditional to your girlfriend. And then fuck her in the ass. All right. We have a game plan. \nEXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe \"Football Fight\" music from \"Flash Gordon\" starts playing, as John bolts O.S. \nEXT. REX'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nJohn sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway. He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts the car, and backs out. \nEXT. BOSTON (VARIOUS) - NIGHT \nCUT TO various shots of John racing through the city on his way to Ted's. Finally, he pulls up to Ted's apartment. \nINT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nJohn throws open the door. The place is as lively as it can be. The party is packed with people, including Alix and Tanya, John's co-workers from Liberty. There are also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot chicks. Ted runs up, wearing a blazer. \nTED Johnny! Thank Christ you made it! \nJOHN I gotta-- I gotta go! Shit! \nJohn scrambles to his feet, and runs for the front door. \nINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nJohn opens the door and runs down the hall. He runs partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt, angry, and betrayed as a woman can be. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN Lori... I... \nHe throws up all over the floor. \nEXT. TED'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nLori storms out into the street. After a beat, John runs out after her. \nJOHN Lori! Lori wait! \nShe hastily pays the cabbie who waits outside. John catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears. JOHN (CONT'D) I'm sorry! I messed up! I-- \nLORI I want you out of the apartment... tonight. Gimme my car keys. \nJOHN Can I please just explain-- \nLORI No. \nJOHN I was gonna-- \nLORI I have given up a big chunk of my life for you. \nJOHN I was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon-- \nLORI Just give me my keys, John! \nHe reluctantly hands her her keys. She turns and walks toward her car. \nJOHN Lori... please. I love you. \nShe gets in the car and drives away with a screech. Angle on Ted, who is walking out the door. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED Johnny, come on upstairs. Tami-Lynn's gonna make some RC Cola from scratch. \nJOHN Fuck you! I don't want to talk to you! \nTED What? \nJOHN Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended. \nTED Oh come on, she'll go home, watch Bridget Jones' Somethin' Asshole, cry a little bit, she'll be fine, you'll talk to her tomorrow. \nJOHN (EXPLODING) Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?! \nTed pauses, realizing John is serious. \nTED Well... `course I do, Johnny. Thunder buddies for life. \nJOHN Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life. \nTED Johnny, I'm... I'm sorry. \nJOHN I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore. \nJohn turns and walks away. \nTED Johnny, wait! Hey, listen! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTed pushes his own stomach in. We hear his soundbox squeak out the words \"I wuv you.\" John does not turn around. Ted looks after him, then slowly lowers his head sadly. He sits down on the sidewalk, dazed and defeated. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMONTAGE: SET TO MUSIC - SONG TBD \nEXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT \nJohn pulls up in his car, and sadly goes inside. \nINT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT John sits on the bed and turns on the TV. He flips through the channels, seeing various clips of shows. Eventually, he shuts off the TV. He opens his wallet, and takes out a picture of Lori. He looks at it sadly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MINI GOLF COURSE - NIGHT \nREX Look, I'm an asshole. I know that. It worked for me in high school, and it's been like a reflex ever since. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REX (CONT'D) (sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk. Besides, you're a huge catch and it's about time somebody treated you that way. \nLORI Fine... I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night. \nREX Great. Pick you up at seven? \nEXT./ ESTAB. MIDTOWN HOTEL - NIGHT It's raining outside. \nINT. MIDTOWN HOTEL - SAME \nJohn sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic book. There's a knock at the door. \nJOHN Who is it? \nTED Johnny, it's me. \nJOHN Go away. \nTED Johnny, open the door, please. I wanna talk. \nJohn ignores him. A few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked. \nJOHN JESUS-- \nTed shakes the water off himself like a dog. John flinches back, trying not to get wet. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED Sorry. Look, Johnny, I know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. I saw Lori out on a date with Rex. \nJOHN What? \nTED I'm serious, John, I went over to your house to talk to Lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and I saw Rex picking her up. They were going to the Hatch Shell. \nJOHN You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her-- \nTED Johnny, it's the truth. I'm tellin' ya-- \nJOHN Get outta here. \nTED (BEAT) You know, you're actin' like a cock, you know that? JOHN What? I'm acting like a cock? \nTED Yes. You are actin' like a giant, V- shaped-funny-lookin'-guy-in-a-porno cock. \nJOHN Huh? \nTED `Member that porno we saw with the guy with the V-shaped cock--forget it. What I'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself. \nJohn glares at him. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED (CONT'D) Lori was right about you. You can't take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life. \nJOHN Oh, and you can? \nTED I don't have to, I'm a fuckin' teddy bear! Y'know somethin', I didn't tie you up and drag you to that party. I wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend. \nJOHN Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life? \nTED Whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship. \nJOHN You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it? \nTED Wow. Listen to yourself. What am I, Emperor Ming here, controllin' your mind? That's your choice, John! And you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy. \nJOHN (BEAT) You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin. \nTED (BEAT) Say that one more time. \nJOHN Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTed stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him, wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like the facehuggers from \"Aliens.\" John stumbles around the room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door, shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face. John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed, reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible. John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him. \nJOHN (CONT'D) AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ! god fucking dammit!!! Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor). John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back onto the bed. Ted taunts him. \nTED C'mon, motherfucker! \nJohn jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily. Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing deteriorates into sobs. \nEXT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY \nDonny's car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in \"Silence of the Lambs\"). It's close to one end of the base of a bridge. \nINT. DONNY'S HOUSE - LATE DAY \nDonny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls, there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings, photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in public that Donny clearly took himself. TED Whoa... \nDONNY Yes, as you can see, you've been part of our family for quite some time. Welcome home. \nTED Heh, you know what's hilarious, I got tons of pictures of you guys at my house. \nROBERT Daddy, is he all mine? \nDONNY He's all yours, my little winner. You've arrived at a lucky time, Ted. It's almost Robert's play hour. \nTED I'm guessin' you guys don't have a PS3. I'm guessin' you're more of a wooden horse with a wig kinda family. \nINT. ROBERT'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTed is led into Robert's room. It's a fairly sparse room with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with a wig stands in the corner. \nTED Huh. Wig horse. \nRobert sits down on the floor, smiling at him. Donny stands in the doorway. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDONNY Now, remember, Ted, you belong to Robert now. So you will do as he says. \nTED Y'know, you think you're just gonna get away with a kidnapping? Nice fuckin' example you're settin' for your kid. \nDONNY (leaning in to Ted with ANGER) LANGUAGE!!! \nTed flinches nervously. Donny moves back. \nDONNY (CONT'D) When I was a little boy, I saw you on television. And I thought you were the most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father if I could have a magical teddy bear, too. And he said no. And I was heartbroken. I decided that if I ever had a son, I would never say no to him. \nTED Maybe \"no\" to a Snickers bar every once in awhile wouldn't hurt. \nROBERT Me and Ted are gonna be best friends, daddy. \nDONNY Yes. You are. Happy play time. Donny shuts the door. Robert stares at Ted. \nTED Jesus fucking Christ! \nROBERT No! Daddy said no bad words! \nTED Yeah well, fuck your dad. \nTed scrambles for the window and tries to open it. It doesn't budge. He takes a running leap at it, but just bounces off like a plush toy, and lands on the floor. \nTED (CONT'D) Shit! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nRobert stands over him. \nROBERT I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it. \nTED That's a great story, I felt like I was there. \nROBERT Daddy gave me an ouch. Now I have to give you an ouch. \nRobert grabs Ted with one hand, and gets a grip on one of Ted's ears with the other hand. Robert pulls on the ear as hard as he can, and rips the ear off. Ted screams as loud as he can. Robert looks at him, holding the ear. \nTED Okay... okay, kid. You win. We'll do it your way. You wanna play a game or somethin'? It's play time, let's play a game. \nROBERT Yeah, I wanna play a game! \nTED Good, good, hey, how `bout we play a little game of hide and seek? \nROBERT I love hide and seek! I'll hide! \nTED Well, now, Robert, your dad likes you to show good manners, right? \nROBERT Yes. \nTED Well, a well-mannered kid lets his guest hide first, don't ya think? \nThere's a beat. Robert stares blankly at him, then: \nROBERT Okay, you hide first. \nTED Great. Fantastic. Okay, now you count to a hundred and then try to find me, okay? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nROBERT Do I need to wash my hands before this game? \nTED You... well-- no, you-- god, that's a weird fuckin' question, no, just start countin'. \nJOHN What do you mean, what kinda trouble? \nLori turns, slightly curious, but still annoyed. \nTED They got me! That freaky guy and his freaky fat kid! \nJOHN What? \nTED I'm in their house, John! You gotta call the police, they won't let me outta here! They tore my ear off! \nJOHN Wait, slow down! Where are you? \nTED Uh... I'm not sure, it's uh-- \nSuddenly, a hand grabs the phone away from Ted. He gasps and looks up. It's Donny, who slams the phone back down in its cradle. \nDONNY (dark, brewing rage) You're not a very polite guest. \nTED Shit. \nINT. LORI'S CAR - LATE DAY/DUSK \nJOHN (INTO PHONE) Ted? Ted? Hello? Ted! \nLORI What's the matter, is he all right? \nJOHN I don't know. \nLORI Where is he? \nJOHN I don't know, but he's in trouble. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLORI Why? What happened? Can you call him back? \nJOHN No, it's blocked-- wait a second. \nJohn scrambles for his wallet. He opens it, and pulls out the address given to him earlier by Donny at the Common. He looks at it, then points out the window. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Go! Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway! \nEXT. BOSTON STREET - CONTINUOUS Lori's car peels out and races off. \nINT. DONNY'S KITCHEN - LATE DAY \nDonny stands over Ted. \nDONNY You've put us in a pickle here, haven't you? We have to go now. \nTED Yeah, good idea. \nTed runs through Donny's legs, and out into the hall. He races for the living room and the exit, but Robert steps in front of the door, blocking him. TED (CONT'D) Aaaa! \nROBERT Found you. \nRobert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses. \nINT. DINING ROOM - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS \nDonny pursues Ted around the table. Ted ducks under the table, under the chairs, etc. trying to escape Donny (and Robert, who has entered the room). Ted slips past them and back out into the hall. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nHe races for the door, but the deadbolt is too high to reach. He runs into the living room, and pushes open a door. \nINT. BASEMENT - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS \nTed tumbles down the dark stairs into the basement, which is lit only by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. He lands, gets his bearings, then freezes in shock, as he sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and mutilated teddy bears. \nTED AAAAAA! \nDonny and Robert move in to frame behind him. DONNY We tried to make do with other teddy bears. But none of them were you, Ted. \nTed whirls around in shock, as we cut to: \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nJohn and Lori race through the streets of Boston. \nINT. LORI'S CAR - DUSK \nJOHN It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They got him somehow. LORI Which way? \nJOHN Shoot up 99! \nEXT. BOSTON STREET - DUSK - CONTINUOUS \nThe car makes a hard left. \nTED (holding head in pain) Aaaaa! Shit!! \nINT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nThey continue watch with held breath, as they keep up. \nINT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Ted shakes himself off, still a little dazed, and climbs back up. Robert climbs into the way back and grabs one of his legs. \nROBERT No! You're being bad! \nTed reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and brandishes it threateningly at Robert. \nTED Back off, Susan Boyle. \nRobert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump. \nINT. LORI'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nJOHN Easy... \nLORI I know. \nJOHN EASY-- \nLORI I know! \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori breathe energetic sighs of relief. \nTED Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right? \nJohn and Lori laugh. \nJOHN Yes! Fuckin' A right! \nINT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nDonny sees what's happening in his side mirror. He puts his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back) and tumbling into the back seat. \nTED God dammit! \nTed gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack. \nANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off. \nINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nDonny's car scrapes against the side of the tunnel, sending sparks flying. \nINT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nDonny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the floor on the passengers' side. Donny rips the sack off his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window. He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is opposing traffic moving in the other direction. \nEXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks. \nLORI Shit! \nShe pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they continue on into the city. \nEXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nDonny's car races through the streets, pursued by John and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways behind. \nINT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nTed is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side. He looks around, and spots a \"Club\" underneath the seat. He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then, with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but can't. \nEXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nDonny's car swerves out of control, veering up the street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop. Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit. TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly. That little rip has done something... He shakes it off, and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and disappears inside. ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the sidewalk after them. \nINT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS \nTed runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him down a bit. \nANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through the garage door, and running inside. They look around for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK ON JOHN. \nROBERT (O.S.) NO!! \nJohn and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at them! \nROBERT (CONT'D) You can't have my teddy bear!! \nWhen Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look down at him. \nLORI Oh my god. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED (weak, slow breathing) Johnny... \nTed looks glassy-eyed for a beat. John starts to frantically gather up the chunks of stuffing. \nJOHN Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all! \nLori starts helping him, desperately grabbing chunks of the white cotton. \nTED Johnny... \nJohn leans back over Ted. \nJOHN You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine. \nTED (WEAK) Jesus, I look like the robot from \"Aliens\". \nJOHN No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay. \nTED I... I don't think so. I'm... I'm in trouble. I need... I need to tell you something. \nJOHN What is it? \nTED Don't... don't ever lose her again. She's the most important... most important part of your life. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: TED (CONT'D) Even more than me. She's your thunder buddy now. She's-- \nTed closes his eyes... and dies. ANGLE DIRECTLY ABOVE TED as we pull away, and it starts to rain... \nEXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe rain is pouring now. Lori's car pulls up. She and John hurry out, John holding the remains of Ted. They race inside. \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJohn and Lori burst in with the remains of Ted. They're both drenched from the rain. Lori frantically searches drawers for sewing materials. She finds a needle and thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to sew him up as John watches intently. \nLORI John... I don't know if this is gonna-- \nJOHN Just try. Please. Just try. \nShe continues sewing, until she is all finished. They wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower their heads. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER \nJohn sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his shoulder. \nLORI John... I'm sorry. You did everything you could. I'm... I'm just so sorry. \nShe gently puts an arm around him. There is a thunderclap outside. John does not react. \nLORI (CONT'D) (almost too softly to be HEARD) You're not afraid... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nANGLE ON TED (shortly after) as a white sofa blanket is placed over him. John and Lori shut off the lights, and exit... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJohn is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks over to the window, and looks out. \nEXT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME \nANGLE UPWARD - We see a cloudy sky, much like the one from that night when John was a child. As before, there is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star whizzes by through the opening. \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLori's eyes widen a bit in recognition. She stares at the shooting star for a beat, then closes her eyes and makes a wish... \nEXT./ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - TIME LAPSE \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nJohn wakes up, looks around groggily, then remembers. He gets out of bed, and walks toward the living room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nHe pauses for a beat... and walks in. The blanket is where it was left. John slowly removes it. Ted is still motionless. John lowers his head sadly. Suddenly, Ted's eyes snap open. \nJOHN Ted! \nTED (RETARDED-SOUNDING VOICE) I'm alive, Johnny! \nJOHN Oh my god! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED (RETARDED-SOUNDING VOICE) I'm alive!

A graphic next to her reads \"FORMER CELEBRITY BUSTED AT AIRPORT\", with an unflattering photo of Ted. \nINT. AIRPORT - DAY (VIDEO) \nWe see Ted getting hauled away by security. A caption below reads \"Ted caught with mushrooms at airport security\". He's putting up a bit of a fight, and gives the \"finger\" to the camera (the finger is pixilated). \nINT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT (EXISTING FOOTAGE) \nWe see 20 year-old John sitting on his bed, laughing. Ted sits by his side, also laughing at the incident. \nEXT.

On her wall, it reads \"Lori has added 3 new photos in the album Mobile Uploads\". \nEXT. OUTDOOR FAIR - DAY (PHOTO) \nLori and John smile as Lori holds a big stuffed bear that John has won for her at a booth. Ted stands nearby, arms crossed, with a deep, disapproving scowl. \nEXT.

MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - NIGHT (EXISTING FOOTAGE) \nJohn, Lori, and Ted play miniature golf. Lori putts the ball, which rolls to the lip of the cup. She reacts, disappointed. Ted makes a graceful leg sweep, pushing the ball into the cup \"accidentally\". Lori smiles. John smiles back at her. Ted winks. \nEXT. BASEBALL GAME - DAY (EXISTING FOOTAGE) (Insert \"Jeter sucks\" bit) \nEXT. LAKE - DAY (EXISTING PHOTO) \nEXT.

JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering a \"Home Sweet Home\" picture into the wall. He steps back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall. He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there like an idiot. \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO) \nJohn, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch. All three sit with their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine bottle on the table in front of them. \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO) \nWe see a photo Ted has taken of himself. In the background are John and Lori, playing Scrabble.

PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted passes the bong to John. \nTED All I'm sayin' is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life. \nJOHN That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot. \nTED Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl.

I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, \"Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high.\" JOHN (looks at his watch) Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work. \nJohn gets up, and hurries into the other room to get dressed. \nTED Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds. \nJOHN (O.S.) Jesus, I don't know if I can drive. \nTED I'll drive you, I feel fine. \nEXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nWe see two shots of John's car driving through the city: We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge. \nEXT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - MORNING \nJohn's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot, scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars. \nJOHN/TED Aw, Jesus. / Fuck. \nANGLE ON Ted's feet. There are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and looks at the damage. \nJOHN Aw, man. \nTED Is it bad? \nJOHN It's not good. \nANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the doorway. THOMAS John! May I speak with you, please? \nJOHN Shit. \nTED It's okay, go, go, I'll pull outta here. (WAVING) Hi, Thomas! How are ya? \nThomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking. \nOTHER DRIVER Asshole! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED (OVERLAPPING) Easy, Jersey license! \nTed drives away. \nINT. THOMAS' OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER \nThomas sits at his desk facing John. \nTHOMAS John, it's almost ten o'clock. \nJOHN I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. THOMAS What do you mean? \nJOHN (BEAT) I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question. \nTHOMAS John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up. Not that I don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him. But I'm telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck. \nJOHN Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me. \nTHOMAS Good. I like hearing that.

Garfield's eyes look like a pair of tits. \nTAMI-LYNN Okay, you were right. \nINT.

This all bullshit! \nSAM DEATH TO MING!!! \nSam charges the Asian man, tackling him. They both tumble over the back of the couch, nearly knocking it over. The duck flies out of his arms, landing on the floor. It immediately goes after Ted, who screams. ANGLE ON SAM, who chokes the Asian man on the floor. John struggles to pull him off. JOHN Sam, no! Get off him! \nANGLE ON TED - who circles confrontationally with the duck, as in an Irish bar fight. ANGLE BACK ON THE GUYS FIGHTING - The Asian man jabs Sam in the eye with the other end of the spoon, and Sam goes staggering backward, falling into John. They land on the table, smashing it in half. They fall to the floor on top of each other. \nASIAN MAN You crazy! You crazy man! \nThe duck charges at Ted and slaps him across the face a few times with its wings. \nTED AAA! AAAA! OW!!

She opens the door cautiously, and looks out into the hall. There's no one there. \nTED (O.S.) Down here, I swear to god I'm not lookin' up your towel. \nShe looks down with a start, and sees Ted standing there. He's blocking his view with one hand. \nTED (CONT'D) Not lookin' up your towel.

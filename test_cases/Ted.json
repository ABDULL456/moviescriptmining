A graphic next to her reads \"FORMER CELEBRITY BUSTED AT AIRPORT\", with an unflattering photo of Ted. \nINT. AIRPORT - DAY (VIDEO) \nWe see Ted getting hauled away by security. A caption below reads \"Ted caught with mushrooms at airport security\". He's putting up a bit of a fight, and gives the \"finger\" to the camera (the finger is pixilated). \nINT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT (EXISTING FOOTAGE) \nWe see 20 year-old John sitting on his bed, laughing. Ted sits by his side, also laughing at the incident. \nEXT.

JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering a \"Home Sweet Home\" picture into the wall. He steps back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall. He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there like an idiot. \nINT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO) \nJohn, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch. All three sit with their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine bottle on the table in front of them. \nINT.

PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted passes the bong to John. \nTED All I'm sayin' is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life. \nJOHN That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot. \nTED Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl.

I gotta have a talk with my weed guy. \nJOHN I-- It's workin' for me. \nTED I think it sucks, I'm gonna have a talk with him. \nJOHN Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints. \nTED No, I know this guy a long time. I've known him since 9/11. Remember, I was like, \"Aw, shit. 9/11. I gotta get high.\" JOHN (looks at his watch) Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work. \nJohn gets up, and hurries into the other room to get dressed. \nTED Hey, you mind pickin' up a bird feeder on the way home? I wanna start enjoying the beauty of birds. \nJOHN (O.S.) Jesus, I don't know if I can drive. \nTED I'll drive you, I feel fine. \nEXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nWe see two shots of John's car driving through the city: We see John in the passenger's seat putting Visine into his eyes, with only Ted's ears and eyes showing as he drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an overhead pull-back shot as we move away from the car to reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge. \nEXT. LIBERTY RENT-A-CAR - MORNING \nJohn's car pulls up the street and into the parking lot, scraping its side against the corner headlight of one of the rental cars. \nJOHN/TED Aw, Jesus. / Fuck. \nANGLE ON Ted's feet. There are wooden blocks attached to the pedals so that his feet can reach them. He slams on the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and looks at the damage. \nJOHN Aw, man. \nTED Is it bad? \nJOHN It's not good. \nANGLE ON THE RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - THOMAS, the branch manager, an intense, middle-aged man, is standing in the doorway. THOMAS John! May I speak with you, please? \nJOHN Shit. \nTED It's okay, go, go, I'll pull outta here. (WAVING) Hi, Thomas! How are ya? \nThomas dryly waves back. Ted pulls forward, scraping the car again. He abruptly pulls out into traffic, and another car swerves a bit to get around him, honking. \nOTHER DRIVER Asshole! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTED (OVERLAPPING) Easy, Jersey license! \nTed drives away. \nINT. THOMAS' OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER \nThomas sits at his desk facing John. \nTHOMAS John, it's almost ten o'clock. \nJOHN I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. THOMAS What do you mean? \nJOHN (BEAT) I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question. \nTHOMAS John, all you have to do is not fuck up, and you get my job when I go to corporate next month. You will be the new branch manager. All you have to do is not fuck up, and all you're doing is fucking up. Not that I don't think you're too fucked up to handle not fucking up my job, but you happen to be the least fucked-up person in the whole office. The next least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been here three fucking years longer than him. But I'm telling you, I will promote the fuck out of him if you fuck up one more time. That is all. Fuck. \nJOHN Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me. \nTHOMAS Good. I like hearing that. Because in a month my life now could be your life: a cushy $38,000-a-year branch manager who's personal friends with Tom Skerritt. It's not a bad life, is it? \nJOHN N--no. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTHOMAS Did you know I'm friends with Tom Skerritt? \nJOHN No. \nTHOMAS I'll show you something I don't show too many people, because I don't want anyone treating me differently. \nThomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom Skerritt. \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) That's me and Tom Skerritt. JOHN (SLIGHTLY OVERDONE) Wowwww. \nTHOMAS Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here. I'm gonna dock you for being late, and for the scratch on that car.

Such a sleaze. \nTRACY You guys are so pathetic. You're shitting on Rex, and you both had sex with him. \nShort beat. \nGINA/MICHELLE Like once./I was drunk. \nGINA And so did you. \nTRACY Well, I didn't want one of you whores getting promoted before me. \nINT. REX'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nLori sits across from Rex, who sits at a large desk. \nLORI So... what do you need to talk to me about, Rex? \nRex takes a framed picture out of a drawer, and shows it to her. \nREX See that? That's me on the diving team in high school. We dove the shit outta that pool that year. If you look close, you can see the outline of my root. \nLORI (ANNOYED) You promised this was about work. \nREX Lori, what is wrong with you? Why don't you like me? I'm rich, I'm good-looking, my dad owns the company-- \nLORI I have a boyfriend, Rex.

(MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: REX (CONT'D) Someone who wears a blazer on an airplane. \nLORI (STANDING UP) I'm very busy. \nREX Well then, how do you have all that time to be in my head? \nLORI Goodbye, Rex. \nLori exits Rex's office. Rex casually gets up, strolls over to her chair, nonchalantly brushes his hand on the cushion where she was sitting, and nonchalantly smells his hand. \nINT./ ESTAB. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT, NEWBURY STREET - NIGHT \nINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS \nJohn and Lori sit across from each other at a romantically set table. They've just finished their meal. John has the remains of a lobster shell on his plate. \nLORI (SATISFIED SIGH) That was perfect. \nA WAITRESS approaches. WAITRESS Would you like me to wrap up your leftovers? \nLORI Oh no, I'm fine, thanks. \nJohn holds up the front portion of the lobster shell, which has the face and eyes on it. \nJOHN Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody. \nWAITRESS (BEAT) Sure. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThe waitress walks away. \nLORI (MILDLY AMUSED) What are you, five years old? \nJOHN Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level. \nAnother WAITER approaches with a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and some chocolate-covered strawberries. \nWAITER Senor. Senora, here is your dessert and champagne. \nLORI Ooh, Cristal. \nJOHN It's a special night. We've been dating for four years. (TAKING BOTTLE) And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right? \nLORI It doesn't seem like four years, does it? \nJOHN (affectionately taking her HAND) No, it doesn't. \nLORI You had no business being out on that dance floor, but I'm glad you were. \nINT.

My head hurts a lot. JOHN Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice. \nShe sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Sorry. Does it hurt? \nLORI (beat, noticing him for the FIRST TIME) N... No. No it's okay. \nJOHN (beat, noticing too) I'm... I'm John. LORI I'm Lori. \nThey smile at each other... \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE) \nLORI Okay, here's a question that'll show how much you actually care about me. You remember we stayed and talked until the place closed, and then we went for late night eggs and waffles, and we stayed there til 5 a.m. watching a movie on the little TV in the diner. Name the movie. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN Octopussy. \nLORI Gold star. \nJOHN But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore? \nLORI I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. \nJOHN Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad. LORI (LAUGHING) Your dancing was bad. \nJOHN I had some cool moves. \nLORI So do people with Parkinson's. \nJOHN That's not how I remember it. \nLORI Yeah, how do you remember it? \nINT. SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy officer's uniform, a la Ted Stryker in \"Airplane!\" as \"Stayin' Alive\" blasts from the jukebox. ANGLE ON LORI, who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty. John takes his hat off, and tosses it O.S. coolly. He struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses it O.S. He then strikes a \"finger up\" disco pose, with a bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to: \nINT. CIAO BELLA RESTAURANT - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE) \nLORI Whatever you say, baby.

John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small box. Lori looks excited. \nJOHN Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for a long time. \nJohn slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up. \nLORI Oh, John. \nLori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings. \nJOHN Those are the ones you liked, right? From that kiosk at the mall? LORI Oh. Yeah. \nJOHN Check out the card. \nShe opens up the card, which we see as John describes it. It says, \"Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you.\" \nJOHN (CONT'D) See, I even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn't get bored while you were reading it. \nLORI (UNENTHUSED) Great. Thanks. Well, um, here.

TED (CONT'D) Aaaa! \nROBERT Found you. \nRobert turns the deadbolt on the door, locking it. Ted turns and bolts in the other direction back down the hallway, but sees Donny heading for him. Ted ducks into the dining room, as Donny lunges for him and misses. \nINT. DINING ROOM - LATE DAY - CONTINUOUS \nDonny pursues Ted around the table.

He lands, gets his bearings, then freezes in shock, as he sees that the basement is loaded with ripped and mutilated teddy bears. \nTED AAAAAA! \nDonny and Robert move in to frame behind him.

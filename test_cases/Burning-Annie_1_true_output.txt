BETH For such "close" friends, it just seems weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a lot closer to you than any of them. 
They are at the Library. 
MAX What are doing here? 
14 INT. LIBRARY LOBBY 14 
Max and Beth remove their coats, revealing formal wear. OTHER STUDENTS give them looks. An older female LIBRARIAN approaches. 
LIBRARIAN Ah, you must have the reservation for booth seven. 
BETH Yes, that's us. 
MAX What? 
LIBRARIAN Right this way, then. 
MAX "Reservation"? 
LIBRARIAN You'd be surprised how many of you lovebirds we get in here. 
She winks and leads them to the elevator. Beth smiles shyly and looks at Max, but he is merely embarrassed. Her smile fades. 
15 INT. LIBRARY MEDIA ROOM 15 
Max and Beth are watching the opening credits of Annie Hall on a tiny TV in a cubicle. They are surrounded by other students in cubicles. 
BETH Isn't this great? 
MAX Well, this isn't exactly what I had in mind. 
BETH What do you mean? 
MAX For starters, I have a serious problem with spending any time in the library when I don't have to. I'm here once or twice a year as it is. Plus... (holds up headphones) What's the point of seeing this together if we're wearing headphones? [MORE] 
MAX (CONT'D) Why not be with a life-sized cardboard cut-out? That way you can be with someone famous, even a dead person. Wouldn't you rather be with Elvis? 
BETH Oh, shhh...! 
MAX Or Batman? 
BETH Can't you just enjoy the moment? 
MAX I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (SIGHS) I'm a little nervous. It's like, our first date and everything. 
BETH Oh. Yeah. 
16 EXT. LIBRARY Â­ NIGHT 16 
Max and Beth leave the library. Their dispositions have switched: Max is perky while Beth is subdued. 
MAX I can't believe how many great lines there are. Even the little throwaways, like when she parks and he's like, "That's okay, we can walk to the curb from here." 
BETH Yeah. I loved it, I'm serious. I'm so glad we did this. 
MAX Yeah, me too. 
BETH But man, relationships are a lot of work, aren't they? 
MAX Uh, sure, sometimes... 
Beth stops him, and they sit on a bench. The night is cold. They sit close and lean in, speaking in hushed tones. 
BETH If I'm going to jump into anything with you, Max, I need some sign that you're serious about it. About me. 
MAX What? You want me to get a tattoo or something? 
BETH Look, you've gotta admit, you're the most pessimistic person in the world. 
MAX Obviously you've never met my mother. 
BETH Can you be serious for a second? 
MAX I guess you really haven't met my mother... 
Beth isn't laughing. 
BETH Look, Max, this isn't going to work.

CONTINUED: They hear the sound of the WINDOW BEING CLOSED and LATCHED. As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide with fear, he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his haunches so he's close to the BOY, desperate, unable to decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear. The BOY is staring from the door to the pistol to the bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat. 
BOY. (MUMBLING, TO SELF.) Bad guys... bad men... 
MAN. Shh, shh... There are FOOT STEPS outside the door as the WELL FED PEOPLE drift closer and then away again. The man starts to cough but he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY's hand in his other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can't. Then the BOY notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN's mouth, stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside: 
WELL FED WOMAN. Will you help me with the dirty dishes? 
BEARDED MAN 2. I'm hungry. As the coughing subsides a little the MAN takes the BOY's hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it. 
MAN. Take it. The BOY tries to resist, shaking his head, terrified, mute. 
MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D) Take it. The MAN puts his left arm around the BOY's tiny, thin shoulders and holds him close. 
MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D) Don't be afraid. If they get hold of you, you're going to have to do it just like everybody else. Do you understand? Shh. No crying. Do you hear me? The WOMAN turns from the window and one of the BEARDED MEN pours whiskey and hands her one. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) The BOY is weeping and shaking his head as the MAN shows him again what to do with the gun. 
MAN (WHISPERS.) Stop crying. You have to be a brave boy. You know how to do it. 
BOY (WHISPERS.) I think so. 
MAN (WHISPERS.) Say "Yes I do Papa." He stares down at the little BOY who just holds the gun feebly... he realises the BOY won't use it. After a moment of torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes the gun from the BOY's hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down at his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol, the MAN aiming the large revolver at the BOY's forehead. 
BOY. What are you doing? The MAN's hand shakes, his thumb trembles on the hammer as he cocks it... 
BOY. (CONT'D) Papa? 
MAN. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
BOY. Will I see you again? When will I see you? The MAN's finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly squeezes it... At that moment there's a loud THUMP from the kitchen and the WELL FED PEOPLE stop and listen, then rush through to the kitchen, and immediately there's a commotion as they see the state of the hatch with the table over it. 
BEARDED MAN 2(O.O.V.) What the fuck do you think you're doing? Huh? What the fuck do you think you're doing...? 
WELL FED WOMAN (O.O.V.) Don't look at me like that. What are you doing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 3) The MAN gathers his wits and opens the door a crack. 
MAN. Follow me, take my hand, don't let go. 
INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY 
The MAN bursts out of the rest room with the BOY and they make a dash for the open window. He sticks his gun in his belt and wrestles with the window, an old colonial style frame which sticks. From behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled GRUNTS and SHOUTS until the MAN wrenches the window open, stuffs the BOY through and follows. 
EXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY 
The MAN picks the BOY up and they rush down the steps. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME - DAY 
They rush down the driveway and the MAN drags the BOY through a gap in the dead privet hedge onto the road. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
They hesitate a moment on the road, deciding. 
MAN. Come on, keep running! They rush across the road to the woods on the other side, the BOY ahead as the MAN checks behind them. The MAN looks back towards the house and two of the WELL-FED PEOPLE have come outside, looking around suspiciously. He hits the ground and takes the BOY with him, they lie flat at the edge of the woods and the road. They are wildly out of breath, chests heaving, the MAN coughing. 
MAN. (CONT'D) Keep your head down. POV MAN - the WELL-FED PEOPLE walk a few steps down the drive and a BEARDED MAN looks through BINOCULARS at the road and the woods, but not directly at the MAN and the BOY hiding. The WELL FED PEOPLE start looking around the side of the house, walking away. The MAN and the BOY get up, dash through the treeline and disappear into the woods. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
.A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky and the outlines of trees as they set off through the woods, sleepy, stumbling like drunks now. They hear a hideous SHRIEK in the distance, coming from the house. They stop, hearing another SHRIEK and a MAN'S SCREAMING. The MAN holds the BOY close and tries to cover the BOY's ears as they stare and wait for-it to pass. 
MAN. We'll be safe soon. 
BOY. They're going to eat those people aren't they, Papa? The MAN does not answer.

NEIL Go get it! 
NORMAN He can't fetch it, y'know. ParaNorman 19. 
21 CONTINUED: (2) 21 
NEIL Yeah well, it's still fun. Good boy! Bring it back! Go get it, Bub! Good boy! CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his feet and he bends down to pick it up. 
NEIL (CONT'D) Why don't you try? 
NORMAN `Cos I don't really, uh... You can go. 
NEIL No, no, it's fun! Try it! 
NORMAN No I don't want to. 
NEIL You throw it. It's really easy. 
NORMAN No it's okay. You can throw it. 
NEIL No, c'mon, it's really fun. 
NORMAN Here. You go first. 
NEIL No, you try it. I already went like fifty times. 
NORMAN Okay, what do I do? 
NEIL You get the stick, you pull it back, and you throw it! 
Norman throws it and accidentally hits Neil in the head, knocking him over. 
NORMAN Neil? Sorry! As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back GIGGLING, the stick held between his teeth. 
NEIL I fetched it! ParaNorman 20. 
21 CONTINUED: (3) 21 CLOSE ON NORMAN, as a smile creeps across his face and he starts to LAUGH. 
NORMAN Are you okay? CUT WIDE as the two kids enjoy their play, the sun above them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky. 
INT. MR PRENDERGHAST'S HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT 
PANTING and WHEEZING, Mr Prenderghast staggers into his study, SLAMS the door behind him and heads for his desk. 
MR PRENDERGHAST I'll show him, and that scary little fat kid... He shakily rummages around the collected papers and trinkets, and pulls out the leather bound book, all the time GRUMBLING crazily. 
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) Doesn't he realize we're running out of t... With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest, then keels over backwards, stiffly hitting the floor with a THUMP. Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of him, sculpting his shape in the air. With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit back in, and he staggers back to his feet. 
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D) No! Not yet! Not yet! He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down onto the ground. The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body. He blinks his eyes, looking around as if he's just been woken from a deep sleep, then down at the defunct body lying at his feet.

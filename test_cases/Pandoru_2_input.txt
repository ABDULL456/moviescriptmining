GALLO You are that's left of us. Good luck, God bless... and God's speed.

PAYTON Earth... is gone? GALLO puffs across his hand with twisted amusement. 
GALLO Wiped away. We ran a full sweep off the grid and they were... gone. One day there, the next... nothing. 
PAYTON In one day... it had to be nuclear or-? 
GALLO Whatever it was, they knew it was coming. Wished us well. We're all that's left. PAYTON sits back in shock, shaking his head in disbelief. 
PAYTON Oh my God... 
GALLO You can see why I was hesitant... to tell even you. My fellow crew members didn't take the news too well. I wanted to wake the primary crew... but my 2nd Lt was already over the edge.

GALLO (CONT'D) ODS came through with flying colors. No logic, no reasoning left. No future, no past, no hope. A dangerous mix when you're stuck inside a tin can like this. The blow was more then he could handle. My lieutenant wasn't far behind. Pandorum.

LELAND moves past a wall-drawing of Earth destroyed, moving to the image of the three pilots. 
LELAND Three little Indians, with the burden to bare... no more law and nothing left to care. Three poor souls, destiny undone. Chop, chop, chop... now there's only one. The sketches reveal violence between the three pilots, two of them killed, one remaining alive.

GALLO'S hands are beginning to tremble as he struggles through the story. 
GALLO They were my commanding officers. Men who had guided me through FT. I looked up to these men. But... it wasn't them anymore. They... were gone. They... tried to... I had no choice. I- With his body beginning to tremble, PAYTON tries to console him, touching his arm. GALLO flinches. 
PAYTON Easy...

LELAND continues across the wall-drawings, showing the one remaining pilot all alone aboard the massive ship. 
LELAND One little Indian left... all alone with his doom.

LELAND (CONT`D) Refused to go to bed, stayed up to play in his room. Oh, and what naughty little games he would play with the slumbering prey. Slayer, master, both God and the Devil, some would say. The boy would grow to manhood, a self-proclaimed King, ruler of his vessel, home to his own sin. The sketches show the lone pilot torturing and devouring passengers from their sleep chambers as he grows old. 
LELAND (CONT-D) And then one day the king cast out all those who had behaved, exiled into the barren cargo holds to fend for themselves... scavenging against the others within their own domain. The sketches show tortured victims forced out into the corridors of the ship, the King returns to his sleep chamber. 
LELAND (CONT`D) King Lonely no longer wanted to play... he yearned to see the morning Sun on a Tanis day. He returned to his bed of 
I slumber, waiting for the day. But the survivors lived on, as the King slept, a whole new world of evil grew as we wept. The seed driven beyond-

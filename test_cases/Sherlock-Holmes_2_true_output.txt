Watson runs round the end of the building and sees Holmes scrambling under the half-built hull. Dredger in pursuit. 
64A                                                               64A EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - SLIPWAY A police WHISTLE echoes through the air.   Dredger turns for a moment, just long enough for -- 
Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway. 
Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering another chock. It's the last straw for the support mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak. 
64B   EXT. FABRICATION SHED                                       64B 
From his vantage point, Watson can see what's coming. 
WATSON Holmes! 
65    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      65 
Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship EXPLODE BACKWARDS -- 
-- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding down towards them. 
66    EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       66 
Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers -- 
-- Holmes charges into Dredger again, pulling him backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard. 
Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his head, as the leviathan roars down towards him. 
The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over him. He's doomed. And... 
The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as -- 
66A                                                                66A EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the half-launched ship. 
The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle and crack with the weight of the tethered ship. 
A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and... 
The timber finally gives way.   The ship is free again, falling through the air -- Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a sound like the side of the world being torn off -- 
-- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a vast, frothy explosion of water. 
Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds. A quiet beat. 
Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet, but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of him and he sags back to the ground. 
Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they find: (CONTINUED) 
66A   CONTINUED:                                                  66A Nothing.   No blood or trace.   The big man is gone. 
The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene. They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and Watson. 
Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn. 
67    INT. LONDON JAIL - MORNING                                    67 
The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled. 
Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change here and there. 
Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking his head. 
WATSON I haven't slept all night. I deserve this... I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail. 
Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's handkerchief. 
HOLMES (theatrically indignant) You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self- defense. 
Watson shakes the notebook in Holmes' face. 
WATSON I've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and I've come to the conclusion that I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration. 
(CONTINUED) 
67   CONTINUED:                                                   67 WATSON (CONT'D) Why else would I continually allow myself to be led into situations where you're deliberately withholding your intentions from me? 
HOLMES You've never complained about my methods before. 
WATSON I'm not complaining... I never complain... I never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on fire! 
HOLMES That was an accident... 
Watson challenges him with a look. 
HOLMES The first time WAS an accident... 
BIG MAN (O.S.) Remember me, boys? Put me away for robbery a few years back? 
Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous- looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face. 
HOLMES Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London. 
Watson snaps at the man. 
WATSON Who could forget that face? I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us! 
Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and drops Brownlee without missing a beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
54A. 67   CONTINUED: (2)                                               67 WATSON (to Holmes) Nor am I complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog. 
HOLMES Gladstone's my dog as well.   It's in the interest of science. 
WATSON What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary. 
HOLMES Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive.

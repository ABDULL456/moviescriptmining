She fires again. 
CHARLY Where's Henessey...? 
INT. ROOT CELLAR - WITH HENESSEY 
The detective lies naked, bound hand and foot. Beaten. FREEZING. A single ray of LIGHT through a tiny crack. 
He hears a SPLINTERING noise, as if a door's been ripped from its hinges. Pause -- A FUSILLADE of gunfire. Shouts, cries. A heavy weight SLAMS to the floorboards above him. Through a crack comes a tiny stream of BLOOD, dribbling onto him, as -- 
EXT. OLD MILL - SAME TIME 
TIMOTHY bolts from the house, clutching a bleeding hand. Running hellbent for leather. Reaches a parked car. Leaps in and kicks over the engine as, behind him -- 
MORE MEN come piling out of the house, shouting. Running for their cars -- never make it. CUT DOWN IN THEIR TRACKS. Wracked by gunfire, bodies twitching... 
And as Timothy PEELS OUT, spraying mud, we pull UP, UP, AND AWAY... Into the sky, moving ever higher, gunfire fading... Until now we're WAY UP, we can see Timothy's car... the OLD MILL, ever so tiny below us... 
It blows to pieces. Sends flaming boards flying STRAIGHT UP AT US. 
INT. VICTORIAN BUILDING - CHAPTER HQ - NIGHTTIME 
The door bursts open as PERKINS stalks in, shedding his coat. His aide -- let's call him HARRY -- looks up nervously. 
PERKINS This can't happen, Harry. The President's already up at night, prowling his sock drawer for double agents, and now we've got a fucking rogue on our hands. 
HARRY Sir, there's someone in the conference room to see you. 
PERKINS Oh, for the love of Christ, who can be so fucking important? 
He throws open a door off the passage: THERE'S TIMOTHY. Perched on the edge of a conference table, tamping a pack of smokes. Perkins reacts, stunned. 
TIMOTHY It's me, your poor black cousin. The one you can't be seen with. 
PERKINS *You*...! Are you crazy, coming here?? 
TIMOTHY (Lights a cigarette) My boss is dead. 
PERKINS What...? 
TIMOTHY Your rogue bitch just took him out. Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too. 
He blows smoke. Trains his eyes on the older man. Piercing. 
TIMOTHY We're still on, Perkins. I've got the tanker, the chemist, all ready to go... but you gotta contain her, man. We gotta step on her hard and fast. 
An agent on the SWITCHBOARD calls out: 
SWITCHBOARD You have a call on line three, sir. 
PERKINS Who is it? 
SWITCHBOARD Charly Baltimore, sir. 
Perkins stops dead. Lunges for the phone, nearly drops it: 
PERKINS Perkins. 
INTERCUT - OUR HEROINE AT PAY PHONE 
We only see her mouth. Set in hard, grim lines. She says: 
CHARLY It's cold, I want to come in. 
PERKINS Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm going to direct you to a safe house, get you on a plane -- 
CHARLY Can the bullshit, I'm not telling you where I am. I'll come in for a full debriefing, but we do it my way. 
PERKINS Charly, you're being paranoid. It's not like it used to be, you're eight years out of date. 
CHARLY Do tell. 
PERKINS Congress won't authorize a dime, Charly. Chapter's on the way out, we've been reduced to a records- keeping agency, we *don't have enough money to kill you*, understand...? 
CHARLY Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets. We do things my way. 
PERKINS Your way, I see. And if I say go to hell? 
CHARLY From where I stand, it ain't much of a commute. You'll hear from me. 
She clicks off. Perkins darts a look at the techie -- guy shakes his head, no go on the trace. Perkins swears. 
PERKINS She mustn't threaten our success. Contain her, whatever it takes. But be *careful*. If it gets out you're working for me... we'll both be grabbing our ankles on the White House lawn. 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY - NIGHT 
There. Thank you, New Jersey, that'll be all. You can go now. Um, please.

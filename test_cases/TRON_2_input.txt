ALAN V.0. TRON... TRON... Location query... location query... Confirm. 
TRON Confirmed, Alan-One. 
ALAN (sigh of relief) There you are... look, before we get cut off again... 
In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting, transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a bright light at the center. 
We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the others dim. 
ALAN (V.0.) I'm going to put some new coding on your-disk, so you can get into the memory core of the Master Control... when you get there... 
As Alan's voice continues, we 
CUT TO: 
403  INT. DUMONT'S. CENTRAL CHAMBER                               403 
A SHOT OF THE de-rezzing door. The dissolving section has expanded, and we can start to see the guards inside. 
404  INT. COMMUNICATION CHAMBER                                   404 
The light increases in brilliance, as we hear Alan's voice fading out, consumed by static. 
ALAN (V.0.) search all password code series 
TRON Wait! I can't hear... 
He stops. 
The voice is gone. The beam continues to bathe Tron in its glow, and gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It slowly descends, Tron raises his hands to catch it, gripping it, pulls it down and stares at it. 
CUT TO: 
405  POV - THE DISK                                               405 
It is glowing with a new power. Superimposed on its surface is a complex mandala pattern, changing kaleidoscopically as we watch, shifting swirling liquid color. 
CUT TO: 
406  OMIT                                                         406 
407  THE DOOR                                                     407 
Almost gone. We can hear the voices of Sark's men outside. 
YORI (V.0.) Dumont! The door... 
408  YORI                                                         408 
turning back to Dumont. Behind Dumont stands Tron, framed in the entry to the Communication chamber. 
409  OMIT                                                         409 
410  SHOT OF DUMONT                                               410 
He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming winglike supports for the fabric. 
DUMONT I have waited for this moment many thousands of cycles. It is time for the new order to begin... The Users are waiting. 
As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly. Then he holds out his hand to Yori. 
411  LONG SHOT as Yori steps forward up the steps.                411 
CUT TO: 
412  EXT. CHAMBER - THE DOOR                                      412 
We see it is almost transparent, and as we watch, there is a burst of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots of light. 
CUT TO: 
413  INT. CHAMBER - THE DOOR                                      413 
It dissolves completely. Framed in the center of the opening, stands Sark. 
SARK (pointing) Dumont! 
The blue warriors race by him, pouring into the chamber. 
CUT TO: 
414  FULL SHOT - CHAMBER                                          414 
We see Dumont standing on the top of the steps, no sign of Tron and Yori. The guards spread out through the room, Sark strides towards Dumont. 
SARK Where's the program? 
DUMONT (dotty-old-man act) Program? I'm sure you're mistaken. 
414A CLOSE SHOT - SARK                                            414 
furious.

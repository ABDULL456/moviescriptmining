Resentfully, Sidney moves about the room.  Sensing the silent accusation against him, he is aggressive. 
SIDNEY You know, Sally, sometimes I get the impression you think you live in Star-Bright Park.  This is life, kid - get used to it! 
Sidney comes to the phone on her desk.  He dials.  Then he glances swiftly at Sally and, carrying the phone, walks into the bedroom, dragging the long cord behind him. 
INT. BEDROOM 
When the phone comes alive, Sidney pushes the bedroom door shut.  The gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make it.  Keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard in the other room, he says: 
SIDNEY (to phone) Nikko, is Mr. Hunsecker there? This is Mr. Falco.  Well, have him call me as soon as he can.  It's important. 
He sets the phone down on the bedside table, looks at it thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door, opens it and goes back into the office. 
INT. OFFICE 
Sidney stands on the threshold, studying Sally.  His manner is now more sympathetic as he asks: 
SIDNEY Did you send my folks in Philly the check...? 
SALLY Yes. 
Leaving the bedroom door open, Sidney comes up to her, watches her shrewdly, cautiously. 
SIDNEY (softly) I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie... 
SALLY (low-voiced) I know you do, Sidney. 
SIDNEY Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved... 
Sally is putting paper in the typewriter, trying to hold her head up. 
SALLY I'm not judging... 
Sidney comes closer to her.  He puts his hand on the nape of her neck, carrassing her.  Under his touch, the girl is unhappy, and yet at the same time, responsive.  Sidney still has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame. Feeling her relaxed, Sidney bends and kisses her on the side of the throat with more than negligence, for something about her always excites him; his aggression tune in with her submissiveness. 
SALLY (pathetically) I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you... 
SIDNEY (murmuring) That's no way to talk... 
SALLY Or what you see in me, for that matter... 
SIDNEY Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc. 
SALLY If you want me to - 
The phone in the bedroom rings.  Sidney, reacting sharply, forgets his advances to Sally as he turns towards the bedroom. 
SIDNEY (exhilarated) You see?  Hunsecker's gotta phone ME! 
He goes into the bedroom, closing the door as he goes. Sally looks at the closed door. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Sidney has picked up the phone. 
SIDNEY (calmly) Hello, J.J....I presume you saw the Elwell smear. (smiling) No, no medals - not yet.  Oh, it's worse than that - Aunty Van Cleve is firing them...from the horse's mouth... They were just here - in a panic... 
INT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - THE STUDY - DAY 
Hunsecker wears a dressing gown as he sits at his breakfast table.  Behind him are the big glass windows to the terrace overlooking the Manhattan skyline.  The papers are at Hunsecker's elbow; his manner is crisp and cold: 
HUNSECKER Who was just there? (then) You'll be the death of me.  Sidalee! Why?  Didn't you just tell me that they've already traced this smear to you?  All they have to do now is to put two and two together and I'm a chicken in a pot! 
RESUME SIDNEY'S APARTMENT 
Sidney smiles confidently, answers calmly: 
SIDNEY J.J., peace on earth, good will to men - it's working out just the way I planned.  Yeah, I guarantee this bomb will pop right on schedule, but you have to play your part - you be a Saint and let me be the Devil.  But I wanna talk to you first... 
RESUME HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE 
Hunsecker pauses, eyes full of cold voltage. 
HUNSECKER Don't come here.  Susie is up and about. (listening) He called her?  You'd better see me at the TV - three o'clock. 
He bangs down the phone, tense thought in his manner. 
INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT 
Sally is busy with her typing again, but in a depressed mood when Sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down on her desk again.  He seems satisfied with himself, smug. Sally watches him for a moment.  Then: 
SALLY What are you going to do? 
Sidney prepares to leave the apartment.  His tone is full of confidence, self-assertive.  (For once Sidney is certain that he is smarter, more cunning than even Hunsecker). 
SIDNEY (the wise one) Chickie, a lotta people think they're smart.  You watch.  They're dumb: they'll do the work for me! Just watch. 
Sidney makes for the door, goes out. 
INT. CIGAR STAND - LOBBY 
Susan buys paper - DOLLY with her - toward elevator - she gets in. 
INT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM 
J.J. has not moved; he is thoughtful and morose.  Nikko, the Japanese butler, comes in to remove the breakfast table. 
HUNSECKER The table can wait.  No calls.  I have to think about my TV show. 
NIKKO Pleased to do.  I will come back later. HUNSECKER (abruptly) Did you put the bread out on the terrace for the birds? 
NIKKO Yes, but they don't come no more this time of year. 
Smiling, Nikko leaves.  Hunsecker picks up a pencil and makes a note on a pad, about birds no doubt.  Abruptly he looks up, calling: 
HUNSECKER Susie!  Come in a minute, dear... 
She has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room.  She comes forward to him; her manner is serious and wary.  His act is one of a tasteful Mammy singer, but he is watchful, too. 
HUNSECKER Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today. 
SUSAN Why? 
HUNSECKER What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand... 
SUSAN (pausing) Did Sidney tell you about it?

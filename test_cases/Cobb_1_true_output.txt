Cobb smiles. He loves it when someone stands up to him. He thrives on confrontation. COBB I've killed a man. STUMP Fine, then put me outta my fuckin' misery. I'm freezing. 
Cobb hands the gun to Stump. COBB Here ya go, Stumpy. I like a man who stands up to me. Stump holds the gun awkwardly, not knowing what to do. 
COBB Now give me the keys.   I'm driving. 
CUT TO: 
43   EXT. HIGHWAY TO RENO - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)                    43 
The car races down the mountain -- a wild ride. 
44   INT. CAR IN BLIZZARD - NIGHT                                44 Cobb at the wheel is perfectly happy and at peace. Stump, in the passenger's seat, braces himself for certain death. 
COBB It's only another hour -- plenty of time to tell you my story before we find us some women. 
STUMP Women?   Plural? 
COBB Some for you, some for me. We'll have a helluva time. The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump. STUMP (muttering) Dear God... And Cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain, every curve risking death. He seems at peace with the world -- in the driver's seat, literally, on the edge of being utterly out of control. COBB I suppose you want to know about my childhood. Writers usually do. STUMP None of this 'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen' stuff -- COBB My philosophy is simply this   -- Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man's friends shouldn't mind what he does  or says, and those who are not  his friends, well, to hell with  'em. And Cobb drifts into a story of his youth. He's suddenly so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road. 
COBB I was born in a small town in Georgia, of course... my sweet sister Florence still lives there... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                     44 COBB (CONT"D) (beat) And I started playing baseball when I was a kid like everybody else only I was better than every- body else. When I was seventeen I started playing for money -- my father didn't approve. (beat) He was a great man... 
45   EXT. HIGHWAY                                                   45 As the snow whirls around the car hurtling down the mountain, the snowflakes FILL the SCREEN and turn to confetti as we: DISSOLVE TO: 
46   EXT. ROYSTON (GEORGIA) - DAY (1900) (B&W)                      46 Confetti falls from the sky -- PROFESSOR COBB, 40, Ty's father, waves to the crowd in front of city hall. Signs everywhere declare him to be the newly elected MAYOR COBB. A band plays "Sweet Georgia Brown" as the Mayor makes a victory speech. COBB (V.O.) He was the mayor, they were grooming him for governor, he was a learned man, a professor, and the Head Deacon in the Baptist Church. 
47   INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY (B&W)                                47 Professor Cobb sings loudly with the Deacons behind the Pastor as the CONGREGATION joins in. CONGREGATION (sings loudly) 'There is a fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Emmanuel's veins...' 
CLOSE ON TY'S MOTHER 
Very young and pretty, singing in the Congregation. And young Ty next to her, also singing at the top of his voice. (CONTINUED) 
47   CONTINUED:                                                     47 COBB (V.O.) My mother was the most beautiful woman in the county... she married my father when she was twelve which was the way they used to do it. (beat) And she taught me to believe in the hymns we sang... I especially liked the bloody ones... (singing the hymn) 'And sinners plunged beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains...' 
48   EXT. RIVER IN GEORGIA - DAY (B&W)                              48 Young Ty Cobb is baptized in the river. COBB (V.O.) I remember after I was baptized and I was walking home with my pals... 
49   EXT. TRAIN TRACK IN RURAL GEORGIA - DAY (B&W)                  49 Young Ty and three buddies walk along the track. COBB (V.O.) I was feeling very Christian, ready to live the good life -- my father didn't drink, smoke, gamble or chase women -- and I wasn't going to either -- 
The boys skip rocks and start across a trestle bridge. COBB (V.O.) ... when all of a sudden a train was coming at us. 
POV SHOT - TRAIN 
headed right for the boys. COBB (V.O.) There I was, a newly baptized child of God who hadn't hardly sinned, and I was gonna die. (CONTINUED) 
49   CONTINUED:                                                    49 BACK TO SCENE 
The other other boys leap safely into the river, well ahead of the oncoming train. But young Ty stays on the tracks. 
COBB (V.O.) The engine bore down on me till I could see the whites of the engineer's eyes -- I was thrilled... 
CLOSE ON ENGINEER 
He pulls the WHISTLE and screams at the young boy standing defiantly on the track. 
CLOSE ON YOUNG COBB His face filled with excitement as the space between him and the engine reduces to nothing. 
NEW ANGLE Closer and closer the engine comes -- 50 yards, 25 yards, 10, five, four, three... moments before death -- Young Ty Cobb leaps to safety, flying in front of the engine, out over the water till he splashes, mere milli- seconds before he would have been crushed to death.

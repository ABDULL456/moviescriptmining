He turns to look at Bluepoint. 
. . . And it ain't just business. 
Caspar looks at Bluepoint.  Bluepoint's eyes bare into Tom. 
Bluepoint This guy's lying. 
Tom shrugs. 
Tom Why would I? 
Bluepoint This guy's wrong.  This guy's all wrong.  Mink is clean and this clown is a smart guy. 
Caspar is still staring at Bluepoint, no longer smiling. 
Caspar Easy enough to find out, ain't it?  You find Mink, bring him back here. 
He nods at Tom. 
. . . You go down to the car.  I'll send Frankie and Tic-Tac with you to the Royale.  If Bernie's there, Frankie and Tic-Tac'll take care of him. 
Bluepoint And if he's not there? 
Tom shrugs. 
Tom I'll sit facing the corner in a funny hat. 
38.  CUT TO: INT   CAR 
Tom sits behind the wheel of the parked car; we are an his profile. 
Tom's face is rigidly set; we don't know why as we watch him for a short beat. 
BAM--with a loud impact Bernie Bernheim's face is slammed against the driver's window.  Tom still faces forward. 
Bernie is wailing as he is muscled back away from the window by two topcoated torsos--their faces above the car window. 
They muscle Bernie out of frame towards the rear of the car and we hear the back door being opened. 
Bernie's voice, off, is near hysteria: 
Bernie Frankie, let me go, I'm prayin' to ya, Jesus God- -Tom!  Jesus! 
As Frankie and Tic-Tac pile Bernie into the back, we continue to hold on Tom's face.  He still does not react. 
Bernie . . . Are you part of this?!  You can't be part of this!  I think these guys're gonna whack me! You gotta talk to 'em, Tommy! 
Frankie You gimme a headache, you little sheeny. 
To Tom: 
Tic-Tac Okay, we're going to Miller's Crossing. 
Tom still doesn't react.  There is a beat of Bernie's crying. Finally: 
Frankie . . . Lets go! 
As Tom reaches forward and starts the car: 
Bernie You're not part of this!  Tom!  Help me!  These guys are gonna whack me! 
Tic-Tac Whack you inna mouth you don't shut up. 
39.  MILLER'S CROSSING   WIDE 
Day.  A wooded area outside of town.  The wind blows. 
The car pulls into frame and stops on the shoulder.  The backseat passengers--Frankie, Tic-Tac and Bernie--emerge; Tom remains in the driver's seat. 
Bernie is weeping, loudly; he has lost control.  Frankie takes out a gun and whacks him smartly on the side of his head.  The blow sends him stumbling over towards Tic-Tac, who kicks him down. 
The blows haven't quelled Bernie's sobbing. 
Tic-Tac I don't want you runnin' anywhere. 
Frankie takes a swig from his flask and hands it to Tic- Tac, who leans in the car window. 
INT    CAR 
Tom gazes forward, jaw set, eyes off the doings outside. 
As Tic-Tac hands his gun in through the window: 
Tic-Tac Okay.  Take him in the woods and whack him. 
Tom Huh?  I don't. . . 
Tic-Tac Yeah, that's right, the boss wants you to do it. Make sure you're with the good guys. 
Tom stares dumbly at the gun.  Tic-Tac holds it, grip towards Tom, motionless. 
After a beat he takes the gun. 
Tic-Tac You know how to do this, right?  You gotta remember to put one in his brain.  Your first shot puts him down, then you put one in his brain.  Then he's dead, then we go home. 
Tom opens his door. 
WIDE   EXT 
Bernie is still on the ground, sobbing, not responding to Frankie who prods him with his foot. 
Frankie Get up. 
Bernie I can't get up!  I can't get up! 
Frankie drags him to his feet. 
Frankie Get up and walk, you chiselin' little yid. 
He pushes him towards the woods and reaches for the whiskey flask. 
Bernie stumbles off; Tom follows him.

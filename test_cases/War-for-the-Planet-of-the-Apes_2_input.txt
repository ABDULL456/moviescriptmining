HANDHELD SHOT - PEEKING THROUGH THE TREES 
As we move closer, we discover we are at the edge of -- 
A DESERTED R.V. PARK 
Old campers lined up, long-since abandoned. Smoke billows from a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of a rusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
REVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA 
spying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. They exchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp? They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when -- 
A LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest. 
He's mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops in his tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then, very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood: 
MAN I'm just gonna... put this down -- 
He drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to his shoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUST MISSES MAURICE, when -- 
BANG!   THE MAN DROPS DEAD.   Stunned, the apes turn to see -- 
CAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at the man he's just killed. The others regard Caesar's grim, steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack of remorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows something has broken within him. A line has been crossed. 
Finally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of their stares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man. 
The others join him, looking down at the body. The tattered rags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn by the human soldiers. "A" is crudely tattooed on his arm. 
LUCA [Is he out here alone?] 
ROCKET [Maybe he's a deserter?] 
Caesar doesn't respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTED CRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM... 
CUT TO: 
BLACKNESS 
Suddenly a door is ripped open, and light spills in; we are -- 
INT. RUSTED-OUT AIRSTREAM - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
The faces of the apes slowly appear, gazing warily in at us; Caesar and Rocket have their guns drawn. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
They stalk silently into the dim space, eyes roaming... It's long and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed and littered with improvised survivalist essentials. 
We MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through the claustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place a human might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward... 
A CLOSED DOOR 
at the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tense looks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door! 
ON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as he sees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL -- 
A LITTLE GIRL 
cowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lower bunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A little waif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildly matted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at -- 
Caesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing through his veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him, shocked at what they see. 
Finally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar's gun, gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but still shows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, to the others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them: 
CAESAR Look around. Take what we can use. 
Caesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasy look, then follow. 
But Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with a mixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on the floor by the bed, starts to move toward it... 
Terrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawing as far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hoot as he reaches down to the floor and retrieves -- 
A CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates -- then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it. 
Maurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her. She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... as his finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll's head. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
She blinks up, studying him, fear ebbing; she opens her mouth to speak, but no words come, just GENTLE, GASPING GRUNTS... 
CUT TO: 
A DUSTY COMPASS IN A BATTERED OLD LOCKBOX 
REVEAL LUCA picking it up, as he, Caesar and Rocket search the trailer. Luca sees a PAIR OF BINOCULARS in the box; he takes them too, along with some FLASHLIGHTS. 
Impatient, Caesar looks back, wondering where Maurice is -- when Maurice appears in the doorway, the Girl visible behind him, staring out curiously. Maurice signs to Caesar: 
MAURICE [Something wrong with her.   I don't think she can speak.] 
Caesar looks coldly at the Girl, then back to Maurice:

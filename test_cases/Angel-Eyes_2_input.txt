SHARON What's up with you? 
LARRY JR. They won't let me watch T.V. 
SHARON Oh. Well... let's pretend this is T.V. It's a show about a party. 
They look about the room. 
SHARON (as if it's a secret) That man... is really a super hero. 
LARRY JR. Is not. 
SHARON Is too. And so is she. Look. See? Red tights under her dress... Oh-oh, that man gave her a drink with something in it. 
LARRY JR. With what? 
SHARON With stuff to make her sleep. He's a bad guy. 
The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting into it. 
LARRY She drank it. 
SHARON Watch. She'll fall down any minute. 
The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his father. Larry puts the boy down near the door. 
LARRY Hey, sport, you should go play outside. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He turns to Sharon. 
LARRY Stay away from my family. 
Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without humor, speaking loudly. 
LARRY Hey, everybody, keep it down. Somebody might call the police. 
There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now. Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low. 
SHARON What're you doing? 
LARRY (to crowd) Once the cops leave, we can really party. 
The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns back to Sharon. 
LARRY Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home? 
In the hushed tension that follows, a GLASS falls and SHATTERS, and more people quiet down and stare. Sharon looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support there. Angry and shaken, she turns to the door. 
She walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, starts to close the door behind her,    and she stops, take takes a breath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt and anger. She looks at that     nearly-closed door. She pushes it open and walks back    in. 
We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the crowd, searching until she sees her Father. She heads toward him. He sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her. She follows him. We see Larry and his Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward the kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen, leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow them. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON Don't walk away. Okay? 
He acts as if he just noticed her. 
FATHER What? 
She gestures toward his hearing aid. 
SHARON Is it working?     Do you need to check it? 
He absently touches the device. 
FATHER It's fine. 
SHARON Dad... 
But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper. 
LARRY What the hell are you doing?! 
MOTHER Sharon, please. 
SHARON Please? Please what?! Will you stop protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don't talk to your father. Don't bother your father! 
She turns to her dad. 
SHARON I'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad. Okay? Can you handle that? 
Larry advances on her. 
LARRY Just get the hell out... 
And she turns on him in a fury that halts him.

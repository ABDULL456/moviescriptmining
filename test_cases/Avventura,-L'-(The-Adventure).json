{"train": "L'avventura (The Adventure) \nscript by Michelangelo Antonioni Elio Bartolini Tonino Guerra \ntranslated by Louis Brigante \nIt is the afternoon of a summer's day. Anna, a twenty-five-year-old brunette, comes out from the entrance of a stately building and walks along a pathway that leads up to a dirt road. She is in a great hurry and becomes a little annoyed and surprised at seeing her father, a meticulously dressed and elderly gentleman, standing near the curb busily talking to his chauffeur in front of a black British car. \nANNA So, there you are... I've been upstairs looking all over for you... \nThere is a moment of silence during which Anna's father deliberately ignores her presence. She stares at him intently, trying to determine his mood and wondering how she is going to tell him what she has to say before she leaves. Finally, he turns around and faces her. \nFATHER Oh, I thought you were already on the high seas. \nAnna is barely able to control her temper, but realizing that the discussion is about to take the usual sarcastic turn, she immediately checks herself. \nANNA No, not yet, Dad. \nHer father fixes her with a long ironic look. Conscious of his daughter's haste, he is apparently trying his best to detain her. \nFATHER Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht? \nANNA No, Dad, it isn't. \nThere is another moment of silence. Meanwhile, a car has pulled up on the other side of the road. It is Claudia, a twenty-four-year-old blonde and a friend of Anna's. Both she and the driver get out of the car and remain discreetly in the background, waiting for the conversation to end. Anna's father resumes speaking, after a cursory nod to Claudia who, in turn, responds with a polite but half-hearted smile. \nFATHER And how long will you be away? \nANNA Four or five days. \nFATHER (resignedly) Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now. \nAnna glares at him furiously but still manages to restrain herself. \nANNA Used to what? \nFATHER To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father. \nANNA (protestingly and with a deep sense of compassion) But how could you say such a thing? \nFATHER Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter. \nANNA And have you any other truths to tell me? \nFATHER You already know what they are. \nANNA You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad. \nShe kisses him on the cheek but the father remains unmoved. It is obvious that he still has something else he wants to say to her. In fact, after gazing upon his daughter with a certain amount of pity, he finally does say it. \nFATHER That type will never marry you, my child. \nAnna has a difficult time restraining herself but manages somehow to keep calm as she answers. \nANNA Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him. \nSANDRO But your friend is waiting downstairs. \nANNA She'll wait. \nAnna turns around and presses herself up against him with such a violent passion that Sandro is somewhat dismayed. But only for an instant. Soon they are feverishly kissing each other, and it is almost with a sense of sheer animal pleasure that Sandro abandons himself. \nMeanwhile, left alone, Claudia is pacing back and forth outside in front of the building. She is bored and obviously tired of waiting. Then, as she is about to cross over to the other side of the street, she sees Sandro and Anna coming out of the doorway. The expression on Anna's face hasn't changed -- she appears sad and gloomy. But Claudia doesn't take note of it; she is too busy fuming over Anna's lack of consideration, eager to let them both understand that she is sick and tired of waiting around. \nAs Sandro opens the window of the car, which is pointed towards Milan, he says to Claudia: \nSANDRO I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone. \nCLAUDIA (glancing first at Sandro and then at Anna) That seems to apply to you also... \nMeanwhile, the driver has taken Anna's suitcase out of the black car and puts it into Sandro's. Claudia picks up her own suitcase and is about to do the same but Sandro intervenes and takes it from her. \nSANDRO Don't be so humble. \nCLAUDIA How should I be ... arrogant? \nSANDRO But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you? \nWhile this exchange was going on, Anna has already climbed into Sandro's car. Sandro follows and takes his place at the wheel; Claudia gets in alongside him. The car takes off at high speed. \nHeading south along a state highway, Sandro's car is traveling at high speed over a straight open road. It is twilight and as the evening shadows begin to fall, the surrounding countryside is bathed in an aura of mystery. \nInside the car Anna, Claudia and Sandro sit in complete silence. Anna is deeply absorbed in her own thoughts. Claudia is looking out of the window, enthralled by the dark beauty of the landscape. Another car draws up alongside of Sandro's and is about to pass him. But Sandro steps on the accelerator and pulls ahead with a tremendous burst of speed. The other car lags behind and then turns off at a crossroad. However, Sandro makes no attempt to slow down. In fact, spurred on by what has now become a definitely hostile atmosphere, he drives even faster. \nAs Sandro suddenly switches on the headlights, the violent glare that polarizes the roadside cuts off Claudia's view. She turns to Sandro with a look of disappointment \nCLAUDIA It was lovelier before. \nTo please her, Sandro turns the headlights off and once again the countryside is covered by a veil of thick but romantic shadows. \nSANDRO Like this? \nNow Claudia again peers out at the landscape -- but only for an instant. Sandro abruptly turns the headlights on again, revealing a sharp curve in the road up ahead, only about a hundred yards away. He quickly shifts into lower gear, and the car swerves slightly. The sudden shift from fourth to third gear causes the motor to emit a sound that resembles a cry. The car races swiftly towards the curve, getting closer and closer. But at such high speed it appears impossible the car will be able to make the turn. Further up ahead, where the curve fades, there is a stone wall that runs along the side of the road. At this point, even Anna is attentive, her eyes wide open. Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer. Fifty yards, forty, ten. All of a sudden, the headlights illuminate a large gap in the wall about three or four yards away, just on the other side of a small ditch that separates the road from the wall itself. There seems to be no other choice. With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall. The car comes to a sudden halt, but skids along on the muddy ground of an empty lot until it finally stops near the door of a small farmhouse in front of an old man. He is seated on a bench and has been observing the entire scene without budging an inch. \nThere is a brief pause -- silence. Then Sandro comes out of the car followed by Claudia and Anna. Claudia is visibly shaken. She leans up against the building for support, as though in search of something solid and dependable. She is also unnerved by the feeling that she is responsible for what has just happened. \nCLAUDIA It's all my fault! \nBut instead of reproaching her, Sandro turns to the old man and excuses himself for having broken into his property. Imperturbably, the old man looks up at him and says: \nOLD MAN And who do you think made that hole over there? \nEven before he has a chance to be surprised at the old man's remark, Sandro becomes aware that Anna is laughing. It is not the hysterical laugh that normally might be expected after such a close call. It is, instead a pure and simple laugh, almost a happy one, and leaves both Sandro and Claudia plainly baffled. \nCLAUDIA There's nothing much to laugh at. \nSANDRO And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed. \nAnna looks at them as she continues to laugh. \nANNA I'm sorry ... but I can't help laughing... \nOnce in the water, Anna starts swimming towards the island. The sailor at the helm slows the boat even more so as to keep it within Anna's range. Raimondo, meanwhile, has gotten his skin-diving equipment ready; around his waist he is tightening a belt to which a long knife is attached. The yacht continues to slow down. Sandro now dives into the water and starts swimming towards Anna. Claudia and Giulia are removing their clothes and they too get ready to go into the water. But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: \nCLAUDIA Stop ... stop the boat! \nThe motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt. A sailor places a ladder over the side of the boat. Claudia goes down the ladder, easing herself into the water. She moves away from the side of the yacht by swimming backwards. Giulia follows her down the ladder but stops on the last rung. \nGIULIA How's the water? \nSandro looks up and, pointing to the rocks at the highest part of the island, answers her. \nSANDRO Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed. \nGIULIA What has everybody got against me this morning? \nFrom inside the cabin, a feminine voice is heard shouting: \nPATRIZIA Raimondo! \nSolicitously, Raimondo goes over to the door of the cabin, from which Patrizia emerges wrapped in a filmy nightgown. She is a woman of great elegance, somewhere in her thirties. \nPATRIZIA Why have we stopped? \nRAIMONDO (kissing her hand) Lady Patrizia! \nThen, holding her by the hand, Raimondo leads her towards the prow, where Corrado greets her and likewise kisses her hand. \nCORRADO Aren't you going in for a swim, Patrizia? \nPATRIZIA What makes you think I would even dream of such a thing? Raimondo, why don't you go in for a dip? \nShe turns around to look at Raimondo and becomes somewhat startled to see him all rigged out in his diving equipment, complete with mask, spear-gun, etc. \nPATRIZIA Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater? \nRAIMONDO I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself. \nHe dives in. As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: \nRAIMONDO Who ever said that man was originally a creature of the sea! \nThen, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge. On deck, Patrizia peers out over the sea and covering her eyes to shade them from the sun, remarks: \nPATRIZIA I have never understood the islands. With all that water around them, poor things ... \nOut on the water, Sandro and Anna are almost at a standstill, keeping themselves afloat with only the slightest movement of their arms. Sandro is laughing and joking as though all this purely physical enjoyment of sun and water has freed him of all other cares. Anna tries to emulate him but is not entirely successful. Every now and then, her face becomes clouded with that same worried expression. \nANNA When do you have to go back? \nSANDRO I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily... \nANNA Then how come you're not with him? \nSANDRO What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful! \nHe is lying on his back in the water, with his eyes closed, his face to the sun, cradled in the gentle movement of the waves. Anna looks at him, then after a moment of silence, she says: \nBut Anna doesn't say a word. Instead, they both swim silently back to the yacht, where Claudia and Giulia are already climbing aboard. Patrizia comes out of the cabin to see what is happening. \nThey all lean over the side of the boat, looking down into the water, expecting the shark at any moment to come into view. But the water remains unruffled, the seaweed below is clearly visible, waving like so many fans. Even the rocks at the bottom can be seen with all sorts of small-gilled fish darting about. A mysterious, fascinating world and yet, because of what happened, one that arouses fear. Everyone aboard is silent. Until Anna and Sandro, followed by Raimondo, finally arrive and climb aboard. Sandro immediately takes Anna to her cabin, and the others follow, making various comments. \nCLAUDIA (to Anna) But how did you become aware of it? Did it touch you? \nAnna doesn't answer but continues on ahead amid the overlapping remarks. \nGIULIA I would have died. PATRIZIA ... and how ugly they are ... with all those teeth... \nCORRADO (shouting from the shore) What happened? \nGIULIA (shouting from the prow) There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are! \nCORRADO Who's moving? \nInside the cabin, which is partitioned into separate rooms, the general layout is neat and orderly, with a number of prints decorating the walls. Sandro and Anna, followed by Claudia, enter from the outside deck and cross over into Anna's room. It is extremely small, with two cots on one side and a long curtain that partially conceals a bureau from which several dresses are seen hanging. \nAnna is soaking wet in her bathing suit and her hair is all knotted into clusters that hang down over her face. Without bothering to dry herself, she crouches down on the cot and, assisted by Claudia, wraps a blanket around her body. Sandro and Claudia look at her with great concern. A member of the crew enters carrying a tray on which there is a half-filled glass of liquor, which Sandro takes and offers to Anna. \nSANDRO Here, drink some cognac. \nAnna positively refuses it, and the sailor leaves as Sandro sets the glass down on a shelf. Looking up at both Sandro and Claudia, Anna appears pleased with their solicitude. \nANNA It's nothing... really. Let's go back... It's all over now. \nA pause and then an instant later, she begins shivering under the blanket. \nANNA Only, I'd like to change. I'm a little cold. \nLeaving Anna and Claudia alone on their own, Sandro turns and goes outside the cabin where the others are still congregated, busy chattering. Among the remarks exchanged, one that is distinctly heard is Patrizia's. \nPATRIZIA But where did the shark go to? \nAs soon as Sandro closes the door to the cabin, Anna is suddenly and completely changed. She gets up from the cot, goes over to the curtain and draws it aside, revealing an array of feminine attire. Wondering which dress to choose, she finally selects two and tosses them on the cot. \nANNA Which one shall I wear? \nCLAUDIA (picking up one of the two dresses) This one is gorgeous. \nANNA Then why don't you try it on? \nAs Anna begins to dry herself with a large bath towel, Claudia slips on the dress and looks at herself in the mirror with a coquettish expression on her face. \nANNA It looks better on you than it does on me... You keep it. \nAnna is removing her bathing suit as she continues talking to Claudia with a tone and manner that reveal a sense of excitement mixed with one of amusement. \nANNA You know, that thing about the shark was all a joke. \nClaudia looks at her as though dumbfounded, as though she had never known her before. She is obviously piqued and angry, but more with herself than with Anna. \nCLAUDIA There's the difference between you and me: you know how to put over certain things, and I don't. Sometimes I envy you. \nAnna is all dressed and ready. She opens the door and steps outside, as Claudia follows behind. \nPATRIZIA What do you want, Raimondo? Do you want me? A few years ago, maybe... but now... And, then, at this hour of the day! \nComing down the steps that lead into the cabin, Claudia overhears the end of the conversation, and decides to withdraw. But Patrizia sees her and calls her back. \nPATRIZIA Come, Claudia, do come in... There's no romance going on here. \nClaudia enters. Raimondo continues to stare at Patrizia, particularly at her legs. Patrizia becomes aware that Raimondo is staring at her, and with a condescending gesture, she lifts her skirt a little higher to make him see better. \nPATRIZIA There, have you seen enough now? Are you satisfied? \nRaimondo nods yes. Claudia is amused by their behavior but also a little surprised. \nPatrizia calmly resumes her game and Raimondo again begins to stare at her. This time, at her breasts. And again Patrizia becomes conscious of the fact that he is staring at her. She assumes a bored attitude and looks up at the ceiling in a gesture of quiet forbearance. Raimondo reaches out with his hand and gently caresses Patrizia's breast. Claudia looks on in amazement. Raimondo withdraws his hand. \nPATRIZIA (regretfully) Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you... \nRAIMONDO If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue... \nPatrizia laughs at Raimondo's remark and looks at him sympathetically. Then she turns to Claudia. \nPATRIZIA Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo? \nCLAUDIA I would say he's pretty depraved. \nPATRIZIA Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child. \nRAIMONDO Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children. \nPATRIZIA You know, I don't love anybody. \nRAIMONDO (angrily) I know, dammit, I know! (turning to Claudia) And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness. \nRaimondo has such a disgruntled look on his face that Patrizia laughs. \nPATRIZIA He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia? \nCLAUDIA One would have to be in love with somebody to know that. \nPATRIZIA Have you ever been in love? \nCLAUDIA Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out? \nClaudia leaves the cabin and goes up to the deck. Patrizia returns to her game, and Raimondo continues to stare at her. \nAlong a narrow strip of beach on the island of Lisca Bianca, Sandro, Anna, Corrado and Giulia are waiting for Claudia to come ashore. There are some patches of vegetation growing here and there, but by and large the island is one huge rock with rugged cliffs which descend perpendicularly to the water. Jutting promontories give the place a sense of raw, primitive beauty. Seeing Anna and Sandro climbing a short distance up along the rocks to find a comfortable place where they can lie down and stretch themselves, Corrado remarks: \nCORRADO If any of you get into your bathing suits again, you can be sure we won't be seeing one another for the rest of the year. I just can't stand seeing anybody in the city after having seen them naked on the beach. \nThe yacht finally has arrived and the gangplank is laid out between the boat and the shore. Claudia descends and as she wades ashore she stops, bends over to dip her hand in the water, and with a tone of voice resembling that of a mother speaking to its newborn child, she pretends she is speaking with someone or something in the water. \nCLAUDIA Oh, how sweet... What a dear little darling! \nThey all turn around to look at her, wondering to whom or what she is referring. \nGIULIA Who are you talking to? \nSANDRO I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado? \nCORRADO I hope so. \nBreaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht. Claudia runs to the basket, picks up a peach and quickly bites into it. \nCLAUDIA How wonderful! \nCORRADO That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us. \nClaudia takes another peach from the basket and gives it to Corrado. \nCLAUDIA I think you're very sweet, Corrado. \nCORRADO More so than the shark? \nCLAUDIA There's no comparison. \nCORRADO Then why don't we go up and see the ruins? \nAnna and Sandro have left the group and are ensconced further up among the rocks, on a grassy slope overlooking the beach. \nANNA Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you. \nSANDRO You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety. \nANNA A little more so this time. \nSANDRO So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it. \nANNA (angrily) But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other? \nSANDRO There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time... \nANNA In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married? \nSANDRO But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough? \nANNA No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone. \nSANDRO But you just said that a month was too... \nANNA (interrupting) I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more. \nSANDRO And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then? \nANNA (angrily) There you go... Must you always spoil everything! \nShe turns and walks away in a rage. Sandro breathes a deep sigh, as though the scene had exhausted him, then stretches himself on the ground, his face turned skyward, his eyes shut tight. \nThe sky over the island of Lisca Bianca is completely filled with clouds. It is early afternoon, the atmosphere has darkened, and occasional sounds of thunder are heard in the distance. \nSandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head. Further below, Claudia, Corrado and Giulia are also taking a nap. Gradually, however, with the sound of thunder, they become aroused. \nGIULIA Looks like the weather is changing. \nThough no less concerned over Anna's disappearance than any of the others, Corrado attempts to lighten the tension by feigning a calm and sensible attitude. Taking note of the stone hut before him, he observes it carefully and remarks: \nCORRADO It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses. \nSANDRO Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan? \nClaudia comes up close to the hut and tries to peer through the tiny window but inside it is so dark that nothing can be seen. Suddenly, she finds a small piece of bread on the ledge of the window. She picks it up and starts examining it. Then, realizing the bread is still fairly fresh, exclaims: \nCLAUDIA Somebody must live here! \nCORRADO (after examining the bread himself) But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here. \nThe discussion is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of one of the sailors who has come up from the shore. \nSAILOR We had better get started. The storm may break any minute now. \nCLAUDIA (angrily) What do you mean! What about Anna? \nSANDRO (to the seaman) Tell Lady Patrizia that we can't leave now. In fact, we'll have to make a tour around the island... \nSAILOR Wouldn't it be better if you told that to the Lady yourself. I can't assume the responsibility for keeping the boat here. There's no place to tie it up... And then, you know, it's got a flat bottom, and if the sea gets a little too rough... \nSANDRO (angrily) That doesn't make any difference! If we have to stay, we'll stay! \nAboard the yacht, which is circling the island, Sandro, Patrizia, Raimondo and one of the sailors are peering out over the side, scrutinizing the banks and rocky slopes in hope of finding some trace of Anna. The jagged cliffs appear enormously tall and ominous, harboring tiny grottoes in which someone could easily hide. \nPATRIZIA Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something... \nSANDRO Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow. \nPATRIZIA But you have to  consider all possibilities, Sandro. \nIncensed by her remark, which he considers to be absurd, Sandro moves away from Patrizia and goes towards the stern of the boat where he notices Corrado signaling to them from a remote section of the beach. \nCORRADO (calling out) There are some footprints around here... \nBut he stops in the middle of the statement, and throws up his arms to indicate that the discovery is really of little significance. So he proceeds to climb back up along the pathway from which he descended, and the yacht continues on its way. \nSANDRO (calling from the stern, excitedly) Patrizia! \nBoth Patrizia and Raimondo come rushing over to the stern and look towards where Sandro is pointing at something dark and obscure afloat on the water up ahead. \nRAIMONDO (to the sailor) Mario...Steer the boat that way. \nThe yacht heads in the direction of the black object in the water, but as they come up close, they realize it is nothing more than some wooden piece of furniture. The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo. \nSAILOR Shall I turn back? \nSANDRO No. Now that we're here, let's have a look around Basiluzzo. (then turning to Patrizia) When we were swimming, she swam out in that direction. \nSAILOR It won't be easy to find a place to go ashore. \nThe first shadows of evening begin to fall over the island of Lisca Bianca. The sky is now even gloomier, streaked with flashes of lightning. Rumbling sounds of thunder are heard in the distance. The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety. They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance. \nSANDRO Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving. \nOLD MAN (scratching his head) It must have been around four or five... \nCORRADO In the afternoon? \nOLD MAN No... in the morning. Why? What's happened? \nSANDRO Nothing... nothing at all! \nCLAUDIA But why don't you tell him? (then turning to the old man) A girl who was with us has disappeared. \nOLD MAN What do you mean... disappeared?  Was she drowned? \nCLAUDIA No, she didn't drown... She just disappeared, and nobody knows where. \nSANDRO And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it? \nCLAUDIA Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking. \nOLD MAN Have you searched in back of the house to see if she might have fallen off that cliff? Last month that's what happened to one of my sheep... I looked all over for it all day long and it wasn't until late at night that I heard it bleating... It had been there the whole day... and was almost dead. \nClaudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately. \nCLAUDIA Anna! . . . Anna! \nBut her cries are lost in the sound of the storm. Drenched by the rain, her shoes full of mud, her dress soaked, she stops, as Corrado, who had followed after her, grabs hold of her arm and leads her back to the hut. \nCORRADO Come, Claudia...come back inside. \nIt is early morning inside the hut, and the flame of the kerosene lamp has dwindled down to a tiny, flickering light. Claudia awakens with a bewildered look upon her face, wondering where she is and how she comes to be there. She notices Corrado dozing on an empty box in a corner of the room, then realizing that Sandro and the old man are no longer there, she gets up and goes out the door. \nOutside, everything is covered by a thick haze, which is gradually beginning to lift. Sandro, who is standing a short distance away from the hut, hears Claudia approaching and turns around to greet her. \nSANDRO Are you feeling better? \nCLAUDIA (nodding yes) I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me. \nSANDRO You're very fond of Anna, aren't you? \nCLAUDIA Yes, very much so. \nSANDRO Has she ever spoken to you about me? CLAUDIA Occasionally, but always with affection. \nSANDRO And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her. \nCLAUDIA I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening. \nThere is a pause, then suddenly they both hear the sound of a motor growing louder and louder. They look out over the shore but the haze is so heavy that it is impossible for them to determine the source. Then, seeing the old man coming up the path, Sandro impulsively runs towards him and seizes him by the collar. \nSANDRO Whose boat is that? \nOLD MAN (astonished) What boat? \nSANDRO Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor? \nOLD MAN At this time of the year there are so many boats... \nAll of a sudden, Claudia breaks out into tears. Patrizia doesn't say a word. She just lets Claudia cry, knowing it will do her good. Sandro comes over and as soon as Claudia sees him there, she stops crying, and avoids looking up at him. \nSANDRO Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him? \nPATRIZIA I don't see why I should mind. \nCLAUDIA (to Sandro) I think that you might go and have a look yourself. \nSANDRO Yes, maybe that is better. \nHe turns and starts heading down towards the beach. \nPATRIZIA (to Claudia) What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm. \nCLAUDIA (rising) Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night. \nOne of the frogmen emerges with an ancient vase in his hand, evidently found in the depths below. Raimondo, who has just arrived with a thermos of hot coffee, puts it down and goes over to the frogman to fetch the vase. \nRAIMONDO (to the frogman) What is it? \nFROGMAN An ancient vase. There's a buried city under here. It's full of this stuff. \nRaimondo takes the vase and shows it to Patrizia and Claudia. It is an extremely beautiful amphora, in terra cotta, with a figured design around it. Patrizia and Claudia momentarily drop their thoughts to examine it. Then Corrado, who had observed the scene, comes over, followed immediately by Giulia. \nPATRIZIA (ironically) Come on, Corrado, tell us what century it belongs to. \nCorrado smiles, then comes closer to examine it. Claudia also kneels down to look at it. A moment later she feels a presence at her side, and even without turning around she knows it is Sandro. Taking advantage of the discovery that was made, he purposely has returned to join the group in order to be near Claudia. They both now feel between them the warmth of that contact, and for a brief moment, succumb once again to that sudden sense of wonderment which they already had experienced at dawn. \nGIULIA Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift? \nCORRADO Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums. \nPATRIZIA (to Sandro) But aren't you supposed to be on your way? \nClaudia, stricken with dismay, immediately detaches herself from Sandro, who replies with a certain sense of embarrassment. \nSANDRO Yes... I'm going... I'm going now. \nA patrol boat is anchored off the cliff of a small island where the current running through the surrounding waters comes to an end. Sandro is leaning against the wall of a dilapidated building, which is constructed right on that part of the rock where the sea close by discharges all kinds of refuse. Four or five islanders are busy scouring through the accumulated rubbish. They are taciturn, poorly dressed people who every now and then come to blows over the possession of some article washed ashore by the waves. Sandro is watching them, feeling distraught and melancholy. One of the carabinieri who had accompanied him is walking up and down beside an elderly gentleman who is obviously one of the local gentry. \nSANDRO (to the carabiniere) It's already two hours... What are we going to do? \nCARABINIERE It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca. \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN And sometimes even twenty-four... depending on the wind... \nCARABINIERE If the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon, we'll have to wait at least until three or four o'clock. \nSandro looks at them without commenting, then turns and walks away towards the center of the village. The houses and shops around the square are very plain and shabby. Sandro spots a barber shop and, fingering his day-old beard, enters for a shave. \nShortly thereafter, a clamor of voices is heard outside and Sandro comes dashing out of the shop. Seeing the islanders fighting and arguing about something drawn up from the sea, he runs over to find out what it is.  As he arrives on the scene, two policemen step out of the confusion dragging a large crate, which they carry over to the door of a nearby shack, amid the protests of the islanders who are still arguing and shouting among themselves. \nVOICES It belongs to me... We found it... \nGENTLEMAN Back... Stand back! \nMARSHAL Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search? \nAnna's father turns around to look at the bloodhounds who are already sniffing the air for a scent and anxious to get on with the hunt. Then he throws a quick glance at his daughter's valise once more, and with an air of disgust and irritation, walks off in a huff, followed by Claudia. \nATTENDANT (to the Marshal) Get everybody out of the way... \nMARSHAL Okay. I'll send them down to that part of the beach over there... \nAfter they all have left the area, the attendant leads the two bloodhounds over to Anna's valise, instructs them to pick up the scent, then takes them up to the very top of the island, where he subsequently unties them from his leash and sets them off. \nClaudia and Anna's father arrive on the beach where Patrizia, Giulia, Corrado, Raimondo and one of the sailors are seated on a pile of rocks. \nAs the dogs begin running in different directions over the island, trying to track down the scent from Anna's valise, the entire group remains silent, awaiting the outcome of the search. Suddenly, the bloodhounds come racing down the slope, heading directly towards the beach where they are gathered, apparently hot on the trail of some familiar scent. To everybody's amazement, the dogs stop in front of Claudia, jumping excitedly and barking at her as though they had found their prey. Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear. She turns around and sees the others all staring at her. But she cannot understand why they are looking at her that way nor why the dogs have stopped right in front of her. Then, as if struck by a sudden flash of memory, she touches her dress and cries out: \nCLAUDIA It's because of this... The dress... It's because of this dress. Anna gave it to me yesterday, right after the swim. \nCompletely relieved, Claudia smiles and bends over to pet the dogs, as the attendant comes up to them and ties the leash back on to their necks. Then he leads them away and heads once again up\u0007the slope towards the top of the island. Anna's father seems almost disillusioned by the negative results of the search. Corrado also feels dissatisfied, and addressing himself to the Marshal, says: \nCORRADO And what are we going to do now? \nMARSHAL We'll try again. \nPATRIZIA But is it really necessary? Those two beasts... How absurd! \nMeanwhile, the patrol boat has returned and is pulling ashore. Giulia is the first one to notice its arrival and she calls out to the others that Sandro is back. Then she goes over to where Anna's father is standing. \nGIULIA Sandro's here. \nANNA'S FATHER (coldly) I don't know him. \nGIULIA It seems to me that at a moment like this... \nANNA'S FATHER I don't want to know him. \nBy this time, Sandro has come ashore, followed by the carabiniere, and immediately goes up to Claudia. \nSANDRO Claudia, listen ... Claudia. \nBut Claudia hardly looks at him, and seeing Corrado approaching, she moves away from Sandro. \nCORRADO (to Sandro) I didn't think you'd be back so early. \nCARABINIERE (interrupting) We didn't check the other islands, so... \nCORRADO And why didn't you go there? \nCARABINIERE (referring to Sandro) He wanted to come back. \nThe sailors have unloaded the crate of cigarettes from the patrol boat and the Marshal is getting all the details from the carabiniere. \nMARSHAL Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate. \nCORRADO So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...? \nMARSHAL (evading Corrado's question and pursuing his own thoughts) I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca. \nThe train has just pulled into the station. The platform is completely empty and Claudia is the only one to board the train. She climbs up the steps and the door is closed behind her. A second later, she appears at the window, looks out briefly, then disappears into her compartment. The station master raises the signal for the engine to start, a short whistle is heard, and soon the train gets under way. \nSandro dashes out across the tracks, swings open one of the doors, and boards the train as it picks up speed and pulls away from the station. \nClaudia is seated in a corner near the window, looking out. She appears completely relaxed and totally drained of energy, fatigued after so much tension. After a few seconds, she turns around and is abruptly startled to see Sandro standing nearby in the corridor. He comes over to her compartment and takes a seat directly opposite to hers. Claudia is absolutely furious. \nCLAUDIA Go ahead, now say something! I want to know just what it is we have to say to each other. \nSandro remains silent, waiting for Claudia to settle down and calm herself. But she continues to reproach him. \nCLAUDIA Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come? \nSANDRO I don't know why. I just couldn't help it. \nCLAUDIA But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now. \nSANDRO I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not... \nCLAUDIA (deeply wounded) Oh, Sandro... \nSANDRO I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye? \nCLAUDIA For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly? \nSANDRO It takes even less. \nCLAUDIA But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me? \nSANDRO I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together. \nCLAUDIA No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off. \nSANDRO And what about you? \nCLAUDIA Me... I... I... Please leave me alone. \nSuddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor. The car is of an old type -- one half is first class, the other second. Claudia stops in front of a second-class compartment from which the sound of two voices is heard. One is that of a woman -- sweet, very delicate and very feminine; the other is that of a man with a Sicilian accent. Sandro joins Claudia. Standing there together they hear the conversation. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I work there but I'm really a stranger. \nMAN'S VOICE I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you. \nWOMAN'S VOICE And who is she? Does she work in Catania? \nMAN'S VOICE Yes, she takes care of the garden. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener. \nMAN'S VOICE So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another. \nWOMAN'S VOICE And what did they say about me? \nMAN'S VOICE They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort. \nThere is a moment of silence. Then, the sound of music is heard coming from the compartment. Claudia and Sandro look at one another with a smile on their faces. Then Claudia leans over to peek into the compartment. The woman is young; she has thick, wavy brown hair.  He is one of those typical seducers from the provinces, with black hair. There is a tiny radio between them. Sandro also takes a peek into the compartment. Then they withdraw as the two resume their conversation. \nGIRL I came down here to buy a foulard... Suddenly I realized that little by little, directly behind me, I was being followed by so many men, and more and more of them kept coming. \nCHIEF OF POLICE Well, I should think so... Dressed like that. \nGIRL But I have always gone around like this, everywhere in the world. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. \nZuria turns to Sandro and clears his throat. Outside, the crowd becomes very noisy. \nZURIA (to the girl) How old are you? \nGIRL Nineteen. My name is Gloria Perkins. I'm married and a writer by profession. I write in a trance, almost always in contact with people who are dead. Tolstoi, for example, or Shakespeare. But the movies also interest me. \nZuria nods to Sandro as if to say: now watch this. \nZURIA How do you find the men of Messina? Are you shocked by their warm display of friendliness? \nGIRL No, why should I be shocked? We're in Italy, not Finland. \nZURIA And how were you received in Palermo? \nThe girl turns around and looks down at Zuria with contempt, but she manages to remain calm. \nGIRL In Palermo I was with my husband. Now I'm going to Capri to write an article for the Tourist Office. \nZuria clears his throat again and whispers to Sandro. \nZURIA She did exactly the same thing in Palermo. \nCHIEF OF POLICE (to the girl) If you want to go back to your hotel... we're ready to escort you. \nGIRL Oh, yes, thank you... \nPhotographer snaps a flash photo. The girl immediately strikes a pose. Other flashes follow. The clerks ask for her autograph. One of the policemen raises the shutter; the girl comes forward smiling, and is greeted with a certain kind of roar from the crowd. The group leaves the shop. Sandro and Zuria also come out. The girl, ushered out by the policemen, climbs into the Alfa Romeo. The guard holds the crowd back. There are more camera flashes. More smiles from the pretty stranger. Finally the car pulls out, followed by the police wagon. Sandro and Zuria watch the car disappear through the crowd, which starts to disperse. The din, however, is still enormous, due to the unsnarling of the traffic jam. \nZURIA Do you like her? \nSandro shrugs his shoulders, somewhat surprised by the journalist's question. \nZURIA She costs a hundred thousand lire. \nSANDRO You're kidding! \nZURIA No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me? \nSandro is still looking at the journalist with a sense of incredulity, almost as if he felt Zuria's conversation was something out of this world. But he is brought back to reality by Zuria's last remark, which is made as the journalist starts walking at a very hurried pace. \nSANDRO I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc\u0082. \nZURIA Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out. \nSANDRO (impatiently) Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ... \nThe journalist casts a sidewards glance at Sandro. He is a bitter and sarcastic man, one who is completely absorbed with his own little problems and his own daily routine. But for this very reason he is quite capable of taking any kind of insult, either big or small. \nZURIA As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat... \nThe woman, anxious to learn about any new bit of gossip, becomes immediately interested. \nLADY AMALIA Disappeared? Who is she? ... Where? When? \nHUSBAND And that makes four. Anybody else?... \nSandro, a little sick and tired of the whole matter, and wanting to put an end to what has by now become farcical, intervenes. \nSANDRO You have to be precise. Did this girl enter your store or didn't she? \nWIFE (shouting) Yes! \nSANDRO (ignoring her) Was she blonde or brunette? \nHUSBAND (calmly) Brunette. \nWIFE (contradicting him) Blonde. \nSANDRO How was she dressed? \nHUSBAND I don't quite remember. Seems to me she wore a black dress. \nWIFE (intervening sarcastically) He doesn't look at dresses, he looks at what's under them. \nThe husband turns around and looks at his wife menacingly. \nSANDRO Pardon me, but has anyone else been here asking about this girl? \nHUSBAND No ... I don't think so. \nSANDRO Thanks. \nSandro leaves the store. He walks a few steps along the pavement, then sits down at a small outside table of a nearby caf\u0082. He looks out over the square: a small Sicilian town, quiet and still in the hot afternoon sun. Every now and then, he glances up at the country road that winds around the town, as though he were waiting for someone. \nA few moments later, in fact, a car comes into view and slows down as it reaches the square. The driver looks out for a place in which to park. Sandro rises to his feet. The car comes to a stop a few steps away from him. The driver rushes out of the car to open the door for the person inside: it is Claudia. Sandro immediately goes over to meet her, looking at her somewhat amazed. Not only does he see her more elegantly dressed than he has ever seen her before, wearing a smartly tailored polka-dot suit, but also as an entirely new person, as someone whose beauty he has discovered for the first time. For a moment they continue staring at each other, without even bothering to say hello. \nCLAUDIA Any news? \nSANDRO Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication... \nClaudia drops her gaze, relieved by even that slight note of hope. Then she looks up at him again, as though inspired by another sudden thought: something which must have lingered in her mind from one of the Princess' humorous quips. Then, the owner of the general store appears on the scene. After having dealt his nagging wife a crushing verbal blow, he turns to Sandro, but not without first glancing at Claudia, for whom it soon becomes evident he has really come out on the street. \nHUSBAND Listen... In the paper they forgot to say that as soon as the girl left here she took the bus to Noto. The bus leaves from the square, over there. I saw her clearly... I came to the door to see her off... She was a beautiful girl. Lovely pair of legs! \nWhile speaking, he continues to keep an eye on Claudia with the look of one who thinks his gaze is loaded with irresistible masculinity. All of a sudden, he pulls out a package of Nazionali cigarettes from his pocket and offers one to Claudia. She looks at him dumbfounded, then automatically declines with a shake of her head. In turn, he lights up a cigarette, inhaling the smoke voluptuously. Meanwhile, his wife has come upon the scene and looks at him suspiciously. Then, with a sad, wistful voice, she turns to Claudia. \nWIFE You're from Rome, aren't you? I knew right away because I'm from Viterbo... He was a soldier there and so... (indicating her husband, and then quickly continuing) I don't like it very much, here. \nHUSBAND (interrupting) Then why don't you go back? \nHis wife turns and looks at him hatefully, exactly in the same manner he had looked at her. \nCLAUDIA How long have you been married? \nWIFE Three months. \nThe woman pauses for a few seconds and looks at Claudia as though she had detected some hidden motive behind the question. And when she resumes speaking, what she has to say is in sharp contrast to the way she says it. They are words of protest but spoken condescendingly, almost sweetly, yet leaving no doubt as to their meaning. \nMIDWIFE What are you trying to insinuate, young lady? Why should I have seen her again? I don't do anything that's illegitimate. \nCLAUDIA Oh, no... What are you saying? I'm not insinuating anything... \nMIDWIFE And furthermore, my dear young lady... because you really are a dear, you know ...if the story of that girl is merely a pretext, let us say, to get in touch with her, then I feel it is my duty to warn her. These things are very, very dangerous, especially in a neighborhood like this where people occupy themselves more with other people's affairs than their own. \nSeeing Claudia being put into an uncomfortable position, Sandro, who had been following the midwife's discussion with a cagey attitude, intervenes. \nSANDRO Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses? \nMIDWIFE There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know... \nSANDRO Thank you. \nMIDWIFE Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time. \nClaudia starts moving hurriedly out of the courtyard, followed by Sandro. \nSandro's car is speeding across a harsh, sun-baked landscape, bypassing long lines of peasants returning from the fields: the women seated on donkeys, the men on foot. The more fortunate among them have horse drawn carts. \nClaudia is looking at the surrounding countryside and spies an iron bridge that is all rusty and obviously no longer in use. \nCLAUDIA Look at that bridge! Who knows why they even bothered to make it... \nThe car continues onward, passing an abandoned factory, then a railroad station, also abandoned, its tracks covered by weeds, the ticket office haphazardly boarded up with old wooden planks. \nCLAUDIA Look at that: a factory... a station... and look at those tracks, all full of weeds... But why? \nSandro shrugs his shoulders and continues driving without saying a word. Up ahead a small town comes into view, with monotonous rows of newly constructed homes lined up along the side of the road. The car enters the town and stops. Sandro gets out and goes over to a fountain nearby, but the fountain is dry. Somewhat surprised, he begins to look around. And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut. There is no sign of life anywhere, except for the weeds growing between the cracks in the walls, invading and suffocating everything in sight. \nClaudia gets out of the car, joins Sandro, and together they start walking along the streets. The sun beats furiously down upon the crumbling houses, upon the church, upon the useless monument in the square on which a dedication is inscribed: \"To The Agricultural Worker.\" \nSandro looks around in absolute silence. Claudia is also  silent, somewhat dismayed. Instinctively, she presses up close to Sandro who leads her to a shady spot where the ground is overgrown with weeds. \nSandro and Claudia are lying next to each other on the grass. Sandro appears calm but is actually looking at Claudia as though he were about to embrace her with his eyes. Then he takes her hand. Claudia offers no resistance; in fact, she entwines her fingers around his, almost with a sense of desperation. Sandro tries to kiss her. She makes a feeble attempt to resist, looks around, and sees the deserted town, the barren fields, the crumbling, sun-baked walls. She turns and looks at Sandro again, and now it is she who kisses him. When they break apart, they stretch themselves out upon the grass. Sandro kisses her violently, again and again and again... \nThe early twilight shadows are beginning to fall. The sky is still clear but the sun is fading. There is a deep silence and the air is absolutely still. In a certain sense, Sandro's car, standing there in the middle of the deserted street, is the only thing alive in that desolate town. \nHuddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass. Lazily, Claudia awakens, and then Sandro also opens his eyes. They are both somewhat disheveled. \nCLAUDIA (faintly audible) It's late... We should be going. \nLittle by little, she leaves behind the drowsiness of her deep and peaceful sleep, purring languorously in a typically feminine fashion. Sandro smiles and gently embraces her. A moment later, Claudia releases herself from Sandro's arms, sits up and realizes that the countryside and the town itself are as black and motionless as death. A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet. \nCLAUDIA Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery. \nSANDRO Who knows why they all left... \nClaudia starts to move but her legs are still numb from her sound sleep and she hobbles along comically, laughing at the same time. Sandro also gets up and finds that his legs are cramped. Hobbling and laughing himself, he follows Claudia towards the car. But the car, baked by the sun, is like an oven. They both make boisterous and playful exclamations, then another embrace, another kiss. Finally, they climb into the car and drive off with a loud roar that echoes up and down the abandoned town. \nSandro and Claudia arrive in the town of Noto and pull up on the opposite side of the street from the Trinacria Hotel. As they climb out of the car, Claudia turns to Sandro: \nCLAUDIA Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone. \nSANDRO Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement, what disorder! They were very much concerned with scenographic effects... an extraordinary sense of liberty... \nThere is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene before him. Then, giving voice to a sincere thought, he exclaims: \nSANDRO Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas... \nCLAUDIA And why did you drop them? \nSANDRO Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs. \nClaudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment, and Sandro becomes aware of it. \nSANDRO Why are you looking at me like that? \nCLAUDIA I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things. \nSANDRO I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays? \nThe last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness, Sandro avoiding Claudia's glance. He laughs to himself and for a while remains silent. He takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings, then turns to Claudia. \nSANDRO Claudia, let's get married? \nCLAUDIA (astonished) What! Get married? \nSANDRO Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say? \nCLAUDIA What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me? \nSANDRO You look at me as though I had said something foolish... \nCLAUDIA And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me? \nSANDRO That's why I asked you... \nCLAUDIA So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8. \nSandro smiles and playfully ruffles Claudia's hair. She also smiles, then slowly they both head towards the hotel. \nIt is morning inside the Hotel Trinacria.  Claudia has just had breakfast in her room and is almost finished dressing. It is a rather large room, set out with old pieces of furniture. The place is in a state of disarray, and the door leading into Sandro's room is wide open. Because of the general disorder, Claudia is unable to find her stockings. But instead of being angered by this, she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily. As she continues to look for her stockings, Sandro appears in the doorway. \nSANDRO Are you ready? \nClaudia comes up to Sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration. \nCLAUDIA (ironically) But why am I so infatuated with you? \nSANDRO (smiling) Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside... \nCLAUDIA Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away... \nShe starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to locate her stockings. Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music. It is a popular tune, wild and rhythmic, emanating from a publicity truck as part of some local advertising stunt. Claudia is overtaken by the music and cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for Sandro. Little by little, she starts swaying back and forth to the music. Then, kicking off her shoes, she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet. Sandro looks at her, amused but also somewhat impatient. \nSANDRO (leaving) Okay. I understand. See you later. \nClaudia rushes up to the door, and feigning an exaggerated attitude of despair, says: \nSandro doesn't answer but merely shrugs his shoulders. Then he takes Claudia by the arm and gently leads her towards the stairway. He has a worried expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing the stairs. As they walk through the corridor, Claudia looks at him anxiously, wondering what is wrong. \nCLAUDIA Sandro ...What's the matter? \nSANDRO Nothing. \nHe opens the door to his room and ushers Claudia in. As soon as he enters, he takes off his jacket and throws it on a chair. Then he walks over to the window and closes the shutters. Then, without saying a word, he turns to Claudia, grabs her in his arms and squeezes her. Claudia smiles, and playfully yells \"Ouch!\" Then he goes to kiss her but Claudia tries to resist but doesn't succeed. This little struggle stimulates Sandro and is enough to make him forget all reserve. He drags Claudia on to the bed and forces her to lie down. \nCLAUDIA No, Sandro... Please... \nSANDRO Why? \nCLAUDIA No reason why... \nBut Sandro hugs her and kisses her again. This time, Claudia lets herself be kissed. \nCLAUDIA What's the matter with you? \nSandro only responds by kissing her again. Then Claudia yields. Sandro is angry and excited, as though he wanted to take his resentment out on Claudia. \nCLAUDIA Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ... \nSANDRO And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure. \nWounded, Claudia pushes him away with all her might, and exclaims: \nCLAUDIA What are you saying? \nSANDRO I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to. \nCLAUDIA Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But... \nShe stops short, then turns aside and reaches out to touch his jacket on the chair, looking into the pockets, not with curiosity but with a sense of love. Sandro grabs her by the shoulders and forces her to turn around. \nSANDRO But what? \nClaudia remains silent, then gets up from the bed, and in a subdued tone of voice, says: \nCLAUDIA Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby? \nSANDRO Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody... \nCLAUDIA No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely. \nSANDRO I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is? \nThere is a moment of silence, then Claudia starts heading towards the door. \nCLAUDIA Come, let's go. Pack your things, and I'll get mine ready too. \nIt is evening. Sandro's car is pulling into the town of Taormina on its way to the San Domenico. It comes to a small square and passes by a group of men and women seated on the steps of an ancient ruin. They are dressed in evening clothes and are laughing and giggling. The car turns into the street of the San Domenico and stops in front of the hotel. A porter immediately comes out and opens the door. Claudia and Sandro get out and head towards the small courtyard that leads into the foyer. \nThe lobby is full of activity and alive with people dressed in formal attire. Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on. The sound of music is heard coming from one of the halls at the other end of the lobby. There is obviously a party underway: further on, through a glass partition, couples are seen dancing. Suddenly, Claudia stops. Directly up ahead, she notices Patrizia. As soon as she see Claudia, Patrizia comes to greet her, smiling. \nPATRIZIA Well, I'm looking for somebody else and who do I find but you. \nThen Sandro enters the adjoining room, where the clerk has in the meantime turned on all the lamps and performed all the other little duties. Sandro starts to undo his tie. Claudia remains standing in the middle of the room, listening to all of Sandro's movements in the other room. A knock is heard at the door of Sandro's room and Sandro is heard saying: \nSANDRO Come in. \nA few seconds later, the porter also enters Claudia's room with her baggage. She opens the valise and starts taking out her nightgown and other necessities. Her gestures are slow and imprecise because fatigue has overcome her. Several moments pass, and Sandro appears at the door in his pajamas. \nCLAUDIA Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow. \nSANDRO Aren't you going to change? \nCLAUDIA You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore. \nSandro shrugs his shoulders without, apparently, giving much thought to Claudia's statement. He goes into the bathroom saying: \nSANDRO Sure, that's what I said... \nThe sound of the shower running is heard. \nSANDRO Wow, it's ice cold... \nClaudia goes up to the door adjoining the two rooms and stops at the doorway of the bathroom that is situated between the two rooms. \nCLAUDIA Sandro, I'm not coming down. \nSANDRO Why? \nCLAUDIA I'm too sleepy. \nSANDRO Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name... \nClaudia has been listening to Sandro with her head leaning against the door jamb, her eyes closed. As soon as Sandro stops, she goes back to her bed and starts undressing. Sandro comes out of the bathroom, wearing a bathrobe, and going over to Claudia, says in an affectionate tone: \nSANDRO You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow? \nCLAUDIA Late, very late. \nClaudia disappears into her bathroom, and Sandro returns to his room. After a while, his voice is heard. \nSANDRO Did you know that when I was a boy I wanted to be a diplomat? Can you imagine that! Me, a diplomat? It's strange but I never thought I'd be rich. I saw myself living in a rooming house, full of geniuses... \nClaudia has slipped into her nightgown and returned to her room. Sandro is heard clearing his throat, and then continuing. \nSANDRO Instead, I have two apartments, one in Rome and one in Milan. As far as genius goes, it's a habit I've never formed. What do you think of that? \nSandro reappears at the doorway, already half dressed. Claudia slides into bed and stretches herself out under the covers. \nCLAUDIA I look at things differently... But maybe it's best we talk about it some other time. Do you mind turning off that light over there? \nSandro turns out the lamp on the table while Claudia closes the main switch. The room is enveloped in darkness. Sandro approaches the bed and bends over Claudia to kiss her. \nSANDRO Good night, my love. \nCLAUDIA Good night. Tell me that you love me. \nSANDRO I love you. \n", "test1_input": "Raimondo goes aboard the yacht and returns with Claudia's valise. He consigns it to one of the carabinieri who, in turn, takes it aboard the patrol boat. Claudia follows him aboard. The Marshal comes out of the radio room, steps ashore, then joins Sandro and Anna's father on the motorboat, while Patrizia, Giulia, Corrado and Raimondo go aboard the yacht. \nIn the seaport town of Milazzo, on the Sicilian mainland, Sandro and Anna's father are seated in an office at police headquarters.  The sailors picked up on a charge of carrying contraband are being questioned by the police Lieutenant. \nSAILOR No, sir, Lieutenant, we weren't even able to drop anchor once ... the sea was too rough. \nThe Lieutenant motions for the sailor to come up to the desk, then points to a sheet of paper in front of him. \nLIEUTENANT Okay. Just sign here. (turning to a guard standing at the door) Have the next one come in. He's the last, isn't he? \nAnother sailor enters and timidly approaches the Lieutenant's desk. He is rather young, and his face is completely bronzed by the sun. \nLIEUTENANT They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right? \nYOUNG SAILOR Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too. \nLIEUTENANT So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times... \nThe sailor starts, as though taken by surprise, then quickly answers. \nYOUNG SAILOR Yes, sir. Three times. \nLIEUTENANT (to Sandro and Anna's father) Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other. (then, facing the sailor again) Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat? \nYOUNG SAILOR What other boat? \nLIEUTENANT Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that? \nYOUNG SAILOR (stuttering) I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ... \nSandro is unable to control himself any longer. He gets up, walks over to the sailor and yells in his face. \nSANDRO But what are you saying?... What are you saying? \nThe Lieutenant motions to Sandro to be quiet, then calmly rises from his desk and continues. \nLIEUTENANT Now look here, I'm ready to forget the whole thing: the cigarettes, the contraband -- everything. If you would only tell me... you or your friends... whether the girl was aboard your boat and how far she went. \nThey all remain silent. The Lieutenant motions to the guard who then leads the sailors out of the office. \nLIEUTENANT (to Anna's father) Just as I thought. Even if you caught them in the act, they'd deny it. They always deny everything. And then, in this case, if they were to admit having had the girl aboard, it would mean they'd be admitting to the charge of carrying contraband. Oh, it's easy to say: talk! But if they did talk, the following morning you'd find them cold dead in front of their doorstep. \nANNA'S FATHER I think it would be worth my while to take a run over to Palermo. The Chief of Police there is a very good friend of mine and I'm sure he'll do whatever he can. I feel we're wasting our time here... Excuse me, Lieutenant. I hope we see each other again under better circumstances. And thanks for everything. \nBidding goodbye to the Lieutenant, Anna's father leaves, without looking at Sandro. A moment later, Sandro folds the newspaper he was reading, tucks it under his arm, and starts heading towards the door. \nLIEUTENANT At any rate, we'll continue investigating. I know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to all areas... \nSANDRO (showing the newspaper to the Lieutenant) Tell me, Lieutenant, do you happen to know this F.Z. who wrote this article here? \nThe Lieutenant takes a look at the paper which carries a two-column story headed: DISAPPEARANCE OF A ROMAN TOURIST AT LISCA BIANCA. \nLIEUTENANT That's Francesco Zuria. He's the news correspondent. \nSANDRO Where can we locate him? Don't you think that by offering a reward to anyone who can give us some information... \n", "test1_true": "From the opposite end of the corridor through which Sandro and the Lieutenant are walking, appears the Sergeant who was in charge of the patrol boat on which Claudia toured the islands in search of Anna. After saluting his superior, the Sergeant says: \nSERGEANT Have you any instructions for me, Lieutenant? May I return to Lipari? \nLIEUTENANT Yes. With whom did you leave the crate of cigarettes? \nSERGEANT I left it at the warehouse. \nThe Sergeant again salutes his superior, then continues on his way along the corridor. Sandro abruptly turns around and follows after him. \nSANDRO Pardon me, Sergeant, but when did you get back? \nSERGEANT About two hours ago. \nSANDRO And the young lady who was with you? \nSERGEANT I don't know... She said she had to catch a train. \nSandro remains a while, absorbed in his thoughts, then hurriedly leaves the building, and heads towards the station. \nOn her way to the waiting room of the station, Claudia purchases a newspaper, then goes over to an empty bench and sits down. Turning to the local news section, she suddenly comes upon the article announcing Anna's disappearance. \nA moment later, Sandro appears at the door. Claudia looks up at him but doesn't say a word. He walks over and sits down beside her. \nSANDRO Where are you going?... To Montaldo's? \nCLAUDIA Yes. \nSANDRO Then I'll go with you. \nThere is a moment of silence, then Claudia shows him the newspaper article. \nCLAUDIA Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them. \nSANDRO Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them... \nCLAUDIA Yes, you should go. \nSANDRO But then when will we see each other? \nClaudia looks at him imploringly, intent on making him understand, without having to tell him outright, that it is not a question of their seeing each other. Sandro, of course, does realize and suddenly springs to his feet and nervously begins pacing back and forth across the waiting room. Claudia, in turn, also rises and goes over to him. \nCLAUDIA I know it's difficult. But if you go on like this it will become even more difficult. \nThe bell announcing the train's arrival is sounded. Sandro turns around and faces Claudia, almost with a sense of helpless despair. \nCLAUDIA Please, don't look so solemn... And don't wait for the train to come in. \nBut Sandro doesn't move. And again Claudia insists, imploring him not to stay, although she realizes full well that this may mean a final goodbye. \nCLAUDIA Please, please leave. I don't want to look out of the window and wave to you with a handkerchief. \nSandro still doesn't move, and is about to say something, but Claudia looks at him so pleadingly and with such a determined expression, that he finally succumbs and starts walking towards the exit behind the train tracks. \n", "test1_id": 2034, "test2_input": "In the meantime, they have arrived at a shady alcove where, seated in various wicker lounge chairs, are Patrizia, Giulia and a young man dressed in simple, casual clothes. The first one to notice Claudia and to greet her with warm cordiality, is Giulia. \nGIULIA Well, finally! We were beginning to get worried about you, too. \nClaudia plunks herself down in one of the lounge chairs next to Patrizia. The young man rises and bows slightly. \nPATRIZIA But where did you finally end up? \nCLAUDIA It was futile. We went all over. \nThere is a moment of silence; the thought of Anna returns to weigh on the group. Claudia pours herself an orange drink from a pitcher on the table beside her. \nCLAUDIA (referring to Anna) But why does she do these things? (she takes a sip from her glass, then rises) I can't stand it any more. \nShe takes a few steps, looks around at the villa, and at the other end of the alcove sees Corrado and Ettore saying goodbye to a pair of elderly gentlemen. \nGIULIA (to Corrado and Ettore) But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat? \nCORRADO When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold. \nETTORE (noticing Claudia) And who is this? \nPATRIZIA This is Claudia, Anna's friend... (to Claudia) You've never met my husband, have you? \nEttore immediately recalls Claudia's name from a previous conversation that was apparently held before she arrived. \nETTORE By the way, have you phoned him? \nCORRADO You mean Sandro? I told you already. He's not in. At least he's not at the hotel. \nETTORE Now look what has to go and happen... At a time when I'll be needing him. How can we discuss things when we lack dates and figures?... \nPATRIZIA But didn't he say he was coming here... \nNow, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable. \nETTORE Well, what are you all waiting for? Send a car out to get him. He can't be more than a couple of hundred miles away... \nGIULIA To me, the fact that hasn't shown up is a good sign. Do you want to bet that he's found Anna? \nETTORE Maybe. But do you know that forty thousand persons a year disappear in Italy without leaving a single trace behind them. Forty thousand! Almost as much as the entire population of San Siro... Raimondo, will you go and see if you can locate Sandro? \nRAIMONDO Okay. \nA gong announcing lunch resounds throughout the garden. \nPATRIZIA First let the poor thing have something to eat. \nETTORE It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal. \nPRINCESS I've never met this Sandro. What kind of a person is he?... He couldn't have done her in himself, by any chance? \nETTORE (breaking out into a loud laugh) Sandro?... Oh, sure... I can see Sandro calling Anna over to him and saying: Listen, Anna, I intend to get rid of you, but since it's so painful and complicated... and besides, I don't happen to have a gun on me... why don't you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on your own... \nThere is a moment of complete, dead silence, during which the same disturbing thought flashes across the minds of all those who are present like a sudden revelation. \n", "test2_true": "PRINCESS (rising) Come on, let's go. \nThey all get up except Claudia. She is left so completely shaken by the conversation, by the thought, that it seems she no longer has the strength to move. Giulia, after giving Corrado a defiant look, turns and smiles at the young man who had stopped to wait for her. \nGIULIA (to Claudia, referring to the young man) Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints. \nGOFFREDO Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same. \nGiulia laughs with a strange sense of excitement, then takes Goffredo by the arm and leaves. Claudia remains alone. She watches the group heading towards the house,  Giulia holding tight to  Goffredo, Ettore  to Patrizia. Their voices are heard, somewhat unclear. \nETTORE But... where is the Prince?... Is he well? \nPRINCESS The last time I saw him, the day before yesterday, it seemed he was well. \nETTORE Princess, why don't you sell this villa? I would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic. \nPRINCESS It's a little like that already. \nFinally, even Claudia starts moving, slowly, behind the others; but she is still very much upset. \nA crowd of people that keeps growing and growing from one moment to the next, is gathered in one of the main streets of Messina, in front of a men's store with its shutters half-shut. The local police are unable to control the flow of traffic, which has been blocked as a result of the crowd. The cars are packed close to one another, raising a great din with their horns. The throng is composed chiefly of young men pushing and climbing over each other to get near the shop to see inside. Sandro tries to make his way through the crowd in an attempt to get up close himself, but the confusion is so great that he finds the going very difficult. Remarks and comments are heard above the noise. \nFIRST YOUNG MAN Who is it, Sophia Loren? \nSECOND YOUNG MAN Oh, no! It's some model from Turin with a low-cut dress. \nOTHER VOICES It's Queen Saroya... I saw her... So, who could it be? \nTHIRD YOUNG MAN They've torn her dress... She's almost nude... She ran into the shop to hide herself... \nA police siren is heard from afar, then before long it fills the air and dominates every other sound.  An Alfa Romeo pulls up, followed by a police wagon full of policemen. Both vehicles maneuver their way through the crowd like snakes through a jungle, and stop right in front of the shop. Sandro takes advantage of the opening created by the two cars and thus finds himself a few steps away from the door. Bending over in order to see through the small space left open by the half-drawn shutters, he notices several newspapermen and photographers. \nSANDRO (to one of the newspapermen) Which one of you is Zuria? \nNEWSPAPERMAN He's inside. \nMeanwhile, the policemen have come out of the wagon and arrive at the door of the shop, with the Chief of Police leading the way. One of them raises the shutter, and the crowd, which has backed away slightly at the insistence of the police, begins pressing forward threateningly. Soon pandemonium breaks loose. In the confusion, Sandro manages to get inside the store along with the policemen and two photographers. The shutter is again lowered, just a few inches behind him. \nStanding in the middle of the shop is a most charming and provocative young brunette with tight-fitting pants and a blouse that is open almost from the neck to the waist. She is wearing nothing under her blouse, so that with every movement of her body, one cannot help catching a glimpse of her naked breasts. As the policemen come forward, she receives them with a smile. Sandro asks one of the journalists standing nearby if he can tell him which one of them is Zuria.  The journalist points to a man who is only a few steps away -- a man not very old but who has a ravaged face, and whose hair is almost completely white. \nSANDRO Zuria? \nZURIA Yes. Until proven otherwise. \nSANDRO I would like to ask you something. \nZURIA Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy? \nEverybody is gathered around the Chief of Police and the girl. The store clerks are looking at her admiringly. The manager, most upset, is explaining the situation to the Chief of Police. \nMANAGER I phoned you, Chief, because, in view of the situation... I thought it best... \nThe girl interrupts him. She has a very self-satisfied look on her face. \n", "test2_id": 2035, "test3_input": "The attic is bright and spacious, with slanted roof, and two huge windows. It is filled with paintings, easels, canvases, brushes and oils. As soon as Giulia enters the studio, she moves away from Claudia and attaches herself to the young Prince who is setting up one of his paintings on an easel beside one of the windows. Claudia looks around the room with a sense of indifference. Going over to the window, she looks out and sees a vast panorama of the countryside. \nGiulia looks at the painting with a certain amount of surprise. It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir. \nGIULIA Claudia, come and see. It's a nude. \nClaudia is looking through the paintings that lean up against the wall face backwards. She turns one around: a nude woman. A second: another nude woman. A third: the same. \nCLAUDIA They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken. \nGIULIA (to Goffredo) But why all nudes? \nGOFFREDO Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman. \nGIULIA And where do you find the models? \nGOFFREDO Oh, there are as many as one wants. \nGIULIA (turning to Claudia) I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia? \nClaudia goes back to look out the window: a group of flying birds swoops down to land directly under the roof. The birds settle themselves in a little nest directly in front of the window. Claudia bends over to get a better look and is actually able to see the little nest, as she hears behind her the exchange of remarks between Giulia and the young Prince. \nGOFFREDO It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination. \nGIULIA But how could they pose like that? I couldn't. \nGOFFREDO (with a grave, youthful sensuality) Why don't you try? \nGIULIA Me... Goffredo, you're mad! (turning to Claudia) He's mad. \nCLAUDIA Not really. \nClaudia moves away from the window, and continues to look at Giulia and Goffredo with a deep sense of amazement. Giulia is euphoric, kittenish and trembling with excitement. Goffredo is firm, resolute and serious. \nGIULIA Don't you ever paint men? \nGOFFREDO Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait. \nGIULIA But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me. \nGOFFREDO (insistent) But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more. \nGIULIA (timidly) I appeal to you more? \nGiulia glances over at Claudia, who is still preoccupied looking out of the window, then screws up her courage and boldly advances towards Goffredo, making her intentions clearly understood. Goffredo immediately responds to her invitation and draws himself close up against her. There is a moment of hesitation, then a kiss -- awkward but passionately violent. Giulia, on her part, is completely shameless. Claudia turns around exactly at that moment when the two of them are caught up in a feverish embrace. She looks at them, completely dumbfounded, then takes a few steps forward as though she doesn't believe her own eyes. \nCLAUDIA (almost unconsciously) Giulia! \nGiulia quickly turns around, her face is flushed with excitement but also with an expression that seems somewhat triumphant. Before anybody has a chance to say anything, she heads towards the door, swings it open and stands firmly on the threshold,  obviously intent on telling Claudia to leave. In fact, Claudia doesn't wait to be told but immediately walks out into the hallway. \nGIULIA And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear? \nCLAUDIA It couldn't be any clearer. \nGiulia takes a few steps backward into the room, and seeing Claudia still there looking at her strangely, exclaims: \n", "test3_true": "CLAUDIA I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door. \nAnd with a violent bang that leaves Claudia startled, Giulia slams the door shut. Claudia remains standing there for a moment, still very much amazed. But she is aroused from her stupor by the sound of a car pulling into the courtyard. Then she rapidly starts descending the stairs. \nClaudia has reached the hallway leading out to the garden and is anxiously waiting there, looking at the car that has just arrived. But she is not able to distinguish exactly who it is, and her view is also blocked by Ettore and Corrado who have just come out of the house and are now standing in front of the car. So she walks out to the garden and joins the group. A certain look of disappointment spreads over her face as she sees only Raimondo come out of the car. Evidently, Sandro has not been located. \nRAIMONDO He's not at the hotel... and he probably wasn't even in Milazzo. The room clerk said he rented a car... \nClaudia moves away from the group, as though she has heard enough. She goes over to lean against an enormous vase standing there on the side. Her hands are trembling. In back of her she hears the sounds of the others' voices but cannot distinguish what they are saying. Then Patrizia arrives and calls out Claudia's name. But she has to repeat it a second time before Claudia realizes she is being called. \nPATRIZIA Claudia... Let's go. \nClaudia turns around but doesn't move. Another car pulls up, driven by the same chauffeur who had evidently picked her up the other day, and in which the Princess is already seated. \nCLAUDIA I'm not coming. \nPATRIZIA But then why did you bother changing? \nPatrizia remains puzzled for a moment as though searching for a motive behind Claudia's sudden decision, then discreetly turns away without insisting and goes over to the car. In the meantime, Giulia and Goffredo have come out through the hallway and head towards one of the two cars. Corrado looks at them with a cold and critical stare, then with a deliberate intent to prick Giulia's feelings, he says: \nCORRADO Giulia is like Oscar Wilde; give her the superfluous and she will do without the essential. \nEttore breaks out into a laugh as he helps Patrizia into the car. \nETTORE That's him; he'd die if he didn't have somebody to quote. He comes up with quotations like that even at a board of directors meeting... \nClaudia watches them getting into the car. She is beside herself, completely wrapped up in her own thoughts. \nIn the rear of a general store, on the outskirts of a small Sicilian town, a woman is seated at the window. She is very young, thin and irascible. Up front, her husband is speaking with Sandro, and as she listens attentively to what he is saying, a sarcastic smile spreads over her face. \nHUSBAND Be patient, I can't remember everything. \nSANDRO (indicating the newspaper article) But it even says what she bought: a bar of soap! So there's no point in making believe you can't remember. \nAfter waiting a few seconds to give her husband a chance to explain himself, the wife jumps up from where she is sitting, comes over to Sandro and yanks the paper from his hands. Then she starts reading the article in a jerky manner typical of one who is not too literate. \nWIFE \"A young female stranger, whose description corresponds with that of the missing girl, came into my store...\" \nShe suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro. \nWIFE She came and then she left. With him. But this one won't admit it. (turning upon her husband furiously) You think I wasn't aware of it... \nThe husband, a young man, tries to keep calm and carry on the conversation in a logical, persuasive manner. \nHUSBAND But if I was carrying on with the girl, why would I want to give any of this information to the newspaper? \nWIFE That's what I'd like to know myself. \nHUSBAND Fine, that makes two of us who want to know. In fact, three, with him. \nHe indicates Sandro.  Then, seeing a fat, luscious female customer enter the store, he turns to her and continues: \nHUSBAND Ah, Lady Amalia, would you be interested in knowing why I told the newspapers about a certain girl who came here the other day and then disappeared? \n", "test3_id": 2036}

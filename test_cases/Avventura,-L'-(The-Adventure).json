{"test1_input": "But Anna doesn't say a word. Instead, they both swim silently back to the yacht, where Claudia and Giulia are already climbing aboard. Patrizia comes out of the cabin to see what is happening. \nThey all lean over the side of the boat, looking down into the water, expecting the shark at any moment to come into view. But the water remains unruffled, the seaweed below is clearly visible, waving like so many fans. Even the rocks at the bottom can be seen with all sorts of small-gilled fish darting about. A mysterious, fascinating world and yet, because of what happened, one that arouses fear. Everyone aboard is silent. Until Anna and Sandro, followed by Raimondo, finally arrive and climb aboard. Sandro immediately takes Anna to her cabin, and the others follow, making various comments. \nCLAUDIA (to Anna) But how did you become aware of it? Did it touch you? \nAnna doesn't answer but continues on ahead amid the overlapping remarks. \nGIULIA I would have died. PATRIZIA ... and how ugly they are ... with all those teeth... \nCORRADO (shouting from the shore) What happened? \nGIULIA (shouting from the prow) There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are! \nCORRADO Who's moving? \nInside the cabin, which is partitioned into separate rooms, the general layout is neat and orderly, with a number of prints decorating the walls. Sandro and Anna, followed by Claudia, enter from the outside deck and cross over into Anna's room. It is extremely small, with two cots on one side and a long curtain that partially conceals a bureau from which several dresses are seen hanging. \nAnna is soaking wet in her bathing suit and her hair is all knotted into clusters that hang down over her face. Without bothering to dry herself, she crouches down on the cot and, assisted by Claudia, wraps a blanket around her body. Sandro and Claudia look at her with great concern. A member of the crew enters carrying a tray on which there is a half-filled glass of liquor, which Sandro takes and offers to Anna. \nSANDRO Here, drink some cognac. \nAnna positively refuses it, and the sailor leaves as Sandro sets the glass down on a shelf. Looking up at both Sandro and Claudia, Anna appears pleased with their solicitude. \nANNA It's nothing... really. Let's go back... It's all over now. \nA pause and then an instant later, she begins shivering under the blanket. \nANNA Only, I'd like to change. I'm a little cold. \nLeaving Anna and Claudia alone on their own, Sandro turns and goes outside the cabin where the others are still congregated, busy chattering. Among the remarks exchanged, one that is distinctly heard is Patrizia's. \nPATRIZIA But where did the shark go to? \nAs soon as Sandro closes the door to the cabin, Anna is suddenly and completely changed. She gets up from the cot, goes over to the curtain and draws it aside, revealing an array of feminine attire. Wondering which dress to choose, she finally selects two and tosses them on the cot. \nANNA Which one shall I wear? \nCLAUDIA (picking up one of the two dresses) This one is gorgeous. \nANNA Then why don't you try it on? \nAs Anna begins to dry herself with a large bath towel, Claudia slips on the dress and looks at herself in the mirror with a coquettish expression on her face. \nANNA It looks better on you than it does on me... You keep it. \nAnna is removing her bathing suit as she continues talking to Claudia with a tone and manner that reveal a sense of excitement mixed with one of amusement. \nANNA You know, that thing about the shark was all a joke. \nClaudia looks at her as though dumbfounded, as though she had never known her before. She is obviously piqued and angry, but more with herself than with Anna. \nCLAUDIA There's the difference between you and me: you know how to put over certain things, and I don't. Sometimes I envy you. \nAnna is all dressed and ready. She opens the door and steps outside, as Claudia follows behind. \n", "test1_true": "GIULIA But aren't you afraid? \nSAILOR Ma'am, sharks never attack anybody. Anyway, the raft is dark, and they wouldn't be able to see it. \nPATRIZIA So, it is true that they're blind... \nAnna appears at the door of the cabin and Sandro rushes over to meet her, a little surprised to find her looking so cheerful, as though the incident that had just taken place were completely forgotten. \nSANDRO How are you? \nANNA Fine. Can't you see so yourself? \nAnna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water. \nANNA I have an urge to put my feet on some land. Aren't you coming? \nAs she starts to go down the steps, Sandro quickly comes over to her. \nSANDRO Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while. \nANNA Wait for what? \nPATRIZIA Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive. \nCLAUDIA Better dead. \nBut Anna has already stepped aboard the raft, and Sandro follows her. Giulia has her eyes fixed on the beach where Corrado in his white suit is waiting for them. Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: \nGIULIA Will the three of us fit? \nSAILOR Sure, sure. There's plenty of room. \nPatrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin. And Raimondo follows her shortly after. Giulia descends into the raft and, as it moves away from the boat with a slight pitch, she lets out a few hysterical shrieks. Anna laughs and then shouts out to Claudia: \nANNA Claudia, aren't you coming? \nCLAUDIA I'm certainly not going to swim across. ANNA We'll send the raft back to you. \nGIULIA And bring some cushions when you come, and a towel... \nClaudia nods assent, and remains there looking over the side and watching the water splash against the boat. Suddenly, she looks up at the sky and realizes that the sun has disappeared. Actually, it is hidden behind a cloud, and over on the horizon a group of other clouds have accumulated. \nThe sailor left aboard the yacht is now signaling the other sailor on the raft who, having deposited Sandro, Anna and Giulia on the beach, is returning to pick up Claudia. He sounds the depths with his oar and then shouts up: \nSAILOR Okay. Come ahead, come ahead. \nThe sailor aboard the yacht goes over to Claudia and says: \nSAILOR I'm taking the boat right up to the shore, and we'll let you get off from the gangplank as soon as we get there. \nThen he disappears inside and soon the yacht starts moving towards the shore. Claudia peers out over the landscape; the islands are sharply silhouetted against the sea and sky, the volcano on Stromboli smokes feebly, and in the distance a ship passes by. Claudia is plainly enchanted by the view. Then she collects her thoughts and slowly heads towards the cabin. \nPatrizia, seated at a small table inside the cabin, is busy working on a complicated jigsaw puzzle, which, once completed, is supposed to represent a typically classical scene. One by one, she selects the various pieces of cardboard and inserts them in their rightful places. Simultaneously, she is munching on some crackers spread with jam, and a piece of cold fruit. Beside her is Raimondo.  He is staring at Patrizia with such an intense expression that she becomes thoroughly annoyed and says to him, as she continues working at her puzzle: \n", "test1_id": 2034, "test2_input": "The train has just pulled into the station. The platform is completely empty and Claudia is the only one to board the train. She climbs up the steps and the door is closed behind her. A second later, she appears at the window, looks out briefly, then disappears into her compartment. The station master raises the signal for the engine to start, a short whistle is heard, and soon the train gets under way. \nSandro dashes out across the tracks, swings open one of the doors, and boards the train as it picks up speed and pulls away from the station. \nClaudia is seated in a corner near the window, looking out. She appears completely relaxed and totally drained of energy, fatigued after so much tension. After a few seconds, she turns around and is abruptly startled to see Sandro standing nearby in the corridor. He comes over to her compartment and takes a seat directly opposite to hers. Claudia is absolutely furious. \nCLAUDIA Go ahead, now say something! I want to know just what it is we have to say to each other. \nSandro remains silent, waiting for Claudia to settle down and calm herself. But she continues to reproach him. \nCLAUDIA Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come? \nSANDRO I don't know why. I just couldn't help it. \nCLAUDIA But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now. \nSANDRO I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not... \nCLAUDIA (deeply wounded) Oh, Sandro... \nSANDRO I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye? \nCLAUDIA For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly? \nSANDRO It takes even less. \nCLAUDIA But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me? \nSANDRO I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together. \nCLAUDIA No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off. \nSANDRO And what about you? \nCLAUDIA Me... I... I... Please leave me alone. \nSuddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor. The car is of an old type -- one half is first class, the other second. Claudia stops in front of a second-class compartment from which the sound of two voices is heard. One is that of a woman -- sweet, very delicate and very feminine; the other is that of a man with a Sicilian accent. Sandro joins Claudia. Standing there together they hear the conversation. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I work there but I'm really a stranger. \nMAN'S VOICE I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you. \nWOMAN'S VOICE And who is she? Does she work in Catania? \nMAN'S VOICE Yes, she takes care of the garden. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener. \nMAN'S VOICE So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another. \nWOMAN'S VOICE And what did they say about me? \nMAN'S VOICE They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort. \nThere is a moment of silence. Then, the sound of music is heard coming from the compartment. Claudia and Sandro look at one another with a smile on their faces. Then Claudia leans over to peek into the compartment. The woman is young; she has thick, wavy brown hair.  He is one of those typical seducers from the provinces, with black hair. There is a tiny radio between them. Sandro also takes a peek into the compartment. Then they withdraw as the two resume their conversation. \n", "test2_true": "MAN'S VOICE No, not like this one. \nWOMAN'S VOICE And why wouldn't we have one like this? \nMAN'S VOICE Because this is a Chinese radio. \nAnother pause. Sandro takes hold of Claudia's hand and presses it. She doesn't resist, but allows him to do it. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling. \nMAN'S VOICE But for you, what comes first: music or love? \nClaudia presses up close to Sandro, amused and, at the same time, obviously moved. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one. \nMAN'S VOICE Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music. \nClaudia laughs but she is still very upset. All of a sudden, she starts and looks out the little window. The train is coming into a station and is beginning to slow down. Claudia grabs Sandro by the sleeve and pulls him through the corridor. Sandro tries to resist. \nSANDRO Claudia, listen to me... \nCLAUDIA No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor... \nShe continues to drag him through the corridor, until they finally reach the platform. Then she opens the door. They are both highly emotional. Claudia is almost hysterical. \nCLAUDIA Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more... \nSANDRO But why, Claudia?... Why? \nSandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms. In the meantime, the train has come to a stop in the station. Sandro pauses to look at Claudia once more. \nSANDRO Even if you chase me away, I... Claudia, let's not wait any longer... After, it will be too late ... Come with me. \nClaudia is visibly battling with herself. Then, in one last moment of decision, she pushes Sandro towards the door and goes back into the car. \nOnce on the ground, Sandro walks back and forth along the platform to see if he can find Claudia, hoping she might look out the window to wave goodbye. But she doesn't appear. The train starts to move, as Sandro desperately tries to catch a glimpse of Claudia. But she is not to be seen. Sandro starts running along the platform, but the train is now going too fast. He stops -- angry, disappointed and upset. \nAt the entrance-way of a luxurious villa, Claudia, who has just arrived, is greeted by the Princess. She is an elderly woman, rather ordinary in appearance but very aristocratic in taste and manner. \nPRINCESS Did you have a good trip? It is such a magnificent day! I am very happy that Sicily is able to give you so warm a welcome. And you do deserve it. You're such a lovely blonde. Come, my dear. \nClaudia smiles, and follows the Princess into the garden. \nPRINCESS And where are you from? \nCLAUDIA From Rome. \nPRINCESS Oh, how nice! So, you're from Rome... And would you happen to know of some intelligent clergyman in Rome who might be willing to come here and stay with us? We have our own private little chapel... It is a masterpiece, with seventeenth-century frescoes... and the remains of all our dead ancestors, a wonderful collection... He would find it very convenient there, and could say his own masses. Then he would have to spend a little time with my husband, who never sees anyone, to keep him occupied. \nCLAUDIA An intelligent clergyman, Princess? But I think the intelligent clergymen of today have so many other things to do. \nPRINCESS Well, perhaps one with a little physical handicap. One who is slightly lame, for example. \n", "test2_id": 2035, "test3_input": "SANDRO Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement, what disorder! They were very much concerned with scenographic effects... an extraordinary sense of liberty... \nThere is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene before him. Then, giving voice to a sincere thought, he exclaims: \nSANDRO Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas... \nCLAUDIA And why did you drop them? \nSANDRO Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs. \nClaudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment, and Sandro becomes aware of it. \nSANDRO Why are you looking at me like that? \nCLAUDIA I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things. \nSANDRO I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays? \nThe last words are spoken with a deep sense of sadness, Sandro avoiding Claudia's glance. He laughs to himself and for a while remains silent. He takes another look up at the dark outlines of the buildings, then turns to Claudia. \nSANDRO Claudia, let's get married? \nCLAUDIA (astonished) What! Get married? \nSANDRO Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say? \nCLAUDIA What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me? \nSANDRO You look at me as though I had said something foolish... \nCLAUDIA And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me? \nSANDRO That's why I asked you... \nCLAUDIA So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8. \nSandro smiles and playfully ruffles Claudia's hair. She also smiles, then slowly they both head towards the hotel. \nIt is morning inside the Hotel Trinacria.  Claudia has just had breakfast in her room and is almost finished dressing. It is a rather large room, set out with old pieces of furniture. The place is in a state of disarray, and the door leading into Sandro's room is wide open. Because of the general disorder, Claudia is unable to find her stockings. But instead of being angered by this, she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily. As she continues to look for her stockings, Sandro appears in the doorway. \nSANDRO Are you ready? \nClaudia comes up to Sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration. \nCLAUDIA (ironically) But why am I so infatuated with you? \nSANDRO (smiling) Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside... \nCLAUDIA Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away... \nShe starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to locate her stockings. Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music. It is a popular tune, wild and rhythmic, emanating from a publicity truck as part of some local advertising stunt. Claudia is overtaken by the music and cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for Sandro. Little by little, she starts swaying back and forth to the music. Then, kicking off her shoes, she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet. Sandro looks at her, amused but also somewhat impatient. \nSANDRO (leaving) Okay. I understand. See you later. \nClaudia rushes up to the door, and feigning an exaggerated attitude of despair, says: \n", "test3_true": "SANDRO As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square. \nClaudia is in a playful mood and she is anxious to demonstrate her exuberance. \nCLAUDIA (teasingly) Very well. But you must first tell me that when you go out without me it's like going out without one of your legs. Go ahead, have a look around the town all by yourself, but you'll have to hobble along on only one leg. And you must also tell me that you are filled with a great desire to embrace my shadow on the walls... Then you must tell me... (suddenly her tone of voice changes and she becomes quite serious) You must tell me that you love me. \nSandro replies with the same good-natured tolerance with which he had been watching Claudia as she danced her coquettish dance. \nSANDRO But you know it already. Why must I tell you? \nCLAUDIA So, you wonder why? \nWithout waiting for him to answer, she goes back towards the center of the room and once again starts looking around for her stockings. Sandro begins to leave. \nSANDRO Then I'll see you later. \nCLAUDIA Okay. In a few minutes. \nSandro goes out the door. Claudia finally locates her stockings and proceeds to finish dressing. \nSandro comes out of the hotel and crosses over to the sunny square. He starts strolling down along a street which leads to a baroque church that opens up to a wide flight of stone steps. Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the fa\u0087ade of a large and magnificent old building. A few feet away from the fa\u0087ade, seated on a bench in the shade, is an old coachman whose horse is standing beside him with its head deep in a sack of hay. \nSandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed. He rings the bell but there is no answer. Then he notices a time schedule posted on the door indicating visiting hours. After glancing at it, he walks over to the seated coachman. \nSANDRO It's closed. Isn't there any custodian or caretaker inside? \nCOACHMAN (apathetically) Nobody there. \nSANDRO But it says it's open from 9:30 to 10:30., and it's ten o'clock now...  That's a fine way to greet tourists. \nCOACHMAN Tourists? Last year a few Frenchmen came here and they all walked around in their bathing suits. So they were made to understand that it was better if they didn't come at all. \nSandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door opening and a man appears.  Sandro goes over to him. \nSANDRO Are you the custodian? \nCUSTODIAN Yes, come right in. \nSandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy architectural design, though somewhat in a state of decay. The custodian goes on his way and Sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men are studying the architecture. On hearing Sandro's footsteps, they turn around for a moment, then resume their observation. They are, in fact, young architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain architectural details. They do this with an extraordinary interest, almost with a sense of religious zeal. Sandro continues to stroll through the courtyard. His footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the otherwise absolute silence. The two young students exchange words between each other but they speak in faint whispers, almost as though they were inside a church. \nSandro gazes up at the arcades, the columns, the windows. He is obviously filled with a painful sense of regret, resentful and bitter. He turns to look at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his presence. But he is unable to ignore them; they plainly annoy him. In a certain sense, they humiliate him. He turns away and heads towards the exit, walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise. Then he goes out, quietly closing the door behind him. \nIn the hotel lobby, a maid is cleaning and dusting, and at the same time, singing little snatches from a popular romantic tune. The hotel manager, who is busy writing something in the register behind the desk, looks up and says: \nHOTEL MANAGER Go ahead, keep right on singing... \nDisappointed, the maid immediately stops singing, and the manager resumes writing. But she quickly looks up again as she hears footsteps coming down the stairs. It is Claudia. \nHOTEL MANAGER (to Claudia) Excuse me for interfering, but I've heard about that girl... Here in this place one gets to know about everything... That girl you're looking for... Why don't you try asking at the youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the young girls traveling through here end up there. \nClaudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to ask for additional information. But she is suddenly distracted by Sandro who enters the lobby at that very moment. \nCLAUDIA I was just coming out to meet you. How come you're back so soon? \n", "test3_id": 2036}

ARRIVALS AGENT Welcome back, amigos! Anything to declare? 
PAPÁ JULIO As a matter of fact, yes. 
The family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive. 
MIGUEL Hola. 
The arrivals agent's jaw literally drops. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION 
Miguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across an arching second floor walkway. 
VOICE OVER P.A. Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta Gonzales-Ramos, please report to Level 7. 
Dante happily trots alongside.       Miguel looks up to see gondolas traveling by. 
MIGUEL Whoa... 
Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel notices Tío Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation. 
TÍO OSCAR I miss my nose... 
At the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with "DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS." The family passes through. 
INT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS 
Inside, they find case workers helping travelers work out holiday snafus. 
DISTRESSED TRAVELER C'mon! Help us out amigo... We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight... 
CUT TO: 
MIFFED WIFE We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's family for Día de Muertos! 
CUT TO: 
In a far corner, one traveler in particular is raising hell. 
MAMÁ IMELDA I demand to speak to the person in charge! 
A beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mamá Imelda tears into her. 
CASE WORKER I'm sorry, señora, it says here no one put up your photo-- 
Mamá Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's desk. 
MAMÁ IMELDA My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies! 
In a swift movement, Mamá Imelda removes her shoe and smacks the computer. 
PAPÁ JULIO Mamá Imelda? 
She turns her shoe on Papá Julio, who leans back and yelps. Mamá Imelda softens. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda. 
PAPÁ JULIO Well, we never made it to the ofrenda... 
MAMÁ IMELDA What?! 
PAPÁ JULIO We ran into... um... 
Mamá Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel. 
Miguel looks at Mamá Imelda.       Her photo flashes before him. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel? 
MIGUEL Mamá Imelda... 
MAMÁ IMELDA What is going on? 
Just then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out. 
CLERK You the Rivera family? 
The computer short circuits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLERK'S OFFICE 
CLERK Well, you're cursed. 
The family gasps. 
MIGUEL What?! 
The clerk searches through a huge stack of papers. 
CLERK Día de los Muertos is a night to GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from the dead. 
MIGUEL But I wasn't stealing the guitar!

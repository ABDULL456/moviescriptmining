{"train": "CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND a screenplay by \nCharlie Kaufman \nbased on \nCONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND \nan unauthorized biography by Chuck Barris \nthird draft (revised) May 5, 1998 \nMUSIC IN:   OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL \nTEXT, WHITE ON BLACK: \nThis film is a reenactment of actual events. It is based on Mr. Barris's private journals, public records, and hundreds of hours of taped interviews. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT \nSUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981 \nIt's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street. \nINT. CAB - CONTINUOUS \nLooking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a \"P\" insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet); .38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays). \nGONG SHOW \nAn excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer. \nPERFORMER Why'd they do that? I wasn't done. \nBARRIS (AGE 50) I don't understand. Juice, why'd you gong this nice man? \nJAYE P. MORGAN Not to be.     That is the answer. \nThe studio audience laughs. \nINT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT \nThe cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags. \nGONG SHOW \nChuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points at it. \nBARRIS We'll be right back with more stuff. \nINT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT \nThe back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes. The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands. The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change. \nTHE GONG SHOW \nChuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog. The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like \"Gong Show a New Low in Television\", \"The Dumbing of America\", and \"Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization.\" We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke. There is a knock at the door. \nBARRIS (mumbly) Fuck. Shit. Piss. \nNaked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge? Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty, young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in the background. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) (weakly) More stuff? \nBELLHOP Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you requested. Except I couldn't find a... (consults list) ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine. \nBARRIS Well, it's late. (mumbling and bowing) But thank you. Thank you for trying. You are a scholar and a... \nBarris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a scholar and a... \nBarris trails off. \nBELLHOP (eyes averted) Thank you, sir. \nSuddenly Barris becomes agitated. \nBARRIS Why are you not looking at me like that? Do I look ugly to you? (runs to the mirror) It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping, see. I have a lot on my... \nBarris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts to make conversation. \nBELLHOP (re: exploded tv) Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir? \nYoung Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another boy, as a crowd of children look on. \nBARRIS (V.O.) A constant, inarticulate rage leading to fist fight after fist fight. \nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING \nYoung Barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning sunlight pouring through his bedroom window. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS (V.O.) The calm I felt watching dust suspended in the early morning sunlight. \nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT \nYoung Barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a man walking upstairs. The young boy is clearly terrified. \nBARRIS (V.O.) I remember fear. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING \nToddler Barris watches his mother change clothes. He studies her pendulous breasts. She looks down, smiles warmly. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Love. \nMOTHER You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie? \nBARRIS (AGE 4) Yes. \nMOTHER I bet you would like to be a mommy some day, wouldn't you? \nBARRIS Yes, mommy. Please. \nMOTHER C'mere, you. \nHis mother lifts the little boy to her breasts and presses his face against them. He is in heaven. \nINT. CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY \nFour year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with several other four year olds. They all wear party hats. Barris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in birthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit candles. He leads the children in \"Happy Birthday Dear Chuck\" as young Chuck beams. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Rejection. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nChuck glances at the kitchen doorway. His mother stands there, staring at him. She dressed in black mourning clothes, complete with veil. \nINT. NURSERY - DAY \nYoung Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair and holds Barris's infant sister. She fusses with the bows and frills on the baby's outfit. The light in the room is golden and warm. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Expulsion. \nWe move in on the little boy's devastated face, then follow him as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nA sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily tossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing of scales on a bass violin. \nBARRIS (V.O.) When I was sixteen I had an experience with my little sister's friend Tuvia that left an indelible impression. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia? \nTUVIA I don't know who that is. \nBARRIS Of course you don't. (beat) Why are you waiting around anyway, listening to this cacophonous cacophony, when you could be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings? \nTUVIA I don't know what anything you say means. \nBARRIS No.    You wouldn't, would you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBarris watches Tuvia playing with the dog. She gets on all fours and yelps, imitating the dog. This excites the dog, who bounces around her. Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white underwear for a while. This excites Barris. Finally he pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over his pants. We hear him unzip his fly. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Hey. \nTUVIA (not looking) What? \nBARRIS Hey, Tuvia. \nTUVIA (turning) Wha-at?! \nTuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan. She gets quiet. \nThe tourists \"ooooh.\" Another tour group comes around a corner. This one is led by Georgia, a perky, blonde southern girl. The two groups squeeze past each other. Chuck tries to make eye contact with Georgia. He smiles at her, but she ignores him. \nINT. NBC COMMISSARY - DAY \nBarris is at the cash register paying for his food. He looks around for a place to sit. He spots Georgia, sitting with a female friend, and he sits at a table behind, so as to listen unobserved to their conversation. \nGIRLFRIEND That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda cute, huh? \nGEORGIA Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but what you want is a man who's goin' places. A go-getter on the management fast-track. \nBarris registers this information. \nINT. NBC PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY \nBarris stands at the counter talking to a female clerk. \nBARRIS Management trainee application, please. \nThe clerk hands him an application without looking up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS (CONT'D) How many people applying for this so far? \nCLERK (calculating) Let's see, including you... about two thousand. \nBARRIS For how many positions? \nCLERK (looking up and smiling) Five. \nINT.

BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nYoung Barris is having sex with Georgia. They finish. Barris rolls off her and onto his back. Georgia sighs. \nGEORGIA Tell me again. \nBARRIS Head of network sales at thirty.   Head of the entire network at forty. \nGEORGIA And? \nBARRIS (rote) Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all my millions left to you. \nGEORGIA You're wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck Barris, management trainee. \nShe climbs on top of Barris and begins kissing him all over. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Life was sweet. For a minute. \nINT. BARRIS'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nGeorgia is looking radiant as she reads a movie magazine. Barris enters. She runs over to kiss him. \nGEORGIA Baby doll! \nBARRIS I got fired. \nShe pulls away, studies him for a moment, lets it sink in. \nGEORGIA Fired? \nBARRIS Fired.   F-I-R... \nGEORGIA Fired?   What the fuck did you get fired for?! \nBARRIS I don't know, efficiency cutback. Some bullshit... Look, it's gonna be... \nGEORGIA Well, I'm pregnant, you fuck! \nBARRIS Pregnant? \nGEORGIA Yeah, pregnant! \nBARRIS What the fuck did you get pregnant for?! \nGEORGIA What do you mean, what the fuck did I get pregnant for? You got me fucking pregnant, you fuck! \nBARRIS Well, fuck you. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nBarris sits drunkenly at the bar.   He talks to a drunken guy next to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nYoung Barris watches happily from behind the cameras. He spots, Debbie, a pretty, bland young woman with headphones and a clipboard. He sidles over to her. \nBARRIS Hi. \nDEBBIE What? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Hi! \nDEBBIE Oh. \nBARRIS I wrote this song. \nDEBBIE Oh.    Uh-huh. \nBARRIS It's number three on the pop charts. \nBarris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof. \nDEBBIE Huh. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nBarris and Debbie are having dinner. \nBARRIS See, I believe there's a great future in television. \nDEBBIE Uh-huh. \nBARRIS So I'm going to take my royalties and create a pilot. A pilot is what they call a test tv show. \nDEBBIE I work in tv. \nBARRIS Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I believe there's a great future in game shows. \nDEBBIE That's good. \nBARRIS Everyone loves game shows, right? \nDEBBIE I don't know. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Well, they do. \nDEBBIE That's great then. \nBARRIS I'm on my way! \nThere is a long, awkward silence.    They both saw away at their steaks. \nINT. DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBarris and Debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical. They're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their steaks. When it's over, they both just lie there. \nINT. DEBBIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nYoung Barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi- darkness and stares out the window. The front door unlocks and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway. She turns on the light. This is Penny Pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a black leotard and skirt and black mascara. She has red hair. She sees Barris on the couch. \nPENNY Hello. \nBARRIS Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie. \nPENNY Yeah, I figured. \nPenny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter, and enters the kitchenette. Barris watches her ass. \nPENNY (CONT'D) You hungry? \nBARRIS Um, no thanks. \nPENNY Thirsty? \nBARRIS If you have a beer. \nPenny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris.      She sits in a chair across from him. They both drink. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPENNY So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always wondered. \nBARRIS (a little taken aback) It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking. \nPENNY No problem. I just got fucked by this drummer cat. A really righteous Negro hipster. \nEXT. ABC BUILDING - DAY \nPenny leans on a signpost smoking a cigarette.

Oh my God! We gotta go celebrate!     Let's go roller skating! \nPenny kisses Barris. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS I can't, Pen. I got a date. \nPENNY Okay.     That's cool.    Call me after. \nBARRIS Yeha, okay. I will. \nBarris walks off.       We stay on Penny smoking her cigarette. \nMUSIC IN: DATING GAME THEME \nTHE DATING GAME PILOT BEING MADE, QUICK SHOTS OF: \nBARRIS TENSELY DIRECTING ACTIVITY ON THE SET. \nGIGGLY BACHELORETTE ASKING QUESTION. \nGAWKY BACHELORS MUGGING. \nTOOTHY HOST GUFFAWING. \nACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.) I figured I was in. All I had to do was get the pilot made and I'd be a millionaire. Everyone would love me. \nMUSIC OUT SUDDENLY. \nEXT. TERRACE - DAY \nACTUAL BARRIS (staring off) Was anyone ever so young? \nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY \nBarris, 32, lies on his bed on his back and tosses the football in the air. A very very very old dog lies on the floor. Phoebe, Barris's 26 year old sister enters. \nPHOEBE Chuck... \nBARRIS Albert's dead. \nPHOEBE Well, he led an amazingly long life. \nBARRIS Still, it's hard to go on. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPHOEBE Y'know, you've been staring out this window for six months now. \nBARRIS I'm trying to come up with new tv shows, if you must know. Okay? That's what I'm doing. I believe there's a real future in tv. (holds up notebook, shakes it) Look. Ideas. Okay? \nPHOEBE You're thirty-two years old, and you have no career and no prospects. \nBARRIS Thanks for the status report, Phoebe. Look, I just gotta come up with the right concept. Then, boom. (holds up notebook again) Which, by the way, I've almost got. \nPHOEBE You're breaking mom's heart.     You know that, don't you? \nBarris looks out the window at his emaciated mother sitting in the yard in an old wicker-backed wheelchair and staring off into space. \nBARRIS Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my being born broke mom's heart. \nBarris watches his mother for a long moment. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name, Tuvia, anymore? \nPHOEBE Who? \nBARRIS Tuvia.   Your friend.   Tuvia.   The girl. \nPHOEBE Oh. No. I heard something. I think she got divorced recently or something. \nChuck stops chewing. \nBARRIS Jesus. \nBYRD I'm happy to report you fit our profile, Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this work? \nLong pause. \nBARRIS Well, what's the profile? \nBYRD Are you interested in this work, Mr. Barris? \nBARRIS Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent. Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck beautiful Eastern European women. Wear a trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick. \nBYRD The work we do is very serious. It's essential in quelling the rise of communism and allowing democracy to gain its rightful foothold around the globe. \nBARRIS Sure.    Yeah. Okay.   That's good. \nEXT. ABANDONED ARMY BASE - DAY \nThe place is ramshackle and overgrown.   It looks deserted.    A barbed-wire fence surrounds it. \nINT. BASE REC ROOM - DAY \nA severe-looking instructor is teaching a class to an assembled group of scary-looking men: losers, psychos, mercenaries, Latin American thugs, and Chuck Barris. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINSTRUCTOR #1 There are several efficient methods of killing a man, were you to find yourself without a weapon. The edge of your hand against the adversary's Adam's apple. (demonstrates on mannequin) This will crush the windpipe causing strangulation and death. \nThe students take notes. \nINSTRUCTOR #1 (CONT'D) Boxing your adversary's ears with proper force will cause his ear drums to burst and possibly result in bleeding in the brain. And death. \nEXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT \nIt's dark. Byrd sits on a step, smoking a cigarette.     Barris approaches. \nBARRIS You're training me to be a killer. \nBYRD See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly bright. \nBARRIS I can't kill people.    My future is in television. \nBYRD Listen, you're thirty-two years old and you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three. Better get cracking. \nBARRIS I have ideas for shows. \nBYRD Oh, good. Why don't you spend another six months developing 'em while staring out the window at mommy's house next to poor dead Albert the dog. \nBARRIS How do you know all that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBYRD I know everything about you, Chuck. For fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk off with. \nBarris lifts his hands, tries to remember. \nBYRD (CONT'D) Right. Leave in the morning, if you want. But I'm here to tell you this is honest work for good pay. You'd be helping to make the world safer. And your country would be grateful. \nByrd rises, stubs out his cigarette in his hand. \nBYRD (CONT'D) It'll toughen you up. \nBarris sits there staring into the blackness. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nAnother big, frightening instructor stands before the class. Behind him is a full-sized diagram of a man which illustrates all major arteries and organs. He is demonstrating the proper way to grip a knife, then using the knife, he points to various sites on the body. \nAngle on Chuck Barris. He has copied the diagram of the man in his notebook and is writing \"Carotoid artery carries blood to brain. Death in seconds.\" He then writes: \"Game show idea: Slice of Life. Interesting!!\" \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nSeveral canvas dummies are propped up in the field. Barris and other students slash at the dummies with big knives. \nINT. WORKSHOP - DAY \nBarris and other students are assembling rifles. \nEXT. MUDDY FIELD - NIGHT \nBarris and other students crawl on their bellies through mud. \nINT. LABORATORY - DAY \nThe severe instructor, in a lab coat, is mixing chemicals. \nYOUNG BARRIS I was just -- \nBYRD (softening) I like you. I really do. And you're gonna do fine tomorrow. And we're gonna become great friends. And you're gonna have a very nice little career. But you've got to grow up. There's a war on. \nYOUNG BARRIS What war? \nBYRD (walking away) That's not your concern. \nINT. MEXICAN HOTEL ROOM   -   NIGHT \nIt's hot. There are two twin beds in the room. Byrd sleeps soundly in one. Barris lies in the other, eyes wide open. \nEXT. MEXICO CITY STREET - DAY \nRenda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking. \nBARRIS Excusa me, por favor, Senor. \nRenda stops. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros? \nRENDA No comprende. \nRenda tries to get away from this pesky tourist.   Barris follows him, calling after him. \nBARRIS Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares? \nRenda picks up his pace, as does Barris.   Benitez approaches. \nBENITEZ May I be of some assistance here? \nRenda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nRenda's in the back between Barris and Benitez. Brazioni drives. Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. The car drives slowly through the crowded Mexico City streets. They arrive at a jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big parade. It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with dancing skeletons. It's wild and frightening. Brazioni glances at Renda in the reaview mirror. \nBRAZIONI Day of the dead. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nThe car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first. His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun. He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car, looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls, the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out. He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading look in his eyes. \nRENDA Por favor. No me mates, senor.   Tengo tres bebes. Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air. His hand shakes.   He pulls out Spansh-English dictionary. \nBARRIS Again. \nRENDA Que? BARRIS Repitolo. Again. \nRENDA No me mates. Tengo tres bebes. Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes, startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away. Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Oh Christ.     Oh crap. \nBarris tries to stop Renda from screaming by covering the hole in Renda's face. Barris throws up, some of it landing on Renda's pants. He wipes his own mouth with his bloody hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More blood spatters Barris's clothing and face. The church bell continues to chime. \nINT. AIRPLANE - DAY \nBarris and Byrd sit side-by-side in first class.    This time Barris has the window seat and stares out. \nBYRD Beautiful country, isn't it? \nYOUNG BARRIS Yeah. \nBYRD You did us proud, Chuck. \nBarris doesn't say anything. \nBYRD (CONT'D) Renda was a bad guy. He really was. \nBARRIS Yeah. \nINT. APARTMENT - EVENING \nBarris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail. He flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror. \nBARRIS (V.O.) I had changed. I could see it in my eyes. Something dark. \nBarris notices a fleck on the side of his nose.    It's dried blood. He distractedly rubs at it. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nRenda's contorted face in close-up as he is shot.   Blood spurting. Echoey church bells chime. \nRENDA No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes. \nINT. APARTMENT - EVENING \nThe bachelorette makes a mock-horrified expression as the studio audience erupts in laughter. Barris buries his face in his hands. \nINT. DATING GAME SET - DAY \nA brunette bachelorette asks a question. \nBRUNETTE BACHELORETTE Bachelor number one, what nationality are you? \nHANDSOME BACHELOR Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well- Hung. \nThe audience goes wild.   Barris pulls at his hair. \nINT. DATING GAME SET - DAY \nA black bachelorette asks a question. \nBLACK BACHELORETTE Bachelor number three, I play the trombone. If I blew you, what would you sound like? \nThe audience screams with delight. \nINT. BOARD ROOM - DAY \nLeonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris sit around a conference table and watch a tv. On it is The Dating Game. A black bachelor is responding to the trombone question.   He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls. Barris has his head in his hands. Goldberg signals an assistant, who switches off the television. The executives look quite grim. \nGOLDBERG Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are unairable. \nBARRIS Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't control what people say. \nEXECUTIVE Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't have black men getting blow jobs on national television! \nGOLDBERG The point isn't that he's black, Hank. \nEXECUTIVE (beat) Well, I know that. That's not what I meant. \nBARRIS Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these shows. Right? And that's good. Show business must avoid indifference at all costs. \nEXECUTIVE Even when taste is involved? \nBARRIS Taste is just a word. \nEXECUTIVE You don't fuck with taste, my friend! \nBARRIS (uncomprehending) What does that even mean?   I don't even under -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGOLDBERG Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That's it. If you can't figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the contestants being lewd, we're going to have to pull the show. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nBarris is drunk and brooding. He picks a fight with a big man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar. Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp. This gives him an idea. \nINT. DATING GAME SET - DAY \nThe contestants are onstage.   Barris appears, warm and charming. \nBARRIS Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Jenks of the Federal Communications Commission. \nThe severe training camp instructor joins Barris onstage. \nINSTRUCTOR #1 (increasingly psychotic) Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast. The penalty for this disgusting, un-American behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both. Anyone making a sick, subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately. I will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a long drive to that prison. Just you and me. No other witnesses -- \nBARRIS (jumping in) Any questions? \nThere are none. The contestants are paralyzed with fear. Jenks is red-faced, trembling. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Okay.   Have fun, everybody!' \nEXT. TERRACE - DAY \nThe actual Barris being interviewed. \nACTUAL BARRIS Sometimes as a younger man I stretched the truth to get what I wanted. \"Through all the lying days of my youth/I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I may whither into the truth.\" Yeats. You heard of him? \nINTERVIEWER (O.C.) Yeah.   Of course. \nACTUAL BARRIS Sure you have. (beat) Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired and become a big hit. A phenomenon, really. \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE, BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY \nSUBTITLE: BARRIS PRODUCTIONS, LOS ANGELES, 1967 \nThis is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed. Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles, lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. Barris, 36, is behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. He wears a t- shirt and jeans and loafers. This is a new Barris, confident and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. Outside in the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and screaming of a busy but casual office. \nBARRIS (into phone) Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye. \nBARRIS Have you noticed, Jim, I've got a tv show on the air? I don't need to kill people for hire anymore. \nBYRD I know you don't need to.    But you'd like to. \nBARRIS That's insane. \nByrd shrugs, unconvinced.    He sips his drink. \nBYRD Think of it as a hobby. An avocation. Something you do to relax. You can be an assassination enthusiast, a murder bug. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS I've got important things to think about here. I don't have time to fuck around with you. \nBYRD Okay, I'll help you out with your little show. Tit for tat. That's the kinda guy I am. I've seen this Dating Game of yours, Chuck. And I have a thought. \nBARRIS What, now you're a television producer? \nBYRD Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you. \nBARRIS Let's hear it then. \nBYRD Well, what do you have now? The couple gets sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right? Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious- living boobs out in TV-land. \nBARRIS Yeah, what's your point? \nBYRD Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast Asia, for example. \nBARRIS The network's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together. \nBYRD (shrugs) Send 'em with a chaperone. Some respectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch. \nBARRIS (considering) Y'know, that's not half bad. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBYRD I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say we have a job for you in Austria. You, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam! you take care of some Company business. It's the perfect cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative by night. \nBARRIS I told you, I don't have to kill people for money anymore. \nBYRD Chuck, when I said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money. Some of it, but very little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck. I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but you botched it. Don't you want to get really good at something, Chuck? \nBarris stares at Byrd. \nINT. BOOTH (DATING GAME SHOW) - DAY \nThe director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not- too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp chatter in the booth. \nDIRECTOR (rapidly) Ready one, take one. Ready three, take three. Ready one, take one. \nBLONDE BACHELORETTE Number one, can you please tell me what a girl is like who hasn't been on a date before and how you can tell she hasn't been on a date before? \nDIRECTOR Ready two, take two.   This guy has never been on a date. \nEveryone in the booth laughs. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFAT BACHELOR Well... \nBARRIS Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy.   This is just too good. \nFAT BACHELOR ... I'll ask her what she likes to do and \nDIRECTOR Ready one, take one.   Ready two, take two. \nFAT BACHELOR And if she doesn't know what she likes to do -- \nDIRECTOR Ready three, take three. The only date he's ever had is with his right hand. \nGuys in booth laugh, except Barris. \nFAT BACHELOR ... then I'll know she hasn't done it yet. \nEXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS - DAY \nSUBTITLE:    LONDON, 1967 \nIt's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along, taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and Barris. Barris seems bored. \nINT. PUB - DAY \nBarris enters the pub alone. He's dressed in a blonde wig and moustache and glasses. It's crowded and he searches the room for someone. He spots a pretty young woman by herself at a table. She wears white go-go boots. \nBARRIS Excuse me, is this seat taken? \nBARRIS (CONT'D) C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you something neat. It's okay. \nThe fat bachelor enters the courtyard. \nEXT. TERRACE - DAY \nACTUAL BARRIS I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor. He was ugly and fat and stupid. More life wouldn't have changed that for him. No woman would ever have loved him. That's just the brutal truth, y'know? \nINT. LONDON HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBarris enters the room, shaky and scared. \nINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nBarris rips open the Polaroid box, pulls out the foil paper that protects the film, rips that open and pulls out a small white plastic vial. Barris greases the vial with Vaseline and sticks it up his ass. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe looks at himself in the mirror, naked and pathetic. There is a knock at the door. He stiffens, grabs his gun and pads out of the bathroom. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nBarris peeks out the peephole.   We see a fish-eye view of Patricia Watson. \nBARRIS Olivia? \nPATRICIA It's Patricia, actually. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER \nBarris and Patricia sit sipping champagne.   Both are drunk. \nPATRICIA ... and so then I spent a year in Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war movement as an agent provocateur, nudging it toward violence in order to discred it. That was fun. I got to wear granny glasses. \nBARRIS Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd you come up here tonight? \nPATRICIA I don't know. You're sort of cute in a homely way. And it's always lonely when that civilian you're fucking calls out the name off your fake passport. \nBARRIS \"All the information I have about myself is from forged documents.\" \nPATRICIA Nabokov. \nBarris is thrilled and kisses her. It begins to turn hot and heavy. Suddenly Barris pulls away. \nBARRIS Actually, I just gotta go into the bathroom and take care of something. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPATRICIA No, baby.    Leave the microfilm in. \nEXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY \nA plane lands. \nINT. KENNEDY AIRPORT TERMINAL, CUSTOMS - DAY \nBarris waits sweatily in line with a small a carry-on suitcase. When the line moves, he walks as if perhaps he has something up his ass. A customs agent walks past the line with a dog. The dog sniffs Barris's ass in passing. \nEXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY \nBarris steps out of the terminal. A black limo pulls up. The back door opens and Barris gets in. \nINT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS \nSeated in the back are Jim Byrd and Simon Oliver, 50. Oliver is pure ivy league with a pipe. When he speaks it is with an affected British accent. Byrd is pissy. \nBYRD Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver. \nBARRIS Hey. \nBYRD Everything go okay?    You don't look too good. \nOLIVER Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that understood? \nBARRIS You're welcome, pal. \nOLIVER Do I make myself clear? \nBARRIS Fuck you!    They're my contestants. \nOLIVER Amateur. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nREAL ESTATE AGENT (beat) Very good, sir. \nINT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBarris and Penny are having sex on the floor. \nPENNY So, man, are you seeing anyone? \nBARRIS Nobody serious. You? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPENNY No.   I think we should get married. \nBARRIS Aw, Pen, don't start -- \nPENNY No, listen, it makes sense. You and I feel exactly the same about marriage, right? How much bullshit it is, right? And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small. So, it makes sense. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBarris, 50, types away. He is sweaty and naked except for a towel draped over his head. \nBARRIS (V.O.) I liked Penny. I even loved her in my way. But the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life... I remember my parents' marriage. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHILDHOOD KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBarris, five, sits at the dinner table with his parents. His father, dressed in a dental smock, stares down at his plate as he eats. His mother absently chews and stares vacantly into space. \nMOTHER We need a new ice box. \nThe father shrugs. \nINT. DATING GAME SET - DAY \nThe set, which holds four couples, divides in the middle to reveal a new refrigerator. \nANNOUNCER A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer with automatic ice maker! \nOne of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically, happy and in love and kissing. The other couples look disappointed and angry at their spouses. \nWe pull back to reveal we're watching this on a tv in: \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - MORNING \nThe office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like employees watching The Newlywed Game. Many sit on the floor, jammed up against each other. A few women are nursing infants. Someone passes a joint. Barris sits behind his desk, with a \"Make Love Not War\" helmet on his head, his feet up, and a guitar in his lap. \nBARRIS Beautiful. Did you see that? How much they loved each other just then? That's what it's all about, kiddies. \nEveryone agrees.   Someone switches off the tv. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Okay, guys, new business. We're winning our slots every week. \nEveryone cheers. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) But that means we need you Bandits to get on the contestant mill. Our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be introducing three new shows in the coming months: The Parent Game, The Game Game, and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty Pageant, so we're gonna really need you guys to carry your weight. Nuff said. Any other business? \nEMPLOYEE #1 Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got two. \nBARRIS Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are you? \nRICK Here.    No, it's not true. \nBARRIS Any other witnesses to this alleged infraction? \nEMPLOYEE #2 I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Rick, you're dead meat, buddy. (shoots Rick with finger) I sentence you to... dance for us in today's post-meeting version of \"Out of Limits\" featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers. \nEveryone cheers. \nRICK Aw, Chuck. \nBARRIS Get up here, you rascule, you. \nRick heads up to Barris's desk. Everyone laughs. A few employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments. They break into a raucous banjo version of \"Out of Limits.\" Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping. \nMONTAGE \nAs \"Out of Limits\" continues, now the actual version, we see montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many game shows, happily directing the bustling activity. \nINT. RANCH-STYLE LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe actual Jim Lange, host of The Dating Game. \nMONICA Have a seat. \nBarris sits on the couch. Monica sits next to him. Mindy is in the background, futzing around in the kitchen area. \nMONICA (CONT'D) So... have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, Chuck? \nBARRIS (beat) Yes, I have. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MONICA'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER \nBarris, Monica, and Mindy sit on the couch watching a religious show on television. \nEXT. TERRACE - DAY \nACTUAL BARRIS Yeah, I remember that religious girl, sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam I ever experienced. It took a little more work than usual, but I got in there, baby. (smacks lips, then stares off into space) It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam, it just doesn't go away. This is the great tragedy of getting old. \nINT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY \nThe room is abuzz with activity. Lots of people on the phone talking. A potential Newlywed Game couple being interviewed. Monica sits in the waiting area, eavesdrops on the interview with the Newlywed Couple. \nWOMAN Getting married to Alan is the best thing I've ever done. It's just so wonderful knowing that you've got someone by your side through everything for he rest of your life. \nThe couple kisses. \nLORETTA 'kay, Mon.     He's off. \nMonica enters the office. \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMonica enters.   Barris wears a deerstalker cap. \nBARRIS My sweet little clamato. \nMonica leans down and kisses Barris. \nMONICA I'm pregnant. \nBarris's eye twitches. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONICA (CONT'D) (crying) I can't be pregnant, Chuck. \nBARRIS Is it mine? \nMonica looks at him incredulously, flings an ashtray at him, misses. She sits at the desk, looks glumly out the window. \nMONICA I can't believe you asked me that. \nBARRIS I know. I'm sorry. (beat) But you're sure, right? \nMONICA I hate you so much right now. \nBARRIS Look, we'll take care of it. \nMONICA How?    Are you gonna marry me? \nBARRIS (carefully) Well, no. Not at this point. \nMONICA I'm not murdering my baby! (weeping) I can't... do that. Please... \nBarris sighs.    He touches Monica's hand. \nINT.

Barris opens it. \nBARRIS Here we are. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMONICA (collapsing) I can't I can't I can't I can't... \nBarris supports her and leads her into the office. \nBARRIS It's okay.     It'll be okay. \nEXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN, UCLA - DAY \nLORETTA Chuck? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNo response. \nLORETTA (CONT'D) Chuck? \nBARRIS (not turning) Uh. \nLORETTA Rod Flexner's here. \nBARRIS Shit piss fuck, send him in. \nFlexner enters.    He's a suit. \nFLEXNER Chuck!    Great to see you. \nBARRIS What's up, Rod? \nFLEXNER Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your shows aren't doing too well in the old ratings war. The Family Game, for one. \nBARRIS Okay. \nWe move into Barris's eyes. \nINT. FAMILY GAME SET \nThe show is in progress. Suddenly shots are fired from offstage. The host and contestants are slaughtered. It's bloody and violent. \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY \nWe're on Barris's eyes. \nFLEXNER And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite frankly, in the toilet, Chuck. \nINT. HOW'S YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW SET \nA mother-in-law is being garotted with piano wire.   Her neck is sliced. Blood spurts. \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY \nFLEXNER Now, as you know, Dream Girl is flailing terribly. \nINT. DREAM GIRL SET \nDream Girls lie bloody and flailing all over the set. \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY \nFLEXNER And The Game Game has no life in it at all. \nINT. GAME GAME SET \nThe contestants on the set are all bloody and dead. An applause light flashes on and off, but the audience members are also dead. \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - DAY \nFLEXNER So I've been put in the unfortunate position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four of these shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm just the messenger. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nBarris drinks alone.   He's sullen and sauced. \nBARRIS (to bartender) They killed my babies. Just like that. I pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly. Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these people? \nBARTENDER The fucking bastards. \nBARRIS What am I gonna do now? (sees pretty woman) Hey there, can I buy you a drink? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLARGE MAN What are you blind, asshole?   This lady's with me. \nBARRIS (screaming) Fuck you! \nThe large man stands to face Barris. He is very large. Barris stands. The man swings at Barris. Barris easily deflects the punch, grabs the man's forearm and breaks it with a sickening crack. The man screams. Barris gets him in a chokehold from behind. The man whimpers and gags. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Let's see, if I remember correctly, the next move breaks your neck, which kills you instantly or paralyzes you. Depending on your luck. \nLARGE MAN Please. \nBARRIS (lets go) Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead. \nThe large man hurries from the bar. Everyone in the bar, including the large man's date, watches Barris. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) (to the woman) Hi. I'm Chuck Barris, tv producer.   Have you ever done any acting? \nPicard drives fast. Barris eyes him suspiciously, fingers his gun. Picard spots a Fiat in his rearview mirror. \nPICARD Merde. KGB. They know who you are, Monsieur Barris. It is their intention to kill you very much in East Berlin. \nBarris checks in the passenger side mirror. \nBARRIS Merde!   MERDE! PICARD Not to worry, my friend. \nPicard speeds up dramatically, but continues to drive calmly. Barris is agitated. \nPICARD (CONT'D) I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to meet you. Do not worry, I am not KGB.            I do not want to kill you, I want you to live a long happy life and have many dancing grandchildren to admire. \nPicard screeches around a corner, then another one.            He's lost the Fiat, for the moment. \nEXT. QUIET EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING \nPicard's car stops at the curb. Picard and Barris emerge. Picard opens the trunk. He lifts out a big folded-up clump of rubber with a an engine mounted on it. \nBARRIS What the hell is that? \nPICARD Your ride, Monsieur Barris. \nPicard unfolds the rubber mass. He pulls a cord and it begins to inflate. It is an airplane, a one person inflatable plane. \nBARRIS No fucking way. \nPICARD It's quite reliable and easy to operate. It will get you over the wall. Or you can stay here. In the German Democratic Republic. I will arrange for you to get a good factory job. No, you must fly, like Daedalus before you, to the freedom of the west. \nBARRIS Christ.   What about you? \nPICARD They do not catch me, monsieur. This is my talent, to get away always. In guerre. In amour. This is my talent, and perhaps this is my curse. \nEXT. BERLIN WALL - DAY \nThe fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street, dipping and rising erratically. The noise is deafening. Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified.    He approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it. The plane is shot by a soldier. Air hisses out. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nBarris sits on a park bench.   Jim Byrd approaches, sits. \nBYRD (chuckling) So, did you have a nice flight? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying. \nBYRD Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were up to. You were there to kill Colbert, they were there to kill you. I'm thinking we got a mole. So much hate in the world, Chuck. \nBARRIS Am I in danger still? \nBYRD Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of business since yesterday, so far as I know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main concern should be: if they know who you are, they know who I am. \nBARRIS Fuck off.     What do we do? \nBYRD Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna do. You're lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in. \nINT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY \nBarris sits with a several network executive and some other staff members watching a fat man tap dance badly and, because of his weight, extremely loudly. It's painful for everybody to watch. The fat man finishes. \nBARRIS Thank you.     Thanks.   That was great. \nThe fat smiles and exits.       Barris puts his head in his hands. \nEXECUTIVE WOMAN I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak. \nBARRIS There's gotta be somebody in America with some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every week. \nThe executives look at each other. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Bring in the next thing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAn assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows enters with a guitar. She begins to sing a folk song, very sincerely, in a very off-key monotone. It's unbearable and depressing. Barris glances over at the executive; she's checking her watch again. The song is endless.    Barris's eyes grow cloudy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nThis is the same field where Renda was shot. Now, the folksinging woman is in the field singing. Barris pulls out a gun and aims it at the woman. Her eyes widen in terror, but she keeps singing. A church bell chimes and Barris shoots her. She flies back, spurting blood. Her guitar hits the ground with a twang. \nINT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY \nBarris snaps out of his fantasy with renewed energy      The folksinger is still droning on. \nBARRIS (ushering out) Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in touch. That was wonderful. \nWAITER Are you gentlemen ready to order? \nKEELER I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green salad. \nWAITER And for you, sir. \nKEELER Um, Just give me a steak.    Rare. \nWAITER Thank you. \nThe waiter leaves.    Keeler sips his drink, stares at Barris. \nKEELER \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called, for the night cometh wherein no man can work.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBARRIS That's Carlyle! \nKEELER Yes. \nBARRIS It's amazing you should quote him.   He's my hero. \nKEELER I read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman. Every smell, every nuance, you remember with a special allure, as if the acts had occured outside civilization, outside time. And when the allure is gone, you are condemned. \nBARRIS Condemned? \nKEELER I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend. \nBarris looks into Keeler's hollow eyes. \nEXT. TERRACE - DAY \nThe actual Barris puffs on his cigar. \nACTUAL BARRIS The next day I heard Keeler offed himself. \nEXT. L.A. HOTEL - NIGHT \nKeeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window. \nACTUAL BARRIS (V.O.) You never really know in the world of espionage if something labeled a suicide actually is a suicide. But he was dead. That I knew. \nINT. MARTONI'S - NIGHT \nBarris eats dinner with Penny.   Barris seems depressed. Penny is reserved. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPENNY When you called, I wasn't gonna come. \nBARRIS I'm glad you did, Pen. \nPENNY I said to myself, enough.      Enough of this jerk already. Enough. \nBARRIS I could see how you would feel that way. \nPENNY But I've come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology. It's called TA, Transactual Analysis. \nBARRIS Transactional Analysis. \nPENNY Now see, by correcting me you're responding as \"Parent\" to my \"Child.\" (authoritative voice) \"Here's the proper way to say this word, Penny.\" But that's okay. As long as we both understand that's what you're doing. Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's wrong, Chuck? Are you okay? \nBARRIS A guy I knew killed himself last night. \nPENNY My God. Everyone you know kills themselves. Or tries. Who is it this time? \nBARRIS You don't know him.   A stagehand. \nPENNY Why'd he do it? \nBARRIS He didn't like his work anymore. \nPENNY Is being a stagehand really bad or something? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBARRIS (beat) Yeah, it's pretty bad. \nPatricia storms up to the table. \nPATRICIA You were supposed to meet me at The Palm two hours ago. \nBARRIS Oh fuck, I forgot. \nPENNY Who is this? \nBARRIS I'll take it! Don't hang up! \nBarris picks up the phone. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Hello? \nTUVIA (O.S.) Hello, is this Chuck Barris? \nBARRIS Yes. \nTUVIA (O.S.) Oh, this is Tuvia Feldman.    I don't know if you remember me -- \nBARRIS Of course I do. \nTUVIA (O.S.) I'm in town and I've been following your career and I wondered if you might want to get a drink. For old times sake. \nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY \nTuvia plays with the dog.    White panties are revealed. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Sweet Tuvia... \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY \nAdult Tuvia answers the door with her baby. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Ripe Tuvia. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nBarris waits in a booth, anxiously eyeing the door.      A guy approaches. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUY Hey, Chuck, I got a talent. \nBARRIS \nNot now. \nGUY Just take a second. \nThe guy gets down on all fours and starts barking and panting like a dog. It is a repulsive and frightening sight, but Barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off the guy. \nTUVIA (O.C.) Chuck? \nBarris tears his eyes away from the dog guy to look at Tuvia. She is an older middle-aged lady. Younger than Chuck, but clearly of no interest to him. The disappointment on his face is palpable. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) It's Tuvia! Remember? Hi! \nBARRIS (V.O.) Old Tuvia. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Hi. \nTUVIA You look great. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BAR - LATER \nBarris sits in a booth across from Tuvia. The relationship has shifted once again. Now middle-aged Tuvia is trying to flirt. As they talk, she touches his arm repeatedly. She laughs at everything he says. She reapplies lipstick as they talk. There's a quiet desperation in her eyes. Barris is pleasant but unengaged. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Ah, Tuvia. The fantasy of Tuvia forever cast out by the reality of Tuvia. Finally, because of my fame and her desperate straits, her poverty and single parenthood, she was going to submit to me. Finally I could've had her. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) I could've had what had so long eluded me. But now she was old and I wasn't interested. \nINT. TRAIN - NIGHT \nMiddle-aged Tuvia staring out at the night-time landscape in the darkened train car, her suitcase on the seat next to her. \nINT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBarris is having sex with two twenty year old nymphettes     The drugs and alcohol flow freely. He seems to be enjoying himself but there is a hollowness in his eyes. \nBARRIS (V.O.) Tuvia was old, but not me.   I was the Game Show King. \nINT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY \nThe rabid audience members chant, \"Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby...\" \nINT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nBarris snorts Coke in the darkness.He scans an article headlined: \"Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western Civilization.\" The phone rings, alarmingly breaking the stillness. \nBARRIS What? \nTELEPHONE VOICE Paul Picard is dead. \nEXT. EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING \nBARRIS (unenthused) Great. I'm just heading -- \nPARTY MAN #1 I have a talent I think you'd really appreciate. \nBARRIS Uh-huh. \nParty Man #1 begins farting \"Jingle Bells.\"   Barris   gets up and moves away. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPARTY MAN #1 (calling after) Hey, didn't you ever hear of Le Petomane? He was a star, buddy! These are totally smell-free! \nBarris settles by the fireplace.      A pretty woman approaches, smiling. \nPRETTY WOMAN Hi. \nBARRIS Hi. \nPRETTY WOMAN I thought it was you. \nBARRIS (bowing) It's me. \nPRETTY WOMAN I'm glad to meet you because I wanted to tell you that I've seen The Gong Show and I think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment today. \nBARRIS Well -- \nPRETTY WOMAN How dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity. \nBARRIS I don't think it's that loathsome. \nPRETTY WOMAN What is it then? To mock some poor, lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives. To destroy them. So everybody's not brilliantly talented. They're still people. They deserve respect and compassion. I mean, who the hell are you? What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you created The Dating Game. Wow, right up there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess that's what gives you the right to... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBARRIS Excuse me, I've got to -- \nBarris loses himself in the crowd.    He hurries past a guy who recognizes and starts chanting. \nPARTY MAN #2 Chuckie Baby! Chuckie Baby!     Chuckie Baby! \nBarris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door. \nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT \nBarris makes his way down the crowded street. People stare, turn their heads to gawk. We hear over and over again: \"Hey, isn't that Chuck Barris?\" and \"Hey, look, The Gong Show guy!\", and \"Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby!\" Barris smiles wanly and nods. People shove paper and pen in his face and he scribbles autographs without stopping. Sweat forms on his brow. His polyester shirt is drenched. \nBARRIS (V.O.) She was right. What the hell had I done with my life? \nAmong the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor he killed in London. He sports a bullet hole in his head Barris does a double take. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Wait, you're that guy. You're dead. This is screwy. \nFAT BACHELOR I only want to be loved. \nBARRIS That's all I fucking wanted! \nBarris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed, bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run. Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle- aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Mr. Barris? \nBARRIS No, I'm... \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN My name is Louise Wechsler and I'm here from Tulsa with my family and... \nBARRIS Please, I'm not feeling well. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Just a moment of your time. I love your show. And, well, I, sort of, have a talent myself. \nBARRIS You can stop by the office to audition tomorrow. \nThe woman continues to approach. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just wondering. See, I dance a little and I was just wondering -- \nThere's no way out of this.     Barris sighs. \nBARRIS Yeah, all right. Go ahead. \nBarris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly. Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Very nice. \nSomething in her hand glints in the light. Barris reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her. The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She straddles him and is about to stab him through the air. Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into his brain. The assailant slumps over. \n", "test1_input": "BYRD (O.S.) Over here, Strawberry-dick. \nBarris looks over and makes out Byrd sitting on a rock with a view of L.A. spread out in front of him. Barris joins him. \nBARRIS Jesus, how do you know these things? \nBYRD We even know what she actually thought it tasted like. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Really? I could never find that out. What did she think? \nBYRD It's a \"need to know\", my friend.   So tell me, what can I do you for? \nBARRIS I could really use an assignment, Jim. To straighten my head. \nBYRD I got something for your head. \nINT. DATING GAME SET \nA Dating Game couple waits anxiously for host Jim Lange to announce their destination. \nJIM LANGE ... and we're the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to beautiful... West Berlin! \nThe couple screams excitedly by reflect, but as the destination sinks in, their perplexity becomes apparent. \nEXT. WEST BERLIN STREET - DAY \nBarris and the Dating Game couple walk along. It's cold and gray and they all wear heavy coats. The couple wear cameras around their necks. Nobody looks happy. \nINT. BEER HALL - NIGHT \nBarris sits in the corner of this noisy, smoky place. He has a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken Germans in the background sing a song. Patricia Watson approaches and sits. Barris looks up and smiles. \nBARRIS Treesh. \nPATRICIA Leibchen. (kisses him, sits) So, here's what we got.   Name's Hans Colbert. (pulls out photos) Other side of the wall.   We don't like him very much. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS (singing Toot-toot-tootsie) Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye. \nPATRICIA You'll work with a kraut named Keeler. He's been trailing Colbert for a month now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a drunk, so you stay sober and take charge. \nBARRIS (collecting photos) Done and done. See you after? \nPATRICIA Prove how much you love me, baby.   Kill for me. Then I'm all yours. \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nBarris crawls through a long dirt tunnel. Telephone cables run along the floor. An occasional bare bulb lights the way. \nINT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY \nA middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and shaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing a hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at the shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a change of clothes, and continues shaving. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER \nBarris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes. We see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background. A car pulls up and Barris gets in. \nINT. CAR, RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY \nBarris sits in the parked car with Keeler, a heavyset, silent German man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth. He is constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook. There is a long silence. \nBARRIS What you writing, Sig? \nKEELER I am keeping track of all the goings on on this street. \nBarris looks out the window. There is nothing going on, yet Keeler keeps writing. More silence. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by. \nKEELER Yah.   I know how to do my job. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PARKED CAR - NIGHT \nBarris and Keeler are still in the car. Keeler continues to smoke and write. A well-rested, happy-looking Colbert walks by with a group of people. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PARKED CAR - AFTERNOON \n", "test1_true": "DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PARKED CAR - EVENING \nBarris and Keeler wait in the car. Colbert emerges from his house, alone, and walks toward the car. A drained Barris sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected force, Keeler swings open the passenger door. The door hits a stunned Colbert and sends him flying. Keeler races around the car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and jumps on top of him. Barris watches, surprised at the dramatic personality shift in Keeler. Keeler is strangling Colbert. A cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as he does this. Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him, so he can watch him die. \nKEELER (calmly to Barris) Under the seat, please. \nBarris reaches under the seat, pulls out a Polaroid camera. \nKEELER (CONT'D) Please, if you don't mind, a photograph. To remember. \nBarris is stunned, scared. He takes the photo. The flash illuminates the bulging-eyed Colbert and the calm Keeler. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nBarris types.   A knock at the door.   He looks up, panicked. \nBARRIS (falsetto) Who is it? \nHOUSEKEEPER (O.S.) Housekeeping, Mr. Barris. \nBarris looks around. The place is a disaster. Food wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing, plastic army men set up for battle. He gets up, puts on a hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the peephole for a long moment, and answers the door. The housekeeper is plump and kind-looking. \nBARRIS Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds. \nHOUSEKEEPER (looking around) Another rough night, huh? \nBARRIS (tapping his head) The human psyche is a wondrous thing. \nHOUSEKEEPER (smiling maternally) Yes, I know it is. (taking gun) We don't need this now, do we?    Why don't we just put this away? \nShe puts the gun in a drawer, starts to pick up.   Barris watches her, then: \nBARRIS Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your bosom for a little while? \nHOUSEKEEPER Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very good idea, Mr. Barris. \nBARRIS I'm sorry. You're right. I just... I'm just without... comfort of any sort, and I... please forgive me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHOUSEKEEPER (smiles at him) No harm done. \nBarris smacks himself in the head. \nBARRIS (bowing) Thank you. Thank you.      Thank you.   You are a scholar and... \nHOUSEKEEPER It's fine, sir. \nBARRIS Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God thinks of someone like me? \nHOUSEKEEPER God? \nBARRIS Yes, God. \nHOUSEKEEPER Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows have brought laughter and joy to millions of people. That's a very important thing, I think, in these difficult times. I would imagine God likes you very much. \nBarris smiles a rubber-band smile. \nBARRIS Thank you, that's very kind. (glances at her ample bosom) So... I should get back to... \nHOUSEKEEPER Yes, of course, sir. Don't mind me. \nBarris resumes typing.   The housekeeper cleans. \nEXT. EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING \nA hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals the tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the quiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of the building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a car. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment building. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe car drives away. Barris stops at the end of the block, stares at the imposing wall. \nBARRIS I'm really, really fucked. \nAnother car pulls up next to him. Picard, a        serious-looking Frenchman, sticks his head out the window. \nPICARD Get in. \nBARRIS What?       Who the hell are you? \nPICARD No time.      Get in or die. \nBarris hesitates, gets in.        The car screeches off. \nINT. PICARD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \n", "test1_id": 813, "test2_input": "CONTINUED: \nL.A.

In the background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses splashing around in the water. \nJAMIE FARR Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy. I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron. I remember at the time I was reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff with. \nINT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nBarris lies in bed next to Patricia. It's 12:30 AM.

But -- \nKEELER Why do you kill? \nBarris looks around, clears his throat. \nBARRIS Oh. \nKEELER During the second world war, I had the pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I found it exhilirating.

Jesus, I can't even despise myself with any insight. \nPATRICIA Insane asylums are filled with people who think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company. Wonder what that means. \nBARRIS Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote. But I never did. I'm the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first.

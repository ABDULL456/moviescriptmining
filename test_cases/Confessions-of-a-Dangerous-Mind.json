{"test1_input": "BARRIS Have you noticed, Jim, I've got a tv show on the air? I don't need to kill people for hire anymore. \nBYRD I know you don't need to.    But you'd like to. \nBARRIS That's insane. \nByrd shrugs, unconvinced.    He sips his drink. \nBYRD Think of it as a hobby. An avocation. Something you do to relax. You can be an assassination enthusiast, a murder bug. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS I've got important things to think about here. I don't have time to fuck around with you. \nBYRD Okay, I'll help you out with your little show. Tit for tat. That's the kinda guy I am. I've seen this Dating Game of yours, Chuck. And I have a thought. \nBARRIS What, now you're a television producer? \nBYRD Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you. \nBARRIS Let's hear it then. \nBYRD Well, what do you have now? The couple gets sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right? Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious- living boobs out in TV-land. \nBARRIS Yeah, what's your point? \nBYRD Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast Asia, for example. \nBARRIS The network's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together. \nBYRD (shrugs) Send 'em with a chaperone. Some respectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch. \nBARRIS (considering) Y'know, that's not half bad. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBYRD I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say we have a job for you in Austria. You, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam! you take care of some Company business. It's the perfect cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative by night. \nBARRIS I told you, I don't have to kill people for money anymore. \nBYRD Chuck, when I said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money. Some of it, but very little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck. I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but you botched it. Don't you want to get really good at something, Chuck? \nBarris stares at Byrd. \nINT. BOOTH (DATING GAME SHOW) - DAY \nThe director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not- too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp chatter in the booth. \nDIRECTOR (rapidly) Ready one, take one. Ready three, take three. Ready one, take one. \nBLONDE BACHELORETTE Number one, can you please tell me what a girl is like who hasn't been on a date before and how you can tell she hasn't been on a date before? \nDIRECTOR Ready two, take two.   This guy has never been on a date. \nEveryone in the booth laughs. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFAT BACHELOR Well... \nBARRIS Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy.   This is just too good. \nFAT BACHELOR ... I'll ask her what she likes to do and \nDIRECTOR Ready one, take one.   Ready two, take two. \nFAT BACHELOR And if she doesn't know what she likes to do -- \nDIRECTOR Ready three, take three. The only date he's ever had is with his right hand. \nGuys in booth laugh, except Barris. \nFAT BACHELOR ... then I'll know she hasn't done it yet. \nEXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS - DAY \nSUBTITLE:    LONDON, 1967 \nIt's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along, taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and Barris. Barris seems bored. \nINT. PUB - DAY \nBarris enters the pub alone. He's dressed in a blonde wig and moustache and glasses. It's crowded and he searches the room for someone. He spots a pretty young woman by herself at a table. She wears white go-go boots. \nBARRIS Excuse me, is this seat taken? \n", "test1_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBarris sits across from the woman. \nBARRIS London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it. \nWOMAN Yes it is. \nBARRIS (beat) Oh. Sorry. \nBarris gets up, glances around, spots another pretty young woman in white go-go boots, sitting by herself. He approaches her. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Excuse me, is this seat taken? \nPATRICIA By you. \nBarris sits. \nBARRIS London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it? \nPATRICIA Especially the fog. It affords one solitude, even in a city full of people. \nBARRIS I'm Chuck. \nPATRICIA Yes, I gathered. \nBARRIS And you are? \nPATRICIA (smiles) Here you go, Chuck. \nShe hands him a manila envelope, and stands to leave. \nBARRIS At least give me a made-up name. Something for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPATRICIA Cry out, \"Olivia!\" \nBARRIS That's Twelfth Night. \nPATRICIA Very good, Chuck. I'm pleasantly surprised. You're not like the other murderers. \nShe smiles and leaves. Barris watches after her, then opens the envelope and pulls out a black and white photo of a man. \nEXT. WESTMINISTER ABBEY - DAY \nIt's raining. A bored Barris, dressed normally, waits with the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance. The fat bachelor checks his watch. \nFAT BACHELOR I thinks he's really pretty and I want to be her boyfriend. \nEXT. CHURCH COURTYARD - NIGHT \nBarris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the empty, dark courtyard. \nENGLISHMAN (loud whisper) Here. \nBarris approaches. \nBARRIS Do you have it? \nENGLISHMAN Do you have it? \nBARRIS Sorry.     Yeah. \nBarris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope. The Englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad of cash and counts. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you. \nENGLISHMAN Just the same. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe Englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and hands Barris a box of Polaroid film. \nBARRIS Thank you.     Oh, one more thing. \nBarris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and jams it into the Englishman's mouth. The silencer breaks the man's front teeth. The man makes a muffled grunt. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Sorry about your teeth. \nThe Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused. After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) It's Ronnie, isn't it? \nThe fat bachelor nods. \n", "test1_id": 813, "test2_input": "BARRIS (unenthused) Great. I'm just heading -- \nPARTY MAN #1 I have a talent I think you'd really appreciate. \nBARRIS Uh-huh. \nParty Man #1 begins farting \"Jingle Bells.\"   Barris   gets up and moves away. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPARTY MAN #1 (calling after) Hey, didn't you ever hear of Le Petomane? He was a star, buddy! These are totally smell-free! \nBarris settles by the fireplace.      A pretty woman approaches, smiling. \nPRETTY WOMAN Hi. \nBARRIS Hi. \nPRETTY WOMAN I thought it was you. \nBARRIS (bowing) It's me. \nPRETTY WOMAN I'm glad to meet you because I wanted to tell you that I've seen The Gong Show and I think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment today. \nBARRIS Well -- \nPRETTY WOMAN How dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity. \nBARRIS I don't think it's that loathsome. \nPRETTY WOMAN What is it then? To mock some poor, lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives. To destroy them. So everybody's not brilliantly talented. They're still people. They deserve respect and compassion. I mean, who the hell are you? What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you created The Dating Game. Wow, right up there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess that's what gives you the right to... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBARRIS Excuse me, I've got to -- \nBarris loses himself in the crowd.    He hurries past a guy who recognizes and starts chanting. \nPARTY MAN #2 Chuckie Baby! Chuckie Baby!     Chuckie Baby! \nBarris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door. \nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT \nBarris makes his way down the crowded street. People stare, turn their heads to gawk. We hear over and over again: \"Hey, isn't that Chuck Barris?\" and \"Hey, look, The Gong Show guy!\", and \"Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby!\" Barris smiles wanly and nods. People shove paper and pen in his face and he scribbles autographs without stopping. Sweat forms on his brow. His polyester shirt is drenched. \nBARRIS (V.O.) She was right. What the hell had I done with my life? \nAmong the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor he killed in London. He sports a bullet hole in his head Barris does a double take. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Wait, you're that guy. You're dead. This is screwy. \nFAT BACHELOR I only want to be loved. \nBARRIS That's all I fucking wanted! \nBarris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed, bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run. Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle- aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Mr. Barris? \nBARRIS No, I'm... \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN My name is Louise Wechsler and I'm here from Tulsa with my family and... \nBARRIS Please, I'm not feeling well. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Just a moment of your time. I love your show. And, well, I, sort of, have a talent myself. \nBARRIS You can stop by the office to audition tomorrow. \nThe woman continues to approach. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just wondering. See, I dance a little and I was just wondering -- \nThere's no way out of this.     Barris sighs. \nBARRIS Yeah, all right. Go ahead. \nBarris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly. Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) Very nice. \nSomething in her hand glints in the light. Barris reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her. The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She straddles him and is about to stab him through the air. Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into his brain. The assailant slumps over. \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: (2) \nBarris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and pulls off the wig. He gets up, shaking and heaving. He looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with all his might. \nEXT. TERRACE - DAY \nACTUAL BARRIS That was it. I just disappeared. The network had to put The Gong Show into reruns. It was 1981. I holed myself up in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nSUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, SPRING 1982 \nWe see Barris from above, shivering and naked in the corner. The manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter. Barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms, appealing to the gods. \nBARRIS Who Am I? \nThere is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor. \nNEIGHBOR (O.S.) Who cares?     Shut the fuck up! \nThere's a knock at the door.    Barris crawls toward it, peeks through the peephole. \nBARRIS Fuck.   Shit. Piss. \nBarris unlocks the door.    Simon Oliver stands there. \nOLIVER Barris. \nBARRIS How'd you know where I was? \nOLIVER Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don't be an orangutan. We always know where you are. We always know what you're doing. By the by, I'd think twice before I'd attempt to get that tripe you're writing published. And there's a typo on page -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don't work for you anymore. I have things to... \nBarris trails off. \nOLIVER I'd like you to come back for one last assignment, Chuck. \nBARRIS No.     Now get... Good-bye \nOLIVER I think you might be interested when I tell you it's the mole who fingered your friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard... and Seigfried Keeler. \nBARRIS Keeler committed suicide. \nOLIVER Yes, of course he did. He threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord. \nBARRIS (beat) I'm not interested, Oliver. \nOLIVER As long as the mole's alive, you don't have a chance in hell of remaining so. Besides, killing is in your blood, old man. You fit the profile. \nBarris lunges at Oliver, pushes him against the wall. \nBARRIS That fucking profile again! What's the fuck is it?! What the fuck do you bastards know about me, that I don't?! \nOLIVER Indeed.   Where to begin.   First, let go of me. \nBarris lets go.    Oliver sits in a chair, straightens his shirt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nOLIVER (CONT'D) Let's see. Well, you had a twin sister, stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your mother always wanted a daughter. She blamed you for your sister's death. And, so, until your sister Phoebe was born, she raised you as a girl. \nBARRIS That's not true. \nOLIVER Oh, and your father the dentist? Not really your father. Your biological father was a man named Edmund James Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your mother didn't know when she had an affair with him in 1930. If you want to look him up, he was also known as the Tarrytown Troll, because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly. Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in 1939. We believed your self- loathing tendencies coupled with that extra Y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well. \nBARRIS You're lying. \nOLIVER I'm trying to think what more I can tell you. I'm sure there's more. But you have me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I don't have your files in front of me. \nBARRIS Just leave me the hell alone! \nOLIVER Your mother always loved the game shows, and you so wanted to please her. We never expected the game show business to work out for you. But that it did, turned out to be in our favor. I guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBarris lunges at Oliver. The two wrestle on the floor. Barris punches him repeatedly in the face. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nBarris lies sleeping in a tangle of sheets. There's blood on his hands. A knock at the door. Barris jumps awake, grabs his gun. He looks around. The room is a mess, stuff knocked over. There's been a fight. He sees his bloody hands. Another knock. \n", "test2_id": 814, "test3_input": "BARRIS Huh?     What? \nPENNY (O.S.) Chuck?    It's Pen. \nBarris brings his gun with him to the door, looks through the peephole, then opens the door. Penny stands there, takes in the room, the mess, the haggard Barris. \nPENNY (CONT'D) Oh, Chuck. \nBARRIS Jesus, how'd you find me? Am I listed in some guidebook or something? \nPENNY You sent me your last letter on hotel stationary. \nBARRIS Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen. You look beautiful. \nBarris hugs her. \nPENNY I don't really. But I appreciate the lie. I know how you hate lying. (looking around) Boy, this place is scary looking. \nBARRIS Yeah. (taps his head) The human psyche. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPENNY I came to take you back to California with me. It's a lonely state without you. \nBARRIS I don't know, Redhead. \nPENNY I can't wait forever for you to ask me to marry you, you know. Well, apparently I can. But I really don't want to. Chuck. \nBARRIS Pen. \nPENNY (crying) I love you so much. You don't understand. I don't even know why. You're such a schmuck. \nBARRIS You don't know the half of it. \nPENNY You're not gonna marry me, are you? \nBARRIS I don't know if I can. \nPenny nods her head and leaves.    Barris watches her go, then falls to the floor and weeps. \nEXT. PLANE - DAY \nEXT. UNION OYSTER HOUSE, BOSTON - NIGHT \nINT. UNION OYSTER HOUSE, BOSTON \nBarris, dressed in a suit, sits with Patricia Watson.     He smiles across the table at her. \nPATRICIA I can't believe you finally left your two- hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me. I'm honored. \nBARRIS Y'know, I got a visit this morning from Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever. But she doesn't know who I am, what I've, what I'm capable of. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BARRIS (CONT'D) And she can't ever know. So what does she really love? A lie. And I started thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman in the world who truly knows me. I know I've screwed you over in the past, and I'm really sorry. I just want you to know that you're the one I want to be with. I love you, Treesh. \nPatricia looks at him. Her hard-as-nails demeanor softens. She smiles. Barris smiles and reaches across the table for her hand. \nEXT. WHARF - NIGHT \nBarris and Patricia stand looking out at the harbor. \nBARRIS I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh. \nPATRICIA Neitzsche said, \"Whoever despises oneself still respects oneself as one who despises.\" \nBARRIS I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't even despise myself with any insight. \nPATRICIA Insane asylums are filled with people who think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company. Wonder what that means. \nBARRIS Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote. But I never did. I'm the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first. I am disposable. I disposed of people and I am disposable. (beat) You look cold. \nBarris drapes his jacket over Patricia's shoulders. \nPATRICIA Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're actually acting like a gentleman. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBarris kisses her.      She lets him. \nPATRICIA (CONT'D) Well, it's late. I should get going. \nBARRIS I suppose you still won't tell me where you're staying. \nPATRICIA No.   But I'll show you. \nShe takes his hand.      They walk off. \nINT. PATRICIA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "PATRICIA Drink? \nBARRIS Sure.    Bourbon. \nPatricia pours some drinks. There are a couple of chairs near the window. Barris sits in one. \nPATRICIA I've been thinking a lot about you lately, Chuck. \nBARRIS Yeah? \nPatricia approaches Barris with the drinks, hands him one. \nPATRICIA I've missed you. \nBARRIS You could've fooled me. \nPATRICIA Well, I've mellowed. \nPatricia takes Barris by the hand, leads him to the window. \nPATRICIA (CONT'D) Look. Boston's a beautiful city. We could start over here. A normal person's life. Together. Selling insurance. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIS That sounds right. \nPatricia flops down in the chair that Barris had been sitting in. Barris sits in the chair across from her. Patricia raises her glass. \nPATRICIA To life. \nBARRIS To life. \nPatricia casually slides her hand under the chair cushion. In one swift move, Barris pulls a gun from his ankle and shoots Patricia three times, twice in the head, once in the heart. The force of the bullets has tipped the chair over. Patricia lies sprawled on the floor. \nBARRIS (CONT'D) (bitterly) L'Chaim. \nBarris stands and looks at Patricia's body.      She holds a gun. \nINT. QUIET CAFE - MORNING \nSimon Oliver sits sipping an espresso. He has a black eye and bruised face. Barris enters, looking haggard. He sits and stares at Oliver. \nBARRIS It's done and I'm done.   Agreed? \nOLIVER Agreed.   But if you get antsy... and you will. \nOliver smiles and walks off. Barris sits for a moment, then stands, walks over to a payphone and dials. \nBARRIS Hey, Redhead? \nINT.

CHAPEL - DAY \nWell-wishers, family, fans, photographers, reporters, and passers-by are lined up on either side of a red carpet that leads from the chapel to a limousine waiting at the curb. Barris and Penny emerge from the chapel. Everyone cheers, photos are snapped, rice and confetti are thrown, as the happy newlyweds make their way to the limo, Barris spots a pinky-ringed hand in the crowd holding a gun. Barris pushes Penny toward the white limo. The driver stands there holding the door open. Barris shoves Penny in, then screams at the driver. \nBARRIS Drive, Danny! Now! \nBarris jumps in the car, the driver slams the door closed, hurries around the driver's door and gets in. The car peals away from the cab. \nINT.

BEN (to Vitti) The hell you are. You're supposed to be in my custody. We have therapy today. VITTI For what? The more we talk the worse I get. I had that dream again. BEN The one where you're Mussolini? VITTI No, the other one. BEN The limp sword dream? JELLY (at car) I probably shouldn't be listening to this. VITTI So don't! JELLY Sorry. 
BEN (to Vitti) Do you think this dream might be sexual? 
VITTI I know what you're thinkin'. The sword is my cock and I can't get it up, but that ain't it. I saw Sheila last night and I had a hard-on you could swing from. 
BEN (winces) I don't want to know that. VITTI You coulda hung wet towels on it. JELLY (calls out) He's like a racehorse in that area. BEN Okay!   I get it. VITTI (to  Jelly) Wait in the  car! (to  Ben) So what does  it mean? Ben sits on the wicker divan. BEN Sex can represent a lot of things. In your case I think it's about performance anxiety. Trying to find a job that fits. VITTI Doc -- nothing's gonna fit. That nine-to-five bullshit -- I'll fuckin' kill myself if I have to do that for the rest of my life. You know they take taxes out of your check? What the fuck is that? I'm doomed. I'm gonna end up selling hot dogs on the street. (starts breathing hard and sweating) Look at me. I'm havin' a fuckin' panic attack here. My heart's beatin' like a rabbit. BEN You're hyperventilating. 
He empties the drugstore bag and hands it to Vitti. BEN Breathe into this. Vitti sits on a wicker chair. VITTI (speaks through bag) This is your fault. 
BEN Excuse me? VITTI Tellin' me I have to get a job like I'm some fuckin' nobody. It was humiliating! Thanks a lot. BEN (jumps up, in a total rage) Hey, I'm doing the best I can!     If you can't appreciate that, or if my    best isn't good enough for you, then    maybe you should find somebody else to    talk to, you selfish prick! Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob, then quickly pulls himself together. BEN Sorry. VITTI What the hell was that? BEN I'm fine.    I'm grieving.   It's a process. Ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple of pills. VITTI Now what are you takin'? BEN Echinacea and goldenseal. Do you know the TV show 'Little Caesar'? VITTI Yeah, I know it. BEN The producer of that show is a man 
named Raoul Berman. A mutual friend told him I knew you and Mr. Berman called me this morning. He wants to meet you. 
VITTI For what? BEN Meet him and find out. CUT TO: 
EXT. NOGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT Ben and Laura walk up to a trendy Japanese restaurant in Chelsea. Ben is really keyed up. LAURA We finally got him out of the house -- why are we having dinner with him? I mean, how professional is that? BEN This is not social. Paul's meeting a television producer who might have a job for him. He's nervous and wants me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer, that's all. LAURA He's a grown man. I don't see why he needs a chaperone. BEN He doesn't. He needs a buffer.    I'm here in buffer capacity only. LAURA Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time Ben pops a couple of pills. LAURA Didn't you just take two of those? BEN No, that was something else. LAURA Well, you better not drink anything. You know what happens. BEN Laura? I'm a doctor?     I think I know what I'm doing.

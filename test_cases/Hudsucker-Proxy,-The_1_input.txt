HUDSUCKER Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal. 
NORVILLE Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid -- 
HUDSUCKER It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile. 
Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter. 
NORVILLE Oh, geez. 
HUDSUCKER Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal. 
NORVILLE Geez, I -- 
HUDSUCKER Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying. 
NORVILLE Yessir. 
HUDSUCKER Well, why don't ya read it. 
NORVILLE Sir? 
HUDSUCKER Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'. 
NORVILLE Yes sir... 
He tears open the envelope, reads: 
NORVILLE 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- 
HUDSUCKER Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph. 
NORVILLE 'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done? 
As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, then pats down a yawn. 
NORVILLE '...Looking back now, Sid, I see that I allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself -- but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of I...' 
Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up. 
Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief. 
He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently quavers in a voice strangled with emotion: 
HUDSUCKER Skip this part... 
He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles. 
HUDSUCKER ...Last paragraph, last paragraph. 
Norville looks down the page. 
NORVILLE '...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --' 
HUDSUCKER -- tough titty toenails! 
He roars with laughter. 
HUDSUCKER ...That'll show the bastard! 
He merrily wipes his eyes. 
HUDSUCKER ...Yeah, go ahead. 
NORVILLE '...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...' 
Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod. 
HUDSUCKER ...Geez. 
Pleased with himself: 
HUDSUCKER Yup. It's all there. Well, see that it gets delivered in the morning. 
Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the stars. 
HUDSUCKER Sheeel beeee... 
MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE 
Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on his way back to the heavens. 
HUDSUCKER ...Ridin' six white horses, She'll be ridin' six white horses She'll be ridin' six white horses When she comes... 
We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door. 
GEAR ROOM 
Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear. 
With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn -- 
SWEEP SECOND HAND 
Lurching forward -- 
PERPETUAL MOTION BALL 
Swinging down -- 
EXT. PAVEMENT 
As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK. 
BOOM DOWN

SUSAN Oh!  And who isn't?  You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside of me, too! 
JOSH No!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up. 
SUSAN Oh right!  And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails!  Why are you doing this Josh? 
JOSH There was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine. It was called a Zoltar Machine... 
SUSAN Oh stop it! 
JOSH It was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you could make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what I'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just a kid! 
SUSAN Fine Josh!  You're a kid!  Look, I really don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me.  But we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep.

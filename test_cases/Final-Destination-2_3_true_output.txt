B/W CAMERA FOOTAGE from Thomas' car shows Thomas tackling Kimberly to the ground just as a jack -knifed truck plows into the SUV. 
MR. BURROUGHS My Lord... 
A GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting back tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV -- but she stops him. 
KIMBERLY Don't.   I have to see this. 
Mr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on. 
INT. RORY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
It's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist at the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn everywhere. 
RORY Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there? That's my fuckin' car right there! Oh God, that's dope. 
After high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a freshly chopped line. 
ANCHOR MAN (O.S.) In other news, a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner. 
Rory looks up to see the DMV photo of Evan. As he takes in the report, his mood radically shifts. He looks like he's been hit by a train. 
MONTAGE 
Of Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the news very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by EMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to grading blue books. 
TIM'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Tim's eyes are glued to the latest Stephen King novel. Nora peers in. 
NORA Come on, Tim, lights out already. 
Tim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book. 
TIM Mom? 
NORA Yeah? 
TIM You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what? 
Nora swallows, trying to seem brave. 
NORA Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all. 
But neither of them are convinced. 
NORA Get some sleep. 
Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs it in. 
INT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Nora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again. 
NORA Officer Burke, please? 
INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Mr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch. 
KIMBERLY It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten anymore. 
Mr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective. 
MR. BURROUGHS I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe. 
KIMBERLY I love you too, Dad.     Goodnight. 
But Mr. Burroughs isn't ready to leave. He finishes his drink. 
MR. BURROUGHS You know, after your mother died... 
Kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst. 
MR. BURROUGHS There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the 
things I th ought about. 
KIMBERLY I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away. 
MR. BURROUGHS (choking up) I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. 
Mr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING out of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr. Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there is none. And he leaves.

{"train": "Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace \nTITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... \nA vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by a roll up, which crawls up into infinity. \nEPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE \nTurmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict..... \nPAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships. \nINT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT \nIn the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one of the battleships. \nQUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain. \nThe Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her. \nCAPTAIN : Yes, sir? QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once. CAPTAIN : Yes, sir. \nThe CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply. \nCAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately. NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to. \nThe screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms ever closer. \nEXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX) \nThe small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation battleship. \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE \nA PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch. \nPK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless protocol gearheads to greet them. \nThe door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay. Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14. \nTC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please. \nThey move off down the hallway. \nEG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think? PR-4 : I'm not made to think. \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM \nA door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the formal conference room by TC-14. \nTC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master will be with you shortly. \nThe droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door. \nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this. QUI-GON : I don't sense anything. OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's somethging...elsewhere...elusive. QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs. OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future... QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan. OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands? QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short. \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE \nP-59 : Switch to bio...There they are! \nThe Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with their laser swords. \nOBI-WAN : They have shield generators! QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go! \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE \nNUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway. \nRUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer droids. TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft. \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY \nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing craft. \nQUI-GON : Battle droids. OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army. QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet. OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short. \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE \nTEY HOW recieves a transmission. \nTEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet. RUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself. NUTE : At last we're getting results. \nOn the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE. \nNUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is pleased. AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended. \nNUTE smirks at RUNE. \nNUTE : I was not aware of such a failure. AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of yours. NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote. AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a settlement. NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken. \nAMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully. \nAMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time. NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much. AMIDALA : We will see. \nThe QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black. \nRUNE : She's right, the Senate will never.... NUTE : It's too late now. RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack? NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there. \nINT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM \nThe QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man. \nPALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be the...get...negotiate... \nThe hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away. \nAMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening? \nCAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT \nCAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators... BIBBLE : A malfunction? CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness. BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion. AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not dare go that far. CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished. AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation. BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend ourselves. CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army. AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war. \nEXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX) \nSix landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo. \nQUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I hope you've learned, my young Padawan. OBI-WAN : Yes, Master. JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey? OBI-WAN : What's this? QUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up. JAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!? \nOBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up. \nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city. \nThey all stop. \nQUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there? JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy. QUI-GON : No??! JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my goen back dare. \nA PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance. \nQUI-GON : You hear that? \nJAR JAR shakes his head yes. \nQUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way... OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little pieces, then blast us into oblivion! JAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry! \nJAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp. \nEXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT \nQUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance. \nQUI-GON : Much farther? JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday? \nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that turn into breathing masks. \nJAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't expict a wern welcome. OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes. \nJAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the water. Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him. \nEXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER \nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct. They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON follow. \nINT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE \nGUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping trio. \nJAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back! CAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big dudu this time. \nCAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI. \nJAR JAR : How wude. \nINT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM \nThe Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others. \nBOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new weesong! QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them. BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big. OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come here and take control of you. BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of uss-en. OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of you will affect the other. You must understand this. BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no care-n about da Naboo. QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way. BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway. QUI-GON : We need a transport. BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen through da core. Now go. QUI-GON : Thank you for your help. We go in peace. \nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave. \nOBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo? QUI-GON : A transport, I hope. \nThe JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict. QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look. \nCAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications. QUI-GON : Do you have transports? CAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way. \nTHEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded \nINT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY \nCAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance. \nCAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them. QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us. AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people. QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay. BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare. CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her. QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you. BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help. CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness. Any attempt to escape will be dangerous. BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you must leave... \nThe QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE. \nAMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us... PADME : We are brave, Your Highness. QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now. AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be careful, Governor. \nINT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY \nThe door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE), followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry. \nCAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots. \nCAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS. \nOBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots. \nQUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft. \nGUARD DROID : Where are you going? QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those people to Coruscant. DROID GUARD : You're under arrest! \nThe DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire, they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger and fire as the ship takes off. \nEXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX) \nThe ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at them. \nEXT. SPACE (FX) \nThe sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the deadly Federation blockade. \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT \nThe PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch. \nRIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed. \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD \nJAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN. \nOBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble. \nOBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down. \nJAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey? \nJAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit. He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head. \nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying out. \nANAKIN : ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing things. I'm making my own droid... \nQUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving. JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look. \nPADME : I'm glad I met you,....ah... ANAKIN : ...Anakin. PADME : Anakin. ANAKIN : Anakin Skywalker. PADME : Padme Naberrie. \nPADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave. \nANAKIN : I'm glad I met you too. \nWATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head. \nWATTO : (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia. (Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don't know nothing.) ANAKIN : (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO : (subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you can go home.) \nANAKIN lets out a \"yipee\" and runs out the back. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY \nQUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft. \nQUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on board? OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe. Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking about. QUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back. \nQUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR grabs his arm. \nJAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched. QUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY \nQUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth. Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly appears. \nVENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!! \nJAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan. \nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA : (subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??) \nSEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan desperately tries to scramble to safety. \nJAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one?? ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid. \nJAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way. \nANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful, Sebulba...This one's very connected.) \nSEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN. \nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada you mean, slave?) ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.) SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.) \nSEBULBA turns away. \nANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.) \nQUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba. JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten. QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble. Thank you, my young friend. \nPADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down the crowded street. \nTHREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you? PADME : He's perfect. ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a Podracer! \nPADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles. \nTHREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked? \nARTOO BEEPS \nTHREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing! \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS \nAMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram. \nBIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me... \nAMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous. \nOBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind. \nINT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY \nQUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit. \nOBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent. QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace. OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying? QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time. \nEXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT \nDARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city. \nDARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master. DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty. DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge. DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command. \nThe hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY \nThe giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house. \nINT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY \nQUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside. JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a little brighter red. \nSHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere. ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck. SHMI : Any attempt to escape... ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof! \nPADME and JAR JAR are horrified. \nJAR JAR : How wude. PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws... SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own. \nAn awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment. \nANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace? \nPADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look. \nQUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous. ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it. \nSHMI looks askance at her son. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it. QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods. \nWATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous. \nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win. WATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a follish one, methinks.) \nEXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY \nOBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink. QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel. \nOBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a long time. QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and there is something about this boy... \nEXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY \nQUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch \nPADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in the courtyard below. \nQUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward. SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has... QUI-GON : He has special powers. SHMI : Yes... QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait. SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life. QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father? SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him? QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY \nKITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring. \nANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and Wald. \nAll whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting. \nKITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky? ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow! KITSTER : What? With this?? WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.) AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to run. SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be bug squash. \nSEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of the energy binder plates. \nANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders... JAR JAR : Who, mesa? ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours. \nJAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled. \nJAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish) KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run. ANAKIN : It will. \nQUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get words out that make sense. \nQUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN : Yes, sir!! \nANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY \nSHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly. \nEXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT \nANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky. \nQUI-GON : Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut. ANAKIN : There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets? QUI-GON : Most of them. ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all? QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely. ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch! \nQUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm. \nQUI-GON : There, good as new... \nSHMI yells from inside the hovel. \nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet. WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or nothing. QUI-GON : The boy, then... \nWATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket. \nWATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother... \nWATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue. QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry. \nWATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so...it makes little difference. \nANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine. KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves. \nWATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd. (Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.) \nWATTO walks off, laughing. \nANAKIN : What did he mean by that? \nQUI-GON : I'll tell you later. \nARTOO beeps at THREEPIO. \nTHREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous. \nARTOO emits a series of beeps. \nTHREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships! KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time, Annie. PADME : Do what? KITSTER : Finish the race, of course! PADME : You've never won a race? ANAKIN : Well...not exactly... PADME : Not even finished?! \nANAKN looks sheepish. \nANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time. QUI-GON : Of course you will. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY \nOne of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN, QI-GON, or the QUEEN. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY \nAn EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX) \nA two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene. \nFODE/BEED : - A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces. (We have perfect weather today for the Boonta classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.) B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY \nOn the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box. \nFODE/BEED : - (O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!) B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system. A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord Pedrovia.) B : Two time winner, Boles Roor... A : Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya bookie ookie!! (On the front line the reigning champion, Sebulba from Pixelito. By far the favorite today.) B : And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy. A : Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.) B : I see the flaggers are moving onto the track. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - GRANDSTAND - DAY \nColorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell barbecued creature parts and colorful drinks. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX) \nAll the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and waves to the crowd. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX) \nJabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the start of the race. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY \nOn a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer started. The two-headed announcer reports. \nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.) A : An dare ovv! (And they're off!) B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled. \nPADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the race as it progresses. \nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.) B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders today. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX) \nThe Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke. ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily. One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away. Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of Anakin's Pod. \nFODE/BEED : - B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY \nJABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small, hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange alien named FANTA. \nJAR JAR : Where's Skywalker? \nFANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON watch another screen and look worried. ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver of the quadra-Pod looks worried. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX) \nANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by another racer, XELBREE. SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the alien's engine. The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly veers away. ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump. One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the whole thing EXPLODES. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY \nQUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information. The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in Anakin's defeat. The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS. KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues. \nFODE/BEED : - (O.S) B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings. A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.) \nQUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR : What gooie-on? FANTA : Bug off. \nLap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME look worried. \nJAR JAR : He musta crash-ud. PADME : Here he comes! \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX) \nARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells. \nTHREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear! \nEXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX) \nSure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack. The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild. \nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.) B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in... A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.) \nANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is unbearable. ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze, then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke. \nQUI-GON : Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to the ship. \nThe GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES. PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE, only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI wave as they ride off. \nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) I'll return the eopies by midday. \nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY \nARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES; JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft. OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them. \nQUI-GON : Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going back...some unfinished business. I won't be long. OBI-WAN : Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...? QUI-GON : It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts. \nOn a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns and speeds away. \nEXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY \nANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is towering above them. KITSTER is with them. \nQUI-GON : What's this? ANAKIN : He said I cheated. QUI-GON : Did you? ANAKIN : No! QUI-GON : Do you still think he cheated? GREEDO : Yes. QUI-GON : Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his opinion, fighting won't change it. \nQUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over to WALD who has been watching the goings-on. \nWALD : Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end. \nFarther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin's hovel. QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them to the boy. \nQUI-GON : These are yours. We sold the Pod. ANAKIN : (suddenly beaming) Yes! \nINT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY \nSHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON. \nANAKIN : Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have! \nANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket. \nSHMI : Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful. QUI-GON : And Anakin has been freed. ANAKIN : What?!? QUI-GON : You're no longer a slave. \nANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned. \nANAKIN : Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize, or what? QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about gambling. SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi? QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident. You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil. ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your starship and everything?! \nQUI-GON kneels down to the boy. \nQUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And if you succeed, it will be a hard life. ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?! QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it is yours alone. \nANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON. \nANAKIN : I want to go. QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time. ANAKIN : Yipee!! \nANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't you, Mom QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it. ANAKIN : But the money from selling... QUI-GON : It's not nearly enough. \nSHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands in hers, she draws him close. \nSHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you. ANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change. SHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right. \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT \nANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe. \nRIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is one big city. ANAKIN : Wow! It's so huge! \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX) \nThe ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant. \nEXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY \nSupreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on a landing platform. The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM. CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group. ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen. \nPALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum. VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position. AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor. \nPALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform toward a waiting air taxi. \nPALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it... \nJAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead. ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN. \nJAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around) Pitty hot! \nVALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city. \nQUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The situation has become more complicated. \nINT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY \nQUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what is being said. \nJAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my. ANAKIN : Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on. \nCAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA. \nINT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY \nPALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one side. \nPALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility, only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion. AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope. PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now. AMIDALA : What options do we have? PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum. AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way? PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts... AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation. PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being. AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do. \nEXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX) \nA unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple. \nINT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY \nQUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle. OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room. The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA. \nQUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord. MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!? KI-ADI : Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium. YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are. MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing. YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must. KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again. MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the Queen is the target. YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her. MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you. YODA : May the Force be with you. \nOBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council. \nYODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you? QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in the Force. YODA : A vergence, you say? MACE WINDU : Located around a person? QUI-GON : A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians. MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy?? QUI-GON : I don't pressume... YODA : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is. QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested. \nThe JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON. \nA third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention. \nAKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law. VALORUM : The point... \nVALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA. PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN. \nPALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear. VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations? \nQUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed. \nAMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a \"vote of no confidence\"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership. VALORUM : What?...No! \nThis causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over. \nMAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order... \nThings settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA. PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena. \nBAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum. MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan. \nMAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him. \nBAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must be voted upon in this session. LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures committee for study. \nThe assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA. \nASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! \nPALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA. \nPALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue... MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will begin the vote. \nThe Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE. \nVALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have betrayed me! How could you do this? \nEXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET \nOBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony. \nOBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know it. He is far too old. QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you. OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again. QUI-GON : I will do what I must. OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time. QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice. \nINT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET \nANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen. \nANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder. \nMACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA. \nYODA : Good, good, young one. How feel you? ANAKIN : Cold, sir. YODA : Afraid are you? ANAKIN : No, sir. MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life? ANAKIN : I don't think so. \nANAKIN hesitates for a moment. \nYODA : See through you, we can. MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings... KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother. ANAKIN : I miss her. YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think. ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything? YODA : Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering. ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid! YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you. ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid. YODA : Then continue, we will. \nINT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET \nNUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS. \nDARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her. NUTE : Yes, my Lord. DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, is the planet secure? NUTE : Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now. DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi. NUTE : Yes, my Lord. \nDARTH SIDIOUS fades off. \nRUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!! \nINT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT \nANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and gauges. \nANAKIN : ...and that one? RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.

AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours. CAPT. PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no army. QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you. AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks! \nJAR JAR looks around, puzzled. \nJAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness? AMIDALA : Yes. I need your help. \nINT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY \nThe Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one Federation battle cruiser orbiting.

PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie. ANAKIN : Is it? I can help... Where are we going? PADME : To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a peaceful people... ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back. \nANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back. \nEXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY \nThe Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON. \nOBI-WAN : Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master. \nQUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere. \nQUI-GON : Good. \nOBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment. \nOBI-WAN : Do you think the Queen's idea will work? QUI-GON : The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power to help her. OBI-WAN : I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the trials. \nQUI-GON looks at him for a long moment. \nQUI-GON : You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than Iam, Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight. \nEXT.

He sees something and yells down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue. \nGUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen! ANAKIN : All right. They're here! \nANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR. \nBOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together. JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no... BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General. JAR JAR : General??! Oh, no.. \nJAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints. FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO GUARDS and PILOT pile out and join the group. \nPADME : What is the situation? CAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win. PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused. \nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest. \nPADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi? QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded. CAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem. QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be killed. BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part. \nJAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with interest, as does ARTOO. \nPADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication and their droids will be helpless. QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship. OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army. PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it. \nINT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY \nNUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through the throne room. \nDARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought. NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do not expect much resistance. OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps. DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be using the Queen for their own purposes. DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to our advantage... NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord. DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY (FX) \nAll is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off. SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills. HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon. Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line. JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators. \nGENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields. \nA red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled WARRIORS. \nEXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY \nPADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans over to ANAKIN. \nQUI-GON : Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe placeto hide and stay there. ANAKIN : Sure. QUI-GON : And stay there! \nDROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza, SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at the BATTLE DROIDS. As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage the DROIDS outside. \nINT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY \nALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME's TROOPS rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for cover. ANAKIN runs under a Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over. Let's see... \nANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship begins to shake. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one.... \nANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. \"Droid blaster.\" Yeah! \nThe JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a palace hallway. The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around him. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on the right. \nANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down. \nThe fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear life. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one. \nARTOO beeps. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm not doing anything! \nARTOO beeps. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything. \nThe SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once, flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn. \nINT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE \nThe Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station. \nRIC OLIE : Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on the transmitter. BRAVO TWO : Roger, Bravo Leader. \nThe fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the hangers and attack. \nRIC OLIE : Enemy fighters straight ahead! \nEXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY \nJAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up in the wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process. OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle. They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS. \nINT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE \nA giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo. ARTOO beeps a worried concern. \nANAKIN : The Autopilot is searching for what other ships? \nARTOO beeps and whistles. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire it or something. \nARTOO chirps that he's trying. \nAn enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa! \nNow the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick. \nANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this mess is the way we got into it. \nARTOO beeps a reply. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one? \nANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station. \nINT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE \nThe SQUADRON attacks the space station. \nRIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge. BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader. \nThe attack is fruitless. \nRIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through it. \nMeanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks. \nANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing! \nThe enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin. ARTOO screams. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit! \nANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo! \nANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa! \nANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started! \nANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red. \nARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically. \nINT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY \nThe laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs to catch up. \nANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding the ship. He ducks back down. \nANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good. \nHe looks at the dashboard to see red lights. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo. \nThe BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO. \nBATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot? \nARTOO beeps a reply. \nBATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot? \nARTOO whistles. \nBATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification! \nANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green. \nANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition. \nHe flips the switch and the engine starts. \nBATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll blast you! ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up! \nANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them. \nANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this! \nHe presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed! \nThe two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here! \nANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee! \nINT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE \nTEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE. \nTEY HOW : Sir, we're losing power... There is some problem with the main reactor... DOFINE : Impossible!! I don't... \nThe bridge explodes. \nINT. NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE \n", "test1_input": "DARTH SIDIOUS fades away. \nRUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi? NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report. \nINT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER \nSparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the power drive drops. \nOBI-WAN : .....we're losing power. \nOBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics. \nQUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet. JAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!? OBI-WAN : Power's back. \nThe lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of them. \nJAR JAR : Monstairs back! \nThe large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around and speeds away. \nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now?? QUI-GON : Relax. \nQUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma. \nOBI-WAN : You overdid it. \nThe COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER. \nOBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good! \nJAR JAR regains consciousness. JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie! \nJAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips away. \nQUI-GON : Head for that outcropping. \nEXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX) \nThe long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to Theed, the Naboo capital. \nEXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX) \nAs the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport. \nNUTE : Ah, victory! \nINT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX) \nThe little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is brightly lit. \nJAR JAR : Wesa dude it! \nEXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY \nParadise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface. The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies. QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief. \nJAR JAR : Wesa safe now. QUI-GON : Get this thing started. JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey? OBI-WAN : What is it? \n", "test1_true": "JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie! \nOBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics. \nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey! \nQUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the waterfall. \nQUI-GON : Come on... \nOBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON starts in after him. \nQUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar. JAR JAR : No! Too scary! OBI-WAN : Get up here! JAR JAR : No a mighty no! \nJAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall. \nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen! \nJAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to pull QUI-GON out of the water. \nOBI-WAN : That was close. BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons! \nThe TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them. JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI. \nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons \nQUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks lose, crashing down the waterfall. The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess. \nJAR JAR : Whoa!!! \nEXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY \nThe waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun. \nINT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY \nQUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE, PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the middle of the room. \nBIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate? NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by the Senate. AMIDALA : I will not co-operate. NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them. OOM-9 : Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four. \nThe SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room. \nEXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY \nQUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO BIBBLE, and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN. \nFOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI. \nJAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad! \nQUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this. They move between two buildings. \nQUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor. BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador. QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make contact with the republic. \nCAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward. \n", "test2_input": "JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can. \nJAR JAR : Mesa Ja Ja Binksss...

A large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes. \nOBI-WAN : Tahyt's it. Tatooine. RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like. QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention. \nEXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX) \nThe ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine. \nEXT.

NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA \nOBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up to him and falls to his knees. \nJAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go! OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious. \nJAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer) enters the main area. \nOBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new one. \nQUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him. \nQUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a disturbance in the Force. OBI-WAN : I fell it also, Master. \nQUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head to the exit ramp. \nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY \nThey start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport. \nJAR JAR : Dis sun doen murder tada skin. \nFrom the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them. \nCAPT. PANAKA : Wait! \nQUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb. \nCAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you. She wishes for her to observe the local... QUI-GON : No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant... CAPT. PANAKA : The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet. PADME : I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself. CAPT. PANAKA : Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse. QUI-GON : I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay close to me. \nHe gives PADME a stern look. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY \nThe little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this exotic enviroment. \nQUI-GON : ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous tribes and scavengers.

MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY \nThe GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship dealers. \nQUI-GON : We'll try one of the smaller dealers. \nThey head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships stacked up behind it. \nINT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY \nQUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a hummingbird. \nWATTO : (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?) QUI-GON : I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian. WATTO : Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk? (subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!) QUI-GON : My droid here has a readout of what I need. \nA disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and ANAKIN flinches. \nWATTO : (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?) ANAKIN : (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like you...) WATTO : (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the store) Me dwana no bata. (I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon) Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need. \nARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back. \nQUI-GON : Don't touch anything. \nJAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue. ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME. She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile. Finally, he gets the courage to speak. \nANAKIN : Are you an angel? PADME : What? ANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most hardened spice pirate cry. \nPADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've never heard of angels. \nANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don't know it. PADME : You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much? ANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto, who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think. PADME : You're...a slave? \nANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly. \nANAKIN : I am a person! My name is Anakin. PADME : I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a strange world to me. \nANAKIN studies her intently. \nANAKIN : You are a strange girl to me. \nJAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around, knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hit the nose! \nJAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair. \nEXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY \nWATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a hyperdrive. \nWATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this? QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries. WATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real... QUI-GON : I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will do fine. WATTO : No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again. QUI-GON : Credits will do fine. WATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that. \nINT.

You be careful... \nANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of his eye. Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID. \nANAKIN : What is it? QUI-GON : Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before. Come on. \nQUI-GON and ANAKIN start running. \nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY \nQUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard time keeping up. \nANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait! \nQUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a speeder bike. \nQUI-GON : Anakin, drop! \nANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by QUI-GON. ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up, bewildered by the confrontation. \nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go!

TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY \nQUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping over one another in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warrios hear the ship fly over them a few feet off the ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a moment. Before DARTH MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's ramp. \nEXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY \nThe SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop.

NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY \nANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt. \nANAKIN : Are you all right? QUI-GON : I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget. OBI-WAN : What was it? QUI-GON : I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen... ANAKIN : Do you think he'll follow us? QUI-GON : We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no doubt he knows our destination. ANAKIN : What are we going to do about it? \nOBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a \"who are you?\" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent stare. \n", "test3_true": "OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look. \nINT. COCKPIT - SPACE \nRIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch. \nQUI-GON : Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last laugh. \nThe stars streak outside the cockpit window. \nEXT.

The Palace can be seen in the distance. \nINT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT \nNUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind. DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch. \nNUTE : When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away! BIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided... They will not live under your tyranny. \nBIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE. \nOOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long. \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA \nThe ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room. She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he rests. PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking verydejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm. \nPADME : Are you all right? ANAKIN : It's very cold. \nPADME gives him her over-jacket. \nPADME : You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is cold. ANAKIN : You seem sad. PADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen. ANAKIN : I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll ever see you again.. (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune. \nANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it around her neck. \nPADME : It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always remain. ANAKIN : I care for you too. Only I...miss... \nANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes. \nPADME : ...You miss your mother. \nANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him. \nEXT.

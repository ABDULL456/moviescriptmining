I'm building a Podracer! \nPADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles. \nTHREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked? \nARTOO BEEPS \nTHREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing! \nINT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS \nAMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram. \nBIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me... \nAMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous. \nOBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind. \nINT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY \nQUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit. \nOBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent. QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace. OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying? QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time. \nEXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT \nDARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city. \nDARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master. DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty. DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge. DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command. \nThe hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY \nThe giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house. \nINT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY \nQUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside. JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a little brighter red. \nSHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere. ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no luck. SHMI : Any attempt to escape... ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof! \nPADME and JAR JAR are horrified. \nJAR JAR : How wude. PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws... SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own. \nAn awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment. \nANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace? \nPADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look. \nQUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous. ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it. \nSHMI looks askance at her son. \nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's never heard of a human doing it. QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods. \n", "test1_true": "QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again. \nJAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth. \nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something... QUI-GON : What? ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you? QUI-GON : What makes you think that? ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon. \nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles. \nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him. ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight. QUI-GON : I wish that were so... ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves...have you come to free us? QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not... ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here? \nQUI-GON thinks for a moment. \nQUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept secret. ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim? PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it. ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything! QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we need... JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade. PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind. SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races. QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used properly. ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished... SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you... ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you. \nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset. \nSHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it. \nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina pitty bad goo. GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might be able to help us? \nSHMI shakes her head no. \nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in the universe is no one helps each other... SHMI : Anakin, don't... \nJAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat. \nPADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will find another way... SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but he can help you...he was meant to help you. ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes! \nThe storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY \nThe storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop. \nPADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve. QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know. PADME : Well, I don't approve. \nQUI-GON turns and starts into the shop. \nINT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY \nWATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese. \nWATTO : Patta go bolla! ANKAIN : No batta! WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya. ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno! \nQUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him. \nWATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs) QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee. \nQUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of WATTO. He studies it. \nWATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian. QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need. WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it. \nANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward. \nANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly. WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there. QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. \"The fastest ever built.\" WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think. QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship. \n", "test1_id": 2364, "test2_input": "QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet. WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or nothing. QUI-GON : The boy, then... \nWATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket. \nWATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother... \nWATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue. QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry. \nWATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so...it makes little difference. \nANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine. KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves. \nWATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd. (Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.) \nWATTO walks off, laughing. \nANAKIN : What did he mean by that? \nQUI-GON : I'll tell you later. \nARTOO beeps at THREEPIO. \nTHREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous. \nARTOO emits a series of beeps. \nTHREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships! KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time, Annie. PADME : Do what? KITSTER : Finish the race, of course! PADME : You've never won a race? ANAKIN : Well...not exactly... PADME : Not even finished?! \nANAKN looks sheepish. \nANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time. QUI-GON : Of course you will. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY \nOne of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN, QI-GON, or the QUEEN. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY \nAn EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX) \nA two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene. \nFODE/BEED : - A: Toogi! Toogie!

B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY \nOn the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box. \nFODE/BEED : - (O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!) B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system. A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord Pedrovia.) B : Two time winner, Boles Roor...

MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY \nSEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer. \nKITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a long cable. SHMI gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye. \nSHMI : Be safe. ANAKIN : I will, Mom. I promise. \nShe leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches. \nJABBA : ...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin SKywalker tuta Tatoonine.... \nThe CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's engines. KITSTER and JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back. \nJAR JAR : Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo. \nPADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek. SEBULBA bangs on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He looks around to see if anyone has noticed. \nPADME : You carry all our hopes. ANAKIN : I won't let you down. \nPADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a sinister grin. \nSEBULBA : Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.) ANAKIN : (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo.

QUI-GON approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer. \nJABBA : (sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge begin!) \nThe CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy straps himself into the tiny racer. \nQUI-GON : Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don't think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the Force be with you. \nQUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense. \nEXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY \nThe giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot between the engines.

The platform rises like an elevator. \nSHMI : Is he nervous? QUI-GON : He's fine. PADME : You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen... QUI-GON : The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too. PADME : You assume too much. \nEXT.

He gets caught up in the wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process. OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle. They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS. \nINT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE \nA giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo.

JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the energy balls. The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS. \nINT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE \nANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle.

Eyes now on Johnny. Jenny looks at him with great interest. 
JOHN (uneasy pause) We heard the same. 
AMSTERDAM So then. 
He reaches for the watch. 
CUT TO 
50 EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT 
Happy Jack stands at the lamppost, aghast. A WOMAN lowers her head and retches. Jackls watch and chain are still in place. 
But the watch has been SMASHED. And hanging from the chain is a BLACK CAT, skinned and strangled. 
CUT TO 
51 INT- HIDEOUT 
Happy Jack stands with his Citizens. The room QUIETS as, one by one, the mob notices him. 
JACK You! 
He GRABS the Young Boy who had reached for his watch on the lamppost and starts to BEAT him. 
JACK What'd you do to my watch, you dirty little bastard... 
Jack breaks the Boy's hand with his nightstick. The Boy SCREAMS 
and FAINTS. So does one of the Women in the group. Jack takes the Boy's other hand. 
JACK Hands won't be so quick in future. 
SHANG That's enough sport this evening, Jack. JOHNNY (stepping forward) It wasn't him. 
All turn to look at Johnny. Jack drops the Boy's hand. 
JOHNNY I have word for you from who did it. You're to meet him at Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda. 
CUT TO 
52 INT. SPAPROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT 
A low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played by Orientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages from the ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them and JOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of All-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around. 
JACK All right, step out, you yellow... 
All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues; 
nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling. 
Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play. 
AMSTERDAM Hello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for. 
JACK Then you're marked for dead. 
Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chair across his path. Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick. Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him, HITS him twice on the side of the head. There is a CRACKING SOUND. The PATRONS of the Pagoda gather round. 
CUT TO 
53 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT 
Later. Festive again. And no sign of Amsterdam. 
Two PATRONS step away from the all-sorts barrel. Hanging from the spigot like the cat from the watch chain is the BODY of Happy Jack Mulraney. The belt has been removed from his trousers, tied like a NOOSE around his throat, then looped over the spigot. His TEETH lie scattered on the floor around him. His NIGHT STICK has been jammed down his throat. 
CUT TO 
54 EXT. DOCKS/HIDEOUT NIGHT 
Amsterdam holds the FANCY COAT from Jack's uniform over his arm. Carefully, he DRAPES the coat over Jenny's shoulders. SHANG steps forward. 
SHANG I gave no order for this. 
Amsterdam says nothing at first, just holds his hand out: he's holding the RED SILK SCKRF. 
AMSTERDAM (very quietly) Never mind giving orders. What were you giving this for? SHANG I'm calling you out, Amsterdam. 
AMSTERDAM I got this at the hanging. It was Charles McGloin's. Everybody here saw you take it from Jenny. What was MCGloin doing with it? What'd you give it to him for? 
SHANG I didn't give it to him. Why would I give it to him? 
AMSTERDAM I gaw you give it to him. Last week, behind the Old Brewery. 
SHANG (to group) He's gone flat. I got no reason to trade with the Native Americans. 
AMSTERDAM What about stepping up in the world, as it were, and leaving the rest of us behind. There's a reason. Making a separate arrangement for yourself with the one Native so stupid and luckless that he got hung. That's you to the ground, Shang. 
SHANG (very edgy now; to group) Who believes what he's saying? Can any of you believe what he's saying? 
AMSTERDAM Bene. We'll see. Any of you that believes I did proper by Happy Jack Mulraney tonight, stand beside me. Any of you that still likes Shang's way with the cops, and Shang's way with the Natives, go to him. (to Shang) Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just see which of us is left standing? 
SHANG Let see where they stand. 
Jenny rises, stands next to Amsterdam. Jimmy Spoils, Johnny, Sheeny Mike are next. Now the other members of the mob move in clusters to all STAND with Amsterdam. 
AMSTERDAM What's your pleasure, Shang? 
One of the YOUNG BOYS has a dead rat blackjack hanging from his belt. Shang grabs it. He BITES the head oft the rat and spits it across at Amsterdam. Amsterdam almost smiles at him. Shang sneers, drops the body of the rat, and LEAVES.

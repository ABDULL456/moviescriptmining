DANCES WITH WOLVES Yes. 
KICKING BIRD Good, then take her inside... she is your wife. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES Oh... good... thank you... goodbye... 
The newlyweds disappear into their new home. The flap is dropped and there it stays. The light begins to change, growing darker, the wind comes up, blowing leaves against the door. In the distance there is thunder. 
EXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY 
The lodge flap is still closed. But now it is covered in sunshine. 
Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are just across the way, bundled now against the chill of oncoming winter. They're watching too. Smiles A Lot is standing next to Worm, -- Otter is on his haunches. Both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat as they talk nonchalantly. 
WORM Dances With Wolves' door is closed alot these days. 
SMILES A LOT They're trying to make a baby. 
The two older boys look down at Otter. 
OTTER I know that. 
SMILES A LOT You would think they could have made a baby by now. 
WORM Maybe they're having a hard time. Some people have a hard time. 
SMILES A LOT I don't think they're having a hard time. 
OTTER Me neither. 
A silence as the boys watch smoke curl out of the lodge. Worm laughs to himself. 
OTTER Maybe we should pull the smoke flap closed. Then they would come out. 
The boys look at each other for the first time, their eyes brightening. What a great idea! 
The two boys are stalking toward Dances With Wolves' lodge when they see something that makes them peel off in another direction. 
It's Kicking Bird, coming to call. 
KICKING BIRD Dances With Wolves, are you in there? 
In a moment the lodge flap opens and Dances With Wolves steps outside. He's fully dressed but a little disheveled. 
KICKING BIRD I am riding today to a far away place. It is a place I haven't seen for a long time. A sacred place. I would like you to come with me. 
Dances With Wolves ponders this. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
Kicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are cantering side by side across the open prairie. 
They pull their horses to a walk and Kicking Bird glances Dances With Wolves' direction. 
Dances With Wolves' glances back and smiles. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES It's good to be out. 
KICKING BIRD Yes it must be. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES We are trying for a baby. 
KICKING BIRD No waiting? 
DANCES WITH WOLVES No waiting. 
The medicine man keeps looking at his protege. There is virtually no semblance of Lieutenant Dunbar left. 
KICKING BIRD I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life, there is one that matters more than all the others. It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and it is good to see. 
Dances With Wolves doesn't reply, but he is blushing a little. 
EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY 
Dances With Wolves and Kicking Bird gallop their horses to the crest of a steep hill and rein to a halt. 
Down below, miles distant, is the curving line of a river. But there is a section of river, directly before them, that cannot be seen. It is screened by a mammoth stand of trees, some of them towering a hundred feet or more. 
He glances at Dances With Wolves but his companion doesn't see. He's staring in wonder at the great forest before him. 
KICKING BIRD It is said that all the animals were born here... that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people. Even our enemies say this is a sacred place. 
They start toward the river at a walk. 
EXT. BROKEN FOREST - DAY 
The two riders come out of the sunlight and onto a shaded path leading into the forest. They've only gone a few yards when Kicking Bird pulls to a stop. The men sit on their horses in complete silence. Dances With Wolves is still fully entranced. 
DANCES WITH WOLVES It's quiet. 
But Kicking Bird does not acknowledge his companion's words. He seems to be concentrating on the quiet. The quiet is wrong and Kicking Bird knows it. He moves forward slowly. 
Following behind Kicking Bird, Dances With Wolves' attention is focused on the tree tops above him. A curious buzzing sound has started up and is growing louder by the moment. Perhaps there are bees swarming in the branches overhead. 
Now he is distracted by Cisco coming to a stop. Kicking Bird too has stopped. Just ahead the forest opens into an incredible cathedral-like expanse. Sunlight streams down onto the floor in beautiful pools. 
But still there is a deathly quiet and Dances With Wolves can see now that this remarkable place has been horribly desecrated. 
Trees have been felled everywhere, most of them left to rot for no explicable reason. 
At the same time he sees this destruction Dances With Wolves realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming from overhead but from the forest floor. 
The insects are not bees. They are flies and they are swarming over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground. Badgers, skunks, squirrels and other small animals, nearly all of them killed merely for target practice. 
The men and their ponies move on. Deer carcasses are everywhere, many of them horribly mutilated. A choice flank portion is cut away here and there, while ninety-five percent of the bodies have been left to rot.

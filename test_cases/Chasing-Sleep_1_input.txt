Hi, this is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police. I was wondering if Mrs Eve Saxon had come into work today, or called in, any word from her. Yes. Since yesterday. Did you see her leave yesterday? Yes. About what time was that? I'm not sure. Is she calls, or comes in, could you please ask her to call me. My number is 734-9722, extension 38. Thank you. Bye. 
He hangs up. 
DERM 
She hasn't been in today. 
ED 
My God. 
DERM 
She hasn't called here at all? 
ED 
No. 
DERM 
Any messages? 
He points to the answering machine.  It is blinking, full of messages. 
ED 
I must have been asleep. 
DERM 
That happens. 
ED 
I was up late last night. 
DERM 
I understand.  Why don't we listen to these messages? 
ED 
Alright. 
Ed pushes the button on the machine. 
The first message is from Eve's work. 
CELESTE 
(on machine) 
Hi, this is Celeste, calling for Eve. We're worried about you. You don't come in. You don't call. No, seriously, we just want to make sure you're OK. Don't worry about your students. Marie's covering for you. But give us a call, OK? Bye. 
ED 
That's the school where Eve works.  She's a piano teacher at Franklin High. 
Then there's a message for Ed. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
(on machine) 
Hello, Mr Saxon. This is Mrs Mastrioni from the University. You didn't show up for your morning class and I'm calling to see if you'll be in for your other classes so that I can make the proper arrangements. I assume you remember how to use the phone. 
ED 
Damn. 
DERM 
You're a teacher too? 
ED 
A professor at the University. 
The next message is Derm. 
DERM 
(on machine) 
Hello, this is Detective Derm from the Seattle Police Department... 
Derm takes a small pill box from his overcoat, while the machine plays in the background. 
DERM 
That's me.  Do you have a glass of water? 
ED 
Sure. 
Ed goes into the - 
INT. KITCHEN 
- and fills a glass for the detective. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
When he comes back, he sees Derm casually looking over the woman's magazines on the coffee table. Derm picks up a filled-in New York Times Sunday Crossword and looks it over. 
DERM 
Your wife did this? 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
Smart woman.  The acrostic, too. 
Ed hands Derm the water.

{"train": "STAR WARS \nEpisode IV \nA NEW HOPE \nFrom the JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS \nby George Lucas \nRevised Fourth Draft January 15, 1976 \nLUCASFILM LTD. \nA long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away... \nA vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity. \nIt is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. \nDuring the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. \nPursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... \nThe awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate. \nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY \nAn explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design. \nAnother blast shakes them as they struggle along their way. \nTHREEPIO Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! \nRebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door. \nTHREEPIO We're doomed! \nThe little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand. \nTHREEPIO There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. \nArtoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship. \nTHREEPIO What's that? \nEXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE \nThe Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship. \nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER \nThe nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor. \nIn a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces. \nAn explosion hits near the robots. \nTHREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister... \nArtoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots. \nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY \nA death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. \nA light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him. \nLUKE Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear! \nThe robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly. \nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY \nThe awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic. \nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER \nA woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds. \nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER \nThreepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance. \nTHREEPIO Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? \nA familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion. \nTHREEPIO At last! Where have you been? \nStormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance. \nTHREEPIO They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! \nArtoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him. \nTHREEPIO Wait a minute, where are you going? \nArtoo responds with electronic beeps. \nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR \nThe evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord. \nIMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. \nVader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain. \nVADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted? \nVader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat. \nVADER What have you done with those plans? \nTHREEPIO Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? \nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON \nThe Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. \nThe Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. \nOut of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. \nA voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard. \nBERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. \nLUKE It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. \nLuke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader. \nOWEN I have no need for a protocol droid. \nTHREEPIO (quickly) Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... \nOWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. \nTHREEPIO Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say... \nOWEN Do you speak Bocce? \nTHREEPIO Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce... \nOWEN All right shut up! (turning to Jawa) I'll take this one. \nTHREEPIO Shutting up, sir. \nOWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. \nLUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... \nOWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! \nLUKE All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. \nAs the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box. \nOwen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly. \nLUKE Uncle Owen... \nOWEN Yeah? \nLUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! \nOWEN (to the head Jawa) Hey, what're you trying to push on us? \nThe Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder. \nTHREEPIO (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. \nLUKE Uncle Owen... \nOWEN Yeah? \nLUKE What about that one? \nOWEN (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We'll take that one. \nWith a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo. \nLUKE Yeah, take it away. \nTHREEPIO Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. \nOwen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry. \nLUKE Okay, let's go. \nTHREEPIO (to Artoo) Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face. \nTHREEPIO Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! \nArtoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench. \nLUKE It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! \nTHREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help? \nLuke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face. \nLUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! \nTHREEPIO I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. \nLUKE Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. \nTHREEPIO I see, sir. \nLUKE Uh, you can call me Luke. \nTHREEPIO I see, sir Luke. \nLUKE (laughing) Just Luke. \nTHREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. \nLUKE Hello. \nArtoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body. \nLUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. \nLUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. \nOwen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself. \nLUKE I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. \nOwen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger. \nOWEN That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. \nLUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? \nOWEN He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. \nLUKE He knew my father? \nOWEN I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers. \nLUKE Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. \nOwen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it. \nOWEN You mean the next semester before harvest? \nLUKE Sure, there're more than enough droids. \nOWEN Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. \nLuke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle. \nOWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke. \nLUKE But it's a whole 'nother year. \nOWEN Look, it's only one more season. \nLuke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands. \nLUKE Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. \nAUNT BERU Where are you going? \nLUKE It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids. \nResigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner. \nAUNT BERU Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. \nOWEN I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. \nAUNT BERU Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. \nOWEN That's what I'm afraid of. \nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD \nThe giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE \nLuke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship. \nLUKE What are you doing hiding there? \nThreepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight. \nTHREEPIO It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission. \nLUKE Oh, no! \nLuke races out of the garage followed by Threepio. \nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD \nLuke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars. \nTHREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. \nLUKE How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! \nTHREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? \nLUKE It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. \nOwen yells up from the homestead plaza. \nOWEN Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. \nLUKE All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. \nHe takes one final look across the dim horizon. \nLUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. \nTHREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir. \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA \nMorning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead. \nOWEN Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now! \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN \nThe interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff. \nOWEN Have you seen Luke this morning? \nAUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. \nOWEN Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? \nAUNT BERU I think so. \nLUKE Threepio! \nEXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY \nLittle Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off. \nLuke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on. \nTHREEPIO Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... \nLUKE Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. \nTHREEPIO I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. \nArtoo makes a beeping sound. \nLUKE No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? \nLuke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air. \nBEN Quickly, son... they're on the move. \nINT. KENOBI'S DWELLING \nThe small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as old Ben sits thinking. \nLUKE No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. \nBEN That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. \nLUKE You fought in the Clone Wars? \nBEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. \nLUKE I wish I'd known him. \nBEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... \nBen gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously. Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it. \nBEN I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. \nTHREEPIO Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. \nLUKE Sure, go ahead. \nBen hands Luke the saber. \nLUKE What is it? \nBEN Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. \nLuke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling. \nBEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. \nLuke hasn't really been listening. \nLUKE How did my father die? \nBEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. \nLUKE The Force? \nBEN Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. \nArtoo makes beeping sounds. \nBEN Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. \nLUKE I saw part of the message he was... \nLuke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face. \nBEN I seem to have found it. \nLuke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes. \nLEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. \nThere is a little static and the transmission is cut short. Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes. \nBEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. \nLUKE (laughing) Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. \nBEN I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. \nLUKE I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. \nBEN That's your uncle talking. \nLUKE (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this? \nBEN Learn about the Force, Luke. \nLUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. \nBEN You must do what you feel is right, of course. \nEXT. SPACE. \nAn Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star! \nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM \nEight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking. \nTAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. \nThe bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair. \nMOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! \nBEN These are not the droids your looking for. \nTROOPER These are not the droids we're looking for. \nBEN He can go about his business. \nTROOPER You can go about your business. \nBEN (to Luke) Move along. \nTROOPER Move along. Move along. \nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET \nThe speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder. \nTHREEPIO I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. \nAs Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away. \nLUKE Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. \nBEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. \nLUKE Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? \nBEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. \nLUKE I'm ready for anything. \nTHREEPIO Come along, Artoo. \nINT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA \nThe young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots. \nBARTENDER We don't serve their kind here! \nLuke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift. \nLUKE What? \nBARTENDER Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. \nLuke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare. \nLuke pats Threepio on the shoulder. \nLUKE Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. \nTHREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir. \nThreepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks. \nBen is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold. \nBen speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee. \nLuke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever. \nA large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove. \nCREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? \nThe hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity. \nHUMAN He doesn't like you. \nLUKE I'm sorry. \nHUMAN I don't like you either. \nThe big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer. \nHUMAN Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. \nLUKE I'll be careful than. \nHUMAN You'll be dead. \nThe rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind Luke. \nBEN This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something... \nA powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. The bartender panics. \nBARTENDER No blasters! No blaster! \nWith astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points the the Wookiee. \nBEN This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. \nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET \nThreepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro- droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street. \nTHREEPIO I don't like the look of this. \nINT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA \nStrange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and cocksure. \nHAN Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. \nBEN Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. \nHAN Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? \nBEN Should I have? \nHAN It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! \nBen reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation. \nTHREEPIO You watch your language! \nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED SPEEDER LOT \nBen and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins. \nLUKE He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. \nBEN It will be enough. \nBen and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley. \nBEN If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. \nINT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY \nJabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth. \nJABBA Come on out, Solo! \nA voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight. \nHAN I've been waiting for you, Jabba. \nJABBA I expected you would be. \nHAN I'm not the type to run. \nJABBA (fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together. \nHAN You sent Greedo to blast me. \nJABBA (mock surprise) Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you. \nHAN I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself. \nJABBA Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business. \nHAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time. \nJABBA (to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life. \nHAN Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure. \nEXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY \nChewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street. Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter. \nINT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94 \nChewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship. \nLUKE What a piece of junk. \nThe tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp. \nHAN She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. \nLuke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow. \nHAN We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. \nThe group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han Solo. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON \nChewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship. \nINT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94 \nLuke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo. \nTHREEPIO Hello, sir. \nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET \nEight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature. \nTROOPER Which way? \nThe darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay. \nTROOPER All right, men. Load your weapons! \nINT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94] \nThe troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance. \nTROOPER Stop that ship! \nHan Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship. \nTROOPER Blast 'em! \nHan draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON \nHAN Chewie, get us out of here! \nThe group straps in for take off. \nTHREEPIO Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. \nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS \nThe half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nHan climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope. \nEXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE \nOFFICER To you stations! (to another officer) Come with me. \nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY \nStormtroopers run to their posts. \nINT. DEATH STAR - HANGAR 2037 \nA line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire. \nOFFICER Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! \nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM \nTarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz. \nTARKIN Yes. \nVOICE (over intercom) We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. \nVADER They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. \nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037 \nVader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft. \nVOICE (over intercom) Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. \nOFFICER (to Vader) There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. \nVADER Did you find any droids? \nOFFICER No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. \nVADER Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. \nOFFICER Yes, sir. \nVADER I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since... \nVader turns quickly and exits the hangar. \nOFFICER Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY \nA trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker. \nLUKE Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. \nHAN I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. \nBEN Leave that to me! \nHAN Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! \nBEN Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him? \nHan shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees. \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY \nThe crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp. \nTROOPER The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. \nThe crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below. \nHAN'S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? \nThe stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard. \nINT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE \nIn a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink. \nGANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? \nA stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look. \nGANTRY OFFICER Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. \nAs the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet. \nLUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. \nHAN Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. \nTHREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir. \nBen feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly. \nBEN Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network. \nArtoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something. \nTHREEPIO He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. \nThe computer monitor flashes readouts. \nTHREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. \nBen studies the data on the monitor readout. \nBEN I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. \nHAN Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. \nLUKE I want to go with you. \nBEN Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. \nLUKE But he can... \nHan and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance. \nFinally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters. \nLUKE I can't see a thing in this helmet. \nA bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube. \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY \nSeveral Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him. \nINT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY AREA \nLuke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath. \nHAN This is not going to work. \nLUKE Why didn't you say so before? \nHAN I did say so before! \nINT. DETENTION AREA \nElevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio. \nOFFICER Where are you taking this... thing? \nChewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up. \nLUKE Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight. \nOFFICER I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. \nThe officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke. \nSuddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle. \nHAN Look out! He's loose! \nLUKE He's going to pull us all apart. \nHAN Go get him! \nThe startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on.  He quickly checks the computer readout. \nHAN We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. \nLuke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the buzzing comlink. \nHAN (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation normal. \nINTERCOM VOICE What happened? \nHAN (getting nervous) Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? \nINTERCOM VOICE We're sending a squad up. \nHAN Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous. \nINTERCOM VOICE Who is this? What's your operating number? \nHan blasts the comlink and it explodes. \nHAN Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We're going to have company! \nINT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW \nLuke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open. \nLEIA (finally) Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? \nLuke takes off his helmet, coming out of it. \nLUKE What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. \nLEIA You're who? \nLUKE I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. \nLEIA Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? \nLUKE Come on! \nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM \nDarth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table. \nVADER He is here... \nTARKIN Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? \nVADER A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. \nTARKIN Surely he must be dead by now. \nVADER Don't underestimate the power of the Force. \nTARKIN The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. \nThere is a quiet buzz on the comlink. \nTARKIN Yes. \nINTERCOM VOICE Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty- three. \nTARKIN The princess! Put all sections on alert! \nVADER Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. \nTARKIN If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. \nVADER Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone. \nLEIA Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. \nLUKE Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. \nHAN Where? \nLUKE Anywhere! Oh!! \nSolo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle. \nHAN Luke! Luke! \nSuddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface. \nLEIA Grab him! \nLuke seems to be released by the thing. \nLEIA What happened? \nLUKE I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared... \nHAN I've got a very bad feeling about this. \nBefore anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels. \nLUKE The walls are moving! \nLEIA Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. \nThey place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good. \nLUKE Wait a minute! \nLuke pulls out his comlink. \nLUKE Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be? \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE \nA soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber. \nFIRST TROOPER Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to him! Look there! \nA trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office. \nTHREEPIO They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. \nFIRST OFFICER (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard. \nThe troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office. \nTHREEPIO (to Artoo) Come on! \nThe guard aims a blaster at them. \nTHREEPIO Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. \nTROOPER All right. \nThe guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door. \nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM \nAs the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller. Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. \nHan is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio. \nLUKE Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! \nHan and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash. \nHAN Get to the top! \nLEIA I can't \nLUKE Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL \nTHREEPIO They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. \nLittle Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot. \nTHREEPIO Hurry! \nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM \nThe walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body. \nHAN One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! (to Leia) Get on top of it! \nLEIA I'm trying! \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL \nTHREEPIO (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? \nArtoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio. \nTHREEPIO Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! \nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM \nMeanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt. \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL \nMuffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly. \nTHREEPIO Are you there, sir? \nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM \nHan is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship. \nLEIA You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. \nHAN Nice! Come on! \nHan gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks. \nFIRST TROOPER It's them! Blast them! \nBefore even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor. \nHAN (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship! \nLUKE Where are you going? Come back! \nHan has already rounded a corner and does not hear. \nLEIA He certainly has courage. \nLUKE What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! \nLuke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar. \nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY \nHan chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him. \nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY \nChewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also. \nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY \nLuke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway. \nINT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT \nLuke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back. \nLUKE (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn. \nBlasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door. \nLEIA There's no lock! \nLuke blasts the controls with his laser pistol. \nLUKE That oughta hold it for a while. \nLEIA Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. \nLUKE Oh, I think I just blasted it. \nLuke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds. \nLEIA They're coming through! \nLuke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest. \nAnother trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia. \nLUKE Here, hold this. \nLuke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well. Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops. \nLEIA Here they come! \nLeia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised. \nLEIA For luck! \nLuke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway. \nINT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY \nBen hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi. \nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY \nThreepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp. \nTHREEPIO Where could they be? \nArtoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response. \nINT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR \nHan and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail. \nTROOPER Close the blast doors! \nAt the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut. \nTROOPER Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! \nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY \nBen hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward. \nVADER I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. \nBen Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance. \nVADER When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master. \nBEN Only a master of evil, Darth. \nThe two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. \nBen makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound. \nVADER Your powers are weak, old man. \nHan adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone. \nHAN (to Luke) You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT \nChewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking TIE fighters.

The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in the room and then comes back on. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS \nA TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor hit, and bounces slightly. \nEXT. SPACE \nTwo TIE fighters dive down toward the pirateship. \nINT.

SPACE - TIE FIGHTERS \nThe two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the pirateship. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN PASSAGEWAY \nA laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips. \nTHREEPIO Oooh! \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS \nLeia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the ship's controls. \nLEIA We've lost lateral controls. \nHAN Don't worry, she'll hold together. \nAn enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks. \nHAN (to ship) You hear me, baby? Hold together! \nArtoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT \nLuke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter with his laser cannon. \nINT.

TIE FIGHTER \nLUKE I care! \nLuke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space. \nLUKE So... what do you think of her, Han? \nHAN I'm trying not to, kid! \nLUKE (under his breath) Good... \nHAN Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... \nLUKE No! \nLuke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at young Luke's jealousy. \nEXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN \nThe battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons. \nEXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN \nThe pirateship soars over the dense jungle. \nEXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST \nAn alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside. He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage. \nEXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE \nRotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops. \nLuke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder. \nINT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK \nThe military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her. \nWILLARD (holding Leia) You're safe! We had feared the worst. \nWillard composes himself, steps back and bows formally. \nWILLARD When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father. \nLEIA We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. (looking pointedly to Han) It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. \nEXT. SPACE \nThe surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin. \nINT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM \nGrand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer the call. \nTARKIN Yes. \nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE \nWe are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet. \nEXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE \nA lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green. \nINT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA \nDodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back. \nDODONNA The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. \nGold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna. \nGOLD LEADER Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? \nDODONNA Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. \nArtoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left. \nDODONNA The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. \nA murmer of disbelief runs through the room. \nDODONNA Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. \nLuke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old. \nWEDGE That's impossible, even for a computer. \nLUKE It's not impossible. I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. \nDODONNA Man your ships! And may the Force be with you! \nThe group rises and begins to leave. \nEXT. SPACE \nThe Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon. \nINT. DEATH STAR \nTarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon. \nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE \nOrbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK \nLuke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder. \nMAN'S VOICE (over loudspeaker) All flight trooper, man your stations.

SPACE \nAs the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a city at night as seen from a weather satellite. \nINT.

The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... \nVADER Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. \nLEIA I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... \nVADER You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away! \nLeia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to Vader. \nCOMMANDER Holding her is dangerous.

Now she is my only link to find their secret base! \nCOMMANDER She'll die before she tells you anything. \nVADER Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! \nAnother Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.

My joints are almost frozen. \nArtoo continues to respond with beeping sounds. \nTHREEPIO What a desolate place this is. \nSuddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him. \nTHREEPIO Where are you going? \nA stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot. \nTHREEPIO Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. \nArtoo counters with a long whistle. \nTHREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there? \nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds. \nTHREEPIO Don't get technical with me. \nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds. \nTHREEPIO What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way!

He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas. \nTHREEPIO No more adventures.

He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. \nIn a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him. \nTHREEPIO Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! \nThe bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport. \nTHREEPIO Over here! Help! Please, help! \nEXT.

You should have been there... it was fantastic. \nBIGGS You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.

You can barely hear me... \nBiggs shakes his head angrily and then continues. \nBIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact. \nLUKE You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them. \nBIGGS I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in. \nLUKE And I'm stuck here... \nBIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock. \nLUKE Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. \nBIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster. \nLUKE I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now. \nBIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire. \nLUKE It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock. \nBIGGS Things always change. \nLUKE I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long? \nBIGGS No, I'm leaving in the morning... \nLUKE Then I guess I won't see you. \nBIGGS Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout. \nLUKE Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got. \nBIGGS So long, Luke. \nBiggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET \nThe gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way. \nIn the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path. \nThe unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET \nThe eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine. \nThe filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport. \nINT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA \nIt is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber. \nINT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA \nArtoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom. \nTHREEPIO Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you! \nA battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET \nThe enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge. \nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY \nFour Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half- buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A trooper yells to an officer some distance away. \nFIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. \nA second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper. \nSECOND TROOPER Look, sir -- droids. \nEXT. TATOOINE - DUNES \nThe Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune. \nINT. SANDCRAWLER \nThreepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off. \nTHREEPIO Wake up! Wake up! \nSuddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots. \nTHREEPIO We're doomed. \nA Jawa starts moving toward them. \nTHREEPIO Do you think they'll melt us down? \nArtoo responds, making beeping sounds. \n", "test2_input": "BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. \nBen rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes his gaze on Luke. \nBEN You'd better get on with your exercises. \nHan Solo enters the room. \nHAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. \nLuke is once again practicing with the lightsaber. \nHAN Don't everyone thank me at once. \nThreepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board. \nHAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. \nChewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head. \nTHREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo. \nArtoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee. \nTHREEPIO He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. \nHAN (interrupting) Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. \nTHREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. \nHAN That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. \nTHREEPIO I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win. \nLuke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness. \nBEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. \nLUKE You mean it controls your actions? \nBEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands. \nSuspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a \"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter. \nHAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. \nLUKE You don't believe in the Force, do you? \nHAN Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. \nBen smiles quietly. \nHAN It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. \nBEN I suggest you try it again, Luke. \nBen places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes. \nBEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. \nLUKE (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? \nBEN Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. \nHan skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker. \nBEN Stretch out with your feelings. \nLuke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position. \nBEN You see, you can do it. \nHAN I call it luck. \nBEN In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. \nHAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. \nSolo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel. \nHAN Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. \nHan and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit. \nLUKE You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. \nBEN That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world. \nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM \nImperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader. \nTARKIN Yes. \nOFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. \nTARKIN She lied! She lied to us! \nVADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. \nTARKIN Terminate her... immediately! \nEXT. HYPERSPACE \nThe pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nHAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. \nHan pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship. \nHAN What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. \n", "test2_true": "LUKE What's going on? \nHAN Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan! \nLUKE What do you mean? Where is it? \nHAN Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. \nLUKE What? How? \nBen moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down. \nBEN Destroyed... by the Empire! \nHAN The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... \nA signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming. \nHAN There's another ship coming in. \nLUKE Maybe they know what happened. \nBEN It's an Imperial fighter. \nChewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window. \nLUKE It followed us! \nBEN No. It's a short range fighter. \nHAN There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? \nEXT. SPACE \nThe fighter races past the Corellian pirateship. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. \nHAN Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. \nBEN It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. \nHAN Not for long... \nEXT. SPACE \nThe pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nThe tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca. \nBEN A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. \nLUKE It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. \nHAN Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. \nEXT. SPACE \nThe TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nThe distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet. \nLUKE Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. \nHAN I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range. \nThe small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station. \nBEN That's no moon! It's a space station. \nHAN It's too big to be a space station. \nLUKE I have a very bad feeling about this. \nHAN Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. \nThe pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station. \nLUKE Why are we still moving towards it? \nHAN We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! \nLUKE But there's gotta be something you can do! \nHAN There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! \nBen Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder. \nBEN You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting. \nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR \nAs the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged. \nEXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS \nThe helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons. \nVOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM \nClear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field. \nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037 \nThe pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar.

{"test1_input": "LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. \nOwen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself. \nLUKE I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. \nOwen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger. \nOWEN That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. \nLUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? \nOWEN He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. \nLUKE He knew my father? \nOWEN I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers. \nLUKE Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. \nOwen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it. \nOWEN You mean the next semester before harvest? \nLUKE Sure, there're more than enough droids. \nOWEN Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. \nLuke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle. \nOWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke. \nLUKE But it's a whole 'nother year. \nOWEN Look, it's only one more season. \nLuke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands. \nLUKE Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. \nAUNT BERU Where are you going? \nLUKE It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids. \nResigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner. \nAUNT BERU Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. \nOWEN I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. \nAUNT BERU Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. \nOWEN That's what I'm afraid of. \nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD \nThe giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE \nLuke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship. \nLUKE What are you doing hiding there? \nThreepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight. \nTHREEPIO It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission. \nLUKE Oh, no! \nLuke races out of the garage followed by Threepio. \nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD \nLuke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars. \nTHREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. \nLUKE How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! \nTHREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? \nLUKE It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. \nOwen yells up from the homestead plaza. \nOWEN Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. \nLUKE All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. \nHe takes one final look across the dim horizon. \nLUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. \nTHREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir. \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA \nMorning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead. \nOWEN Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now! \nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN \nThe interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff. \nOWEN Have you seen Luke this morning? \nAUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. \nOWEN Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? \nAUNT BERU I think so. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY \nThe rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland. \nINT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - DAY \nLuke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment. \nLUKE (yelling) How's that. \nThreepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut. \nLUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well. \nTHREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault. \nLUKE (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so... \nTHREEPIO Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt... \nLUKE Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY \nFrom high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired. \nThe Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON \nThe Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR \nThe speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo. \nLUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? \nThe little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway. \nTHREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. \nLUKE Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up. \nTHREEPIO If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop. \nLUKE No, he's not going to try anything. \nSuddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams. \nLUKE What's wrong with him now? \nTHREEPIO Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. \nLuke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south. \nLUKE Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY \nLuke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer. \nLUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. \nLuke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain. \nThe towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh. \nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY \nArtoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror. \nArtoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him. \nBEN Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. \nArtoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around. \nBEN Don't worry, he'll be all right. \nLUKE What happened? \nBEN Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. \nLUKE Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! \nBEN The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? \nLUKE Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? \nBen ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard. \nBEN Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time. \nLUKE I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. \nBEN Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet. \nLUKE You know him! \nBEN Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. \nLUKE Then the droid does belong to you. \nBEN Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... \nHe suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs. \nBEN I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. \nLuke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around. \n", "test1_id": 810, "test2_input": "OFFICER To you stations! (to another officer) Come with me. \nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY \nStormtroopers run to their posts. \nINT.

The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker. \nLUKE Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. \nHAN I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. \nBEN Leave that to me! \nHAN Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! \nBEN Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him? \nHan shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees. \nINT.

DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE \nIn a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink. \nGANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? \nA stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look. \nGANTRY OFFICER Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. \nAs the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet. \nLUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. \nHAN Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. \nTHREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir. \nBen feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly. \nBEN Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network. \nArtoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something. \nTHREEPIO He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. \nThe computer monitor flashes readouts. \nTHREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. \nBen studies the data on the monitor readout. \nBEN I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. \nHAN Whatever you say.

Luke goes over to him. \nLUKE What is it? \nTHREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \"I found her\", and keeps repeating, \"She's here.\" \nLUKE Well, who... who has he found? \nArtoo whistles a frantic reply. \nTHREEPIO Princess Leia. \nLUKE The princess? She's here? \nHAN Princess? What's going on? \nTHREEPIO Level five. Detention block A A-twenty- three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. \nLUKE Oh, no! We've got to do something. \nHAN What are you talking about? \nLUKE The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her. \nHAN Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. \nLUKE But he didn't know she was here.

Han, you put these on. \nLuke sheepishly hands the binders to Han. \nHAN Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. \nThe Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs. \nTHREEPIO Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? \nLUKE Lock the door! \nHAN And hope they don't have blasters. \nTHREEPIO That isn't very reassuring. \nLuke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star. \nINT.

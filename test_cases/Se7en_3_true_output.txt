MILLS I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him. 
SOMERSET Listen... we have to divorce ourselves from our emotions here.  We have to keep focusing on the small details. 
MILLS I don't know about you, Somerset, but I feed off my emotions. 
SOMERSET He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful. 
Mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger.  Somerset grabs him by the jacket. 
SOMERSET (CONT) Are you listening to me?! 
Mills pushes Somerset's hand off. 
MILLS I hear you. 
There is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the SOUND of a CAMERA ADVANCING.  Mills and Somerset look -- 
Down the stairs, John is posing as a reporter.  He has his camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives. 
JOHN Say cheese. 
He takes another picture, flashbulb flashing.  Mills charges downwards, grabs John by his wrinkled clothing. 
MILLS What the fuck are you doing? 
John squirms, holds up a laminated PRESS identification pass. 
JOHN I have a right, Officer.  I... 
Mills shoves him and John stumbles a few steps, then falls to the landing below with a thud.  His glasses fly off. 
MILLS That doesn't mean anything.  This is a closed crime scene now! 
Somerset steps down and pulls Mills back.  John stands. 
JOHN You can't do this!  You can't... 
MILLS Get the fuck out of here! 
John gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight. 
JOHN (O.S.) The public has a right to know! 
Somerset yanks Mills harder, till Mills sits on the stairs. 
MILLS How do those cockroaches get here so quick? 
SOMERSET They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.  You can hate them, but you better give them something, or they'll make it all up. 
MILLS (calming) I'm sorry... I just... 
SOMERSET Oh, it's alright.  It's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions. 
INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 
Mills stands with the blase DR. BEARDSLEY, who reviews a medical chart on a clipboard.  Zero lies inside an oxygen tent with tubes running into him.  The room is dark. 
BEARDSLEY A year of immobility seems about right, judging by the deterioration of the muscles and spinal cord.  Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system.  Heroin... crack... even an antibiotic which was administered to keep the bed sores from infecting. 
Mills looks into the oxygen. 
MILLS He hasn't said anything, or tried to express himself in any way? 
BEARDSLEY Even if his brain were not mush, which it is... he chewed his own tongue off a long time ago. 
Mills winces, moves away from the bed. 
MILLS There's no way he'll survive? 
BEARDSLEY Detective, he'd die right now of shock if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes. 
EXT.  CITY STREET, CATHOLIC CHURCH -- AFTERNOON 
A tall church on a bustling street.  Smoggy air has eaten at the stonework.  The homeless are camped out on the stairs. 
INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH, PRIEST'S QUARTERS -- AFTERNOON 
The priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable. The parish's wealth is evident.  FATHER BLEEKER, 38, stands looking at several 8" by 10" glossies.  He's dressed in his "civilian" clothing, wears his hair short and proper.  These photos are making him heartsick. 
Bleeker hands them to Somerset who is seated by a fireplace. 
BLEEKER Put them away.  I wish you hadn't brought them into the church. 
SOMERSET I needed for you to see them. 
Father Bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget the images.  Somerset replaces the murder photos in a file. 
BLEEKER There were five principal phases in the development of early Christian art. From Hellenistic through the Renaissance... each period was affected by the decrees of religious leaders. 
SOMERSET If this killer belongs to a certain branch of the church... if he collects religious art from a certain period, I want to know.  I have to narrow it down. 
Bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet.  He puts on a pair of cotton gloves. 
BLEEKER The influences on these... things he's done, couldn't have come before the Gothic period.  What's in those pictures is presented far too asymmetrically. 
Bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet. He takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth. 
BLEEKER (CONT) The colors will tell the tale. 
Bleeker takes the book to a table.  Somerset follows.  Bleeker lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly. 
BLEEKER (CONT) Each sin had a symbolic color.  But the specific color designations changed throughout the ages. 
Somerset leans to examine Bleeker's illuminated manuscript: 
Two pages of prayer.  The prose is elaborately formed, surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins. Bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a rock, guzzling from a jug.  It's been painted in orange.

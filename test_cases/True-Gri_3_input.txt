Rooster I must get you to a doctor, sis, or you are not going to make it. (to LeBoeuf) The girl is snakebit. We are off. 
He swings up behind her and nods down to LeBoeuf. 
. . . I am in your debt for that shot, pard. 
LeBoeuf Never doubt the Texash Ranger. 
Rooster reins the horse around and spurs it. LeBouef shouts after: 
. . . Ever shtalwart! 
The horse takes to the steep slope reluctantly, with stiff legs, Rooster kicking it on. Tree branches slap at him and take his hat. His face, already peppered with shot, gets new scratches. 
THE MEADOW 
Mattie is woozy. As Little Blackie crosses the field at full gallop Mattie looks blearily at the littering bodies of horses and men. 
Next to Lucky Ned's body his horse, saddled and riderless, swings its head to watch as Rooster and Mattie pass. 
Mattie's eyes are closing. 
LATE DAY 
Mattie's eyes half-open. 
Little Blackie plunges on, through a rough road in woods, but slower now, his mouth foaming. 
Rooster Come on, you! 
Mattie We must stop. Little Blackie is played out. 
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: 
Rooster We have miles yet. 
He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife. He leans back and slashes at the horse's whithers. Little Blackie surges. 
Mattie screams. 
Mattie No! 
A locked-down shot as horse and riders enter at a gallop and recede. 
NIGHT 
It has started to snow. 
Mattie is flushed and soaked with sweat. 
The horse is laboring for breath. 
Rooster gives inarticulate curses as he kicks it on. 
Mattie looks ahead: 
Barely visible in the moonlight a man mounted bareback rides on ahead. A sash cord holds a rifle to his back. 
He recedes, outpacing us, disappearing into the darkness and the falling snow. 
Mattie He is getting away. 
Rooster Who is getting away? 
Mattie Chaney. 
Rooster Hold on, sis. 
Mattie is falling. It is unclear why. 
Her legs squeeze the horses flanks. 
Her hand tightens on the horses mane. 
Rooster's arm reaches around to hold her. 
Little Blackie is giving out, going to his knees and then all the way down. 
Rooster hangs on to Mattie as the horse sinks. He pulls her clear, lays her on the ground, and then steps away from her, taking out a gun.

GRANT Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know. 
BRENDA What? 
GRANT Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt. 
Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks at her in her bra. 
GRANT Nice. 
Grant unbuttons his shirt as well.    As he removes it completely, he turns toward her. 
Brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing. 
BRENDA Grant!?    What -- ?! 
Grant grabs her.    She tries to push his arms away. 
BRENDA No, no, we -- 
Brenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls into the creek beside them. 
Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.    She struggles to get free. 
Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing, tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She SCREAMS. 
Grant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up. He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches, feeling its way like a blind snake. 
The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh. 
Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid -- pumps through the tubule and into Brenda. 
Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms there beside him. 
Then she falls back, unconscious.   The tubule retracts into Grant's torso. 
EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE BACK PORCH - NIGHT 
Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy. 
STARLA Hey, Bill! 
Starla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant is watching. 
BILL Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked. 
STARLA That's not funny. 
BILL Sorry. 
STARLA Whatcha' doin'? 
BILL Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass. 
Starla LAUGHS. 
BILL What you up to? 
STARLA Just checking out the lights. 
Bill and Starla look out over the city together. 
BILL Pretty, ain't they? 
STARLA I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile. 
BILL Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot. 
Starla looks at him. 
BILL There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope. 
STARLA Oh, yeah? 
BILL Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me. 
STARLA I'll get Wally to show me sometime then. 
Starla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill. 
BILL Oh, will you now? 
STARLA                            GRANT (O.S.) Or Rollo's ghost.               Starla.

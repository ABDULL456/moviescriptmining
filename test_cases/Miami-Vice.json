OCEAN - CLOSE UP:  WATER - MORNING LIGHT \nWe are at the delicate interface between ocean and air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules evaporate.  This interchange is ethereal.  Then, low frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now... And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots... \nOFFSHORE RACER:  \"BORN TO WIN\" \nin PROFILE. \nAERIAL:  \"BORN TO WIN\" \n...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half mile.  It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left... \nINT. RACE BOAT - SONNY CROCKETT \npilots the \"Born to Win\" in full helmet.  On the throttle and flaps is RICARDO TUBBS... \nEXT. OCEAN - \"BORN TO WIN\" \nleads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.  At the last moment occurs a small power loss, and \"Born to Win\" gets nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, \"Goddess\"... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARINA - \"BORN TO WIN\" - LATER \nthunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.  The canopy is up.  Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.  Dockhands tie it off.  It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine- figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions about asset origins.  The exception is \"Born to Win's\" sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4\" SWITEK.  He looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.  Next to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.  We'll see her again. \nWINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS \nin second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of \"Goddess,\" neither of whom speak English.  The #3 boat, \"Bicardi Silver,\" was driven by David Scott and throttled by John Tomlinson... \nCROCKETT + TUBBS \nleave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican billionaires.  As the small crowd breaks up... \nA DEEPLY-TANNED PLAYER \nnamed NICHOLAS in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair glides by... \nNICHOLAS (low) Burnett, what's crackin'? \nCROCKETT Nothing. \nTUBBS Maxin' and relaxin'. \nNICHOLAS (doesn't believe them) Sure.  Change your mind; get inclined?  Let me know... \nWhatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't want.  (Nicholas brokers \"go-fast\" runs, moving loads from offshore into South Florida.  Among guys who pilot offshore race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but no one's found them yet.)  Meanwhile... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHT \nA couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel. Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss. Fan starts.  Beyond the kitchen we SEE through a dining room to a den.  A chair is overturned.  We HEAR muffled sounds. We SEE feet extend through a door jamb.  Someone's on the floor.  A television is playing, distantly. \nINT. DEN - SEE FAMILY PICTURES \nso close they almost come to life.  A Venezuelan family, two boys and a girl in a pool.  Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at their sister's baptism.  And we see holding the baby daughter is Riccardo Tubbs. \nA family dinner at a South American restaurant.  Tubbs sits with the youngest daughter on his lap.  Maria is on the other side of him.  This is the image that almost comes to life. We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday afternoon when families take the grandparents and have dinner. \nenter an 8,000-square-foot penthouse...offshore racer types, players, So Bee models... \nUGO Runnin' the Biscayne 200? \nCrockett wanders off... \nTUBBS If a coupla new exhaust manifolds show up... \nCROCKETT \napproaches a bar and female bartender... \nCROCKETT Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles. \nBARTENDER (Scandinavian accent) Lemon or lime? \nCROCKETT Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from? \nBARTENDER (leaning in) Gottingen.  That's in Sweden. \nCROCKETT You in Miami workin' on your complexion...? \nShe's beautifully bronzed. \nBARTENDER (laughs) No.  I was in Namibia... \nCROCKETT Doing...? \nBARTENDER With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief. \nGina's listening on her personal comms. \nCROCKETT Really?  I did refugee relocation in Somalia.  But they transferred me out after I was wounded... \nGina rolls her eyes as she crosses by Tubbs. \nGINA Only African he ever \"relocated\" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him... \nTUBBS He did volunteer one time... \nTRUDY (entering) For a massage parlor bust? (beat) Why am I here...? \nTRUDY JOPLIN is a tall African-American.  She whispers into a small mic.  If you looked closely, she's ripped...as if steel cables moved under her smooth skin.  She slides past Tubbs and Gina... \nTUBBS (low) ...to backup Switek.  But only if it gets lethal. \nTRUDY That's impossible. \nTUBBS Why? \nTRUDY Because you cannot kill him. \nSWITEK \nall white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed, adrenaline junkie partner, ZITO.  Approaching is \"Miss Ukraine.\"  High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek finds her... \nTubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is unusually fit. \nTUBBS And there's Dmitri... \nCROCKETT The honey trap.  And there's the honey. \nTUBBS Hello, Miss Ukraine... \nMISS UKRAINE brings Switek his glass of champagne...  She whispers something in his ear...and is led towards a back bedroom.  Gina ambles over. \nTRUDY (to Crockett) Eleven to seven he blows it. \nCROCKETT (whispers) Twenty on my man... \nTRUDY You're giving away your money, fool... \nTubbs opens his Moto as if he's about to make a call...Trudy looks over his shoulder.  What we see is the feed from the monitor in the surveillance room downstairs. \nCLOSER: TUBBS'S MOTO \nTwo blonde people starting to get naked.  Switek and Miss Ukraine.  A second call comes in.  Tubbs ignores it. \nWIDEN.  Everybody goes back to their cars.  As the two \"Russians\" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open. \nARYAN BROTHER Hey, Ivan!  I forgot to ask you something, my brother... \nHe looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a Nextel. \nARYAN BROTHER (cont'd) ...they have a decent death-benefit program in the FBI? \nFor the Russians in the car, time freezes.  As they start to react, they're blown up by .50 caliber rounds from the two sniper positions.  The .50 caliber rounds go right through car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh, bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end. Another round goes through the passenger door, through the passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into the night... \nWIDE \nThe three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash.  The Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles.  They load up and drive off as we hear the \"thump, thump\" of Air Support and some distant sirens.  Meanwhile... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI-DADE CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO - NIGHT \nat 170 knots watching a thermographic image of Alonzo Stevens' car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on the 95...  SEE Tubbs' Sikorsky beyond Switek + Zito as it swoops from a higher altitude right past the Miami-Dade chopper, banks and dives for the freeway. \nEXT. FREEWAY \nTracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front. \nThe black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood.  Tubbs racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in the copilot seat... \nCLOSER:  CROCKETT \nhas his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the shoulder.  Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's Bentley.  Alonzo pulls over.  Tubbs wheels around and lands on the shoulder.  They approach... \nALONZO STEVENS \nexits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs.  He holds his hand out to keep them at a distance. \nFreeway traffic roars past.  Crockett and Tubbs don't get too close, heeding Alonzo's warning... \nTUBBS (incensed, over traffic noise) What the hell did you do? \nSTEVENS The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types... \nStevens takes a low-resolution E-mailed image from his pocket and hands it to Tubbs.  Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to Crockett.  Stevens' head rotates loosely on his shoulders...his mind's elsewhere... \nCROCKETT'S POV:  IMAGE \nAlonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair in a TV room.  On the floor are two young boys bound with plastic ties.  Paper bags are over their heads.  Francine's eyes are as large as saucers.  Around her neck is a necklace of C-4 explosive connected to a detonator. \nSTEVENS (cont'd) (shouts) So I gave them up, man!  Gave up the Feds!  Gave up everything I knew.  Now I got to go home... \nCROCKETT How'd they get onto you? \nSTEVENS How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them. (beat) Sonny, I gotta go...! \nMEANWHILE: \nINT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - TRUDY - NIGHT \nand a Miami PD SWAT team crash through the front door. Another team through the back.  Trudy in a tactical vest is second in with a 12-gauge.  The house is empty.  Gina and other detectives hang in the rear.  First SWAT team \"clears\" the living room, dining room.  Second clears the kitchen, maid's quarters... \nINT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - DOOR TO DEN - NIGHT \n...last room to clear...center of the house.  SWAT teams appear around corners.  Weapons up.  The looks on their faces tell us nobody is here...nobody alive...and what they see gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the legs of a family and overturned chairs.  Alonzo didn't save anyone. \nTRUDY (after changing channel) Hello, Sonny...? \nEXT. FREEWAY - TUBBS \non police radio listens to a message from Trudy while... \nSTEVENS (to Tubbs) I gotta, I gotta go...! \nTUBBS Alonzo... \nSTEVENS What...? \nTUBBS (voice cracks) Alonzo, you don't need to go home. \nNow Alonzo knows. \nFUJIMA Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there... \nCROCKETT How do we do that?  Make a buy? (wry) That went well... \nTUBBS Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them? \nFUJIMA They got a steady stream of supply. So, no... \nCROCKETT From whom...? \nFUJIMA A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono. \nCROCKETT Never heard of him. \nFUJIMA From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think. \nTUBBS Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So... \nCROCKETT Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...? \nFUJIMA They're not.  They collect in Miami.  Montoya, the producer, handles deliveries.  That's his end, and he varies the routes.  We got some FLIR off an AWAC of a coupla go-fast boats, on one run, that's all. \nFujima boots up his military-spec laptop to view the FLIR video.  Meanwhile... \nTUBBS Track with me, here... (beat) They knew the \"Russians\" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money... (beat; to Fujima) What does that say to you? \nCROCKETT (speculating) It says, \"We do not fear you.\" (to Fujima) It says, \"Fuck off and die.\"  It says, \"We get down for recreation...\" \nFujima's Dell laptop glows to life.  Two almost indistinguishable boats and their wakes are SEEN. \nCROCKETT (cont'd) Blow that up... \nCrockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots about the wake emerging behind each boat.  He exchanges a look with Tubbs.  But they say nothing. \nTUBBS (to Crockett) So? \nCROCKETT We could try to run loads into these guys. (to Fujima) Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group. \nFUJIMA You need to consider a few issues. \nCASTILLO (to Crockett + Tubbs) ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup... (to Fujima) And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya... \nFUJIMA Sure. \nCASTILLO I mean full disclosure. \nFUJIMA Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it... (to Castillo) So let me know if we're on... \nFujima splits.  Castillo waits until Fujima's car pulls away. \nCASTILLO (to Tubbs) About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them. \nTUBBS I was the kids' godfather. \nCASTILLO (intuits) And...? \nTUBBS \"And\" what? \nCASTILLO I got to know.  There is never any room for \"personal\"... \nCROCKETT (for Tubbs) He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die... (beat) Everybody gets it. \nCASTILLO Good. \nTUBBS And the answer is \"yes.\" (beat) Before she met Alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago. (beat) You bet it was personal. \n...and is now compartmentalized in the past. \nCASTILLO Okay. (to Crockett) What'd you spot...? \nCROCKETT Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull? \nTUBBS Sal Maguda. \nCASTILLO He any good? \nTUBBS Oh, yeah... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LA PERLA DISTRICT OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - TWILIGHT \nCorrosion and decay.  People look coldly at us.  Malevolence and malefaction on every corner.  No one's picked up the garbage for a month.  Poverty in the Caribbean half-light... \nCROCKETT & TUBBS \ncross the street to CAMERA from their rental car.  The La Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates.  It's had little civic improvements in 400 years. \nThey enter a nightclub - shabby neon. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - CROCKETT + TUBBS - TWILIGHT \nThere are no customers.  They're cautious.  Men stop them and frisk them.  They expected that. \nCROCKETT We're from Nicholas to meet Jos\u00e9... \nThey're waved to the rear.  They start towards a back table. A small group of people wait... \nOVER CROCKETT + TUBBS APPROACHING:  JOS\u00c9 \"COCHI LOCO\" YERO \nHe's a former right-wing Colombian paramilitary from the North Valle near the Pacific coast.  He runs operations, communications and security.  He has cold eyes and a corpulent face.  He's notorious for using torture to ferret-out informants.  Right now he watches these two Americans approach.  Security people are on either side of him. \nJOS\u00c9 YERO (extends hand) Jos\u00e9... \nCROCKETT Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico. \nJOS\u00c9 YERO Sit. \nAs Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the side is a woman.  This is ISABELLA.  Behind glasses, she seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in subdued Tom Ford and staring at him.  Reading him.  Crockett holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business... \nCROCKETT (to Security) Dos caf\u00e9. \nHe's security, not a fucking waiter.  But Yero nods. Security fetches coffee, anyway. \nTUBBS So lay it out, my brother... \nJOS\u00c9 YERO Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good? \nCROCKETT What...? \nJOS\u00c9 YERO Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you? \nTubbs looks at Crockett.  They thought it was a done deal. \nCROCKETT (dark) My mommy and daddy know me. \nIsabella tilts her head imperceptibly. \nTUBBS And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us... (beat) ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us before Nicholas calls. \nCROCKETT That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time. \nYero's security reacts to the tone and raises weapons.  A few start up out of their chair as... \nZITO + SWITEK \nappear at the door, SMGs from shoulder straps.  Zito flips a D14 hand grenade which Crockett snatches out of the air, pulls the pin and slams on the table.  Everyone FREEZES. \nOnly Crockett's hand pressure restrains the clip. \nCROCKETT (cont'd) (goes right up in Yero's face) You want to \"know\" shit?  Who the fuck are you?  You got a side deal with U.S. Customs to open up the coast in a few spots...in exchange you flip them some gringo runners? Like us...? \nTUBBS You wearing a wire? \nTubbs rips open Yero's shirt. \nCROCKETT Or DEA?  The Feeb? \nYero's shirt...open to the waist.  No wire.  Yero's furious. \nYero's people have weapons pointed their way.  They outnumber Switek and Zito.  Slack's taken up on triggers.  It's on the edge.  And the edge is overloaded.  Tubbs reads that, warns Yero... \nTUBBS People gonna walk into this place and say, \"Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?\" \nCROCKETT \"No, viejo.  That was Jos\u00e9 Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall.\" \nTubbs and Gina are not random lovers, they're in love.  The look in her eyes, the openness is pure femininity behind the Bronx presentation.  She smiles, touches the side of his face. \nEXT. SAFE HOUSE, ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT - NIGHT \nties up a 75' Sun Seeker.  It looks like a 38' deep-V offshore racer on growth hormones.  Crockett's alone, as dusk fades over the '60's ranch house on the river.  It's under tropical trees, with one strip of white neon utility lighting outlining the flat eave. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - CROCKETT \nlet himself in.  He's at a kitchen stool at the counter when Tubbs enters in sweats. \nTUBBS Anything? \nCROCKETT Nothing. \nGina enters in a robe... \nGINA (beat) \"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny.\" \nCROCKETT Hi, Gina. (putting shopping bag on table) This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy? \nTUBBS (re:  bag) What do we got? \nCrockett pulls out three overly-large cell phones... \nCROCKETT Satellite.  New encryption. Supposedly sharper than the G... (to Gina) How good's our background? \nTubbs and Crockett look at the Mac screen as Gina boots it up.  Gina's fingers tap dance on the keyboard. \nGINA You're so not the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school. (to Tubbs) San Quentin.  Pelican Bay. (to Crockett) Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again... \nCROCKETT How will it stand up? \nGINA If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - BAD 3 AM TELEVISION - LATER \nNo one's watching it. \nINT. BEDROOM - GINA \nasleep.  Tubbs' eyes are wide open, staring... \nINT. SECOND BEDROOM - ECU:  PAGER \nlights up.  Beeps.  Crockett's hand grabs it.  It's the summons from Jos\u00e9 Yero. \nINT. KITCHEN - GINA - PRE-DAWN \nGINA (Lazily) What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...? \nTUBBS Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do... \nHe leans over and kisses her.  She holds firmly the back of his neck and looks into his eyes. \nGINA Be...careful...  You hear me? \nHe winks at her in assurance and he's gone.  Her lazy smile drops off.  \"Careful\"...she's not so sure he will be... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LEAR 55 JET - TUBBS PILOTS \nCrockett in the copilot seat.  Switek and Zito are in the back, barely awake.  Zito hands out coffee.  Switek's stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery.  Tubbs is clearing US air space as we... \nEXT. SKY - AERIAL:  LEAR JET \nrockets through cumulonimbus against a black sky up to 35,000 feet. \nTUBBS Where we meeting 'em...? \nCROCKETT Port-Au-Prince. \nEXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE AIRPORT, RUNWAY - LEAR JET - DAWN \ntouches down, drives towards us...  Turns towards commercial aviation facility... \nCLOSER:  HATCH \nISABELLA (O.S.) (to Crockett) Put your guns on the table... (enters, sits) If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here. \nCROCKETT Really?  So, what is this, a party? \nCrockett + Tubbs put down their weapons. \nTUBBS We'll have room service wipe up the furniture...and bring drinks. \nIsabella says something in French.  The Cops ease-up. Isabella's personal security frisks Crockett + Tubbs and remain.  Paramilitary leave. \nCROCKETT Glad we came.  This place is a lot of fun if you're Doctors Without Borders.  So...? \nIsabella takes off her glasses.  She's Afro-Cuban. \nISABELLA I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall. \nTUBBS Define small. \nISABELLA Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is (beat) Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. (beat) For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load. (beat) Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided... (beat) No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil... (beat) That's the deal. \nCROCKETT I thought we had to meet the Man. \nISABELLA You do. \nCROCKETT When? \nISABELLA Right now. \nAs she leaves... \nINT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT \nin the back seat on a rural road.  Isabella is not with them. One of her Russians is.  In the front seat, his SMG is ready; his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs. \nEXT. ROAD - CARAVAN \nA military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her security.  Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with Haitian paramilitary. \nINT. MERCEDES - TUBBS \nThey approach a town.  He nudges Crockett.  A police roadblock's ahead. \nCROCKETT \nhas seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his waist. \nTUBBS' POV:  PAGER - NO SIGNAL \nThat's what's surprising.  Tubbs pulls his cell phone. Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock. Crockett gets tense... \nTUBBS \nwatches.  His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to zero. \nEXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS \nstop the caravan.  Is this turning bad? \nINT. CAR - CROCKETT \nalarmed. \nEXT. ROADBLOCK - HAITIAN COPS \ncheck under the vehicles with mirrors.  See all the weapons. Salute.  Usher the convoy past. \nINT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS \nexchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by Haitian military. \nEXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR \nis snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security. Mercedes pulls forward... \nCROCKETT \neyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a dope deal. \nholds his. \nCROCKETT \nSound deadens.  His attention is on the woman in the mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell phone. \nTUBBS' CELL PHONE \nSignal strength returns.  Tubbs punches in numbers. \nTUBBS (low) ...who did we just meet? \nHe waits.  A phone rings.  It's picked up by Gina. \nGINA (O.S.) Hello...? \nTubbs is relieved... \nTUBBS You okay? \nGINA Yeah. \nTUBBS You sure? \nGINA Yes.  What's up? \nTUBBS Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GINA \nGINA Bored. \nTo Tubbs, that's good news. \nTUBBS Okay...see you soon. \nGINA ...and thanks for the flowers. \nEXT. HAITIAN TOWN SQUARE - TUBBS \nTUBBS What flowers? \nGINA The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow. \nPause. \nTUBBS There a note? \nPause. \nGINA You mean with the flowers...? \nTUBBS What's it say? \nGINA \"Salutations from the south...\" \nA deep chill. \nGINA (cont'd) I...I thought it was from you. \nAnd, now, she gets it.  Gina is in the kitchen.  Alone, in their secret safe-house location.  She and Tubbs have nothing to say.  He looks to Crockett.  The message from Montoya- Londono is clear:  I know you.  I can reach out and locate you our yours.  Anytime.  YOU ARE NOT SAFE. \nTUBBS We're on our way... \nINT. KITCHEN - GINA - NIGHT \nTUBBS (O.S.) (forced casual) So why don't you...meet the plane... \nWe sense this is code.  It means get the fuck out of there right now! \nGINA (cool) Okay. \nTUBBS Good idea. (beat) We'll grab a bite. \nGina ends the call, drops to the floor to the wall, kills the lights, holds her Sig .9mm at her side as she moves deeper into the interior... \nZITO (V.O.) Roger that. \nINT. A-500 - CROCKETT - MUCH LATER \nis dozing.  A signal. \nTubbs points up and to the right.  Crockett wakes, looks.  An Aero Commander Turbo Twin is paralleling the A-500's course. Now, it slides over them...almost into a collision.  It sits right over the A-500, separated by only 75 feet. \nINT.

What's up? \nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER I've got an Aero Commander coming in on a two-seventy-nine heading, but I had a double image...like there's another plane there, now I'm only picking up on one.  What do you read? \nINT. US CUSTOMS AWAC - RADAR OFFICER \nRADAR OFFICER Let me see... \nHis FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) picks up Switek and Zito's Air Commander.  He flips through all the different modalities of detection, including thermography, for anything else suspicious in the airspace... \nAWAC RADAR OFFICER (into mic) Too many Mai Tais at lunch... You're seeing double.  One blip. One plane. \nEXT. SKY - SIDE SHOT:  THE AERO COMMANDER LIKE A PANCAKE ON TOP OF THE A-500 RIGHT BELOW IT \nWe get the joke.  The A-500 with its stealthiness under the Aero Commander together like a single footprint. \nAERIAL ANGLE:  TWO PLANES \npiggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into Florida. \nFrom underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane and its load into the United States of America. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIRCLE 6 MOTEL, PARKING LOT - U-HAUL-IT TRUCK - NIGHT \nAlone in the acid-yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights. We wait.

This is his kind of deal.  Crime on crime.  Who's gonna call the cops? \nCROCKETT (skeptical) Usually his thing is street dealers.  Torture their families until they cough up the stash. This...? \nJEAN-LOUIS He's ambitious. \nTUBBS Heads up... \nESCALADE \nLights off.  Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul- It to the other side and disappears. \nTUBBS (cont'd) That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's worth more than the real estate. But no one's supposed to notice his drive-by? \nCROCKETT Here's another incognito genius... \nThe empty mansion is on its own peninsula.  Through the windows we see a yacht and Crockett's 48' Stryker, its canopy open but without its racing supergraphics.  The mansion interior...all Beaumaniers limestone...is devoid of all furnishing.  They sit on white plastic garden chairs from Sears. \nJOS\u00c9 YERO (suspicious) I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda. \nTUBBS You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again... \nCROCKETT How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours? \nJOS\u00c9 YERO What'd Neptune tell you? \nCROCKETT He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set. (beat) So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations? \nJOS\u00c9 YERO (whispers in Spanish to Isabella) Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load... \nYero's certain about their motive. \nISABELLA We want it back. \nCROCKETT Okay. \nISABELLA What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for? \nTUBBS (to Crockett) How much we looking for? \nCROCKETT Nothing. \nISABELLA What's \"nothing\"? \nCROCKETT Nothing.  As in \"free, gratis.\" \nTUBBS And as an investment in the future... \nISABELLA (takes off her glasses and looks at Crockett) \"Future\" of...? \nCROCKETT A fine...business...relationship... \nShe holds Crockett's look...as she did before. \nTUBBS It's yours cause what's yours, is yours.  And what's ours is ours... (to Yero) ...like the second ten-percent, which is now due, Yero, my ace. \nIsabella gestures.  Yero kicks across the floor a cardboard box full of money.  Tubbs glances inside.  Doesn't count it. \nTUBBS (cont'd) What's up next?  Or is this a one- time deal? \nIsabella decides. \nISABELLA (to Yero) Give them the shipment on the seventeenth... \nYero doesn't like it.  She gestures \"do it.\" \nTUBBS Conveyance? \nISABELLA Maritime.  Jose will fill you in. \nAnd she starts to leave...and sensing Crockett's gotten up and follows her.  Meanwhile \nTUBBS (to Yero) Lay it out... \nAnd Crockett, close behind Isabella, now... \nCROCKETT (low) There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product... \nISABELLA (low) And what is that? \nThis is the wife of narcotrafficker Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono. \nCROCKETT Let me buy you a drink. \nIsabella pauses.  Crockett may get killed right now.  They're near the open doors to the patio. \nISABELLA (low) What do you like to drink? \nCROCKETT (low) I'm a fiend for mojitas. \nIsabella looks over at Crockett's boat.  Back to Crockett... \nISABELLA (low) How fast does that go? \nISABELLA I never do business in Cuba. (beat) And nobody goes to Cuba but me. (smiles) And he is not my husband... \nCrockett's surprised.  And he doesn't push it. \nCROCKETT Were you born in Havana? \nISABELLA Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too... (over the wind) ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there... \nCROCKETT Where's she now? \nISABELLA She's dead... \nCrockett looks at her.  Her perspective is that of the '60's and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon. \nCROCKETT Your father? \nISABELLA Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...? \nIsabella looks at the look on Crockett's face. \nISABELLA (cont'd) Go ahead and ask... \nCROCKETT How's he not your husband? \nISABELLA I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel... (looks at him, shouts over wind) And I can do anything I want... \nShe laughs.  She has that combination of intellect, beauty and youth.  Everything is possible...life will never end...she can ride this crest eternally. \nAnd Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to peril, makes \"right now\" too real because she believes she will live forever. \nCROCKETT \ncan't help it.  He looks right at her.  She lifts her face to the spray.  Some clouds part and light strikes her... \nAnd Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.  He wants no one else to have her.  He wants no harm to come to her. And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who he is.  And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn away... \nISABELLA \nsees this.  She's quizzical.  Crockett looks back at her. Their eyes connect. \n\"BORN TO WIN\" \nleaps... \nCROCKETT \nhis left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel. She rocks back against his body.  They rip across the seas... \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"JAZZ\" - A HAVANA NIGHTCLUB JAMMED WITH PEOPLE - NIGHT \n14-piece Afro-Cuban band.  IN THE PRESS OF dancers at a small table, Crockett and Isabella... \nCROCKETT (shouts over noise) Mojitas...? \nISABELLA (shouting back) Later!  Do you dance? \nCROCKETT I dance... \nThey move into the crowd under two-story high windows overlooking Meyer Lansky's Hotel Riviera - freeze-dried 1959 Las Vegas. \nCROCKETT + ISABELLA \nWhatever we knew about Sonny Crockett, we did not know he could dance.  Their feet, their knees and thighs, perfectly matched, they samba, like lightning. \nHe swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as their hips and legs parallel each other's, as he turns her under his arm, stops her, pulls her backwards into his body, her hips into his, the fast beat, the footwork, and he spins her back facing him, pressing her closer as it gets faster and... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - CROCKETT + ISABELLA \nfall onto a bed, shedding the last of their clothes, making love in a house somewhere.  Beyond them is an open window to the ocean.  The sky turns red and grey but the water stays molten. \nTheir eyes are open...because they're locked together the whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised because this is not language; not a symbol, not a representation of a thing.  Jesus Montoya is not here.  Miami is not here.  This is discovery.  This is fact.  They have discovered each other and have never felt like this about anyone before in their lives. \nCUT TO: \nCROCKETT Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow... \nFUJIMA Out of...? \nCROCKETT Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe. \nTUBBS Their loads are poly-drug.  \"E\" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan \"H.\" Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network. \nCROCKETT And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out. \nTUBBS So we want to change-up the mission statement. \nFUJIMA (no) Identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers. End of story.  Everything else I'm hearing is speculation masquerading as intel... \nCrockett flips him a set of keys. \nFUJIMA (cont'd) What's this? \nCROCKETT Keys to the boat.  Go do this motherfucker yourself. \nFujima looks at Castillo...who is this insubordinate prick? \nFUJIMA Who are you talking to? \nTUBBS He's talking to you, bro. (beat) What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization... \nCROCKETT (re: Fujima) Hey, fuck him. \nTUBBS Chill out Sonny. \nCROCKETT We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC... \nFUJIMA (to Castillo) Control your men. \nCROCKETT I'm my own man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am? \nCASTILLO (low) That's.  It. \nEverybody shuts up. \nCASTILLO (cont'd) (to Tubbs) Where are you on this? \nWe know Tubbs has doubts about Crockett's motives and methods, nevertheless... \nTUBBS With Sonny.  110%. \nCASTILLO Then that's it. (to Fujima) Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being. \nFUJIMA I don't know. \nCASTILLO Yes you do... \nFUJIMA I got to talk to my ADO... \nCASTILLO No, you don't, Jim. (beat) 'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be? \nFujima nods acquiescence. \nFUJIMA Okay. \nHe leaves.  When he's out of earshot... \nCASTILLO (to Crockett) You fuckin' better be right...! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FREIGHTER ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT \nstep across to a second ship among the dozens tied-up along the river.  Its crimson paint is peeling and it's been stripped of everything salvageable.  They're alone. \nTUBBS (low) What is going on...?! \nCROCKETT As in...? \nTUBBS There is \"undercover.\"  And there is \"Which way is up?\" \nCROCKETT You think I am in so deep I forgot? \nMontoya looks at her very carefully.  She stares right back at him. \nISABELLA (cont'd) On the other hand...if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba...the lead?  Then let's do that.  Accept their deal.  After the load is received...we will close their eyes forever... \nShe looks at Montoya squarely.  It hangs in the air.  In his strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a conclusion... \nMONTOYA Let's try a few runs with these partners, I think.  I will tell Jos\u00e9... \nIf Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it.  Montoya continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in stone.  He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes. \nHe reaches for her hand and brings her to him.  She kisses him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his neck, and she runs her hands down him... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA AIRPORT - A G3 - NIGHT \nlands.  The door opens.  Isabella emerges.  CLOSER...she searches, looking for someone as she descends the ramp. Then... \nCROCKETT \nemerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane. \nISABELLA'S \nexpression changes, but she masks it. \nBusinesslike, she walks across the tarmac.  There are two Suburbans.  One for her; one full of security.  Crockett and her meet.  No show of affection.  Her Secretary, carrying her briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban. \nINT. SECOND SUBURBAN - DOOR - NIGHT \nopens.  Crockett and Isabella climb in.  The rear is customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and a divider.  As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride in the front vehicle.  Doors close.  Windows go up.  Air conditioning comes on.  She raises the divider, blocking the driver and locks the doors.  They are sealed in the back. Alone.  And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's desperate...as if making love to him puts her world back in balance.  Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses... \nCROCKETT Hola, chica. \nISABELLA Hola, viejo. \nHe touches the side of her face. \nISABELLA (CONT'D) Don't stop, bad man... \nAs they continue, we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARRANQUILLA NIGHTCLUB - TUBBS + GINA - NIGHT \nat the bar.  It's jammed.  \"Cochi Loco\" Yero and his permanent bodyguard, El Tiburon, pass, smile.  Tubbs introduces Yero to Gina, as his wife. \nYero shakes Gina's hand.  He indicates to the bartender that Tubbs and Gina are to pay for nothing...and he moves towards an office.  Cobalt blue light illuminates his face, and his fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

(in Spanish) Why? \nJOS\u00c9 YERO (in Spanish) Too good at what they do, I don't know.  Something I don't like. They are wrong... \nMontoya thinks. \nEL TIBURON What? \nJOS\u00c9 YERO (goes on) In the '80's, air routes came into favor.  It required many pilots. The best were American.  Former crop-dusters.  They didn't fly by the book.  Tell one:  \"Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot runway.\"  Somehow, he'd do it. Great pilots.  But Pablo had a rule.  After they flew six loads...this good pilot who facilitates so much good business... he would come back to Medell\u00edn or Barranquilla to pick up the next load? (beat) And no one would ever see him again.  He'd disappear. (imitates Pablo) \"You a good pilot? Make a lot of money for Pablo? Thank you very much.\"  And then Pablo would kill his ass.  After six loads. (pause) And who was Pablo Escobar?  A provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali.  When the gringos got him, he was nobody. We're three times better than Pablo Escobar. (beat) The means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner.

Gina and Tubbs walk away down the beach towards phosphorescent waves. \nISABELLA I forgot the napkins. \nCROCKETT And the chopsticks and fortune cookies? \nISABELLA What's the best fortune you ever got? \nCROCKETT They're all the same.  \"Financial security is around the corner.\" \"Your friends love you.\" \nISABELLA In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, \"Live now because life is dust.\" \nCrockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the ebb tide. \nCROCKETT Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts? \nISABELLA Why? \nCROCKETT ...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance. \nISABELLA Do I need it? \nCROCKETT (shrugs) Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate. \nISABELLA (laughs) 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...? \nThe Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the Fourth of July. \nCROCKETT Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them. (then) So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run... \nISABELLA (smiles) Really? \nCROCKETT Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can. \nISABELLA When? \nCROCKETT Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner. \nWhat is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her? \nISABELLA Would you find me...? \nCROCKETT Of course. \nISABELLA Where would I go? \nCROCKETT Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there... \nISABELLA (smiles) Is this the protective male talk? \nCROCKETT (deadly serious) This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you. \nISABELLA And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...? \nCROCKETT A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you. \nstares at her from the back corner of the double-wide trailer.  With her is an overweight autistic Boy of about 11. He plays in the corner and watches a small TV with a coat hanger for an antenna.  The Old Woman pays Gina no attention On her face is zero affect.  There are other sounds in the room. \nWIDER:  GINA \nand we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor. Her clothes are disheveled and ripped.  She tries to focus. Then somebody's thick arms are fitting something around her neck.  A blindfold goes over her eyes.  Around her neck is a C-4 \"necklace\" like the one we saw on Stevens' wife in the beginning of the film.  The arms and back belong to the deep- chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and Coleman's double-wide.  MOVE IN ON GINA.  He reaches below the frame and does something.  Gina writhes away from him in the chair.  He laughs.  He backs away from her to camera...and holds something in his hand. \nA CAMERA \nHe takes a digital picture. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

The guy working the cell phone is the buzz-cut Aryan Brother we saw in the Stevens kitchen in the opening. Coleman's shirt open in the Barcalounger watching ESPN.  His watch is loaded with ice, and a four-carat diamond in his ear.  He is all white bling.  Coleman's tattooed up.  Not with \"cool\" Celtic symbols...his tats are neo-Nazi, white supremacist, hard-core prison stuff. \nCELL PHONE \nin the hands of the deep-chested Aryan Brother.  Three girls in cutoffs and halters are making sandwiches and laughing in the b.g..  Then: \nARYAN BROTHER El Tiburon. \nColeman takes the satellite phone, attached to a laptop.  He enters a number.  A frequency-response graphic displays in the computer.  His conversation with El Tiburon is encrypted so the voices are distorted... \nCOLEMAN So...? \nEL TIBURON (in Spanish) Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route. \nCOLEMAN (perfect Spanish) All I want to know is the where and the when.

Screaming, Son's ruined wrist, Tubbs took the knife, and as the Aryan Brother swings the bat... \nLOW ANGLE:  TUBBS \nducks the bat.  It dents the faux-wood paneling.  Tubbs slams the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving the AB Brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10-inch butcher knife through his kidney into his right lung...  AND Tubbs' gun in his left hand has never moved off-target of the Aryan brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until right now:  he snaps a ROUND into the wounded Aryan Brother's head.  And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target. \nAND THE FIERCE EYES OF BULKED-OUT BROTHER \nA nihilistic smile dawns there. \nARYAN BROTHER Shoot me, she dies.  Hey, fuck it, man.

Your finger won't be able to twitch.  Do you believe that? \nARYAN BROTHER Fuck... \nBLAM.  That's all he gets out.  Trudy does exactly that. Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree.  Tubbs retrieves the detonator.  Trudy unties Gina.  Carefully, Tubbs pulls the sensitive remote detonator from his hands. \nTUBBS \nputs his coat over Gina.

I do not. (beat) But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word \"foreboding\"? As in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ABANDONED METAL SHED, INDIAN RIVER - WIDE - NIGHT \nNothing.  Rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into weeds next on a channel of the Indian River.  It cuts through inner-city Miami.  Distant noise.  But... \nINT.

A meeting is imminent. \nMEANWHILE: \nINT. FBI OFFICE - RAC JAMES FUJIMA - NIGHT \nEmpty except for the FBI Agent in a sweatsuit carrying files, as if he stopped by when Crockett's call came in.

Flash samples.  Flash cash. \nTUBBS (into phone) Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli? \nFUJIMA White supremacist types. \nCrockett's impatient. \nCROCKETT OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs? \nFUJIMA NLR, we think.  I wanna know... \nTUBBS (sarcastic) Oh, good... \nFUJIMA ...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said. \nCROCKETT He is saying they had him from the gate.  He is saying to my partner and I and to his family \"goodbye.\" What does that tell you? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO \nin the back seat get lucky.

Our two \"Russians\" approach from their Cadillac with a backup Cadillac and one driver on the other side. \nCLOSER:  ARYAN BROTHERS.  Friendly.  Hip-hop culture has invaded White Supremacist gangs.  Buzz cuts.  Goatees.  A couple of diamond earrings. \nRUSSIAN #1 ...sample now is okay.  And we want sample load when we do deal... \nARYAN BROTHER Sure, man. \nRUSSIAN #1 What inventory you can supply...? \nARYAN BROTHER #1 Meth.  Glass, ice, K's, E's, Mitsu's, Ames, Ex...whatever you need.  Coke?  Tonnage.  And Colombian H.  But give us a heads up... \nThe Aryan Brother pops him a couple of vials. \nARYAN BROTHER #1 (cont'd) Ice.  Spectra-analyze that shit. And party-on with the coke.  You are looking at ninety-two percent pure...none of that jumped-on powder they sell up in New Yorioo... \nARYAN BROTHER #2 Yeah... (beat) Now, let's see the green... \nOne of the Russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other opens up a Nike sports bag. \nRUSSIAN Never seen money before?  This is called \"money.\" \nAryan Brother #1 reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks of hundreds.  Flips through a couple, takes one or two at random.  Russian nods for him to go ahead. \nARYAN BROTHER #1 Okay.  You got lotsa green.  We got all the goodies.  We party. Larry'll call you in the AM and talk money, quantity, time and place... \n", "test2_input": "CROCKETT (soft) Let's talk deliveries. \nIsabella is not let down by the switch to commerce.  She merely goes there, too.  After all, this is their subject. Soft smiles. \nCROCKETT (cont'd) ...and a different kind of deal. \nISABELLA Like...? \nCROCKETT Like \"three thousand a ki?\"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers. \nISABELLA And why should continuing excellence cost more? \nCROCKETT Cost less.  That's the point. \nISABELLA Is it December? \nCROCKETT What do you mean? \nISABELLA Did Christmas come early this year...? \nCROCKETT Better than that. (beat) We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  \"And why,\" you're thinking, \"would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?\"  And the answer is, \"of course\" but also \"no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can.\" \nISABELLA Good samba dancing...? \nCROCKETT Zero risk. \nISABELLA 'Cause you don't lose loads? \nCROCKETT 'Cause we guarantee every load.

(beat) That merely to propose this is a dangerous thing? \nCROCKETT Then I would say to you, this has been fun... \nThere's a long pause.  This is business.  This is what is. \nISABELLA The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it. \nCROCKETT I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front... \nISABELLA Available cash is not an issue for us... \nCROCKETT Twenty-eight-point-five. \nISABELLA What if I pushed to twenty-one...? \nCROCKETT I would say you're...

And all we got from you was bad intel.  \"Low-level producer.\"  Yeah, right... \nFUJIMA What are you talking about? \nCROCKETT Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade. \nTUBBS His operations are kingpin size and first-class.  His security is ex- Eastern bloc, ex-SAS and Israelis. Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption, significant Sig Int and in their zones of activity, they have signal- jamming capability... \nFujima is surprised... \nCROCKETT Yeah.

LEVA'S VOICE Okay, never me. But a lot of them. I know some of the Use she played 'around with, don't tell me. 
WARDEN'S VOICE I ain't tellin you. You're tellin me. 
Karen stops, a few paces from camera. 
KAREN Good morning, Sergeant. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
Lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b.g. During the dialogue, Karen seems irritated by Warden, who looks at her coolly, appraisingly, physically. 
KAREN I'm looking for my husband. 
WARDEN Captain Holmes just went in town, ma'am. 
KAREN Oh. Of course, He was to have left some things for me. (STUMBLES SLIGHTLY) That he was to have purchased. Do you know anything about them? 
WARDEN No, ma'am, I don't. Is there anythin I can do for you? 
KAREN. No, thanks, Sergeant. 
She makes slight move to go, pauses. 
KAREN He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately. My husband. He says you're very efficient. 
WARDEN Yes, ma'am. 
KAREN What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant? 
WARDEN I couldn't help it if I was born smart, ma'am. 
Karen laughs suddenly, loudly. 
KAREN I love that. Well, good-bye, Sergeant. 
Karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car. Warden and Leva watch her. When she is out of earshot Leva speaks. 
LEVA But man, she sure is one, ain't she? 
WARDEN One what? 
LEVA One woman. 
WARDEN (UNCONVINCINGLY) I've seen better. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. KAREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying the sensual pleasure of it. Karen is a woman of moods and tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. A car is heard pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. Karen's brush strokes become faster, rougher. The front door is heard opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen." She does not answer. Holmes enters. He seems to have had a few drinks. Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair. 
HOLMES I'm sorry I'm so late. And about dinner, I -- 
KAREN It doesn't matter. 
HOLMES -- I got tied up with General Slater. Bumped into him at the Officers' Club. 
KAREN Yes? What did the General have to say? 
HOLMES Success, he said. Success in war, success in peacetime... And not a word about my promotion... There are times I think the Old Man's just waiting to ship me down... (slumps into chair) I've had a bad day all around... (MORE) HOLMES(CONT'D) started right off this morning... trouble with a new man... 
KAREN If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion. 
HOLDS The Company takes care of itself. Or my Topkick takes care of it. 
KAREN I went over there this morning looking for you. 
HOLMES (FLUSTERED) I had some business to attend to in town. During the afternoon. 
KAREN (UNEMOTIONALLY) From the way you look I gather your business wasn't too successful. 
HOLMES Now what does that mean? 
KAREN Dana. Give me credit for a few brains. 
HOLMES How many, times do I have to tell you I haven't any other women before you'll believe me? 
CLOSE SHOT KAREN SHOOTING INTO MIRROR ON DRESSING TABLE Karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her face. She puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb. 
HOLMES VOICE If it were so, don't you think I'd admit it? The way things are between us now? What right have you to always be accusing me? 
KAREN What right? 
TWO SHOT 
They are both tense now. Holmes is out of the chair and pacing. Karen combs her hair spasmodically. 
HOLMES That again. How long will it be, I wonder, before I'm allowed to live that down? After eight years, how many times do I have to tell you It Was An Accident? 
KAREN That makes it all right, I suppose! 
HOLMES I didn't say that. I know what it's done to you, but -- 
KAREN You know I hate to talk about it!

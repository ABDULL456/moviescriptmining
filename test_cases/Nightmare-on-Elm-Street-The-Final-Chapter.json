She tries to push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls. \nJacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to help her up. \nJACOB You okay? \nGina SCREAMS. \nGINA No!  Yes!  Let go of me! \nShe shakes off his grip and he jumps back.  She runs away with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused Jacob. \nKAREN She doesn't like to be touched. \nJACOB No shit! \nKAREN Don't take it personally.  It's not her fault. \nJACOB What happened to her? \nKAREN Her mother was a hooker.  She forced Gina to carry on the tradition.  When she was thirteen... \nJACOB Jesus. \nJacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern.  Karen gives him the same expression. \nKAREN You look terrible. \nJACOB (smiling) Thanks. \nKAREN I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all. \nJACOB I can't talk about it right now.  I'll tell you later.  I promise. \nKAREN Okay.  Why don't you sit and rest for a bit.  The supervisor's not around.  You look like you could use it. \nJACOB I think I will. \nHe gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and Karen likes it.  Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off for it. \nON SCOTT \nHe's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, and he DOESN'T like it. \nWITH JACOB \nas he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall.  He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building. \nJACOB'S POV - THE BRICK WALL \nsits there quietly for a few beats until: \nIT EXPLODES \nBricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through: \nDREAM FLASHES - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD \nHorrifying apparitions and images ZOOM by us.  Gloomy buildings under a pitch black sky.  MUTANTS and twisted MONSTERS.  Shadowy streets and dark alleyways.  And FIVE RAZOR-BLADE FINGERS suddenly ripping right through the sky and down upon us as a VOICE rings out. \nVOICE Hey, you! \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - ON JACOB \nJacob's eyes are closed as a SUPERVISOR looms above him. \nSUPERVISOR No slacking off.  Back to work. \nThe boy's eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a babbling crazy man. \nJACOB What!  Jesus fucking...Oh, shit! \nSUPERVISOR Whoa!  Get a grip, boy. \nThe supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to reality again. \nJACOB Huh?  What's going on? \nSUPERVISOR Nothing.  That's the problem.  Now that you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see if you can change it, okay? \nJacob calms down and nods.  He walks away, snatching a nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall. \n", "test1_true": "We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of the house go to bed. \nINT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWesley is getting in bed.  Jacob is sitting in a chair staring out the window.  Wes switches off the lights and turns to Jacob. \nWESLEY Aren't you going to bed? \nJACOB I'm not tired. \nWESLEY Bullshit.  If you looked any more tired, you'd be dead. \nJacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness. \nJACOB That's right. \nWESLEY You gotta sleep, man. \nJACOB Why?  Who says?  You know, people don't even really know why we sleep.  They haven't found any physical reason for it. \nWESLEY But they do know that you go nuts if you don't. \nJACOB Sharks don't sleep.  They can't pump water through their gills on their own. They have to always keep moving.  If they stop, they can't breath.  If they go to sleep, they die. \nWESLEY You're not a shark. \nJACOB I know.  I'm just a kid.  Don't worry about me, Wes.  Go to sleep. \nWesley shakes his head and gets under the covers.  Jacob continues to stare out the window, desperately trying to keep his eyes open. \nJACOB'S POV - THROUGH WINDOW \nthe trees sway quietly in the breeze outside.  There is a pause.  Then we are suddenly PULLED THROUGH THE WINDOW, SMASHING glass, careening back into: \nDREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD \nWe SAIL through the gloomy air, over the creepy buildings. And suddenly DIP DOWN, right for the street, and end up CRUISING three inches off the asphalt, really ripping down the road until we grind to a SUDDEN HALT.  Right in front of: \nFREDDY'S FEET.  Our shot TILTS UP.  Freddy looms above us and grins. \nFREDDY You can't stay awake forever, boy! \nHe LAUGHS, his mouth gaping wide, and then splitting open impossibly wider.  Something starts pouring out of his mouth, right at us. \nHundreds of GIANT BUGS spew down upon us, covering us completely as everything goes to BLACK and we: \nINT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nON JACOB \nhis eyes are open, his mouth is hanging in a SILENT SCREAM. It looks like his head is about to explode.  He lifts his hand up to his face.  He's holding an eight-inch long MONSTER BUG. \nJacob SCREAMS out loud this time, tosses the mutant insect away.  It lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening. \nJacob jumps to his feet, sending his chair tumbling backwards with a CRASH.  He shakes and moans, a little drool dripping down his chin. \nWesley sits up with a start and stares at Jacob. \nWESLEY I told you you'd go nuts! \nJacob catches his breath, gives Wes a dead serious look. \nJACOB Get everybody else.  I have to tell them something. \nWESLEY In the middle of the night? \nJACOB I MEAN it! \nWesley is shocked by Jacob's manic state and jumps out of bed. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - NIGHT \nFive kids are gathered around the room in various stages of sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief.  Jacob paces back and forth. \nSCOTT I don't get it.  Is this guy alive or dead? \nJACOB He's neither.  He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real. \nWesley, the most gullible of the group, looks pretty scared. \nWESLEY I haven't dreamed of him. I have nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but never of this guy. \n", "test1_id": 1959, "test2_input": "SWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress. There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath. \nThen a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing her legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts. \nGina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another wall. \nWhere the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her. Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinned. Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the hands with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls away from the horde. \nGina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands try to block her way. \nGina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nGina hits the lift's opposite wall having expected it to be a hallway.  The elevator's doors close on her bedroom and she turns to see: \nFreddy.  A razor finger poised over the elevator's buttons. He smiles politely. \nFREDDY Going up? \nGina is shocked and speechless.  She backs away into a corner like someone trapped in a closet with the devil.  Which is exactly what she is. \nRising past the terror is Gina's realization that everything Jacob's been saying is true. \nFREDDY (cont'd) At your service. \nHe punches one of the buttons and the elevator LURCHES.  Gina grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually begins to WHISTLE nonchalantly. \nGINA You're not real! \nFREDDY Ah, but who is? \nThe elevator begins to slow. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Fourth floor.  Overpopulation. \nThe elevator stops.  The doors begin to open.  Gina leaps for the way out.  But she's blocked. \nBlocked by PEOPLE.  They fill the entrance to the lift and start to pile in.  All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, plumbers.  And they're all ZOMBIES. \nVacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies keep coming in.  Pushing Gina back into the elevator. Filling it to capacity and beyond. \nThe doors close and the elevator starts to move up.  Twenty bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their mouths, breathing down her neck.  SMASHING her so hard she can't even yell for help.  Gina turns her head. \nWESLEY is pressed up next to her.  A very dead look on his face.  Begin squeezed by the zombies around him.  One of his eyes POPS out of its socket. \nGina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Eight floor - the morgue. \nThe elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to spastically pile out.  Gina, having only been held up by the crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the monsters exit the lift.  She breathes in ripping gasps like she's having a coronary.  But she sees the open door.  And Gina jumps for the exit. \nFreddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently.  Gina falls to the floor again as the doors shut.  Freddy waves his fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very bottom one.  This button doesn't looks like the others. \nIt's in the shape of a little heart. \nFreddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Time to go down, Gina. \nHe presses the heart button.  And the floor disappears.  Gina falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and LAUGHS. \nINT. HONEYMOON SUITE \nGaudy colors, mirrors, a cheesy heart-shaped bed.  Gina's body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy satin sheets. \nshe's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink LINGERIE.  She moans and tries to sit up. \nAnd four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her down and yank her tight. \nShe's trapped.  That's when the door to the room opens and in walks an incredibly huge FAT MAN.  He barely fits through the door as he closes it behind him.  Puffy cheeks, permanent seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile. \nGina's eyes widen. \nFAT MAN Hi there, princess.  Your mom's told me all about you. \nGina SCREAMS as he approaches her, the ground actually shaking from his weight. \nFAT MAN (cont'd) She said you're even better than she is. \nHe looms above her, now.  Starts to unbutton his shirt to reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh.  Gina is repulsed. \n", "test2_true": "RIP! Krueger's finger blades JUT out of the abdomen ad start tearing a huge SLIT up the front of his body.  The Fat Man starts to fold back as Freddy's head pops out of the front. \nFREDDY ...is a maniac trying to get out! \nFreddy steps out of the Fat Man, sluffing the bulbous remains aside.  He towers over Gina.  That creepy serious look on his face again. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Now it's time for YOU to put out, Gina. \nGina gasps in horror as Krueger moves in.  But then a KNOCK at the door. \nROOM SERVICE (O.S.) Room service? \nFREDDY Huh?  I didn't order anything... \nFreddy frowns and walks over to the door.  He turns back to Gina. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Maybe its complimentary champagne! \nKrueger opens the door.  On the other side is a dinner cart and a waiter behind it.  The waiter is JACOB. \nCRASH!  Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into Freddy's gut, shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled heap.  Three EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT BURST into the room.  The Dream Police materialize. \nFreddy jumps up growling.  Power Cop grabs him from behind. Blade leaps over to the bed and in a FLASH of steel, releases Gina from her satin bonds.  Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and pulls her towards the door. \nJACOB Come on! \nFreddy jumps out of Power Cop's grip and the Dream Police surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room. \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY \nJacob pulls Gina along as the hotel room door SLAMS shut by itself.  Gina yells at Jacob. \nGINA Let go of me! \nShe squirms out of Jacob's grip and bounces away from him like he has the plague.  CRASHING is heard from the hotel room.  A violent battle is under way.  Jacob pleads with Gina. \nJACOB I'm here to help! \nHe holds out his hand to her.  Gina shivers, than looks into Jacob's sincere eyes.  SOUNDS of destruction continue behind the door as the girl battles with her worst fear.  Finally Gina takes Jacob's hand. \nGINA Let's get out of here. \nThey start running down the corridor - together. \nINT. HONEYMOON SUITE \nThe entire room is filled with SWIRLING DUST and SMOKE, completely obscuring everything from sight.  As the sound of BREAKING FURNITURE and grunting fighters echoes, a few pieces of debris bounce into view. \nAnd then there is SILENCE. \nThe dust settles and the smoke dissipates.  The DREAM POLICE stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room. \nPOWER COP Where'd he go? \nSOUND COP I thought you had him. \nBLADE COP Shit... \nKrueger has escaped. \nHOTEL CORRIDOR \nJacob runs, Gina trailing behind him, the two of them trying to find a way out.  They pass a door. \nThe door SLAMS open and Freddy reaches out, grabs Gina and yanks her into the room.  The door BANGS shut. \nJacob twirls around and runs towards the door. \nAnd the door DISAPPEARS.  Nothing but flat wall remains as Jacob hits it.  He starts banging his fist against the side of the corridor. \nJACOB No no no no! \nThe Dream police run up next to him.  Jacob spins around angry. \nJACOB (cont'd) He's got Gina! \nSOUND COP Stand back. \nEveryone backs off.  Sound Cop opens his mouth.  BOOM!  An almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and CRACK, a huge hole is punched in the wall. \nThe Police leap into the hole, quickly followed by Jacob. \n", "test2_id": 1960, "test3_input": "INT. HOTEL ROOM \nThis one's pretty normal.  Maybe the business suite.  And it's EMPTY except for a heart-shaped box of candy in the middle of the bed.  Jacob and the rest of the Police watch as Blade picks up the box and opens it.  Dozens of COCKROACHES pour out onto the floor.  Now Jacob's really pissed. \nJACOB You let him get away! \nSOUND COP It's difficult. \nPOWER COP He's been at this longer than we have. \nBLADE COP He can do anything. \nSOUND COP But we have to catch him in the act to get him. \nJACOB What...there are rules to all this? \nSOUND COP They're not rules. \nPOWER COP It's just the way it is. \nBLADE COP Jacob, we need you to bring the rest together. \nJACOB The rest?  You mean the kids at the home? \nBLADE COP Yes.  We need as many of you as we can get.  And you must bring them to Springwood. \nJACOB How? \nBLADE COP You have the power to link your dreams with other's.  Dream of Springwood, then bring the rest with you. \nSOUND COP Living souls are what he thrives on. Living souls are what we need to help stop him. \nPOWER COP Before it's too late. \nBLADE COP Before he takes everyone. \nSOUND COP And every THING. \nJacob just shakes his head. \nINT. LIMBO \nAll is BLACK.  Except for Freddy and Gina.  He has her from behind, his hands locked on her shoulders. \nFREDDY Ah...alone at last. \nGina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds away.  Freddy wraps his arms around her, hugging her. \nAnd he KEEPS wrapping his arms.  They STRETCH and elongate, wrapping once around his body and then around her's again. \nAnd then again.  Freddy's rubber limbs curl around and around an around Gina's quivering body.  Spiraling up and down. Encircling on all sides on every part of her, touching and grabbing her EVERYWHERE. \nUntil Krueger's arms cover her entirely.  Gina whimpers. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Touching, isn't it? \nAnd he starts to SQUEEZE.  Gina gags as Freddy's snake-like embrace TIGHTENS around her, draining the life out of Gina's body. \nINT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJacob wakes with a start as the entire house around him shakes. \nJACOB Gina! \nJacob jumps out of bed. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY \nJacob dashes down the corridor.  Karen comes out of her room. \nKAREN Is it an earthquake? \nJACOB No.  It's Freddy. \nThey run to Gina's room and fling the door open. \nINT. GINA'S BEDROOM \nThe RUMBLING of the house has stopped.  Gina's in bed, her tongue sticking grotesquely out from the corner of her mouth, her skin completely blue.  Jacob and Karen run to her to try and help. \nGina's already dead.  But Freddy's not quite done with her yet.  Jacob and Karen watch as Gina's chest CAVES IN.  Karen SCREAMS. \n", "test3_true": "The coroner's back, the neighborhood gawks.  Jacob, Karen and Scott sit on the front steps in a daze. \nBut this time there are police barricades up.  In another part of the front yard we can see Mr. and Mrs. Ross with a social worker, MR. SILVERMAN.  Mary Ross is crying while her husband David is having a heated argument with Silverman. \nThe kids watch on gloomily. \nThe social worker leaves as Mr. Ross walks over to the kids. Mary walks right by them and into the house - to broken up over something to talk. \nDAVID Pack your bags, kids. \nJACOB You're kicking us out? \nDAVID No.  They're taking you away.  They say it's for your own good. \nKAREN They can't do that. \nDAVID Yes, they can.  They consider Mary and I possibly unfit to act as foster parents. They're going to find temporary homes for you until this mess is straightened out. I'm so very sorry. \nKaren runs up to David and hugs him desperately.  He holds her. \nKAREN No, please. \nDAVID They're not calling it an accident this time.  They don't really know what to call it. \nKaren lets go.  Scott stands up. \nSCOTT What's going to happen to us? \nDAVID You'll be alright. \nKAREN What's going to happen to you? \nDAVID I don't know.  They're thinking of pressing charges. \nJACOB Aw, Jesus... \nDAVID Come on.  A car from juvenile hall will be here in an hour. \nHe leads them up the stairs. \nEXT. JUVENILE HALL - DAY \nA sign reads: ROSEDALE YOUTH CENTER. \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nMr. Silverman, the social worker, is talking to the teenagers.  Karen and Scott look understandably worried. Jacob looks like the world just ended for him. \nMR. SILVERMAN I'm sure most of you know how this works already.  You'll be assigned new foster homes tomorrow afternoon.  Tomorrow morning the police will be talking to you regarding the matter at the old house. \nKAREN What about it? \nMR. SILVERMAN Anything you know. \nSCOTT Are we considered suspects? \nMR. SILVERMAN You'll talk to the police about that. Don't worry.  We'll all try and work this out. \nKAREN Will we be able to go back to the Ross's? \nMR. SILVERMAN I don't know.  You'll have a place to stay in the mean time. \nKAREN Will we be together? \nMR. SILVERMAN No.  We don't have anybody willing to take more than one person.  I'm afraid you'll be split up. \nSCOTT Great... \nMR. SILVERMAN Hey, you can visit each other.  You'll be in the same town. \nJACOB If it's still here. \nSilverman frowns at that last comment as the kids get up to leave. \nINT.

{"train": "Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare \nFADE IN: \nINT. DC-10 AIRLINER - NIGHT \nJACOB JOHNSON is sleeping.  It doesn't look like a pleasant experience.  He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead. The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin. \nThe boy's eyes snap open. \nJacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue to drone. \nUntil a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE. \nThe sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else. Jacob frowns. \nThe noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob immediately turns back to him. \nJACOB Do you hear that? \nThe man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets louder. \nGREYHAIRED MAN Hear what? \nJACOB That noise. \nGREYHAIRED MAN I don't hear anything. \nThe man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER - - like it's coming closer.  Jacob squirms in his seat -- sneaks a look at the man again.  How can he not hear that?  A STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention. \nJACOB Excuse me. \nSTEWARDESS Yes? \nThe WHOOSHING is completely obvious now.  The greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him. \nJACOB What is that sound? \nSTEWARDESS That's just the engines, sir. \nJACOB No, it's different.  It's not the engines.  It's getting louder. \nThe man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly. \nSTEWARDESS We're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather.  That's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit. Everything's fine. \nJACOB Um...okay. \nThe stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails.  The whooshing is really starting to BLARE now.  He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists around to look behind.  He snaps back to the greyhaired man. \nJACOB (cont'd) Can't you hear that? \nGREYHAIRED MAN (losing patience) Look, kid.  Will you relax?  It's just the damn engines, okay? \nThe man glares at him, and Jacob backs off.  The sound has grown DEAFENING.  Jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad. He looks at the closed window.  He reaches out his hand, grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see: \nA 747 coming RIGHT AT US. \nJacob SCREAMS.  The planes CRASH. \nImpact - decompression - explosion.  The hull of the cabin buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside. \nA huge wing section RIPS through the structure - barely missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired man's head clean off - nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across and out the other side of the cabin. \nAnd Jacob's seat drops down - sending him and us into: \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \nLike an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his chair, tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face. \nAnd Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking straight up from the blasting wind. \nThat's when CORPSES start falling past him.  The captain of the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand. More men, women, crew people - and CHILDREN. \nBut these children aren't dead bodies.  Two LITTLE GIRLS and one LITTLE BOY, all dressed in white, plummet down next to Jacob, head first, like high divers.  And they're singing: \nTHE CHILDREN One two, Freddy's coming for you... \nThe children turn around in the sky so that they are travelling feet first.  The Little Boy's pants puff up and the Girls' skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their hair... \nTHE CHILDREN (cont'd) Three four, better lock your door... \nJacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, battered and, unfortunately, alive.  He climbs up to the edge of the crater.  He looks back a the remnants of his home. \nThen something starts to happen. \nSomething his growing from the crater - spreading out.  It's not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.  Even though it's night, this darkness is darker.  It creeps out from the hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.  What it covers doesn't disappear.  It becomes GLOOMY.  The shroud is getting bigger. \nAnd it's getting faster.  Jacob runs. \nWITH JACOB - RUNNING \nHe bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic. He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its gloominess covering houses.  Then whole blocks. \nEverything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW. \nAT THE STREET CORNER \nJacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.  He stops and yells at her. \nJACOB Get the hell out of here!  It's coming! \nWOMAN What's coming? \nJacob points down the street.  The shroud is swooping down the road - browning out street lights in its wake.  And the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.  Jacob screams at her. \nJACOB Don't you see it? \nWOMAN See what? \nAnd it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.  The Woman is totally oblivious to the danger.  Jacob shakes his head -- stumbles away. \nThe woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER. She sighs. \nAnd begins to MUTATE.  Her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which she DOESN'T seem to notice. \nShe just shrugs her twisted shoulders. \nWOMAN (cont'd) Kids...watcha gonna do? \nShe hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and two heads. \nBACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING \nLike a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters. \nA VOICE booms out from nowhere. \nFREDDY (O.S.) Jacob!  You're too old to run away from home! \nJacob covers his ears and races out of town. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nJacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.  He rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.  most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom. \nSuddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its source: \nHIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN \nThe town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over almost all of it now.  The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD. POPULATION... \nAnd the numbers after the word \"population\" are changing. They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the \"thousands\" digit disappears, then the \"hundreds\", then \"tens\", then... \nCLINK - the count stops at \"1\".  Springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud.  There is a pause. \nCRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.  It vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the highway. \nBACK ON THE STREET \nJacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.  The tar in front of Jacob becomes molten.  It bubbles and pops. \nJacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt. \nIt's a hat. \nThe hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.  Four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side.  A head is up now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - hiding the face.  The body beneath the head ascends.  The veil of asphalt parts: \nIt's FREDDY KRUEGER.  Jacob SCREAMS. \nFreddy LAUGHS.  He shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of Springwood.  A look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face. \nFREDDY Payback time... \nHe raises his face and looks at the road in front of him.  It goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty fields. \nThis is where Springwood used to be.  A look of anguish crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation. \nJACOB Mom... \nHONK!  SCREECH! \nJacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him.  He rolls off to the side of the road. The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake. \nJacob chokes on the dust.  He slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him.  He takes a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME. \nANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY \nWe can see a pickup truck in the distance. Jacob's HAND ENTERS FRAME, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet dangling from his wrist. \nThe pickup truck starts to slow down. \nEXT. ROSEDALE - DAY \nA sprawling little community with pleasant streets and cheerful houses.  It looks a lot like Springwood, the only real difference being that it actually exists.  It also has a sign: WELCOME TO ROSEDALE.  POPULATION: 8,786 \nA Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of blocks down the road from us.  Jacob steps out of the passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye.  He shuffles into town. \nCLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN \nIt reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE! \nThe sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry expression: MR. HOPKINS \nMR. HOPKINS Clean up your act somewhere else! \nHe walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE \nEXT. ROSEDALE FOSTER HOME - DAY \nIt's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a usually quiet neighborhood.  Today the home is surrounded by about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: NO HALFWAY HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!, DON'T LOWER OUR PROPERTY VALUES!, and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL!  The crowd mumbles amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in protest. \nON JACOB \nWe catch him walking down the sidewalk.  He tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement.  He looks like he hasn't slept in days.  The sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention. \nJacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES.  She is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a faraway look in her eyes. \nJacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie.  She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks: \nJACOB What's going on? \nKAREN Free speech.  The right of assembly. \nJACOB What is this place? \nKAREN It's a home.  A foster home.  For teenagers.  It's where you go when things get bad.  It's the place to figure out what to do next.  It's a home for kids that no one else wants. (beat) It's MY home. \nKaren hasn't looked at Jacob once.  She suddenly seems to steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the house.  Jacob is befuddled. \nJACOB Oh... \nHe stands there and watches. \nIN FRONT OF THE HOUSE \nKaren quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head up, eyes staring forward.  The crowd parts ever so slightly as the irked townsfolk start to heat up.  They have an actual human to vent their anger on now.  Mr. Hopkins lays in on her as she passes him. \nMR. HOPKINS Why can't you find somewhere else to shack up? \nKaren turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt. \nKAREN What have we ever done to you? \nMR. HOPKINS Nothing...YET. \nKaren turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head.  Her groceries tumble onto the grass.  A hand reaches down to help her.  It's Jacob's. \nHe quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins looms above them.  Both angry and embarrassed now. \nMR. HOPKINS (cont'd) Look, we've been here for years.  This is a quiet street.  We'd just like to keep it that way. \nJacob can't take this guy anymore.  He stands up and faces the older man with a scowl. \nJACOB Lighten up, mister. \nJACOB Springwood. \nMARY Springwood?  Where's that? \nJACOB Upstate about a hundred miles. \nDAVID (suspicious) I know this state like the back of my hand.  I've never heard of Springwood. \nThere is an uncomfortable pause.  Then Karen suddenly breaks in. \nKAREN Jacob's a little down on his luck.  I told him he could stay here a few days. \nJacob gives here a surprised look. \nMARY Are your parents in Springwood? \nJACOB My father died before I was born.  My mother, she's dead, too. \nDAVID You have a legal guardian? \nJACOB No. \nDAVID Been in any state or federal program? \nJACOB No. \nKAREN Just for a little while.  So he can get his bearings. \nDAVID Got any ID? \nJacob reaches for his back pocket - it's empty.  He shakes his head \"no\". \nMARY (to David) I think we can help him out, honey.  The budget's tight, but we can't turn down someone in need. \nDavid doesn't acknowledge his wife, he just stares at Jacob sternly.  Karen bites her nails.  Then David sits down and starts to lecture. \nDAVID Okay.  You got three, maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you.  But his isn't going to be a free ride.  We're part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house.  Everybody works - and that includes you.  Are you on drugs? \nJACOB No. \nDAVID Good.  If I catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you, you're outta here.  No arguments.  You got that straight? \nJACOB Yes, sir. \nDAVID Okay.  Dinner in two hours.  Why don't you go meet the rest of the gang. \nKAREN Thanks, David. \nMARY I'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's room. \nDavid gets up.  He gives Jacob a final once-over. \nDAVID And take a shower, for chrissakes. \nDavid leaves the room.  Karen gives Jacob a huge grin. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - DAY \nKaren leads Jacob into the room.  There are two teenagers on the couch: WESLEY is a fifteen-year old, curly hair, kind of small.  GINA is also fifteen, brunette hair, seems pretty happy. \nKAREN Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet. This is Jacob.  Jacob, this is Wesley and Gina. \nJACOB Hi. \nWESLEY Welcome to fun central. \nKAREN He's going to be staying with us for a while. \nGINA Oh yeah?  How'd you get through the blockade? \nAnother kid, SCOTT, pops into the room.  He's sixteen, dark hair, with a tough-guy I could give a shit attitude.  He doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for Karen. \nSCOTT Hey, beautiful.  How's it going? \nKAREN Hi, Scott. \nScott notices Jacob and frowns.  Karen is a little annoyed. \nSCOTT Who's Barney Rubble? \nKAREN This is Jacob Johnson.  He's a new resident.  At least temporarily. \nJacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the junk.  Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping.  She tries to push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls. \nJacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to help her up. \nJACOB You okay? \nGina SCREAMS. \nGINA No!  Yes!  Let go of me! \nShe shakes off his grip and he jumps back.  She runs away with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused Jacob. \nKAREN She doesn't like to be touched. \nJACOB No shit! \nKAREN Don't take it personally.  It's not her fault. \nJACOB What happened to her? \nKAREN Her mother was a hooker.  She forced Gina to carry on the tradition.  When she was thirteen... \nJACOB Jesus. \nJacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern.  Karen gives him the same expression. \nKAREN You look terrible. \nJACOB (smiling) Thanks. \nKAREN I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all. \nJACOB I can't talk about it right now.  I'll tell you later.  I promise. \nKAREN Okay.  Why don't you sit and rest for a bit.  The supervisor's not around.  You look like you could use it. \nJACOB I think I will. \nHe gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and Karen likes it.  Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off for it. \nON SCOTT \nHe's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, and he DOESN'T like it. \nWITH JACOB \nas he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall.  He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building. \nJACOB'S POV - THE BRICK WALL \nsits there quietly for a few beats until: \nIT EXPLODES \nBricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through: \nDREAM FLASHES - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD \nHorrifying apparitions and images ZOOM by us.  Gloomy buildings under a pitch black sky.  MUTANTS and twisted MONSTERS.  Shadowy streets and dark alleyways.  And FIVE RAZOR-BLADE FINGERS suddenly ripping right through the sky and down upon us as a VOICE rings out. \nVOICE Hey, you! \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - ON JACOB \nJacob's eyes are closed as a SUPERVISOR looms above him. \nSUPERVISOR No slacking off.  Back to work. \nThe boy's eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a babbling crazy man. \nJACOB What!  Jesus fucking...Oh, shit! \nSUPERVISOR Whoa!  Get a grip, boy. \nThe supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to reality again. \nJACOB Huh?  What's going on? \nSUPERVISOR Nothing.  That's the problem.  Now that you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see if you can change it, okay? \nJacob calms down and nods.  He walks away, snatching a nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall. \nSOUND COP I think you're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes. \nBLADE COP Guys, guys.  This is getting us nowhere. \nShe takes her helmet completely off, long dark hair tumbling over her shoulders.  It's TARYN, the ex-junkie.  These three, they're the Dream Warriors.  Or at least they used to be. \nJACOB Hello?  May I butt in here and ask some more stupid questions? \nThe three of them stop bickering and turn to Jacob.  Blade walks up to Jacob.  Her two partners assume position behind her. \nBLADE COP We don't know much more than you do. What we do know is that we've been recruited... \nJACOB By who? \nSOUND COP We don't know. \nJACOB Why? \nBLADE COP I think that's obvious. \nPOWER COP The shit's about to hit the fan. \nSOUND COP Krueger's discovered new powers. \nBLADE COP He's ripped a hole between dreams and reality. \nPOWER COP Our own powers have been amplified. \nSOUND COP We only hope it will be enough. \nBLADE COP But we're going to need your help. \nJACOB Me?  What can I do?  Just who are you guys...really? \nBlade puts her helmet back on.  Her face turns grim. \nBLADE COP We were like you.  We fought Freddy Krueger many years ago.  Our souls were released from his grip.  No we're back to try again. \nAll three of them drop their visors down at the same time. \nJACOB I still don't understand what... \nJacob's voice starts to GARBLE. He keeps trying to talk but the words come out twisted and clipped.  He raises a hand to his throat.  The hand is transparent.  Jacob looks at his body as it slowly starts to disappear and now he's completely mute. \nSOUND COP Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore. \nPOWER COP Because we're already dead. \nJacob vanishes completely. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nJacob opens his eyes.  He's in bed, dressed in a white smock. A DOCTOR stands next to him with a clipboard in hand. \nJACOB What's going on? \nDOCTOR Just relax, everything's fine. \nJACOB That's what you say... \nDOCTOR You're lucky you're here instead of juvenile hall.  You put up quite a fight. But you're clean.  No traces of drugs or alcohol in your blood. \nJACOB I could've told you that. \nJacob starts getting out of bed. \nDOCTOR Hold on there. \nJACOB You said I was fine.  I have to get back. My friends are in trouble. \nDOCTOR I said you weren't on drugs, but I never said you were fine.  You're suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack.  At least that's what we hope it is.  You had a major seizure, Jacob. \nJACOB You don't understand.  This whole town is in danger. \nDOCTOR We're keeping you here for observation. You're not going anywhere tonight. \nJACOB You can't do that.  You don't have the right! \nDOCTOR Yes we do.  Your temporary guardian, Mr. Ross, signed all the papers.  If you're okay in the morning we might let you go home.  Until then, you're bed bound. \nJACOB But... \nWESLEY (cont'd) Hey. \nHe struggles harder now, but to no avail.  He's wrapped tight, like a cigarette. \nON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes.  As the lunatic SCREAMS, the screams become magnified, again becoming that loud, deafening ROAR we heard before.  Wesley squirms in his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, SEEING with each of the man's SCREAMS, the walls of the room SHUDDER INWARD and \nWesley's EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him.  He SPINS back to the TV set, where: \nThe first orderly is now looking AT US.  Wesley REACTS as he notices something familiar about the man's face. \nFIRST ORDERLY Relax, Wesley. \nWESLEY Dad? \nThe second orderly BOLTS into view.  He has become Freddy Krueger. \nFREDDY Yeah, Wesley.  Everything's gonna be great!  Just have a smoke on us! \nAs they hold their smokes out TOWARD US, their arms PROTRUDE FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes. \nWesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS the floor with an ugly THUMP.  The wind knocked out of him. He rolls.  The couch is GONE. \nAs he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM. \nThen we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, cylindrical white objects.  Clearly, they resemble GIANT CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them. \nHe continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can do is SCREAM one last time, and \nThe screen goes BLACK. \nAfter a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as  Wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY looms over him, grinning, and we: \nINT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM \nThe room is back to normal, but not the occupant.  Freddy Krueger now stands here alone.  He has just peeled the wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which Wesley has become one. \nFREDDY Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the Surgeon General says...? \nKrueger reaches in and pulls the tiny Wesley out of the pack. As before, Wesley is immobile, helpless.  Freddy holds him between two fingers. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Smoking's bad for your health! \nFreddy looks around, as if searching for something, then beams as he reaches into the air and... \nFREDDY (cont'd) Ah!  A match made in heaven! \nHe produces a puny version of WESLEY'S FATHER In one hand. His body is straight and rigid, like a match stick. \nFreddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to BURST INTO FLAME, an evil grin spanning Wesley's Father's face. \nHe brings the Father-Match to what would be Wesley's tiny feet, and lights the end. \nVERY CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HAND \nWesley SCREAMS as Freddy tosses the FATHER-MATCH and brings the teenager's little head up to his fire-scarred lips. \nThe boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as Freddy takes a huge drag off of Wesley's head. Where his feet should be, the tip of the Wesley-Cig GLOWS RED, causing Wesley to SCREAM with supernatural pain.  Smoke billows from Freddy's nose and mouth.  He savors it. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Ahhhh!  Now we're smokin'! \nHe CACKLES horribly as he continues to suck on the Wesley- Cig.  With each puff, Wesley's white-wrapped body becomes slat-black ash. \nFREDDY (cont'd) What's your sign, Wesley?  It wouldn't be Cancer, would it? \nIn between his demonic CACKLES, Freddy DRAGS on the Wesley- Cig, each puff turning more of Wesley into ash until all but his head is black and charred.  Freddy holds the Wesley-Cig out, poised to tap the ashes loose. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Now say the secret word and you know what you'll win... \nWESLEY Go to hell! \nFreddy grins. \nFREDDY Right... \nAnd he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger.  The ashes immediately fall, sifting in the air as Wesley's head - charred and black at the neck where it's been separated - falls loose.  Wesley SCREAMS. \nWESLEY Noooooooo! \nand his severed head falls and falls and falls. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - THE NEXT DAY \nINT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJacob closes the door.  All the kids are here.  Gina absentmindedly plays with some of Wesley's things. \nJACOB When I was put under, Freddy was released.  I know this because I dreamed it. \nSCOTT And that dream was real? \nJACOB Yes.  Wesley was his first victim. \nSCOTT Aw, man... \nJACOB You said it yourself.  How could it have been a cigarette? \nKAREN And how could he...dire that way and not wake up? \nGINA (mockingly) Maybe the \"authorities\" will figure it out. \nSCOTT I'm sorry.  I just can't buy into this. \nJACOB Call me crazy...but I think he's after Rosedale.  The whole place.  In my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done. I think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town. \nSCOTT You are crazy. \nJACOB Thank you.  There's more.  There are... other people in there.  In the nightmares. \nKAREN Like him? \nJACOB No. Different.  There are three of them. They're dressed in black. They have powers like Freddy, but they seem to be on our side. \nKAREN Who are they? \nJACOB Well, you gotta hang in there with me on this one.  They call themselves... the Dream Police. \nScott actually laughs. \nSCOTT This is too much. \nGINA You mean...like cops? \nJACOB I guess. \nKAREN Where are they from? \nJACOB They're kids that Freddy killed years ago.  THEY don't even know how they got there.  But they're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger. \nSCOTT Then why haven't these guys done the job already? \nJACOB They say they need help.  I don't know what or why...yet. \nSCOTT I can tell you who needs help. \nJACOB Hey, I'm trying to save all of us. \nSCOTT I won't believe it until I see it. \nJacob is crushed that he's not getting through to them. \nJACOB By then it'll be too late.  It was too late for Wesley. \nThe kids stare emptily at Wesley's earthly possessions. \nEXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nJacob and Karen sit on the steps.  Across the street we can see window curtains part as Mr. Hopkins sneaks a wary peek. \nKAREN They're going to use all this to shut us down. \nJACOB I know.  It's my fault. \nKAREN You going to try to run away again? \nJACOB It's too late for that. I have to stay and try and put a stop to it. \nKAREN I'm sorry.  It's all so hard to accept. \nJACOB I wish I could convince you of the danger you and the others are in. \nKAREN I've been in danger before. THAT I can handle. \nJACOB This is worse than anything you can imagine. \nShe ducks behind a tree.  And comes out suddenly dressed as a sharp BUSINESSWOMAN.  Jacob is slightly taken aback. \nKAREN (cont'd) I like to be other people! \nJacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN walks out in her place.  Jacob is really taken aback this time. \nKAREN (cont'd) (as fireman) I can be anybody I want. \nJACOB Show off. \nKaren slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD. \nKAREN (AS REDHEAD) When things get bad it helps to be someone else.  I use it to protect myself. \nThe redhead walks seductively towards Jacob.  He raises his eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample cleavage inches away from his nose. \nKAREN (cont'd) (as redhead) What do you think? \nJACOB I think I like you the way you always are. \nHe smiles. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE \nAnd now Karen is herself again.  They're still very close. \nJACOB (cont'd) Much better. \nThey look like they're about to kiss... but Karen suddenly sees something that grabs her attention. \nKAREN Look! \nJacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR.  It's not the one to the bedroom.  It just hangs there in space between two trees. \nKAREN (cont'd) I wonder where it goes? \nShe reaches for the knob and opens it. \nJACOB Karen, no! \nBut she's already stepped through.  Jacob runs up to the doorway and it SLAMS in his face.  Jacob tries to open the door.  It doesn't budge.  He keeps twisting the knob to no effect. \nJACOB (cont'd) Karen! \nJacob starts to pound on the door as we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAREN'S HOME - KITCHEN \nSixties style decore, appliances that look about twenty-five years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all.  Karen is standing in the middle of the room, completely disoriented. She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed picture. \nIt's a picture of HER, Karen, age thirteen.  Karen sets the picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in. \nINT. KAREN'S HOME - LOWER HALLWAY \nKaren steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be back in the forest again.  Nope.  She blinks.  Then she starts to walk down the corridor. \nMore pictures on the wall this time.  One of a WOMAN and another of a MAN (Karen's MOM and DAD). \nKaren's sure of it now.  She's home.  The center of her worst nightmares.  She creeps along to the main stairs.  And that's when the NOISES begin.  A thumping from upstairs.  A CRASH, like something hit the floor above.  More thumping, repeatedly and then human MOANING, the sound of pain. \nSomebody is getting beaten. \nKAREN Oh no... \nSomething is twisting deep inside the girl.  Her face goes shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the stairs...and starts to climb them. \nON THE STAIRS \nKaren goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the BEATING increase in their intensity.  Every hit seems to touch Karen as she flinches.  She's afraid to go on - but can't seem to stop. \nINT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \nKaren slowly heads for a door at the end, nervously reaches out for the knob. \nINT. KAREN'S PARENT'S BEDROOM \nKaren opens the door.  What she thought she was going to see was bad enough - but this is worse: \nFreddy Krueger is in the middle of the room.  In front of him is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back.  But the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it. \nKaren is confused.  She doesn't know what to make of all this.  She looks at a clock.  It's late. \nKAREN You better get back to your room.  We don't want anybody to get the wrong idea. \nJACOB (smirks) Or the right one? \nKaren finally relaxes.  She smiles and playfully pushes him. \nKAREN Get out of here. \nJacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out.  It's the framed photo of Karen, age thirteen - from her dream.  He hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment. \nJACOB That's something else my mom taught me. \nHe gets up and goes to the door, turning back to her. \nJACOB (cont'd) Don't sleep. \nKAREN No.  Not tonight. \nShe holds the picture tightly- staring at it with those faraway eyes. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT \nScott comes out of the bathroom in his night clothes, the toilet flushing in the B.G.  He goes into his room, but stops at the doorway when he hears Karen's door open. \nScott ducks behind his door as he watches Jacob leave Karen's room and head for his own.  Scott frowns.  His is not pleased. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \nDavid Ross is sifting through some mail when a heated conversation in the kitchen catches his interest.  He stops to listen. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nKaren is finally convinced, Jacob and Scott are looking like they're ready to punch each other, and Gina looks scared. \nKAREN I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for real. \nSCOTT And I'm telling you a dream is a dream. \nKAREN Jacob was in there with me. \nSCOTT And where else was he with you last night? \nJACOB What the hell is that supposed to mean? \nKAREN I have the picture in my room if you want to see it.  He brought it out from the nightmare. \nSCOTT Or from your hope chest.  I bet your bed isn't the only thing he's been into. \nKAREN That picture was destroyed years ago. \nJACOB You better watch your mouth, pal. \nSCOTT I'm the last person you want to start fucking with. \nJACOB Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott. Krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle. \nGINA Will you two stop it!  You're scaring the shit out of me. \nKAREN You should be scared. \nMr. Ross enters the room, none too pleased. \nDAVID Alright.  What's going on here? \nSCOTT Join the fun.  Jacob and Karen were just telling us about their new excuse to sleep together. \nJACOB Nothing happened between us last night. \nSCOTT You mean in plain old reality, right? \nDAVID Okay, everybody.  Out.  Jacob and I are going to have a little talk.  Now. \nScott, Gina and Karen grudgingly leave the room.  David turns to Jacob. \nDAVID (cont'd) Your days are numbered here, buster. \nJACOB I'm sorry, but... \nDAVID Hey, I don't know what kind of shit you're shoveling to these kids, but it's going to stop.  My Good Samaritan instincts have their limits.  We've had enough tragedy around this place.  We don't need you making things worse with fantasies. \nSWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress. There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath. \nThen a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing her legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts. \nGina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another wall. \nWhere the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her. Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinned. Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the hands with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls away from the horde. \nGina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands try to block her way. \nGina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nGina hits the lift's opposite wall having expected it to be a hallway.  The elevator's doors close on her bedroom and she turns to see: \nFreddy.  A razor finger poised over the elevator's buttons. He smiles politely. \nFREDDY Going up? \nGina is shocked and speechless.  She backs away into a corner like someone trapped in a closet with the devil.  Which is exactly what she is. \nRising past the terror is Gina's realization that everything Jacob's been saying is true. \nFREDDY (cont'd) At your service. \nHe punches one of the buttons and the elevator LURCHES.  Gina grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually begins to WHISTLE nonchalantly. \nGINA You're not real! \nFREDDY Ah, but who is? \nThe elevator begins to slow. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Fourth floor.  Overpopulation. \nThe elevator stops.  The doors begin to open.  Gina leaps for the way out.  But she's blocked. \nBlocked by PEOPLE.  They fill the entrance to the lift and start to pile in.  All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, plumbers.  And they're all ZOMBIES. \nVacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies keep coming in.  Pushing Gina back into the elevator. Filling it to capacity and beyond. \nThe doors close and the elevator starts to move up.  Twenty bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their mouths, breathing down her neck.  SMASHING her so hard she can't even yell for help.  Gina turns her head. \nWESLEY is pressed up next to her.  A very dead look on his face.  Begin squeezed by the zombies around him.  One of his eyes POPS out of its socket. \nGina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Eight floor - the morgue. \nThe elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to spastically pile out.  Gina, having only been held up by the crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the monsters exit the lift.  She breathes in ripping gasps like she's having a coronary.  But she sees the open door.  And Gina jumps for the exit. \nFreddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently.  Gina falls to the floor again as the doors shut.  Freddy waves his fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very bottom one.  This button doesn't looks like the others. \nIt's in the shape of a little heart. \nFreddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Time to go down, Gina. \nHe presses the heart button.  And the floor disappears.  Gina falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and LAUGHS. \nINT. HONEYMOON SUITE \nGaudy colors, mirrors, a cheesy heart-shaped bed.  Gina's body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy satin sheets. \nshe's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink LINGERIE.  She moans and tries to sit up. \nAnd four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her down and yank her tight. \nShe's trapped.  That's when the door to the room opens and in walks an incredibly huge FAT MAN.  He barely fits through the door as he closes it behind him.  Puffy cheeks, permanent seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile. \nGina's eyes widen. \nFAT MAN Hi there, princess.  Your mom's told me all about you. \nGina SCREAMS as he approaches her, the ground actually shaking from his weight. \nFAT MAN (cont'd) She said you're even better than she is. \nHe looms above her, now.  Starts to unbutton his shirt to reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh.  Gina is repulsed. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nThis one's pretty normal.  Maybe the business suite.  And it's EMPTY except for a heart-shaped box of candy in the middle of the bed.  Jacob and the rest of the Police watch as Blade picks up the box and opens it.  Dozens of COCKROACHES pour out onto the floor.  Now Jacob's really pissed. \nJACOB You let him get away! \nSOUND COP It's difficult. \nPOWER COP He's been at this longer than we have. \nBLADE COP He can do anything. \nSOUND COP But we have to catch him in the act to get him. \nJACOB What...there are rules to all this? \nSOUND COP They're not rules. \nPOWER COP It's just the way it is. \nBLADE COP Jacob, we need you to bring the rest together. \nJACOB The rest?  You mean the kids at the home? \nBLADE COP Yes.  We need as many of you as we can get.  And you must bring them to Springwood. \nJACOB How? \nBLADE COP You have the power to link your dreams with other's.  Dream of Springwood, then bring the rest with you. \nSOUND COP Living souls are what he thrives on. Living souls are what we need to help stop him. \nPOWER COP Before it's too late. \nBLADE COP Before he takes everyone. \nSOUND COP And every THING. \nJacob just shakes his head. \nINT. LIMBO \nAll is BLACK.  Except for Freddy and Gina.  He has her from behind, his hands locked on her shoulders. \nFREDDY Ah...alone at last. \nGina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds away.  Freddy wraps his arms around her, hugging her. \nAnd he KEEPS wrapping his arms.  They STRETCH and elongate, wrapping once around his body and then around her's again. \nAnd then again.  Freddy's rubber limbs curl around and around an around Gina's quivering body.  Spiraling up and down. Encircling on all sides on every part of her, touching and grabbing her EVERYWHERE. \nUntil Krueger's arms cover her entirely.  Gina whimpers. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Touching, isn't it? \nAnd he starts to SQUEEZE.  Gina gags as Freddy's snake-like embrace TIGHTENS around her, draining the life out of Gina's body. \nINT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJacob wakes with a start as the entire house around him shakes. \nJACOB Gina! \nJacob jumps out of bed. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY \nJacob dashes down the corridor.  Karen comes out of her room. \nKAREN Is it an earthquake? \nJACOB No.  It's Freddy. \nThey run to Gina's room and fling the door open. \nINT. GINA'S BEDROOM \nThe RUMBLING of the house has stopped.  Gina's in bed, her tongue sticking grotesquely out from the corner of her mouth, her skin completely blue.  Jacob and Karen run to her to try and help. \nGina's already dead.  But Freddy's not quite done with her yet.  Jacob and Karen watch as Gina's chest CAVES IN.  Karen SCREAMS. \nKAREN What do you mean, nothing? \nJACOB It's over.  We're finished.  He's won. \nJacob walks on ahead of them.  Karen is flabbergasted.  She stops and just stands there with Scott.  The two of them watching Jacob walk away. \nSCOTT Looks like your hero just gave up. \nAnd Karen still can't believe it. \nEXT. JUVENILE HALL COURTYARD - DUSK \nJacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and hating himself for it. \nKaren and Scott step out of a door.  They watch him for a few seconds.  Then Karen walks towards Jacob.  Scott stays behind and lights up a cigarette. \nKAREN How can you do this? \nJACOB Do what?  I'm not doing anything. \nKAREN Exactly.  After all we've been through you just throw in the towel.  Why? \nJACOB Because we're fucked.  The last thing the Dream Police told me was that they needed all our help.  Together.  Even if we weren't about to be split up there aren't enough of us left to make a difference. \nKAREN How do you know that? \nJACOB I don't.  But, it's all just too much. I've tried so hard and nothing's worked. I'm spent.  I'm wasted.  I'm...I'm so tired. \nJacob puts his face in his hands. \nJACOB (cont'd) I've had enough. \nKAREN So you're just going to give up?  I'll bet that's something your mother never taught you. \nThat hit home.  Jacob uncovers his face.  His ID bracelet dangles from his wrist.  He looks at the bracelet.  ALICE glints in the setting sunlight.  He remembers.  Jacob looks up at Karen. \nKAREN (cont'd) We still have one night together. \nJACOB And we're not going to waste it. \nJacob stands up. \nINT. JUVENILE HALL LOUNGE - NIGHT \nJacob paces back and forth in front of Scott and Karen. \nKAREN Scott, we need you. \nSCOTT Look, I don't know what's going on anymore.  Two of my friends die and now you tell me I have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it. \nJACOB We'll have help. \nSCOTT Ah, yes.  I almost forgot.  The Sleepy Squad.  Alright.  I'll make you a deal. I told you I wouldn't believe this stuff unless I saw it.  If I understand this correctly, all I have to do is fall asleep and you just whisk me into the action. \nJACOB Right. \nSCOTT Okay.  If that happens, if both of you show up in my dream, I'll help you out. If nothing happens, then I'll get a good night's sleep and laugh at you in the morning. \nJACOB Fine.  You got a deal.  And you won't be disappointed. \nKAREN I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm.  Will you be able to bring me in? \nJACOB I hope so.  Then I got to make sure we all end up in Springwood. \nSCOTT The old stomping ground? \nJACOB Yeah.  Only right now it's not a very pretty place. \nKAREN What do we do when we get there? \nJACOB Play it by ear.  And try and stay alive. \nA SOCIAL WORKER sticks his head into the lounge. \nSOCIAL WORKER Half hour til lights out, everyone. \nThe kids get up and start for the door. \nJACOB Off we go. \nSCOTT Into the wild black yonder. \nSCOTT Um, a beer, I guess. \nThe bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown liquid.  Chunks of matter float amongst the foam.  Scott takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next to him.  The mutant smiles at him. \nBARTENDER Go on.  Puts hair on your back. \nSCOTT And that's all? \nThe bartender returns.  Holds one of those half pineapple type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny umbrella.  He gives it to Scott. \nSCOTT (cont'd) That's okay, this'll be plenty. \nBARTENDER No charge.  Compliments of the man at the end of the bar. \nThe bartender walks away and Scott cranes his head to look down the bar. \nSCOTT'S POV \nThe crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the surface of the wood. \nBACK TO SCOTT \nHe picks up his drinks, holding the moving one at arm's length, and heads down the bar. \nAT THE END OF THE BAR \nsits Freddy Krueger.  He sips coolly on some hideous concoction as Scott sits down in the chair next to him and lights a cigarette, trying to look equally cool. \nFREDDY Welcome to my favorite haunt. \nSCOTT So you're the man. \nFREDDY At your service. \nSCOTT What's on your mind? \nFREDDY A deal. \nSCOTT A deal's what got me into this. \nFREDDY Bring Jacob to me. \nScott, valiantly holding on to his nerve, raises an eyebrow. \nSCOTT What's in it for me? \nFREDDY Power.  You don't need to hang out with those losers. You're a take-charge kind of guy, Scott.  Like when you took charge of your father. \nSuddenly Freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free hand.  Scott grimaces. \nSCOTT Leave my father out of this. \nFREDDY I'll make you mayor of Rosedale. \nSCOTT After you make it look like this? \nFREDDY You can have Karen. \nThat was Freddy's trump card.  It really hits a nerve in Scott.  Karen's everything he's ever wanted. \nSCOTT Alive? \nFREDDY Any way you want her. \nSCOTT (after a beat) Okay. \nFREDDY Shake? \nKrueger holds out his knives.  Scott shakes his head. \nSCOTT No thanks.  I trust you. \nFreddy laughs. \nINT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ALICE'S BEDROOM \nJacob opens the door into darkness. \nJACOB Mother? \nHe turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room. Jacob looks up.  The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with blood. \nCRUNCH!  Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious elbow in the chest.  All this gave Freddy a few seconds to grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cop's head. The pummeling begins again. \nTHWACK THWACK THWACK!  Power Cop is punching Freddy towards the door. \nEXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN \nLike in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors and somersaults onto the pavement.  Sound Cop is a few yards away knelt down next to Scott's dead body.  He looks up as Freddy sneers. \nFREDDY No more playing around. \nFreddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND.  It grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look soft at all.  Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance, and raises his giant hammer hand.  Power Cop steps through, looking for blood.  Sound Cop tries to warn him. \nSOUND COP Kincaid! \nToo late.  BAM!  Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's head.  He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two feet - trapped at the legs. \nBAM!  Freddy hits him again.  Power Cop is down to his thighs and he can't get out. \nA RUMBLING is heard.  Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting to open his mouth.  Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop. \nFREDDY Put a lid on it! \nTHUNK!  The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, stretching it painfully and blocking it completely.  Sound Cop reels from the impact.  Tries to pull out the firmly wedged plug. \nFreddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM!  Hits him down to his hips.  The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground. \nFreddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the struggling Sound Cop. \nSound Cop's head is EXPANDING.  Pressure seems to be building up, something's gonna blow.  Freddy picks up a boulder from the street rubble.  He catapults it with both hands at Sound Cop.  The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it CLEAN OFF. \nSound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of his neck with a SCREECH. \nSound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over limply. \nFreddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs... KACHUNK! until a KNIFE embeds itself in his back.  Krueger spins around. \nCHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Three more knives slam into his body as he staggers back in surprise.  Blade Cop stands twenty feet away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after knife, flinging them at Freddy.  They sail like flying bullets. \nCHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Krueger falls back from the sheer force of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his body. \nBlade stops. She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what Freddy will do next. \nKrueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion.  Then he grins.  His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body builder and flexes every muscle. \nPOP POP POP!  The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs, CLATTERING to the ground. \nThe girl in black steps back and raises her arms.  SHINK SHINK!  Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms. They're not held by her, they're a PART of her, exiting from the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists.  She crosses the blades in front of her. \nFREDDY (cont'd) (smiling) Ah... a girl after my own heart. \nKACHINK! Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND to double their normal size.  He raises them and takes on a fencing stance. \nFREDDY (cont'd) En guard, bitch \nSWOOP/CLANG!  A swordfight ensues.  Freddy swinging his four long knives.  Blade slashing her rapier-arms.  They lunge, they parry, they leap, they duck. \nCLANG!  They connect.  SCREEEEE.  Metal scrapes metal.  It's a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop and Freddy are equally matched.  Blade moves to get the upper hand. \nCLINK CLINK!  Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.  Now when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right behind it on the follow-through. \nFreddy gets caught off-guard.  Gets slashed twice in the shoulder and twirls away.  Then starts to move FASTER. \nBlade counters with an equally increased intensity.  Freddy ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.  A fold of black cloth drops down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little blood.  They pause for a second. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Touche. \nAnd Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame, twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand. \nKrueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out of the stump. \nAstonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, swinging away at an incredible rate.  An impossible rate. \nJACOB rounds the corner.  He stumbles into the action just as the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING MASS.  Pieces of them start to drop away. \nBlade's foot hits the ground.  Freddy's arm plops away.  A broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then one of Blade's arms. \nCLOSE ON JACOB \nas he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action that's moving too fast for him to see. \nThen there's silence. \nKaren frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined expression on her face. \nKAREN No more... \nShe KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house. \nINT. ELM STREET HOUSE \nWe've been here before, haven't we?  But for Karen it's the first visit as she opens the front door and walks in.  She takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and then begins to SEARCH it. \nINT. ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM \nKaren races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling through shelves, flipping through books.  She doesn't know what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it yet. \nINT. ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN \nThe intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open cabinets and tosses plates to the floor.  Still nothing. \nINT. ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS \nKaren runs up them, a girl with a mission. \nINT. ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM \nKaren flings the door open.  Nothing but a bed and a set of drawers.  No hint as to the occupant's lives.  She doesn't bother ransacking this one and goes on to: \nINT. ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDY'S BEDROOM \nJackpot.  Karen stares through the open door at a child's room, a very twisted child's room.  She slowly walks in. \nA bed, a desk, a dresser.  There's a Jack-in-a-box with its head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes. \nAnd a pile of more-than-dirty clothes. \nKaren goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater. \nKaren goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!! \nAnother piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY. The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure. \nThere are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one. \nSuddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf. She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a CRASH. \nFOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs. \nSomeone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the hallway.  Karen raises the bat. \nAnd Jacob appears.  Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob jumps away from her. \nKAREN Jacob!  You scared the shit out of me! \nJACOB The feeling is mutual. \nKAREN Where are the Dream Police? \nJACOB I told them to look for you.  What are you doing here?  Don't you know what this place is? \nKAREN I do now.  Look what I found. \nShe starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings. \nJACOB You've got to get out of here. \nKAREN Wait.  You have to see this. \nJACOB You don't understand.  The Police can't kill Freddy.  They literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive! Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him. \nKAREN But I think I found the answer.  Shut up for a second and look at these. \nShe starts showing him the scrawlings. \nJACOB Okay, so he's a bad artist. \nKAREN No!  You told me Krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right? \nJACOB Yeah... \nKAREN Freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts.  These are HIS past. Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, too! \nShe walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of LITTLE FREDDY and FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER. \nKAREN You're NOT my father. \nKAREN'S FATHER But we're going to have the same fun! \nKaren stares at him defiantly.  And a HAND grabs Karen's Father, and yanks him away.  We PULL BACK. \nKAREN'S MOTHER is next to the bed.  Furious. \nKAREN'S MOTHER That's enough! \nAnd she SLAPS Karen's Father.  He stands up, SLUGS her across the jaw.  She tumbles back.  Karen sits up. \nKAREN Mommy, no! \nKaren's Mother gets up, a defiant look just like Karen's on her face. \nKAREN'S MOTHER You're never going to touch her again! \nKAREN'S FATHER I'll touch what I want! \nBAP!  He strikes her again, sending her right out the door. He follows her. Karen stands up and runs after them. \nIN THE HALLWAY \nCRACK!  The man hits the woman down to the floor.  Karen's mother stands up, just taking it.  She's at the top of the stairs.  Karen's Father swings his arm back, and Karen jumps on him.  He shrugs her away violently. \nWITH KAREN \nas she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body. She looks up. \nWIDER \nAnd Karen's Father is now FREDDY again.  He swings his fist. SMACK! \nKaren's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards.  Karen jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy.  But it's too late. \nKaren's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones cracking, disappearing into darkness. \nFreddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her.  DANGLES her over the top of the steps. \nFREDDY Be honored, bitch.  You're the last soul I need. \nAnd Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger.  GRABS him.  Freddy DROPS Karen.  She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy turns, his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacob's gut one more time, IMPALING him against the wall.  Jacob gasps out his final breath. \nJACOB I'll be back... \nFREDDY I'll be waiting. \nFreddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall.  The boy's body hits the floor for the last time.  Freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Where's my little pumpkin? \nHe strolls down the steps. \nDOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY \nFreddy walks down and no one's there.  Karen's Mom was just an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to be seen. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Play time is over, bitch. \nHe walks down the hallway.  Eyes darting.  Until a BOOMING VOICE is heard from the kitchen. \nVOICE FREDERICK! \nFreddy cocks his head and frowns. \nVOICE (cont'd) Frederick!  What have you done? \nAnd, amazingly, a look of FEAR crosses Krueger's face. Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody. \nKrueger turns to the kitchen door.  A man steps out of the shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes.  A man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture. \nIt's FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER - MR. UNDERWOOD.  And he looks pissed beyond belief. \nFreddy shrinks back, eyes widening. \nFREDDY Daddy? \nMR. UNDERWOOD Don't you \"Daddy\" me! \nMr. Underwood raises his arm and SMACKS Freddy across the skull.  Krueger tumbles back into the hallway. \n", "test1_input": "SCOTT That's because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter!  I don't know why we have to listen to this crap.  You're scaring the hell out of Wes here. \nGINA Keep your voice down. \nSCOTT It doesn't matter.  The Ross's sleep like rocks, which is what we all should be doing. \nJACOB I know this sounds crazy, but I swear it's true.  I went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road. Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all, I think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world. \nKAREN How? \nJACOB I'm not sure.  I think I'm some kind of carrier.  He's somehow inside me and as soon as I fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose.  You guys were great to take me in.  I just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed. \nScott gets up and goes to a desk.  He pulls out a map and shows it to Jacob. \nSCOTT Okay.  Show me Springwood. \nJacob looks at the map and points. \nSCOTT (cont'd) There's nothing there. \nJACOB That's what I've been trying to tell you. \nSCOTT There's NEVER been a town there. \nJACOB That's how YOU see it.  I was part of the nightmare, so I'm the only one who notices the difference. \nScott stares at Jacob.  He actually grows sympathetic. \nSCOTT Look, Jacob.  You don't have to convince us that nightmares are real.  Everybody in this room has been through one.  And some of us are still living it.  But the thing is, we know it's just in our heads now.  It can be just as bad as the real thing was, but it's still only a memory. It can't hurt us physically, unless we do the hurting ourselves. \nGINA And we don't want to see you get hurt. \nWESLEY We know it gets crazy.  And we'll help out the best we can. \nSCOTT But this is just too hard to believe. \nJacob plops down on the couch, defeated.  He hangs his head while the kids start to get up.  Wesley gives him a pat on the back as he, Scott, and Gina leave.  But Karen is still here. \nShe sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes. Jacob looks up at her. \nJACOB You don't believe me, either, do you? \nKAREN I don't know. \nJACOB Why are you still here? \nKAREN I'm not sure.  I guess, I guess I see a lot of me in you. \nJACOB Feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself, huh? \nKaren smiles and sits down next to him. \nKAREN Yeah.  That must be it. \nJACOB But you haven't told me why you're here at this place. \nKAREN I can't talk about it right now.  Maybe later.  Do you want me to stay with you? \nJACOB Yeah, that'd be great.  Don't let me sleep, okay? \nKAREN I'll do my best. \nShe reaches for the remote control and flicks on the TV, moving a little closer to Jacob when she sits back into the couch.  The two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes. \nKAREN (cont'd) Thank God for cable TV. \nJACOB Yeah.  Thank God. \nThey continue to watch in silence as Karen takes hold of Jacob's hand. \nINT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - MORNING \nWe are ON KAREN as she sleeps curled up on the couch.  Jacob is in the background putting on his shoes.  He has a brown paper bag with him. \nJacob gets up, grabs his bag, and steps over to Karen.  He gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face.  Then he heads for the front door. \nEXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY \nJacob walks out the door and closes it behind him.  He crosses to the porch steps and stops.  He has to hold onto a porch column just to keep standing. \nKaren appears behind him.  Jacob jumps a bit. \n", "test1_true": "JACOB I'm leaving. \nKAREN Why? \nJACOB He can't hurt you if I'm gone.  Maybe I'll go to the desert or something.  I'll lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep.  Krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures. \nKAREN Fine.  You're just going to take off then... \nKaren has an angry expression on his face.  Jacob gives her a pained look. \nJACOB Don't do this to me.  I'm just trying to protect you and the others. \nKAREN Right.  You blow into town and then blow right out.  Terrific. \nJACOB I don't understand why you're so mad at me. \nKAREN You just don't get it, do you? \nJACOB Get what? \nKaren, though still very angry, looks like she's about to cry.  Jacob, confused, sits down on the porch steps. \nJACOB (cont'd) Maybe I'm crazy. \nKAREN Running away doesn't help. \nHe sighs and smiles a bit. \nJACOB And you're going to convince me, huh? \nKAREN Maybe. \nThis time Karen smiles.  Jacob looks at her and sighs.  Then he yawns. \nKAREN (cont'd) I'm going to make some coffee.  You promise not to move? \nJACOB Yeah.  Sure. \nKaren jumps and heads back into the house.  Jacob stares at the grass in front of him, his eyes heavy. \nJACOB'S POV - THE LAWN \nA bush sits there doing nothing.  Until it suddenly comes TO LIFE.  Its leaves start to shrivel, the lawn turns brown, the sky turns dark.  Everything changes and turns into \nDREAM FLASH - NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD \nWe're in a different front yard in a different town, in a different dimension. \nThe mutant bush starts to change, sprout legs, grow arms, become human. \nALICE \nHer body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us. \nALICE Jacob!  Help me! \nShe's fully formed now.  And Freddy bursts out from the ground behind her.  He grabs Alice, reaches his knife arm around \nALICE (cont'd) No-o-o-o-o! \nHer words are cut off as Krueger jams his blades in her gut and we re-live her death once more.  But it's even worse this time. \nBlood POURS from Alice like a burst fire hydrant, spraying and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human sprinkler.  Freddy LAUGHS. \nFREDDY Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob?  Come and join the fun! \nJACOB (O.S.) NOOOOOOO! \nJacob's voice rips through the scene as everything starts to BLUR RED. \nEXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT LAWN - DAY \nJacob is lying in the grass, violently shaking.  Karen drops down next to him. \nKAREN Jacob! \nJACOB Nooooo! \nHis body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an epileptic seizure.  He SHRIEKS, ignoring Karen completely, and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake.  Like he's never going to stop. \nEXT. MR. HOPKINS' FRONT DOOR - DAY \n", "test1_id": 1959, "test2_input": "We're directly across the street from the Foster Home as Jacob's cries echo through the neighborhood.  Mr. Hopkins opens the front door.  He sees what's going on, scowls, and yells into his house. \nMR. HOPKINS I told you!  It's an overdose!  Jesus Christ, I saw this coming.  Call 9-1-1! \nHe watches the commotion growing across the street, and never once moves to help. \nEXT. FOSTER HOME - MOMENTS LATER \nJacob is being strapped into a stretcher, babbling incoherently.  The residents of the Foster Home stand off to the side while neighbors gawk from the street.  Karen is next to the AMBULANCE GUYS looking frantic. \nJACOB No!  Don't let them take me! \nKAREN Jacob, it'll be alright. \nAMBULANCE GUY #1 Calm down, kid.  We'll take care of you. \nJacob grabs the Ambulance Guy. \nJACOB You don't understand!  Let me go! \nThe ambulance guy straps Jacob's arm down.  Mr. Ross grabs Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed teenager into the ambulance.  Scott shakes his head.  Wesley looks terrified.  Gina keeps her distance from any human. Karen can't take it and runs into the house.  Mr. Ross frowns. \nDAVID This is just what we need. \nThe ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the kids angrily. \nINT. AMBULANCE - DAY \nJacob yells and struggles as an Ambulance Guy prepares a syringe for injection. \nJACOB Don't fucking put me under!  You'll set him free! \nThe ambulance guy holds Jacob down and slams the needle home. Jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over. \nJACOB (cont'd) He'll kill them all... \nJacob's head starts to go limp.  A VOICE rings out in the van, a voice only Jacob hears: \nFREDDY (O.S.) Every town as an Elm Street! \nLAUGHTER echoes as Jacob turns his head towards a window. \nEXT. A STREET CORNER - DAY \nThe ambulance zooms by.  All is quiet for a second until CRASH! A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk and settles at an ugly angle. \nIt's an ELM ST. sign. \nINT. AMBULANCE - DAY \nWe PULL BACK from a wide awake Jacob, who is now suddenly alone in the van.  Outside the window there is only darkness. Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as \nCLANG! the ambulance doors crash open revealing BLACKNESS and KA-BOOM!  the stretcher is shot out of the van like a cannonball. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nThe stretcher with Jacob BLASTS through a wall and starts to race across the floor of the building that Jacob had been sweeping up the day before. \nIt careens along, actually taking a few turns, like it has a mind of its own, heading for a shallow pit in the middle of the warehouse. \nThe stretcher hits the pit, drops a bit, swings up violently, and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been stepped on AND A BLACK HUMAN SHAPE shoots out of Jacob's body from intertial force, staying upright as it slides across the floor, spins, stops, then changes into: \nFREDDY KRUEGER \nFreddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face. \nFREDDY Thanks for the lift, kid! \nHe saunters up to Jacob who is still strapped to the vertical stretcher.  Krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue. \nJACOB What do you want from me? \nFREDDY I already got it!  The rest I'm going to get from your new little friends. \nJACOB Leave them alone! \nFREDDY It's my duty to clean up the neighborhood! \nJACOB What have you done with my town? \nFREDDY Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he? Don't worry.  We'll all be one happy family soon.  Wanna be the first recruit? \n", "test2_true": "Freddy laughs \nWITH JACOB - RUNNING \nas he heads for a door.  Before he gets there, the door swings open and Freddy leans casually in his way. \nFREDDY (cont'd) What's the matter?  Don't want to be part of my expansion project? \nJacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse. \nAT THE DUMPSTER \nJacob races around to the other side and there's Krueger again. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Today, Rosedale.  Tomorrow, the world! \nJACOB Over my dead body! \nFREDDY As you wish. \nFreddy cranks up his knives and looms over Jacob.  And three FLASHES OF LIGHT blast out behind the boy.  Jacob rolls away as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare.  The light fades.  The DREAM POLICE have arrived. \nWe'll call the small one SOUND COP.  He stands there motionless as a loud and horrible GROWING noise emanates from his clenched teeth.  This guy's bark is worse than his bite. \nThe female in black is BLADE COP.  From nowhere she produces two nasty-looking knives, one in each hand.  She spins the blades in the air like an expert Samurai. \nThe large one we'll call POWER COP.  He reaches out for the dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a CRASH.  Freddy frowns. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Uh oh. Too many parking tickets. \nThe Dream Police fan out around Krueger, surrounding him. Power Cop leaps at Freddy, grabs him and TOSSES him in the air.  Freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his feet.  Right next to BLADE. \nShe swings her knives.  Freddy dodges.  Swings hi own blades at her.  She ducks.  Freddy spins again.  Right towards: \nSOUND COP.  The short man in black opens his mouth and a sound like a foghorn at a rock concert BLARES OUT.  The force of it hitting Freddy like a fist. \nFreddy bounces back.  And once again he nimbly pops up.  He glares at the Dream Police. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Don't interfere! \nBLADE COP We have to. \nSOUND COP It's our job. \nFREDDY Get a new one. \nAnd Freddy starts to SPIN.  Slowly at first, then faster and faster, until his image starts to BLUR. \nThe Police circle the whirling image, holding back to see what will happen next.  Krueger stops spinning.  And his clothes are different.  His red and green stripes have been replaced by black and white ones.  There is a number printed across his chest.  He's dressed like a CONVICT.  Freddy grins. \nFREDDY (cont'd) Time to blow this joint. \nBOOM!  A hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above Krueger.  The building is suddenly filled with the beams of moving SPOTLIGHTS and the sound of blasting SIRENS. \nA rope falls down through the hole.  Freddy grabs it and WHOOSH! he's yanked up. \nFREDDY (cont'd) You'll never get me, coppers! \nand away he's gone.  After a few seconds the spotlights fade away and the sirens die.  The Dream Police look up seemingly unsure of their next action.  Then Power Cop kicks a pile of lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away. \nPOWER COP Goddamnit! \nSound Cop shakes his head.  Blade looks frustrated.  Jacob steps up behind them. \nJACOB Alright...just who the hell are you guys? \nThe black-clad trio turn around in unison and look at Jacob. There is a pause.  Then: \nBLADE COP We're the Dream Police. \nJacob almost laughs. \nJACOB The what? \nPOWER COP The Dream Police.  Didn't you hear her, man? \nPower Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing his face.  He's a sixteen-year old black boy.  Heavyset features, sweat dripping down his cheeks.  He's KINCAID from NIGHTMARE 3.  And he's pissed. \nPOWER COP (cont'd) We try and save this guy's ass and then he goes off and cops an attitude. \nSound Cop flips up his helmet.  He's JOEY, the former mute boy. \n", "test2_id": 1960, "test3_input": "She stumbles quickly down the street.  We catch fleeting glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows. \nKaren rounds a corner, and SCREAMS when she bumps into someone.  It's Scott, out of breath from his own sprinting. \nKAREN Scott!  You're here. \nSCOTT Yeah.  Fun town.  Talk to any of the neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of folks. \nKAREN Uh-huh.  Real friendly, too. \nSCOTT So this is a dream? \nKAREN And I'm in it with you.  Convinced? \nSCOTT Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here with you.  Wouldn't be the first time. \nKAREN Nope.  I tired that one already.  Doesn't work.  Come on, we have to find Jacob. \nScott nods and they take off down the street.  A cat with three tails slithers by. \nEXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nJacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road.  He stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his face. \nKaren and Scott are running up behind him. \nKAREN Jacob!  Thank God! \nSCOTT So this is the place, huh? \nJacob's eyes are steady.  He hasn't yet acknowledged the other's presence.  He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in front of him.  A look of vengeance beginning to grow as our SHOT MOVES IN on him. \nJACOB I'm home. \nKaren and Scott are next to him now.  They stand silently with Jacob for a few seconds.  Then: \nKAREN What now? \nJACOB Scott, are you with us? \nSCOTT A deal's a deal. \nJACOB Then we wait. \nAnd not for long.  FLASH!  In three bursts the Dream Police appear directly across from the teenagers.  Scott and Karen jump back.  Jacob hold his ground. \nSCOTT Whoa! \nThe threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows. \nSCOTT (cont'd) Nice outfits. \nPOWER COP Is this all? \nJACOB All that's left. \nSOUND COP It'll have to do. \nSCOTT We can always come back later.  Like when it's daytime. \nPOWER COP It's always night here. \nJACOB What's the plan? \nBLADE COP We need you to draw him out. \nSCOTT Terrific.  We're supposed to be bait. \nSOUND COP Essentially. \nJACOB Then let's do it. \nKABOOOOOOOOM!  A huge BRICK WALL, ten feet high and spreading out across the street and through the houses, BLASTS up from the asphalt.  Right between the Police and the kids. \nON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE \nThe three cops crouch into battle positions. \nON THE TEENAGER'S SIDE \nThe three of them have hardly any time to react before three perfectly round HOLES open up underneath each of them. \n", "test3_true": "ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE \nSound Cop stands up and his body begins to VIBRATE.  A new noise emits from his mouth: a HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL. \nAnd like the walls of Jericho, the bricks in front of them fall apart and tumble to the ground.  Dust settles and the Police walk over the rubble to the other side.  The kids are gone. \nBLADE COP Fan out. \nThe Dream Police break formation and scatter. \nEXT. A STREET \nA hole opens up in the road and WHOOSH, KAREN is elevated up into the scene and the hole seals up instantly. \nShe jumps  a few feet and drops to her knees, holding onto the ground.  She looks up at a street sign.  It reads: ELM ST.  Karen stands up and heads down the road. \nEXT. ROCHESTER AVE. \nAnother hole, and VOOM, Jacob is shot up into the street.  He spins around, trying to get his bearings.  It doesn't take him long.  He knows exactly where he is. \nJACOB Oh no... \nHe starts to run and we FOLLOW him. \nJacob jumps over a procession of RATS making their way across the street and just keeps on sprinting.  Until he reaches a certain house.  He catches his breath as he looks at the building, pain registering on his face. \nJACOB (cont'd) Mom... \nJacob runs towards the house as our shot MOVES IN CLOSE to the mailbox and ate name printed across it.  It reads JOHNSON. \nINT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ENTRYWAY \nJacob bursts through the door.  He turns on a light switch. A lamp SPUTTERS into semi-life, and keeps sputtering, casting a candle-like glow over the interior. \nCobwebs and dust cover everything.  Rats and tarantula spiders skitter about.  Jacob grits his teeth and walks in deeper. \nEXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN \nScott BLASTS out of the asphalt.  He staggers for a few seconds from the ride, then looks at the building in front of him.  A puttering neon sign, \u00d4SPRINGWOOD TAVERN', marks the local saloon.  Muffled MUSIC and VOICES seep through the cracks of the double doors. \nScott looks around, then shrugs.  He heads for the entrance. \nINT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN \nDump is too clean a word, dive is too nice, abomination is more like it.  A greenish haze covers everything.  Instead of sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that looks like a compilation of human teeth, crushed bugs, and pools of unmentionable goo. \nThen there's the people. \nImagine any profanity, any obscenity,any blasphemy, add them all up - then double them.  It wouldn't even come close to the patrons of this joint. \nThey dance, they yell, they drink bloody bubbling mixtures. There's a guy to the right that doesn't seem to mind that half his brain is showing.  That girl over there has no jaw. In a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips.  A ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his hand up the back of a real body. \nScott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times. Then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn around and go right back out. \nA MUTANT BOUNCER, half his face a skull, blocks Scott's way. \nMUTANT BOUNCER Two drink minimum. \nSCOTT Ah, that's okay.  I think I'm underage, anyway. \nMUTANT BOUNCER Two drink minimum. \nSCOTT No, really.  I'm driving. \nMUTANT BOUNCER Two drink minimum. \nThe bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant.  Scott backs off and turns around.  He carefully moves forward.  A MUTANT WAITRESS with three breasts slips next to him. \nMUTANT WAITRESS Can I get you anything? \nSCOTT That's okay.  I'll just sit at the bar. \nMUTANT WAITRESS Alright, honey.  You call if you need anything. \nSCOTT You bet.  You'll be the first to know. \nScott turns away, trying to keep his eyes in their sockets. He slides up to the bar next to a MUTANT BUSINESSMAN.  The man's head is on backwards, his arms lean on the bar while his face looks out into the crowd.  He has to twist his neck to sip his vile drink. \nA BARTENDER, surprisingly normal-looking, steps up to Scott. \nBARTENDER What'll it be? \n", "test3_id": 1961}

BUNNYMUND Huh? 
Jack, though surprised, quickly grabs the reigns and smiles as he snaps them. 
JACK Hyah! 
North readies his sword and SLICES the Nightmare in half -- 
NORTH Yah! 
SEVERAL TOOTH BOXES spill out of the split Nightmare and rain down into the sleigh at the Guardians' feet. The Nightmare disintegrates into black sand. 
BUNNYMUND They're stealing the teeth! 
Sandy looks at his hands and sees the Nightmare sand take shape and drift away. He and Bunny exchange a look. 
The Guardians turn -- they're headed straight for a pillar. 
NORTH Jack, look out! 
Jack pulls the reins -- 
JACK Aaaahhhh! 
-- the sleigh nearly misses the pillar and skids to a rough stop on a platform. They see Tooth up above. 
NORTH Tooth! Are you alright? 
Tooth is flying around, visibly frustrated. This is bad. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 47. 
TOOTH They, they took my fairies! And the teeth! All of them! Everything is gone! Everything. 
Only then does it hit her. Tooth's wings drop in defeat. She's completely lost amidst the devastation. The Guardians rush to comfort her. Jack stays behind as Baby Tooth pops out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward Tooth. 
TOOTH Oh thank goodness! One of you is alright! 
PITCH (O.S.) I have to say, this is very, very exciting. 
Pitch's voice echoes across the open chamber. They look up to see Pitch, standing high above them with a satisfied smile. 
PITCH The Big Four, all in one place. I'm a little star-struck. (BEAT) Did you like my show on the globe, North? Got you all together, didn't I? 
Tooth darts after Pitch, but he escapes into the shadows. 
TOOTH Pitch, you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies! 
PITCH (O.S.) Or what? 
Tooth follows the sound of Pitch's voice and finds him near one of her tooth box columns. 
PITCH You'll stick a quarter under my pillow? 
NORTH Why are you doing this? 
PITCH Maybe I want what you have. To be believed in. 
Jack takes this in. Pitch moves along the walls and shadows of the chamber and emerges from behind a column. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48. 
PITCH Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds. 
BUNNYMUND Maybe that's where you belong. 
PITCH Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit! 
Bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find Pitch upside down, staring him in the face. Pitch disappears again. 
PITCH (O.S.) Hang on, is that...Jack Frost? (LAUGHS) Since when are you all so chummy? 
JACK We're not. 
PITCH Oh good. 
Jack turns and sees Pitch standing in the middle of a column. 
PITCH A neutral party. Then I'm going to ignore you. But, you must be used to that by now. 
BUNNYMUND Pitch! You shadow sneaking rat- bag! Come here! 
Bunny goes after Pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an opposite column. Tooth spots him, grabs one of Bunny's boomerangs and flies at Pitch in a rage... 
TOOTH Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
Pitch looks at Tooth with a smile and before she can reach him, a huge Nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at her. Tooth falls back. Baby Tooth hides in Jack's tunic. 
PITCH (SOOTHING) Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy. 
Pitch draws a wisp of black sand from Onyx's mane, twirls it in his palm, and turns toward Sandy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49. 
PITCH Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a while to perfect this little trick. Turning dreams into Nightmares. 
Pitch notices the shocked Guardians. 
PITCH Don't be nervous, it only riles them up more. They smell fear you know. 
BUNNYMUND What fear? Of you!? No one's been afraid of you since the Dark Ages! 
Pitch's eyes flash with anger. But then he smiles. 
PITCH (NOSTALGIC) Oh, the Dark Ages.

A long line of cars coast past. Occasionally, someone yells a greeting to John. The car hop brings the coke. Then a couple, Al and Linda, come over. They lean in the window smiling--John prays they don't see Carol. 
AL Hiya, John. Say, do you think if I brought my Mopar by the shop Monday you could spot weld the bumper bracket? 
JOHN Have to be before noon. 
AL Sure. Hey, have you met Linda? 
JOHN No. Hi--ahh, this is my, ahh, cousin, Carol. I'm kinda babysitting tonight. 
CAROL Babysitting!! 
She slugs John on the arm. John grabs her arm as she starts to swing again. 
JOHN Jesus--watch it, will yuh? (smiling at Al) Been hittin' me all night. Kids will be kids, you know. 
She struggles to hit him and spills her coke all over the car. He pushes her rather roughly against the door. 
JOHN Watch out--damn it! Look what--why don't you grow up! (looking at Al again) We don't get along too well. It's been like this-- 
CAROL You spastic creep! 
She is about to really cry this time. She jumps out of the car and runs off down the street. John wipes his car out as Al and Linda watch in amazement. 
JOHN We don't get along too well. You know what cousins are like. 
AL Yeah... well, I'll see ya on Monday before noon. 
John mutters profanities to himself, but his anger subsides after a few moments. He looks back in the direction Carol went. All he can see are two Hell's Angels on choppers rolling in the same direction. He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe. 
CRUISING MAIN STREET--'32 YELLOW DEUCE COUPE 
John roars along looking for her until he sees her walking angrily along the sidewalk--being followed by a Ford full of guys. 
John passes Carol and the Ford and pulls over and stops just ahead of them. Carol stops when she sees John. The Ford also stops and the guys call out to her. She considers the situation a moment, then runs and gets in with John. He pulls off and she grins at him happily. 
CAROL Hi cousin, how's your bod? 
SCENIC LIQUOR STORE--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY 
Terry pulls into the parking lot and stops. He looks up at the flashing liquor store sign and considers his battle plan. "Maybe Baby" by Buddy Holly is playing on the radio. 
DEBBIE Do you have an ID? 
TERRY No... hey, but no sweat. What'll it be? Beer, little wine? 
DEBBIE If you could get some Old Harper, I'd give you a French kiss. 
TERRY Old Harper, rrright! He gives her an OK sign with his fingers and goes over to the store. He starts to enter, then stops and thinks. He sees a man in a business suit approaching, and smiles. 
TERRY Excuse me, sir, while you're in there-- I mean, since you're going in anyway, I wonder if-- 
MAN Yes, son? 
TERRY Could you--sir--could you give me the time? 
MAN (looking at his watch) Why sure, it's a quarter to twelve. 
TERRY Great. Quarter to twelve. Thanks a lot. 
The man regards him, Terry pretends to start off until the man goes in. Terry pulls himself together as another man approaches, or rather stumbles up, being older, scruffy and, essentially, a bum. 
TERRY Pardon me, sir, but I lost my I.D. in--in a flood and I'd like to get some Old Harper, hard stuff. Would you mind buying a bottle for me? 
The bum is still trying to focus on Terry and smiles. 
BUM Why certainly, I lost my wife, too-- her name wasn't Idy, though, and it wasn't in a flood--but I know what ya-- 
TERRY Thanks, here's enough for a pint. 
The old man takes the money and falls into the store. Terry watches and then waves to Debbie in the car that everything is cool. 
As he waits for the bum to come back out, the first man in the suit exits. Terry smiles at him again. 
TERRY Hi. Still quarter to twelve. 
MAN Right-o. Night. 
TERRY Night. 
The man gets into the car and backs out. Terry goes over to the window of the liquor store and looks to see how the wino's doing with his booze. Terry sees the liquor store owner setting four bottles of cheap wine on the counter.

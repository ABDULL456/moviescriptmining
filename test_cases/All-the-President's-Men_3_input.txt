He hangs up. 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN watching from phone booth as the SECRETARY hurries across the hallway. As we see her open the door of the clerk's office, BERNSTEIN bolts out of the phone booth and runs into the reception room heading straight for the SECRETARY's desk. 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN at her desk, looking at the telephone console, receiver in hand. He punches the button marked Intercom and we can hear it BUZZ somewhere. 
VOICE (V.O.) Dardis. 
BERNSTEIN Carl Bernstein's here to see you--I don't know why, but he seems angry-- 
CUT TO: 
DARDIS emerging through one of the doors behind BERNSTEIN. BERNSTEIN see him. 
BERNSTEIN (to DARDIS) Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so. 
DARDIS Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow? 
BERNSTEIN (headshake) I'm on deadline. 
CUT TO: 
DARDIS' OFFICE. He is fiddling with a combination lock at a filing cabinet. BERNSTEIN is seated across DARDIS' desk. 
DARDIS You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff? 
BERNSTEIN Whatever. 
He hands BERNSTEIN some papers, glances at his watch. 
DARDIS I'll never get out of here in time. 
BERNSTEIN (flying through what he's been handed) The telephone calls... we know about that. 
DARDIS The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks-- 
BERNSTEIN --yeah, that was in The Times this morning. 
BERNSTEIN continues to fly through the papers. 
BERNSTEIN (continuing stops) What's this Dahlberg check? 
And as it's mentioned-- 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP--CASHIER'S CHECK. It's drawn on the First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida, it's dated April 10 and it's for 25 thousand dollars, payable to the order to Kenneth H. Dahlberg. 
DARDIS' VOICE That the twenty-five grand one?-- Don't know-- 
CUT TO: 
BERNSTEIN starting to copy the check in a meticulous facsimile. DARDIS watches. 
DARDIS I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. (watching BERNSTEIN) Think it might be anything? 
BERNSTEIN (casually) This? (shrugs) Naw... 
And from here quickly-- 
ZOOM TO: 
BERNSTEIN IN A PHONE BOOTH in the lobby of the Justice Building. Wildly excited-- 
BERNSTEIN --Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't know what I got-- (holding the Dahlberg facsimile) --and I think the Times has it too-- (big) --but somewhere there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg in this world and we've gotta find him-- 
And now comes 
THE HUNT FOR DAHLBERG. 
This is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying to locate a man names DAHLBERG. 
WOODWARD is maybe in the reference room of the Post, sweating, surrounded by Who's Who and Dictionary of American Biographies and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities-- 
BERNSTEIN is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building, sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away. 
This took them hours, and that effort should be visible to us. They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone book and dialing numbers and God knows what else. The point is, we want to get to DAHLBERG in a reasonably short amount of time, but we also want people to know there was effort involved. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD, bleary, in the reference room, a girl comes in, a researcher librarian type. 
RESEARCHER Were you after the Dahlberg articles from the files? (WOODWARD nods) There aren't any, sorry. 
And now she drops a piece of paper, a photo--

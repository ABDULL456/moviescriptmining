WILLIE That's the object. Not like when they beat up my boy Tom. 
JACK How is Tom? 
WILLIE Oh, he's fine. He starts college in the fall. 
JACK Oh. And Lucy? 
Willie's expression changes. He starts up the stairs. 
WILLIE Fine... fine. 
Interior: Willie's Campaign Office In Hotel, Day 
The place is a beehive of activity, with typists and messengers scurrying about, all supervised by Sadie. 
SADIE Hey, I need a boy... Where's a boy? (boy runs up) Take that downstairs; they're waiting for it. Right away, on the double. (to typist) Listen, baby, you've got to double- space all of this... he can't read, see. 
The door opens and Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy come in. 
JACK Sadie! 
SADIE (to typist) And they need four copies. (looks up) Hi, Jack. How are you? 
WILLIE Sadie is my secretary now. (to messenger, trying to squeeze by) Oh, pardon me. 
As Willie and Jack walk toward adjoining room, Sadie calls out: 
SADIE Fix your tie, Willie. 
Interior: Bedroom Hotel Suite, Day 
Willie and Jack enter from the office. 
WILLIE Hey, Sugar. 
Sugar Boy appears in the doorway. Sadie slips by into the room. 
WILLIE Keep everybody out of here. I want to talk to Jack and Sadie alone. 
He walks over to Jack, who leans back on the bed. 
WILLIE From now on you're working for me. 
JACK Doing what? 
WILLIE I don't know. Something will turn up, won't it, Sadie? 
SADIE Yeah. We need a college man around... for research. 
WILLIE How much did they pay you on that newspaper? 
JACK Three hundred dollars a month. 
WILLIE (laughs) I could buy you cheap, couldn't I? 
JACK For a bag of salt. 
WILLIE No. No, I don't play that way. I like you, boy. I always have. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you four hundred dollars a month and traveling expenses. 
JACK You throw money around like it was money. 
Willie gets up and walks to the window. 
WILLIE Money?... I don't need money. People give me things. 
JACK Why? 
WILLIE Because they believe in me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Exterior: Burden's Landing, Day 
Willie's car is on the ferry crossing the bay to Burden's Landing. Sugar Boy drives the car off the ferry and up the road toward the house. 
JACK (voice over) I was going home again. But this time it was different. Now I had a feeling that maybe the waiting was over... for me, and for Anne. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Interior: Stanton Living Room (Burden's Landing), Night 
Close shot of Willie standing in front of the fireplace, beneath the portrait of Governor Stanton. 
WILLIE It's a far cry from where I come from... to this house. 
Camera pulls back. The room is crowded with people, all of them friends of the Stantons. Anne, Adam, Judge Stanton, Mrs. Burden, and McEvoy are part of the audience sitting around the fireplace. Jack stands next to Willie.

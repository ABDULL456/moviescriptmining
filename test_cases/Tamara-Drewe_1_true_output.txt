ZOE Still time to change your mind. Blue skies. Fun in the sun. 
ANDY Just not a traveller, Zoe. 
ZOE 
(GENTLY) I know... you're like a big old tree. Stuck here. 
115 EXT. NEXT DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 115 
Nicholas parks his 4X4. As he gets out, he is on the phone. 
NICHOLAS I'll probably stay on at the library for another hour or two. Yes... just checking some law reports. 
115A CUT 115A 
116 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN / HALL. 116 
Tamara is playing with the ill-fitting ring that Ben gave her. She puts it a jar and closes the lid. There's a knock on the front door. She startles, her face falling. She answers it. Nicholas is on the threshold.

NICHOLAS Hello. 
TAMARA So. Nicholas. She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall. Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each other. Neither of them moves. 
NICHOLAS You can tell me to leave. Tamara says nothing. 
NICHOLAS You can throw me right out. Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her. 
NICHOLAS Just say and I'll go. She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is big and fatherly and comforting. Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real, vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the door. Tamara closes her eyes. Their kisses become more urgent. 
117 INT. DUSK. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 117 
Tamara is lying in Nicholas' arms in the growing darkness. He looks blissfully post-coital. Tamara is gazing ahead. A tear rolls down her cheek. It lands on Nicholas' chest. 
NICHOLAS Are you crying? 
TAMARA No. Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her. 
NICHOLAS Don't cry. Am I really that bad? Tamara shakes her head, glad of him. 
TAMARA I'm just not myself. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 76. 
NICHOLAS Yes you are. She looks up at him. 
NICHOLAS (CONT'D) You're relentlessly, rudely, uncompromisingly yourself. A smile appears on Tamara's face. 
TAMARA I used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane. Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it. 
NICHOLAS Is that why you're crying? 
TAMARA No. 
NICHOLAS Am I here as revenge on your ex? 
TAMARA I don't know why you're here. Why are you here, Nicholas? 
NICHOLAS Because... since you climbed over that stile in the summer I haven't thought about very much else. She doesn't believe him. 
TAMARA You can use me in one of your books. 
118 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 118 
Nicholas is putting his coat on. Tamara is uneasy. 
NICHOLAS When can we do this again? 
TAMARA What about Beth? 
NICHOLAS Look, Beth and I have this kind of 
OPEN - 
TAMARA Bullshit. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 76A. 
NICHOLAS Thursday? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 77. 
TAMARA Isn't life complicated enough? Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her. 
119 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 119 
Nicholas strolls in. He's ecstatically happy. Beth is getting something out of the Aga. 
BETH Oh poor you - was it awful? 
NICHOLAS Bloody terrible. Didn't move till well past Chiswick. But look, I nipped into Fortnums... He hands her a package.

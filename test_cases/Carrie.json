Hey, old praying Carrie! \n52 CARRIE \nShe keeps on walking, ignoring him. \n53 BOBBY \nKeeping pace with Carrie, shouting across the street. \nBOBBY Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face... \n54 CARRIE \nTurning toward him, her face contorted with rage. \n55 CARRIE'S POV \u00ad ANGLE ON BOBBY \nThe bike wobbles on its training wheels. \nAnd the bike topples over, on top of Bobby, who screams \n56 OMITTED \n57 CARRIE \nCLOSE now, featuring her eyes most prominently. Her face is uncertain, confused. What just happened? She thought (that's right, thought) something and it happened... \nAnd we HEAR another SCREAM, more of an angry shriek, and then the strange sight and SOUND of: \n58 FLASH CUT \nAs the stones pelt the White bungalow years ago. \n59 CLOSER \nThe stones pelting the roof. \n60 CARRIE \nShe is staring across the street at: \n61 BOBBY \nScreaming with anger (more than anything else) as he disentangles himself. He stands up, looks toward Carrie across the street, shakes his little fist. \nBOBBY (defiantly) Fart-face! \n62 CARRIE \nThe boy's defiant chant can be heard as Carrie blinks, wondering. Then she opens her eyes, wider. She looks at the boy. She frowns for a moment. \n63 FLASH CUTS \nThe stones. \nThe light bulb exploding. \nThe ashtray falling. \nWe hear: \nBOBBY'S VOICE Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face! \n64 CARRIE \nA faint smile, partly of wonder, partly of a strange kind of joy. She knows. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n65 INT. SNELL KITCHEN \u00ad ELEANOR SNELL \u00ad DAY \nSue's mother. Out of a margarine commercial \u00ad a packaged, nice lady, neat, trim \u00ad a good mother, good wife.

She is a large lady dressed in black, carrying a worn black leather sack, which we will discover is bulging with religious tracts. \n68 ELEANOR WITH MARGARET \nMargaret White is not a welcome visitor, but Eleanor Snell is a polite lady. \nELEANOR Oh, Mrs. White. \nMARGARET How have you been, Mrs. Snell? \nELEANOR Fine. \nMARGARET And the doctor? \nELEANOR Fine. \nMARGARET And your daughter? \nELEANOR Sue is... fine. \nAn impasse. Finally Eleanor feels constrained to open the door wider, put a smile on her face, and: \nELEANOR Won't you come in, Mrs. White? \nMARGARET Thank you. \nShe steps inside and Eleanor closes the door behind her, saying: \nELEANOR I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes. \nMARGARET Yes. \nELEANOR Perhaps some time Carrie might visit... \nMARGARET I'm here on the Lord's work. \nELEANOR Yes, of course. \nMargaret is fishing tracts out of her bag. \nMARGARET These will interest the doctor and you. \nEleanor looks at the tracts with pretended interest \nELEANOR I'm sure they will. \nMARGARET And your daughter. \nELEANOR (a smile) Well, I don't think Sue would be \u00ad \nMARGARET (cutting in) Children are godless these days, Mrs. Snell. \nMargaret's voice is almost toneless \u00ad now and throughout. \nELEANOR My Sue is a good girl. \nMARGARET These are Godless times. \nELEANOR I'll drink to that! \nHumor \u00ad and she regrets it immediately. \nELEANOR (continuing; quietly) We'll all read... these. \nThe telephone RINGS. \nELEANOR Excuse me. (retreating) Please sit down. \nMargaret doesn't sit, and Eleanor flees into the kitchen. \n69 INT KITCHEN \u00ad DAY \nAs Eleanor reaches the phone. \nELEANOR Hello... Betty, can I call you back? Margaret White is here... Right... right... Let me get rid of her and I'll call you back. \nShe hangs up, opens a drawer, takes out some hidden household money (a couple of bills), and drags herself back into the living room. \n70 INT. SNELL LIVING ROOM \u00ad DAY \nMargaret is still where we left her. \nELEANOR We'd like to contribute ten... (a look at Margaret) ...twenty dollars. \nMARGARET Thank you. I'll give you a receipt. \nEleanor shifts from foot to foot while Margaret writes out the receipt, gives it to her. \nELEANOR Thank you, Mrs. White. \nMARGARET I'll pray you find Jesus before it's too late. \nWhat can one say? Eleanor stands there, completely exasperated but retaining her politeness like a steel, middle-class glove. She accompanies Margaret to the door and the latter leaves.

Like always. \nHOLD ON Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps out the window as Margaret leaves). A long beat, then: \nDISSOLVE TO: \n72 CARRIE \nWho is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street. She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe \u00ad her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed. \nShe is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of \"Seventeen\" \u00ad absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men. An escape of sorts. \nAnd we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices \u00ad a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall. \n73 ANGLE \u00ad FEATURING CARRIE \nCaught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to see: \n74 EXT THE STREET \u00ad MARGARET \nAs this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black. \n75 CLOSEUP \u00ad CARRIE \nHer heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier \u00ad a scared little girl now encased in the body of an adolescent. \nAs she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat, Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea. \nAnd then the telephone RINGS \u00ad only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as Carrie dreaded \u00ad it's the school \u00ad and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice \u00ad not yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity \u00ad she calls up the stairs: \nMARGARET'S VOICE I know you're listening. Come downstairs. \nAnd defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the: \n76 HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, FOLLOWING CARRIE \nAs she hurries down toward her mother and into: \n77 INT WHITE KITCHEN \u00ad DAY \nWhere Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence. \nCARRIE Hello, Momma. \nNo response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether strange little kitchen \u00ad a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art \u00ad Margaret is a rock. \nCarrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks. \nCARRIE Who was it that called? (no response) What did they say? \n78 MARGARET \nPoint one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns from the stove. \nMARGARET (softly) You're a woman now. \nCARRIE Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared... \nMargaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her face: \nMARGARET `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was called Sin \u00ad ` \nShe pushes the Bible at Carrie, her finger on the place. \nMARGARET ...and the raven was called sin... \nCARRIE Why didn't you tell me? Oh, Momma \u00ad \nMARGARET (overriding) ...and the raven was called Sin! ...and the first sin was intercourse. \nCARRIE I was so scared! And the other girls, they made fun of me and threw things and \u00ad \nMargaret's hand flashes out, backhanding Carrie into the wall. It's a wallop of a slap, the sting of it bringing tears to her eyes. \nCARRIE Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault. \nAnother backhanded blow knocks Carrie to the floor. \nCARRIE Momma! \nMARGARET And Eve was weak and... say it, woman! \nKick. \n", "test2_true": "MARGARET And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world. \nCARRIE They threw things... \nMARGARET (overriding) ...and the raven was called Sin... Sin! ...and the first sin was intercourse. \nCARRIE Momma, please listen. \nA kick. \nMARGARET And the Lord visited Eve with a curse, and the curse was the Curse of Blood! \nThe teakettle starts to WHISTLE. \nCARRIE You should have told me! \nMargaret clutches Carrie's wrist in a vise. \nMARGARET (heavenward) O Lord, help this sinning woman see the sin of her days and ways. Show her that if she had remained sinless \u00ad \nCARRIE No! \nMARGARET -- the Curse of Blood would never have come on her. She may have been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of Lustful Thoughts. \nThe teakettle is WHISTLING louder \u00ad a high-pitched scream. \nCARRIE No, Momma. \nMARGARET Don't you lie to me, Carietta, don't you know by now I can see inside you? I can see your sin just as surely as God can. \nCARRIE Momma, let me go. \nMargaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet. \nMARGARET We will pray. We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls... \nShe switches on the light, and there is Jesus on the wall, rictus, crown of thorns, bathed in an ominous blue light. A vision of a wrathful God. Throughout the following, Carrie struggles desperately, but she's no match for her mother. \nMARGARET And the Lord visited Eve with a Curse, and the Curse was the Curse of Blood. And there was a Second Curse, and this was the Curse of Childbearing, and Eve brought forth Cain in sweat and blood! \nShe propels Carrie into the closet, slams the door behind her. Margaret's voice continues, overlapping onto: \n79 INT. CLOSET \u00ad CARRIE \u00ad DAY \nVery much the little girl now as she sinks to the floor of the closet \u00ad crying, disheveled, beaten. The closet is just what every child ever dreaded about the night. \n80 JESUS \nLooking down at Carrie. \n81 CARRIE \nShe looks away \u00ad and inwards.

The MUSIC swells as we MOVE IN. And finally, we PEER into the car, where we see: \n90 INT. TOMMY'S FORD \u00ad NIGHT \nSue and Tommy have finished making love in the back seat. They are both putting their clothes in order, silently, slowly. \nThen they climb into the front seat. Sue takes out a cigarette. Tommy lights it with the dashboard lighter.

He looks as startled as she does. \nTOMMY How're you doing? \nCARRIE (after a beat; almost inaudibly) Okay. \nIt's harder than he thought it would be; just trying to make small talk is agonizing. But try it, he does: \nTOMMY I thought you had gym this period. \nAll she can do is shake her head. And a young man not easily deterred, he tries again. \nTOMMY (continuing) What're you reading? \nCARRIE (trying to cover, and not very well) It's about... um.. sewing... \nRight. Check and stalemate. Which brings him to: \nTOMMY Umm... if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want to go with me? \nCARRIE What? \nTOMMY The Prom... \nWithout saying a word, Carrie walks down the aisle of book shelves.

Quiet, quietly: \nCARRIE Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever? \nA beat. Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much of a big deal it is.

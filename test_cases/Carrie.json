{"train": "CARRIE \nWritten by \nLawrence D. Cohen & Stephen King \nFADE IN: \nFrom an absolutely glistening WHITE \u00ad an image which first appears to be a brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid matter, less of a mystery. It's the \nEXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) \u00ad DAY \n1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned, spotless \u00ad a vision of small town normalcy and virtue. \nThis is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic. \nWe hear a woman's voice: \nMARGARET (o.s.) Carrie! Carrie \nThe voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue, which initially involves: \n2. STELLA HORAN \u00ad DAY \nAn all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun. \nThe CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body \u00ad luxuriant, taking it in inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard. \n3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE \u00ad STELLA \nAs she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half- grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door. \nVOICE (O.S.) What are those? \n4. STELLA'S POV \u00ad CARRIE WHITE \nA terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde- white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella through the hedge. \nSTELLA Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright. (turning down the radio) How long have you been there? \nCARRIE (not smiling; pointing with her finger) What are those? \nStella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts \u00ad white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit \u00ad not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely. \nSTELLA Those are my breasts, honey. \nCARRIE (a beat; then solemnly) I wish I had some. \nSTELLA You will. `Course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but \u00ad \nCARRIE (a fact) No I won't. \nSTELLA Why, sure you will. \nCARRIE (emphatic) No, I won't. (glancing behind her) Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't. \nSTELLA (at something of a loss) Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts? \n5    CARRIE Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door. She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is: \nCARRIE ...dirtypillows. \nSTELLA What? \nCARRIE Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me. \n6   STELLA \nIncredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge. \nShe kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off. \nSTELLA Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen \u00ad you must be real hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade, would you like that? \n7   CARRIE \nClearly torn \u00ad tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror \u00ad as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head. \nSTELLA C'mon. (offering her hand) It'll be our secret. \nCarrie \u00ad now really scared \u00ad shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge. \nCARRIE I can't! \nSTELLA Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and \u00ad \nAnd just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house. Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream: \nMARGARET CAARRIEETTAAA!!! \n8 CARRIE, STELLA Both frozen by this terrible sound \n9 STELLA'S POV \u00ad CLOSER ON CARRIE \nAs she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she seems to smile \u00ad or is she about to cry? \nAnd then, she's gone \u00ad running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the White house as fast her legs can carry her. \n21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE \u00ad MORNING \nNow some years later \u00ad and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs behind her. \nShe is wearing a shapeless, drab dress \u00ad much too long, not so much out of style as utterly without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes. \nAs she comes down the porch stairs, we hear: \nMARGARET'S VOICE Carrie! \nCarrie stops, turns to reply into the house. \nCARRIE Yes, Momma. \nMARGARET'S VOICE You come straight home from school. \nA moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but: \nCARRIE (sweetly) I always do, Momma. \nThen she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening. \n22. EXT WHITE HOUSE \u00ad ANOTHER ANGLE \nAs Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago. \n23 EXT. TOWN STREETS \u00ad DAY \nCarrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out, an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us about this possibility, there is MUSIC. \n24 BOBBY ERBETER \nAbout five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels. \nBOBBY Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! Praying, Carrie, praying Carrie, praying Carrie! \nCarrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school, in the background: \nBobby, frustrated, stops astride is bike and screams after her. \nBobby's face \u00ad \nDISSOLVE TO: \n25 THE FACE OF AN ADOLESCENT \nOr as he is known in school, THE BEAK. He is pathetically thin, myopic, weak-chinned, beak-nosed, almost a caricature of an adolescent reject. Over his face, we HEAR: \nFROMM'S VOICE What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air? \nWe PAN the faces of adolescents, listening with various degrees of attention, indifference, or reluctance, to: \nFROMM'S VOICE You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness? You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels. Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough... \n26 INT. CLASSROOM \u00ad FROMM \u00ad DAY \nOr, as he is known to his pupils, BIG BELLY FROMM, at his desk in front of the class, reading from an assignment paper. \nFROMM ...If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could \nHe sets down the paper, and looks at the class. \n27 FROMM'S POV \u00ad THE CLASS \nWe will see, among others, Carrie. \nWe also see TOMMY ROSS \u00ad a mid-seventies version of the boy next door. Good-looking, clean-cut, intelligent, athletic. \n28 FROMM \nHe is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement. \nFROMM I must say \u00ad I must confess \u00ad this poem displays an extraordinary talent... (the knife) ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross. \n29 THE CLASS \nAll eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed. In fact, he turns, clasps his hands over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off; he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it. \n30 FROMM \nFROMM Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown... Any criticisms? \n31 THE CLASS \nThe usual hesitation. Then Carrie's hand shoots up. \n32 FROMM \nHe appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering. \nFROMM Carrie White? \n33 THE CLASS \u00ad FEATURING CARRIE \nHer volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck with it. The eyes of the class are on her. And she has to say something. So she does. \nCARRIE It's... beautiful. \nTurns green \n49 CARRIE \nShe walks across the street. \n50 EXT. ANOTHER STREET \u00ad DAY \nA quiet residential street in a lower middle-class neighborhood. Carrie is walking down the street, slowly. \n51 ANOTHER ANGLE \nThere comes Bobby Erbeter again on his bike, paralleling Carrie (as before) \nBOBBY Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! \n52 CARRIE \nShe keeps on walking, ignoring him. \n53 BOBBY \nKeeping pace with Carrie, shouting across the street. \nBOBBY Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face... \n54 CARRIE \nTurning toward him, her face contorted with rage. \n55 CARRIE'S POV \u00ad ANGLE ON BOBBY \nThe bike wobbles on its training wheels. \nAnd the bike topples over, on top of Bobby, who screams \n56 OMITTED \n57 CARRIE \nCLOSE now, featuring her eyes most prominently. Her face is uncertain, confused. What just happened? She thought (that's right, thought) something and it happened... \nAnd we HEAR another SCREAM, more of an angry shriek, and then the strange sight and SOUND of: \n58 FLASH CUT \nAs the stones pelt the White bungalow years ago. \n59 CLOSER \nThe stones pelting the roof. \n60 CARRIE \nShe is staring across the street at: \n61 BOBBY \nScreaming with anger (more than anything else) as he disentangles himself. He stands up, looks toward Carrie across the street, shakes his little fist. \nBOBBY (defiantly) Fart-face! \n62 CARRIE \nThe boy's defiant chant can be heard as Carrie blinks, wondering. Then she opens her eyes, wider. She looks at the boy. She frowns for a moment. \n63 FLASH CUTS \nThe stones. \nThe light bulb exploding. \nThe ashtray falling. \nWe hear: \nBOBBY'S VOICE Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face! \n64 CARRIE \nA faint smile, partly of wonder, partly of a strange kind of joy. She knows. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n65 INT. SNELL KITCHEN \u00ad ELEANOR SNELL \u00ad DAY \nSue's mother. Out of a margarine commercial \u00ad a packaged, nice lady, neat, trim \u00ad a good mother, good wife. She is preparing dinner; in her line of sight, a television game show glitters. \nDOORBELL \nEleanor frowns momentarily, leaves the kitchen. \n66 INT. SNELL HOUSE \u00ad TRACKING ELEANOR \u00ad DAY \nThrough the middleclass, rather tasteful home, to the front door. \nEleanor opens the door. \nSue is coming toward the door. She passes Margaret with a quick (inaudible) greeting and hurries to the front door where her mother is waiting. \nSUE That's Carrie White's mother... \nAs Eleanor nods and closes the door. \nSUE (apprehensively) What did she want? \nELEANOR (indicating tracts) She gave us these \u00ad (conspiratorial sigh) ...and I gave her a donation. \nSue's face betrays relief, but Eleanor notices nothing. \nELEANOR (brightly) Well, how was school today? \nSUE Today? Like always. \nHOLD ON Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps out the window as Margaret leaves). A long beat, then: \nDISSOLVE TO: \n72 CARRIE \nWho is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street. She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe \u00ad her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed. \nShe is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of \"Seventeen\" \u00ad absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men. An escape of sorts. \nAnd we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices \u00ad a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall. \n73 ANGLE \u00ad FEATURING CARRIE \nCaught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to see: \n74 EXT THE STREET \u00ad MARGARET \nAs this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black. \n75 CLOSEUP \u00ad CARRIE \nHer heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier \u00ad a scared little girl now encased in the body of an adolescent. \nAs she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat, Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea. \nAnd then the telephone RINGS \u00ad only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as Carrie dreaded \u00ad it's the school \u00ad and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice \u00ad not yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity \u00ad she calls up the stairs: \nMARGARET'S VOICE I know you're listening. Come downstairs. \nAnd defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the: \n76 HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, FOLLOWING CARRIE \nAs she hurries down toward her mother and into: \n77 INT WHITE KITCHEN \u00ad DAY \nWhere Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence. \nCARRIE Hello, Momma. \nNo response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether strange little kitchen \u00ad a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art \u00ad Margaret is a rock. \nCarrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks. \nCARRIE Who was it that called? (no response) What did they say? \n78 MARGARET \nPoint one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns from the stove. \nMARGARET (softly) You're a woman now. \nCARRIE Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared... \nMargaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her face: \nMARGARET `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was called Sin \u00ad ` \nShe pushes the Bible at Carrie, her finger on the place. \nMARGARET ...and the raven was called sin... \nCARRIE Why didn't you tell me? Oh, Momma \u00ad \nMARGARET (overriding) ...and the raven was called Sin! ...and the first sin was intercourse. \nCARRIE I was so scared! And the other girls, they made fun of me and threw things and \u00ad \nMargaret's hand flashes out, backhanding Carrie into the wall. It's a wallop of a slap, the sting of it bringing tears to her eyes. \nCARRIE Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault. \nAnother backhanded blow knocks Carrie to the floor. \nCARRIE Momma! \nMARGARET And Eve was weak and... say it, woman! \nKick. \nTOMMY Hey. \nShe turns away. \nTOMMY Hey, what's the matter? \nHe puts his arm around her clumsily. \nSUE Nothing. \nTOMMY What did I do? \nSUE Nothing. It's not you. \nTOMMY Hey, everything's all right. I love you, honey. (silence) Did I...? \nSUE (blurting) It's Carrie. \nTOMMY Who? \nSUE Carrie. Carrie White. \nTOMMY Praying Carrie? \nSUE (sharply) Don't call her that. \nTOMMY (imitating Carrie) It's... beautiful. (laughing) That's what she said when I read that poem you wrote for me. \nSUE Tommy, please... \nTOMMY (going on) And Big Belly Fromm saying... (imitating) That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White. (exploding) Jesus! \nSue has turned away from him. \nTOMMY Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it. (silence) Honey? \nSUE Don't call me that. \nTOMMY Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you? \nShe is crying, that's what. \nTOMMY Hey, are you crying? (yes, stupid) Are you? \nHe tries to turn her toward him. She struggles. Manfully, he forces her around. \nTOMMY Jesus, Sue, what is it? \nSUE (trying to turn away) I told you. \nTOMMY Told me what? \nSUE \nAbout Carrie. \nTOMMY That thing in the shower? (she's silent) Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it? I mean, everyone was doing it. \nSUE I'm not everyone. \nTOMMY You're special. \nSUE I was one of them. \nTOMMY So you were teasing Carrie White \u00ad \nSUE We were hurting her \u00ad \nTOMMY She's used to it. Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her knees and say grace in the cafeteria... alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses... Hey, Sue, she's asking for it. \nSUE (vehemently) How would you like to be Carrie White? \nTOMMY How would I like to be Carrie White? \nSUE How would you like to be Carrie White? How would you like to be Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross... big man, big jock, popular. \nTOMMY What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids... (stops) What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything? \nSUE I did something wrong and I feel bad about it. \nTOMMY I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid... \nSUE (interrupting) I've got to do something about it. \nTOMMY Like what? \nSUE I don't know yet. Apologize. \nTOMMY Okay, you tell her you're sorry. \nSUE That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do. \nTOMMY What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake? \nSUE God, I hate you sometimes! \nTOMMY What the hell do you want me to do? \nWhere Carrie is kneeling by her bed, now in her flannel nightgown, praying. \nMARGARET What was that noise? \nCARRIE \nNothing, Momma. \nMargaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it. But there it is \u00ad whole again as her reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser. \nMARGARET Go to bed. \nShe leaves the doorway and we return to Carrie, who smiles sweetly. And then: \nFlex. \nThe door slams closed. \n100 INT. THE GYM \u00ad TRACKING SHOT \u00ad DAY \nDown the class of twenty-five or so girls, still in their street clothes, lined up against the gym wall under their class numbers as: \n101 COLLINS \nWalks in front of them with a clipboard taking roll. \nCollins ...Shyres... \nSHYRES (o.s.) Present \nCOLLINS ...Snell... \n102 THE GIRLS \nSTILL TRACKING, FEATURING Sue \nSUE Here. \nCOLLINS (o.s.) Watson... \nWATSON Present. \nThe CAMERA COMES to an empty space \u00ad without being told, we can tell it's Carrie's. \n103 COLLINS \nHesitates, then moves right along. \nCOLLINS ...and the Wilsons. \nWho're identical twins. \nCORA Here... \nRHONDA ...Miss Collins. \nCOLLINS (small smile; then, closing her book) Okay. Sit down. \nAll the girls \u00ad except Chris \u00ad obey. \nCOLLINS You too, Chris. And spit out that gum. \nCHRIS (overly sweet) Where'll I put it, Miss Collins? \nCOLLINS You can choke on it for all I care. Now sit down. \n104 CHRIS \nPausing for a second, then deciding it's better to go along without talking back. She sits down. \n105 THE GIRLS \nShifting nervously, unused to Collins' absolute no-nonsense tone. \n106 COLLINS \nTaking a deep breath. \nCOLLINS Okay. I just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday. A really shitty thing. \n107 HELEN SHYRES \nthe freckled, slightly pudgy girl sitting next to Sue \u00ad giggles nervously. But no one joins her, and she clasps her hand over her mouth, trying to stifle it. \n108 COLLINS \nGlaring at Helen, silencing her. \nCOLLINS Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings? Do any of you ever stop to think? No, I guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy? \nCHRIS (mumbling) Billy Nolan. \nCOLLINS (loudly) Who? Speak up! I can't hear you. \nChris tries to control her anger \u00ad is barely able to. \nCHRIS Billy Nolan \nBILLY Scared, Chuckie? \nCHRIS No. You'll kill us, you stupid shit! \nBilly lazily slaps her, speeds up. \nBILLY Don't call me that. \nCHRIS Stupid shit. \nHe slaps her again. \nCHRIS (continuing; under her breath) Stupid shit. \nBILLY (disgustedly) Oh wow! \nHe slams on the brakes, and pulls into: \n135 EXT. CARNEY'S (SUNSET BLVD.) \u00ad DOWNWARDS ANGLE \u00ad NIGHT \nLOOKING DOWN on a parking lot where cars are parked; a huge pullman's car which has been converted into a restaurant. This after-school hangout is called the Cavalier. \n136 INT. CHEVY \nAs Billy reaches over, very confidently, to draw Chris to him. \nShe lets herself be kissed, then pulls away abruptly. \nHe grabs at her, and she pulls away. \nBILLY What's wrong? \nCHRIS Can't you wait a minute? \nBILLY What for? \nCHRIS You're so ignorant. \nBILLY That's what you like. \nCHRIS Bullshit. \nBILLY No? I'll show you what you like, Chuckie. \nGrab. \nCHRIS No. \nBILLY Jesus. \nGrab. \nCHRIS No! \nShe pushes him away. \nHe grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle. Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the buttons are ripped off. \nBILLY ...How you... gonna... explain that... \nCHRIS Dumb shit! \nHe slaps her. \nBILLY What'd I tell you? \nSilence. Then, after some time, he leans over and kisses her. She lets him. He kisses her again, and she responds. He goes at it. And she squirms away. \nBILLY (continuing) Hell is this? \nCHRIS I want you to do something. \nBILLY| What? (eagerly) Yeah, what? \nCHRIS I want you to do something for me. Something important. \nBILLY (warily) Something important? \nCHRIS It will be very important to me. It will make me feel very good if you do it. \nShe moves closer to him. Her hand dips down out of FRAME. She blows in his ear. Billy is beginning to writhe; he moves in on her, but she holds him off, playing him like a puppet. \nCHRIS (continuing) Billy, I hate Carrie White. \nCUT TO: \n137 TELEVISION SCREEN \nOn which we see the opening, helicopter-credit-sequence from \"Duel at Diablo.\" The television is in: \n138 INT. SNELL LIVING ROOM \u00ad NIGHT \nWhere the movie's SOUND continues uninterrupted for a bit over an incredible silence between Tommy and Sue. They are sitting on a couch. The silence is finally broken by a reluctant: \nTOMMY Okay. I'll do it. \nAnd we: \nAs Collins tidies up after one of the classes \u00ad throwing towels into huge cans, etc. Only to hear a mewing, whimpering sound and come upon Carrie who's huddled in one of the dark corners of the room, crying. It's almost as if she created her own closet of space. \nCOLLINS Carrie? (on no response) Carrie, what's the matter? (on still no response) Was it one of the girls? Did one of the girls do something to you? Do you want a Kleenex? \nCARRIE No. \nCOLLINS It's all right. Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of. \nCARRIE Miss Collins... \nCOLLINS That's it... \nCARRIE When can I come back to gym? \nCOLLINS Not until Monday. Now what is it? Are you going to tell me? Come on, Carrie, tell me. \nCARRIE I got asked to the prom. \nCOLLINS That's great! \nCARRIE Tommy Ross asked me. \nCOLLINS Tommy Ross \u00ad that's wonderful. He's cute. \nCARRIE I know who he goes around with. They're trying to trick me again. I know. \nCOLLINS Maybe he really meant it. I mean, maybe he really did mean it. Maybe you should think about it. It might be really fun. You might have a really good time! \nCARRIE It would be a nightmare. \nCOLLINS C'mon, Carrie. You should have a better image of yourself. You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair. It's really beautiful. If you just fixed it up a little... here, I'll show you. \nCUT TO: \n143 OMIT \n144 INT. FACULTY LOUNGE \u00ad DAY \nwhere Collins and Morton are grabbing a quick cup of coffee. \nCOLLINS Carrie's been asked to the prom. \nMORTON Who? \nCOLLINS Carrie White. \nMORTON By whom? The Beak? \nCOLLINS By Tommy Ross. \nMorton goes into a coughing fit, accidentally knocking over his coffee in the process. Collins watches, slightly amused by his reaction. When he recovers: \nMORTON What about his girlfriend? Doesn't he date the little Snell girl? \nCOLLINS I think she put him up to it. \n145 INT. OFFICE \u00ad DAY \nWhere Collins is grilling a very nervous Sue \u00ad just Sue so far. \nCOLLINS Who's brainstorm was this? (no response) What are you trying to do? \nSUE You've got it wrong. \nCOLLINS I hope so. I wouldn't have expected this from you, Sue. Not any of it. Well? \nSUE What do you want to know? \nCOLLINS Why Tommy asked her to the prom. (after a beat) Well? \nSUE (reluctant; able to go this far) I asked him to. \nCOLLINS Why? \nSUE (swallowing) I asked him to. \nCOLLINS But, in God's name, what for? What could you possibly have in mind? \n146 DIFFERENT ANGLE \u00ad FEATURING TOMMY \nWho's also in the office for this interrogation \u00ad ill at ease, trying to appear cool. \nSUE You mean what good would it do? Maybe it'll... bring her out of... make her a... \nCOLLINS A part of things? Oh, come on, Sue. None of us are that stupid. And neither is Carrie. \nSUE Maybe not. \nCOLLINS And you're not going to go? You're going to stay home and miss your senior prom? \nJust as this point, NORMA WATSON \u00ad a prissy little pleaser with a mouth whose verbal discretion could make the telephone obsolete \u00ad enters the room with a sheaf of attendance sheets for the next week. All conversation ceases. \nCOLLINS (continuing) Yes, Norma? What is it? \nNORMA Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins. \nCOLLINS Just leave them on the desk. (to Sue) You understand, you can't come without a date? \nCARRIE You better go. \nMARGARET'S VOICE Carrie! Who are you talking to? \nTOMMY Don't you think you better answer? \nCARRIE No one, Momma. \nTOMMY You're going with me. \nCARRIE I can't. \nTOMMY You're going. \nCARRIE They'll laugh. \nTOMMY No one will laugh. We'll see to it. \nCARRIE Please. Please go. \nTOMMY Not `til you say yes. \nCarrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; helpless, honest, confused. She'd really like to go at this point, but that extra sense in her is resisting. \nCARRIE Why? Why is it so important to you? \nTOMMY I don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem. \nMARGARET (o.s.) Carietta!!! \nAnd in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not \"liked\" her poem, had Margaret not called, perhaps she could have held back. \nCARRIE Yes. (beat) Okay. \nTOMMY I'll pick you up at eight. \nCARRIE (whispering) Fine. (then) Thank you. \nTommy smiles at her and, turning to leave, touches her hand against the screen door. A goodbye, nothing more. He goes down the walk toward his car. \n149 CARRIE \nWatching him. She takes the hand he \"touched\" and brushes the hair back from her face. A little beautiful? You bet. \nMARGARET'S VOICE Carrie? Did you hear me? \nCARRIE Coming, Momma. Coming. \nAnd as she turns away from the door, we: \nCUT TO: \n150 INT. GYM \u00ad AFTERNOON \nSUE Why not? \nHELEN Why did you do it? God, everyone's talking. \nWe PULL BACK to see the gym. The entire back wall has been devoted to a giant mural of stars and planets \u00ad it seems the prom is to have a celestial theme, and the gymnasium is in the process of being hung with a great deal of crepe paper, moons, etc. \nSUE I asked Tommy to take Carrie. I thought I owed her that much. \nHELEN Where does that put the rest of us? \nSUE You have to make up your own mind. \nHELEN And Tommy went along with it? \nSUE Uh-huh. (pauses) I guess the other kids think I'm stuck-up. \nHELEN Well... they're all talking about it. But most of them still think you're okay. \n151 HELEN'S POV \u00ad THE GYM \u00ad CHRIS AND NORMA WATSON \nas thick as thieves, off in the corner, whispering. \n152 TWO SHOT \u00ad SUE AND HELEN \nHELEN There is... (giggles) ...a small dissenting faction. \nSUE I guess she's having a field day with this. \nHELEN Susie, she hates your guts. \nSue nods \u00ad she knew it, now she hears it. \n153 EXT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad EVENING \nFULL FRONTAL VIEW of thee bungalow IN the FRAME. \nThe lights are on downstairs; there's a slight drizzle and haze. HOLD, then: \nCUT TO: \n154 INT. WHITE KITCHEN \nAs Carrie and Margaret finish dinner. Silence \u00ad punctuated only by the slight DRIZZLE outside and occasional flashes of THUNDER and lightning. Then: \nCarrie knits her brow, and flex, the window closes. \nMargaret whips around, facing Carrie. \nCARRIE I'm going, Momma. And things are going to change around here. \nFlex. \nThe SOUND of a window shutting in another room. \nMARGARET Witch! \nFlex. \nAnother window. \nMARGARET (continuing) It's Satan's power. First he entered your father, carried him off... \nCARRIE He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows that. \nFlex. \nA couple of windows. \nMARGARET The devil tempted him. \nCARRIE He ran away with a woman, Momma. \nMARGARET All men are the same. That boy, he's like all the rest, he doesn't \u00ad \nFlex. \nThe rest of the windows in the house THUNDER shut. \nCARRIE I don't care. He asked me to go. And I'm going. I'm going, Momma. You can't stop me. \nHOLD \u00ad \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \n155 & 156 OMITTED \n157 EXT. ROAD \u00ad NIGHT \nLeading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. A little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy zoo \u00ad a completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT \u00ad trailing behind. De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance. \nDE LOIS Hell of a risk for a joke. \nTrennant giggles inanely. Billy stops and glares at De Lois. \nBILLY You want out? \nDE LOIS (hastily) No, uh-uh. (then) It's a good joke, Billy. \nTrennant giggles again. \nGarson is stoned silly \u00ad zonked, deadpan. He greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes. \nDe Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers. \nDE LOIS (continuing) Hey, piggie... \nTrennant just giggles inanely. \nAnother long beat, then: \nDE LOIS (continuing) You sure Old Man Henty won't be around? \nCHRIS I told you. He's at a funeral. \nTrennant explodes into a fit of high-pitched laughter. \nBILLY Shut up, Henry. \nDE LOIS Whose funeral did he go to? \nBILLY His mother's. \nDE LOIS His mother's? Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God! \nTrennant lurches into another cackle. And in spite of themselves, Billy and Chris start laughing, too. Even De Lois starts laughing. \nThe group passes a \"No Trespassing\" sign, prompting: \nDE LOIS (continuing) The bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look. \nGarson drops one of the pails on the ground. \nBILLY Asshole. \nThe sound of Trennant's high-pitched giggle. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n158 CHRIS'S POV \u00ad THE HOG PEN \nAnd OVERLAPS INTO the harmonic chanting of De Lois, Trennant and Garson: \nMARGARET There's going to be a judgement! \nThere's nothing more to say. Carrie walks up to the stairs, and we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \n161 INT. GYMNASIUM \u00ad NIGHT \nVery dark, shadowy, deserted. The night before the prom. Silence, then a SCRAPING sound of a: \n162 WINDOW \nBeing jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face \u00ad just whose isn't clear yet. The slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right behind him. \n163 LONG SHOT \u00ad THE GYM \nAs a flashlight is shined upwards \u00ad at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular \u00ad the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be crowned. \n164 TWO SHOT \u00ad BILLY AND CHRIS \nDOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area \u00ad past the numerous tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands. Billy is carrying the ice chest, Chris the flashlight. \n165 ANOTHER ANGLE \nAs they arrive behind the stage. Billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of Playtex rubber gloves, snaps them on. Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine. \n166 CHRIS' POV \u00ad BILLY \nLooking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a narrow platform overlooking the stage area. \n167 CLOSEUP \u00ad CHRIS \nShining the flashlight to guide Billy, her face flushed with excitement. \n168 BILLY \nAs he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures the girders over the stage. \n169 CHRIS \nunable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone. \nCHRIS What's it like up there? (no response) Billee? (no answer; genuinely scared) Billy! \nAnd just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into the FRAME and lands in Chris's hair. She jumps, utterly unnerved. She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from the platform, grinning. \nBILLY Boo. \nCHRIS You stupid shit. \nBILLY (still in good humor) Nice talk. \nCHRIS Hurry up. Do you hear me, just hurry up. \nBILLY (blackface) Yes'um. Yes'um. Weeze doing the best we can. \nCHRIS I want to go home. \nBILLY Just keep your tits on and I'll let you pull it when the time comes. \nCHRIS I plan to. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n170 A SERIES OF SCENES \u00ad LEADING TO THE PROM \nCUTTING between the final arrangements for the prom itself and Carrie's preparations as the night approaches. The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage \u00ad scored throughout with happier and happier MUSIC \u00ad will also feature some of our lesser characters. \nAmong other things, we will see: \nA) THE GYM \u00ad as last-minute arrangements are made \u00ad more crepe paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc.; \nB) CARRIE \u00ad in a town store as she shops for makeup; \nC) NORMA WATSON \u00ad under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted; \nD) TOMMY \u00ad picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist; \nE) CARRIE \u00ad at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't see), a happy look on her face; \nF) THE GYM \u00ad as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall; \nG) SUE \u00ad having dinner with her parents \nH) THE TWINS \u00ad in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously; \nI) ERNEST \u00ad the class president \u00ad making sure the microphone on the stage works; \nJ) THE BAND \u00ad among them, The Beak, setting up; \nK) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act; \nL) A DOOR \u00ad which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates; \nM) GEORGE AND FRIEDA \u00ad he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as Freida's parents take a Polaroid of this night to remember; \nN) THE GYM \u00ad with the adult chaperones \u00ad teachers, administrators \u00ad standing around, looking for something to do. \nAnd she's gone, down the \n174 STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, TO THE FRONT DOOR \u00ad TRACKING \nCarrie who opens the door. \n175 ANGLE ON TOMMY \nWell, we know he's beautiful. And he's looking at Carrie. He didn't know: \n176 CARRIE \u00ad TOMMY'S POV \nHe didn't know she could be beautiful. And she is. \n177 TOMMY AND CARRIE \nHe reaches out his hand. \nTOMMY Hi. \nCarrie takes his hand. \n178 EXT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT \nHand in hand, Carrie and Tommy walk down the path toward his car. \nThey are observed by: \n179 MARGARET \nat the window of Carrie's room. \n180 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT \nMargaret leaves the window as we HEAR Tommy's car drive off. \nShe goes out of the room. \n181 TRACKING MARGARET \nDown the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. Almost the same path that Carrie trod, but trod so differently. While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously expectant, Margaret's is slow and heavy. \n182 INT. WHITE KITCHEN \u00ad NIGHT \nMargaret crosses to one of the drawers. \nShe reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light. \nCUT TO: \n183 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT \u00ad NIGHT \nThe school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them, Tommy's Ford. \n184 INT. TOMMY'S CAR \nas Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars. Tommy watches her taking it all in. \nCARRIE It's like a dream. \nTOMMY You can still change your mind, you know. \nShe turns to him and realizes he's teasing her. \nCARRIE Easier said than done. \nTOMMY (grinning) C'mon. \nCARRIE No. Please \u00ad not yet. \nTOMMY Scared? \nCARRIE Yes. (beat) Can we sit here another minute? \nTommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable \u00ad she's happy to be with Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out. \nCARRIE Tommy... (and then out it comes) Maybe... maybe this was a mistake. \nTOMMY Hey, it won't be so bad. \nShe tries to smile at him. It's not very persuasive. \nTOMMY Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see. (beat; she's trying to believe him) Don't be nervous. Besides... (a little self-mocking) I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself. \nAnd that's just enough \u00ad he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh. \nCUT TO: \n185 INT. GYM \nwhere the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of \"Harlem Nocturne.\" From Carrie's POV it's all magic \u00ad explosions of pastel color, everyone looking like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness. \nCarrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the stage wall \u00ad full of celestial moon, stars and rockets \u00ad a VOICE bellows out behind her. \nVOICE Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer. \n186 GEORGE DAWSON \nCOLLINS (gesturing to his seat) May I? \nCarrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied. \nCOLLINS Carrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten. I want you to know that. \nCARRIE I can't forget it. (beat) But it's over with. It's over. \nCollins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number \u00ad slow, romantic. \nCOLLINS I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you? \nCARRIE It's very... nice. \nCOLLINS (smiling) Just nice? \nCARRIE No. There's more. I don't know... (hesitating; then) ...it's like being on Mars. \nCOLLINS You'll never forget it. \nCARRIE I think you're right. \nAnd then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly. \nCARRIE Thank you. \nCOLLINS Have a lovely time, Carrie. \nTOMMY (o.s.) Hey, what's going on here? \nThere is Tommy, looking \"stern.\" \nTOMMY (to Collins) What are you doing with my date? \nCOLLINS Girl secrets. \nA smile at Carrie, and she goes off. \nTOMMY Don't let me catch you hugging any guys. \nCARRIE You won't. \nTOMMY Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early? \nCARRIE I promised. \nTOMMY Okay. I understand. \nCARRIE I'm sorry. \nTOMMY No, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom \u00ad \nCARRIE (breaking in) That's okay. \nTOMMY What is? \nCARRIE You want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything... \nTOMMY Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier? \nCARRIE (surprised; she'd love to) I've never been there. \nTOMMY Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great! (he means it) Then it's settled. \nHe takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor. \nCARRIE (holding back) Tommy... \nTOMMY C'mon... \nCARRIE I don't... I can't... I... \nTOMMY You can. \nHe has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man of considerable confidence \u00ad the best part of his popularity \u00ad and it's a contagious trait. Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her freedom. \n190 A CORNER OF THE GYM \nTommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward, about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is immediately embarrassed. \nTOMMY Hey... \nCARRIE I'm sorry. \nTOMMY I... \nCARRIE It's just... \nTOMMY No harm, no foul. \nThey stand there for a couple of seconds. \nAnd suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A bird peck. \nAnd again they stand there, until: \nCARRIE I don't know... anything. I can't dance... \nPeering out farther to get a good look. Unseen at first by her, there's a cord on the edge of the FRAME. \n216 MORTON \nBlocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the wings. So he takes the long way around \u00ad back behind the stage... \n217 TOMMY AND CARRIE \nDollying as they're led down the center aisle; past a blur of smiling faces, the APPLAUSE SWELLING. They're being led toward the stage area \u00ad the thrones waiting for them. The lights get brighter; the MUSIC gets louder. \n218 THE BANDSTAND \nAs they pass by. The Beak winds conspiratorially at Carrie. \n219 THE STAGE \nas Tommy gives Carrie his hand, helping her up the steps, over tangles of black power cables. \n220 BENEATH THE STAGE \nWhere we finally reveal just where Chris and Billy have been hiding all this time. Chris listens to the footsteps (of Carrie and Tommy) coming overhead; grasping the cord that Billy has hooked up, holding it very tightly... \n221 CARRIE AND TOMMY \nas they're helped into the massive thrones; behind them is the huge mural of stars and ships. \n222 ERNEST \nthe showman now, P.T. Barnum in all of his expansiveness. \n223 SUE \nIn the wings, watching this action. In the corner of the FRAME, the cord we glimpsed earlier \u00ad the same one which Chris clutched beneath the stage \u00ad jiggles, and Sue notices it move. She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it goes up to: \n224 A BANK OF LIGHTS \nConcealing a single silver bucket; meanwhile: \n225 CARRIE \nStaring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing \u00ad so hot and bright that it's impossible to see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder. \n226 ANOTHER ANGLE \u00ad CARRIE \nas a piece of crepe paper lands in her hair... \n227 THE STUDENTS \nA sea of faces, the spectrum of reactions. \n228 ERNEST \nspreading his arms; a politician. \nERNEST Ladies and gentlemen, I give you he King and Queen of the Spring Prom \u00ad TOMMY ROSS AND CARRIE WHITE! \nThe Band starts playing the school SONG, and we... \nCUT TO: \n229 SUE IN THE WINGS \nThe implications of the cord and bucket positioned over the throne just starting to dawn on her as everyone begins singing the school song: \nALL (o.s.) All rise for the John F. Kennedy Hiyyyyh... \nAnd a hand comes into FRAME, clutching Sue's wrist. It belongs to: \nMORTON What're you doing here, young lady? \nSUE (trying to head for cord under stage) Something's wrong! \nALL (o.s.) We'll raise your banner to the skyyyyh... \nBut Morton has no interest in what Sue is trying to tell him: \nMORTON I'll say there is. \n230 ANOTHER ANGLE \u00ad CARRIE'S POV \nFrom the throne, she sees Sue \u00ad and Morton and he pulls her toward the back exit. \n231 BENEATH STAGE \nChris is almost hyperventilating as the school song continues. \nBILLY What's the matter with you? Pull it! \nChris is frozen \u00ad immobilized, terrified. \n232 CARRIE'S POV \u00ad SUE \nAs Morton firmly pushes Sue out the rear gym door. The door shuts, and as it closes: \n233 CARRIE \nConfused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise... \nThrough the harsh glare of the lights \u00ad laughing, pointing (see Norma Watson), doubling up in hysteria, utterly out of control. \n256 FACES, FACES, FACES \nLaughing... \n256A BILLY AND CHRIS \nreacting to their \"success.\" \n257 CARRIE \nPutting her hands to her blood-covered face, slowly getting to her feet. \n258 THE STAGE \nAs Carrie makes her way to the stairs, tripping over the black power cords. A horrified Collins is on her way up the stairs. \nCOLLINS Oh, Carrie \u00ad let me help you. \nCarrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher. But it's too late for help, and in the fastest flex we've seen to date, she jerks her head and Collins bounces backward \u00ad down the stairs, slamming into a wall. \n259 THE STUDENTS \nLaughing harder now, unable to stop. \n260 THE GYM \u00ad ANOTHER ANGLE \nWhere all is pandemonium. \nMorton makes his way to Collins, giving her his handkerchief; she has a bloody nose. \nCOLLINS (to Morton) Call the police! \n261 CARRIE \nTears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her tormentors. \n262 THE GYM \u00ad YET ANOTHER ANGLE \nHelen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to throw up or go into shock. \nGeorge Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of Tommy Ross, examining him. \nGEORGE Call a doctor! Hey, call a doctor, quick! \nHe tries to pick Tommy up, and in the process the throne topples over on the stage. \n263 INT. HALL CORRIDORS \u00ad SUE \nFrantic, rushing back into the school and down the hall toward the prom doors. \n264 CARRIE \nTakes a deep breath, mustering her energy. She closes her eyes and sees: \n265 THE GYM DOORS \u00ad THREE SETS OF DOUBLE DOORS \nAll of them open, a few students milling around them as... \n266 CARRIE \nCloses her eyes even tighter and flexes. And \u00ad in SWISH PANS: \n267 THE DOORS \nslam shut. In the process, several things are accomplished at once. The prom-goers are trapped inside, and one or two of them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they close, screaming with surprise and pain. \n268 INT. HALL \u00ad SUE \nwho once again was just a little late, arriving just as the DOORS SLAMMED SHUT; she sees the screaming prom-goers unlucky enough to have been caught in the doors. \n269 INT. GYM \nUtter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors. \n270 THE BEAK \nNear the bandstand area, looking up at the stage and realizing that it's Carrie who's responsible for closing the doors. \nTHE BEAK It's Carrie! It's Carrie! \nFromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the microphone, to stop the panic. \nThe kids continue rushing toward the closed doors. \n271 CARRIE \nA small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and never forget her. \n272 CARRIE'S POV \u00ad GYM WALL \nBetween two sets of double-doors, FEATURING a huge firehouse installed in case of an emergency. \n273 CARRIE \nSeeing the hose, getting the idea... NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here. \n297 THE LIGHTING BAR \n298 CARRIE \nShe flexes. \n299 CEILING POV \nCollins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar. We see the flaming cyc on the stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS \u00ad just short of Collins' head \u00ad as far as its wires carry it. \n300 CARRIE \nWatching all this \u00ad a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerging from deep within her. \nAnother flex. \n301 THE LIGHT BAR \nstarts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth \u00ad it hits the ceiling, igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling. \n302 BENEATH THE STAGE \u00ad CHRIS AND BILLY \nseeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar. \nThe back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as: \n303 CARRIE \nSpots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late. They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do. \n304 THE GYM \u00ad FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR \nAs it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her green chiffon dress back into a wall. \nHelen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical. \nStudents have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape. \nMorton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN. \n305 CARRIE \nAs she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered... that Billy and Chris did it. \n306 THE STUDENTS \nMoving aside as Carrie walks through them \u00ad an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces. \n307 WIDE SHOT \u00ad THE GYM \nAs Carrie makes it to one set of double doors, flexes them open, and exits. \n308 EXT. GYM \u00ad HALLWAY \nAs Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut. Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of fire collapse behind her. \nShe passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically. And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this inferno of fire to find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS... and BLOWS. It overlaps onto: \nDISSOLVE TO: \n309 EXT. TOWN STREETS \u00ad NIGHT \nCarrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down a hill, and then, from: \n310 ANOTHER ANGLE \u00ad THE HILL \u00ad NIGHT \nas a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of nowhere, Billy's Chevy \u00ad it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her. \n311 CARRIE \nTurns around and sees it coming toward her. \n312 INT. THE CHEVY \nChris screaming \"Get her! Get her!\" at the top of her lungs, Billy grinning madly behind the wheel. \n313 CARRIE \nAs the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back and forth, her arms thrown out. \n314 THE CHEVY \nAlmost right on top of her... \n315 CARRIE \nFlexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her. It just misses her. \n316 INT. THE CHEVY \nBilly is livid, turning around to see Carrie in the back window. \nBILLY Goddamnit! \nCHRIS Billy!!! \nBILLY Shut up! Just shut up! \nComing toward her. \n329 CARRIE \nShe flings out her arms and cries out: \nCARRIE Oh, Momma! \nAnd throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach. \nBriefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand. \nThen Carrie tumbles down the stairs. \n330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRS \nOn Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs. \n331 MARGARET \nCarrying the knife, she stares down the stairs. \nMARGARET It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.' \n332 CARRIE \nDazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs. \nMARGARET And now the devil has come home. \nCARRIE (whimpering) Momma, it's not right. \nCarrie starts crawling to the kitchen. \n333 INT. KITCHEN \u00ad NIGHT \nCarrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while. \nCarrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut. \nMargaret is coming toward the kitchen. \nCarrie flexes again \u00ad to hold the door shut. \nBut it's no use \u00ad Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her. \nMARGARET I should have killed you when you were born. \nCARRIE Momma, I love you. Please help me! \nMARGARET Sin never dies. \nThere's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork \u00ad dangling from a hook on the way \u00ad suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret. \nMargaret collapses. \nCarrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother. \nAnd then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams. \nCARRIE You. You tricked me. \nSUE No. \nCARRIE Get out. \nSUE We were just trying to... \nCARRIE Get out. \nAnd then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A stone. \nThen another. \nThen a third. \nCARRIE Get out! Get out! \nThe stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail. \nSue is rooted to the spot, terrified. \nCARRIE Get out, get out, get out! \nThe stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of them break through the roof, rattle on the floor below. \nCARRIE GET OUT! \nA stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen. \nCarrie flexes. \nAnd Sue stumbles backwards toward the door. \nFlex. \nSue is whipped around, as though by a great wind. \n", "test1_input": "Shrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie. Another. The girls are bombarding her with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on the wall.

She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! The sound is louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't). \nAnd there is sudden silence. \nCOLLINS (to girls) Get out! Get out! \nThe girls retreat, Sue last. \nSUE It must be her first... \nCOLLINS Out! \nAs the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. Collins slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger. \nCARRIE M... M... Miss Collins... \nCOLLINS Stand up. Take care of yourself. \nCARRIE I'm bleeding. \nOne blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody handprint. \nCOLLINS Damn you! \nShe hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser. \nCOLLINS Get over there! And take one! \nCARRIE \nI don't know... \nCOLLINS Never mind the coin slot... It's broken. \nCARRIE It hurts... my stomach... \nCOLLINS (grabbing her) Do it! Now. \nCARRIE I can't. I don't know how! \nThere's a bright flash as a light BULB POIPS, fizzling out. Collins is surprised. \nCOLLINS What...? \nAnd she looks at Carrie. Her anger seems to seep away.

As for the girls \u00ad \nCOLLINS Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they... \nMORTON You'll have to do something. \nCOLLINS I will. But I understood how those girls felt.

Carrie stands in the doorway. \nMORTON Come in, Cassie. \nCollins starts to correct him, but: \nMORTON Close the door. No, wait. (up) Miss Finch, bring in a dismissal slip. (to Carrie) I think you might take the rest of the day and go home and, uh, well... take care of yourself, Cassie. \nCARRIE (hardly a murmur) Carrie. \nMORTON We're all sorry about this incident. \nMISS FINCH, elderly, spinsterish, goggles in with the yellow dismissal slip, brings it to Morton who initials it. \nMORTON (to Finch, as she goes) Thank you.

And Carrie, you're excused from gym for a week. Take study hall instead. \nMorton picks up the dismissal slip, hands it to Carrie. \nMORTON We are sorry about this, Cassie. \nCARRIE (sudden fury) That's not my name! \nTwo things happen simultaneously; Morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little and then tumbles from the desk. \nThen Carrie goes out. \nMorton comes around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, stares at it curiously for a moment, then looks at Collins. \nCOLLINS (slowly) That reminds me. A light blew out while I was trying to calm her down. \nMORTON I'll send a janitor to fix it. \nOkay, that's reality.

She realizes it and heads for the door leading to the locker room, and this time, Collins doesn't even try to stop her. At the door: \nCHRIS This isn't over. This isn't over by a long shot. \nThe door slams shut, leaving the girls and Collins frozen by Chris's outburst. The BELL gives a shrill RING, and we: \nCUT TO: \n128 INT. THE CAVALIER \u00ad AFTERNOON \nThe local after-school hangout. Clusters of students milling in and around booths. Pinball machines, a jukebox thumping \"NO WHERE TO RUN\" by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. \nSue is sitting, reading, alone in one of the booths as Chris enters, says hello to some of her clique, and spots her. \nCHRIS Hey, Sue! Just who I've been looking for! \nSue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile. Chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her John F. Kennedy school yearbook across the table \u00ad an action which Sue involuntarily jerks away from out of nervousness. \nCHRIS (continuing) I wanted you to sign my yearbook. Hey, where's you old man, did he stand you up? \nSUE (busying herself with the yearbook) Still at practice \nCHRIS Well, I guess you've heard I'm out of the prom. I bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though. Daddy's suing them. Hey, Billee! Billee! Come over and say hi to Sue. \nSue slides the yearbook back across the table to Chris, who examines it: \nCHRIS (continuing) Hey, is that it? Just Sue Snell? \nBilly goons INTO FRAME next to Chris, glomming his arm around her neck. \nBILLY Hey, Suze. \nCHRIS I think we're going anyway, right, Billee? \nBILLY Sure thing, Charlie. \nChris playfully jabs him in the ribs. \nSUE You mean crash? \nCHRIS Sure, why not? Hey, listen, I've got a good one. \"Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but Carrie White eats shit.\" \nBilly, goon that he is, cracks up. \nSue finds it not at all funny, but doesn't know exactly what to do about what she's feeling. \nSUE Chris, I've got to go. \n", "test2_true": "CHRIS (oblivious, her laughter turning to fury) That goddamn Carrie!

Why do you hate her so much? \nCHRIS Hey, hey... tell me if I'm wrong, but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us? \nSUE Me. (it comes out a pinched nerve) Me. But I stopped. \nCHRIS (dawning on her; getting it finally) Oh. Oh, aren't you just it? Oh, my, yes. (imitating; prissy) You stopped. Hey, Billee, she stopped. \nSue is scared now \u00ad she hears it coming. There's no question about it, though; the rumbles have already begun, and there's no stopping what's coming. \nCHRIS (continuing) God, I'm dumb sometimes. Billee, hey, Billee, do you want to know why Suze here didn't walk out? \nBilly's over by the pinball machines with some of his goon squad.

You stopped, remember? So just stop again. (uglier) Why didn't you walk out? Why didn't you walk out, Sue? \nSUE Okay, Chris. That's enough. \nCHRIS You didn't walk out, Sue... little Suze... little Suzy Creamcheese... because you didn't want to miss a moment of your precious prom. \nBulls-eye. Sue fights back the tears and fury, trembling now. But she tries to muster up some dignity. \nSUE And you don't? \nCHRIS (not about to be put off) You're goddamn right, I don't. But we're on your case now. (beat) I'll bet you've got your dress all picked out, too. What color is it? Yellowguts? \nShe's about to break, holding it in as best she can.

(dismissively) See you around, Sue. \nAnd that's it \u00ad shut up, shut down, shut out. \nSue turns and starts to walk out of the Cavalier.

What? \nThe sound is muffled, and we don't hear what she says. But we do hear: \nTOMMY (continuing; exploding) Are you out of your mind? \nCUT TO: \n132 EXT.

THE CHEVY \nwhich belongs to the aforementioned BILLY NOLAN \u00ad a character whose life and brains stopped around the time he saw \"Rebel\" on television. He's Chris's boyfriend, and a huge cross swings around his neck. Right now, he's utterly amused by his harrowing driving, and turns to Chris who ignores him, still brooding over her afternoon losses. Billy takes a huge toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself applying makeup in the visor window. So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some banter with a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light. The light changes, and Billy peels out \u00ad an action with throws Chris backwards onto the seat. \nCHRIS Goddamnit, Billy! \nHe just laughs as he weaves through traffic. \nCHRIS (continuing) Slow down!

Then he overcomes it, and scrawls their names on the slip of paper, folding it. \nTOMMY For you. \nHe hands it to Norma Watson, and it's off \u00ad spirited away, gone. \nTOMMY Tonight you go first-class. \nCarrie stares at the receding figure of Norma as if she were the messenger of doom. \nCUT TO: \n209 INT.

The crowd WHOOOOS. 
Angst flickers on Andy's sweaty face.  He stammers. 
ANDY T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- 
LAWLER You're a wimp. 
ANDY (upset) My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! 
LAWLER Then your father's a wimp. 
ANDY (losing it) And you're just poor white trash! 
Lawler's had enough.  Enraged, he wildly stands and SLAPS Andy. 
BAM! 
Andy crashes over and falls from his chair. 
THUD.  He's on the floor. 
Dead silence.  Everyone is astonished. 
They're all slack-jawed.  Even PAUL SHAFFER.  Trying to cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a ROCKABILLY TUNE. 
Andy jumps up, crazed. 
ANDY (cont'd) I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT! 
Lawler freezes in his seat.  Letterman hides behind his desk. 
Andy storms over, out-of-control.  From a safe distance, he starts SCREAMING at Lawler. 
ANDY (cont'd) YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE! (he POUNDS the desk) FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU FOR THIS!!! 
Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out. 
LETTERMAN You said some pretty inflammatory things. 
LAWLER He thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not. (to Andy) Did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital??

Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out. 
The crowd CHEERS rowdily. 
An unsure moment.  Dave glances at Lawler. 
Until, Andy stumbles back in.  He tries to calm himself. 
ANDY (cont'd) I am sorry.  I am sorry to use those words on television.  I apologize! I'm sorry! (demented) But YOU -- you're a MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE!!!! 
Andy slams Dave's desk.  Dave jerks nervously. 
Crazed, Andy looks down at Dave's coffee cup.  Uh-oh. Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and DUMPS it on Lawler! 
Lawler jumps, burned.  A SECURITY GUARD runs in. 
Andy screams and hurtles away.  He slams open the stage door and barrels out of sight.

JEALOUS 
Five p.m. A Clinton transient hotel. 
Inside hotel room, LETOUR meets with JEALOUS, a twenty-five- year-old drug intermediary in leather jacket. JOHN counts hundred-dollar bills, hands them to JEALOUS. 
JEALOUS Are they "faced"? 
LETOUR Don't bore me. 
JEALOUS rearranges the hundreds: 
JEALOUS Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to. It's time -- my time -- 
LETOUR (overlap) Jees -- 
JEALOUS We've been through all this. (LETOUR shrugs) This nineteen-gram shit is a drag. 
LETOUR We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety. 
JEALOUS I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. She's something. 
LETOUR Never made any big money either. 
JEALOUS Sure. 
LETOUR She blows it. 
JEALOUS You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her? 
LETOUR She always says that. We'll see, Jealous. 
JEALOUS She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you. 
LETOUR No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording. 
JEALOUS Yeah. 
LETOUR reaches for the door. 
JEALOUS Tour. 
LETOUR What? 
JEALOUS Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled. 
LETOUR Why? 
JEALOUS You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her? 
LETOUR (shrugs) I look like an encyclopedia? Who knows? (opens door) Thanks for the warning.

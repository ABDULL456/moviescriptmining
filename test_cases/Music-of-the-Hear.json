{"train": "MUSIC OF THE HEART \nWritten by \nPamela Gray \nSHOOTING DRAFT January 25, 1999 \nFADE IN: \nCREDITS OVER PHOTOS IN AN ALBUM \nThe photos include a sepia-tone portrait of an Italian immigrant family... a b&w snapshot of ROBERTA, a nine-year- old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)... \n...Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a wooden music stand... a b&w snapshot of Roberta in a communion dress... Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same refrigerator, eyes on the music stand... \n...a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a sandcastle on a beach... a color photo of a groom in a white naval uniform and his pretty bride, (Roberta at 25), her hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword... \n...a color photo of Roberta and her husband Greek dancing with another couple at an outdoor taverna. Roberta's husband and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile... \nHOLD ON THIS LAST PHOTO as we now see the ALBUM open on the floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed. We are: \nINT. GUASPARI HOUSEHOLD, ROME, N. Y. - BEDROOM - DAY (1988) \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Wake up, Roberta! \nWe hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small, darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through Venetian blinds. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Come on, Bert -- get out of bed! \nThe CAMERA finds a WOMAN lying face down on a twin bed, thick wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Please, Bert -- you need to get out of that bed. \nThe KNOCKING continues, and she puts the pillow over the top of her head. \nEND CREDITS \nINT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY \nThe WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo -- it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young boys' voices. \nBOY'S VOICE (O.S.) Can you come out now, Mommy? Please? \nShe puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into pieces. \nBOY #2 (O.S.) Mommy, Nick broke my crayon! \nBOY #1 (O.S.) Well, Lexi hit me and he almost broke... he almost broke my ear! \nO.S. arguing \"I DID NOT!\" \"YES YOU DID!\" \"LIAR!\" etc. As if that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hear that? Your boys need you. \nEXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY \nASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian- American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street. \nASSUNTA But I have no room for this! \nOFFICER I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to deliver these. \nAssunta looks beyond the man, dismayed. \nHER POV \nLarge wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole lot more. \nBACK TO SCENE \nInstantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than we've seen her so far. \nROBERTA Watch it, you idiots! Be careful with those! \nThe men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the violins, then up at Roberta. \nASSUNTA Why so many? \nRoberta disappears inside and slams the window shut. \nINT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb over the boxes as if they were giant blocks. \nNICK (calling) Mommy, which box has our toys? \nINT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in the same ratty nightgown. \nROBERTA Look, I know he's there, so quit lying to me!... Then check under Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden... Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras that his wife called and -- \nA beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a french fry. \nROBERTA God, these are cold. \nBRIAN So you're just gonna wrap presents and wait for him to come back? \nROBERTA You sound like my mother. \nBRIAN That's not very sexy. \nROBERTA Are you trying to be sexy or be my friend? \nBRIAN A little of both. \nRoberta smiles, blushing a bit. Brian looks at her, getting an idea. \nBRIAN You know, I know this really cool lady who runs this elementary school -- I wrote a piece on her. It's a public school, but it's alternative -- she might be able to create some kind of gig for you. Let me give her a call. \nROBERTA Great! \nBRIAN (takes his last bite of sandwich) If she hires you, though, you have to be willing to relocate. \nROBERTA Where is it? \nEXT. SPANISH HARLEM, NEW YORK CITY - TRAVELLING SHOT - DAY \nA SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio. Roberta looks scared shitless. \nSuddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street, dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes, jerking Roberta forward. \nTAXI DRIVER Welcome to East Harlem. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK EAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (CPE 1) - EAST HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nINT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY \nJANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume. A sign on her desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and son (12). Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her. \nJANET (looking at resume) Aside from half a term in a private school -- in Greece -- and a year teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten years ago -- it doesn't look like you've had any other teaching experience. \nROBERTA Well, not traditional teaching experience. I've been doing private lessons... \nJanet looks for this on the resume. \nROBERTA It's not on there... I taught my sons. \nJanet smiles politely. \nJANET I'd like to help you, Mrs. Demetras. Brian spoke highly of you and I told him I'd consider starting a violin class... But without the proper qualifications, and without any experience in an inner city school... \nRoberta nods, defeated. \nJANET I'm very sorry. \nINT. CPE 1 - HALLWAY - DAY \nRoberta stands outside Janet's office, dejectedly watching the children noisily running through the hall. \nINT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY \nRoberta knocks on Janet's door. \nJANET (O.S.) Yes? \nAs Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a large scheduling chart. \nROBERTA I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi... \nThey enter. \nINT. JANET'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nJanet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a little off. Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis. \nROBERTA Roberta Guaspari-Demetras. \nDennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily. \nJANET This is Dennis Rausch, our music teacher and program coordinator. (beat) Mrs. Demetras, didn't I make things clear yesterday? \nROBERTA If I could just show you something -- it'll only take a minute. \nBefore Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis exchange a look. \nDENNIS Are we having a talent show? I should have brought my tap shoes. \nRoberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. Dennis watches impassively. \nRoberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and Dennis joins in to be polite. The three take bows. A beat. \nThe bongo player stands. \nROBERTA You will be the first student who will NOT be in my violin class. Out! \nThe child looks stunned. \nROBERTA I said OUT! \nWith a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control. \nROBERTA Who else would like to be kicked out of my class? \nThe students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a small but tough Black boy, raises his hand. \nROBERTA Are you raising your hand because you want to be kicked out? \nDE SEAN Yeah. \nROBERTA Why? \nDE SEAN I don't wanna learn no stupid violin. It's for wimps. \nROBERTA Who told you that? \nDE SEAN I just know. \nROBERTA What's your name? \nBOY De Sean. \nROBERTA Well, De Sean -- you haven't given me a good enough reason, so you're staying. \nShe looks around the room. \nROBERTA Anyone else? \nSilence. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER \nIn front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles. \nNAEEM Hey, I play pretty good. \nRoberta laughs. \nROBERTA (to Naeem) See how easy it is? (to the class) Maybe in the spring, we could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school. (to the boy) What's your name? \nNAEEM Naeem. \nRoberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring for violin sizes. \nROBERTA (to class) If you listen to me and do exactly what I say, you're gonna sound beautiful at the concert and you're gonna be so proud of yourselves. (to Naeem) Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying soft. (to the class) But if you don't listen to me, you'll sound so bad that your own parents will feel sick when they hear you. They might even throw up. \nON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that. \nINT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door. \nROBERTA (O.S.) Come in. \nINT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nRoberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters. \nROBERTA (referring to champagne) What's this? \nBRIAN It's a toast. (giving her a glass, holding his up) To Roberta, who's made it through her first week. \nThey clink glasses and drink. \nROBERTA I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on by a thread there. Out of fifty kids, maybe six are listening to me. \nBRIAN Look at the progress. Didn't you say no one was listening to you on Monday? \nRoberta laughs. \nROBERTA I really appreciate all you've done for us. And I promise -- this weekend I'll start looking for a place. \nBRIAN There's no rush. \nROBERTA No, we've put you out enough. You're supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us. (crosses to his desk, flips through his Vietnam book) I've started your book. It's very powerful. \nBRIAN Thank you. \nBrian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck. Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening. \nROBERTA So what made you choose migrant workers for your next book? I mean, how do you know what to write about? \nBRIAN (kissing her neck) I follow my gut, pay attention to what I'm being drawn to... \nROBERTA How long will you be gone? \nBRIAN Two, three months. \nROBERTA What? \nINT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY \nBrian throws toiletries into a plastic bag. Roberta enters. \nROBERTA I thought... I just thought you were gonna be around. And then last night -- \nHe stops what he's doing and looks at her. \nBRIAN Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great but did you think I was gonna marry you in the morning? \nROBERTA No! Of course not. \nWe see in her face that part of her did think that. \nROBERTA It's just that... we just got here and we're barely... I don't even know where to buy groceries. \nBrian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her in his arms. \nBRIAN You're gonna be fine. You have a job, a place to stay, your kids have a school to go to -- and there's a D'Agostino's around the corner. \nShe attempts a smile. \nROBERTA Congratulations. \nHe kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nRoberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids -- third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow for Roberta's first year] \nROBERTA And what am I doing now? \nNAEEM/GUADALUPE Rosining the bow. \nROBERTA Good. And what am I doing when I turn this little screw? (raising her voice) Everyone stop talking. Right now! \nThe kids quiet down. Only Naeem raises his hand. \nROBERTA Naeem? \nNAEEM Tightening the horse hair. \nROBERTA (touches the heel of the bow) And what do we call this? \nAgain, only Naeem raises his hand. Roberta sees him but turns to DE SEAN, who's talking to his neighbor. \nROBERTA De Sean? \nDE SEAN Yeah? \nROBERTA What do we call this? \nDE SEAN I don't know. \nROBERTA Why not? \nDE SEAN I wasn't here. \nROBERTA Yes you were but you weren't paying attention! Do you want people to think you're stupid? \nThis makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off. \nROBERTA All right, Naeem -- tell them. \nNAEEM It's called the frog. \nSome kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the scroll of the violin. \nROBERTA Anyone remember what this is? \nLUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers. \nROBERTA Lucy! Do you like people snapping their fingers when you're talking? \nLUCY Yeah! \nThe kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll. \nROBERTA What is this called? \nLUCY The jeri curl? \nRoberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough. \nINT. DENNIS' MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY \nROBERTA See how I pushed you? It means your feet aren't centered. \nGuadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys. \nROBERTA Can you bring over a chair? (to Guadalupe) It's probably better for you to sit. \nThe boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed. \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY \nRoberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him. \nROBERTA Where were you today, Naeem? \nNAEEM I can't be in violin class anymore. \nROBERTA Why not? \nNAEEM My mother won't let me. \nROBERTA What? \nNAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of African fabric. \nMRS. ADISA My son's got more important things to do than learn dead white men's music. \nROBERTA They're gonna learn \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"! \nMRS. ADISA How many Black classical composers can you name? How many Black classical violinists do you know? \nROBERTA That doesn't mean it's the way it should be. Naeem's learning to play music -- and that makes him feel good about himself. Why should it matter who wrote it? \nNAEEM Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class? \nMrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then addresses Roberta. \nMRS. ADISA Look. I've seen this before. You white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place. No thank you. \nShe walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them. \nINT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back: Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the book down and dials the phone. \nROBERTA Brian Turner's room, please. \nWhile she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures. \nINSERT - PICTURES \nCharles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were 3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them. \nBACK TO ROBERTA \nShe's really depressed herself now. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS waiting in THE HALL. \nALICE And which ocean is this? \nKids simultaneously yell out \"ATLANTIC\" and \"PACIFIC.\" \nROBERTA Excuse me... I'm here for the violin students. \nALICE (icy) You're late. \nROBERTA Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry. \nALICE They're having a lesson now. \nROBERTA But this is when they have violin class! \nALICE That's not my problem. \nRoberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits. \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY \nLots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess. Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up. \nROBERTA I thought all the teachers agreed to this. \nJANET In theory. (to a student) Adam! I want you in my office right after lunch, you understand? \nADAM What'd I do? \nJANET Think about it! (to Roberta) Whenever you pull kids out, it's a disruption, plus it's extra work for the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed. Some teachers resent it. \nROBERTA Well, can't you talk to them? \nROBERTA I never said that. \nBRIAN No? Maybe not with words. \nThis embarrasses her, then pisses her off. \nROBERTA You know what? I shouldn't have called you. This was a mistake. \nBRIAN No, no -- I'm sorry. Look, I know it hurts, but you're gonna get through this, Roberta -- you will. \nROBERTA I'm moving back to my Mom's. \nBRIAN What? You're gonna quit teaching in the middle of the term? \nROBERTA I don't fit in there -- I'm not making any progress with the kids... \nBRIAN What are you gonna tell Janet -- your husband left you and nothing else matters? \nROBERTA I don't know yet. \nINT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoberta lies awake on the futon, heartbroken. \nINT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRoberta stands and watches Nick and Lexi sleep. She lies down beside them and closes her eyes. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nRoberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY- DOLLAR BILL. Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to speak. \nBOY My mother gave it to me. \nJANET Why would she give you fifty dollars? \nBOY To buy breakfast. \nJanet gives him a stern look. \nJANET Do you know how hard your mother works? Do you think it's right for you steal from her? \nBOY I didn't! \nJANET Well let's go call her right now and ask her. \nAs Janet turns to walk off, Roberta crosses to her. \nROBERTA I need to speak to you. It's important. \nJANET It'll have to wait. (to the boy) Come on. In my office. \nRoberta watches as Janet dashes off with the boy in tow. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nGuadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to set up her violin. Roberta enters, surprised to see her. \nROBERTA Guadalupe? What are you doing here? \nGUADALUPE I can't get the stop sign. \nROBERTA Honey, your teacher's probably looking for you. \nGuadalupe sighs, then hands Roberta the violin. \nGUADALUPE I can't come anymore. It's too hard. \nROBERTA The violin is hard for everyone. \nGUADALUPE But everyone else is better than me. I'll always be slow. \nRoberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case. \nROBERTA Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman? \nGUADALUPE No. \nROBERTA He's one of the greatest violinists in the world, and he has problems with his legs too. He walks with two canes -- but he still makes the most beautiful music. \nGUADALUPE And he sits down when he plays? \nROBERTA He has to. \nGuadalupe takes this in. \nGUADALUPE He was your student? \nRoberta laughs. \nROBERTA No. But if he was, I'd tell him the same thing I'm telling you. You shouldn't quit something just because it's hard. \nNICK And the octopuses. \nRoberta smiles and puts her arm around him. \nNICK Is Daddy coming here soon? \nRoberta tenses up. \nROBERTA Well, that's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. Daddy's not gonna live with us anymore. You and Lexi will have special times when you stay with him, like at Christmas. \nA beat. \nNICK Can you tell the birthday story? \nRoberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news. \nROBERTA Don't you want to talk about what I told you? \nNICK I want to hear the birthday story. \nA beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then: \nROBERTA It was the day of Grandpa's birthday, and I was sad because he had died a few months back. \nNICK But you knew I'd be born that day. \nROBERTA So I packed a bag and got all ready -- \nNICK And Daddy laughed. \nROBERTA I said, \"It's my father's birthday, and the baby's gonna be born today.\" \nNICK He didn't believe you. But I was born. The same day as Grandpa. \nROBERTA It was a happy day. \nNICK Was Daddy happy too? \nShe looks at him, taken aback by the question. \nROBERTA Of course he was. \nNICK Then why is he leaving me? \nRoberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer. \nROBERTA He's not leaving you, Nick. He loves you and Lexi very much. \nNICK Then why can't he live here? \nROBERTA (struggling) It's very hard to explain... Sometimes things happen between grown-ups... and they just can't be together. \nThe CAMERA moves behind them as they continue to look out the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nThe kids play \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" and they sound awful. Roberta looks disgusted as she leads them. \nROBERTA Slow bows! Slow bows! Don't squeeze! Stop! Everybody stop! (to De Sean) How much did you practice this week? \nDE SEAN My asthma -- it was very bad and I had to go to the hospital. \nROBERTA Again? You told me you went to the hospital last week. \nDE SEAN Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week. \nRoberta rolls her eyes, then turns to Lucy. \nROBERTA Lucy -- you sounded the worst of all. Have you practiced? \nLUCY No. \nROBERTA Why not? You can't be in this class if you don't practice! \nLUCY My grandma got mugged. \nA beat. \nROBERTA Oh. I'm sorry. Is she O.K.? \nLUCY She died. \nRoberta stands there, sobered. \nROBERTA I'm really sorry, Lucy. (tries to get her bearings) Just do the best you can. \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY \nA group of kids stand together with their violins and chat. Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them. \nNAEEM Hi, Roberta. \nMRS. LAMB You're shouting at them. All the time. \nROBERTA Not all the time. But if they don't listen -- \nMRS. LAMB Didn't you tell them that they were making their parents sick? \nJanet raises her eyebrows at this. \nROBERTA That wasn't exactly what I said -- \nMRS. LAMB I'm raising Becky in a supportive atmosphere. I don't send her to school to be abused. \nROBERTA I'm just trying to discipline them. If they're gonna learn an instrument, they need to take it seriously -- \nJANET I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to say, Roberta, is that you're a little too harsh. I'm sure you might be able to soften some of your comments to the children? \nShe gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nRoberta listens to the students play \"Go Tell Aunt Rhody\" -- badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response. \nROBERTA Well, that was... that was pretty good... that wasn't too bad... \nThey look at her in disbelief, then look at each other. \nDE SEAN It wasn't? I thought we stunk. \nROBERTA I wouldn't put it that way... You all just need to practice a bit more. (to James) James, have you practiced this week? \nThe boy nervously shakes his head no. \nROBERTA Can you please try a little harder for next week? \nJames nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness. \nROBERTA Good. Just do the best you can. \nDE SEAN Why you acting like that? \nROBERTA Like what? \nDE SEAN Nice. \nROBERTA Don't you want a nice teacher? \nDE SEAN I already got nice teachers. You added some variety. \nLUCY Yeah. We like you better the way you used to be. \nROBERTA Oh. (to Becky) What about you, Becky? \nBECKY Yeah. This is even worse. You're acting weird now. \nA beat. \nROBERTA Well, then -- I take it back. You all stunk. \nThe kids laugh. \nROBERTA But don't tell your parents I said so! \nThe kids laugh again. \nINT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATE - DAY \nChristmas MUZAK plays in the b.g. as Roberta kisses and hugs Lexi and Nick goodbye. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands nearby. \nLEXI Can't you come with us? Please? \nROBERTA Honey, I told you. This is Daddy's special time with you. \nLexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT I'll take good care of them. \nThe FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from sight. She observes all the families travelling together, and feels like the loneliest person in the airport. \nINT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. \nShe crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR. \nRoberta gets up and warily approaches the door. \nROBERTA Who is it? \nBRIAN (O.S.) Santa Claus. \nShe looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile. \nShe starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: \"Come on, Roberta!\" \"Roberta, get back here!\" She smiles. \nROBERTA Well, O.K. But you have to promise you'll all start together. \nShe nods. They begin again -- all at different times. \nDE SEAN Man. We'll never get that right. \nROBERTA That's not a very nice thing to say about your classmates. (to class) How many people think they can get it right by the concert? \nAll the kids raise their hands. De Sean looks around, embarrassed, then raises his too. Roberta smiles. \nINT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBrian and Roberta finish making love on the futon. They lie in each other's arms, still breathing heavily. \nROBERTA I love you. \nBrian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing. \nROBERTA Did you just laugh? \nBRIAN I'm sorry. It's just... \nRoberta looks at him, offended. \nROBERTA What? \nBRIAN Why do people feel like the minute something's going great, they gotta name it? (beat) Once you name something, you snuff the life out of it. \nShe disentangles from him. \nROBERTA Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away with that crap? It's not the Sixties anymore. \nBRIAN Well, maybe if you'd actually gone through the Sixties, you'd know what I'm talking about. \nROBERTA Fine! We won't name it, we won't talk about it, we'll act like we have no feelings for each other whatsoever! \nShe angrily turns on her side with her back to him. Brian regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder. \nBRIAN I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole. (sweetly teasing) You can say you love me if you want. \nROBERTA Forget it. I changed my mind. \nHe laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY \nERNIE (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall. Roberta approaches. \nROBERTA How's it coming, Ernie? \nERNIE Well, if I could just remember what I did here yesterday, I'd be moving a whole lot faster. (beat) You look real pretty today, honey. \nBrian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside. \nBRIAN You're crazy. Why did you hire him? \nROBERTA He needed a job. Besides, he's wired all of East Harlem. \nBRIAN When? Fifty years ago? \nBrian sighs and walks off into another room. Two MEN carry in large panels of sheetrock with old WALLPAPER on it. \nROBERTA Why is there wallpaper on it? \nMAN #1 That's how it comes. \nThey lean the panels against a wall. Roberta turns to Ernie. \nERNIE Yep, that's how it comes now. \nThe guys quickly exit. Brian re-enters and sees the panels. \nBRIAN What the hell is this? \nROBERTA Sheetrock. \nBRIAN You've gotta be kidding. Those ex- cons you hired ripped this off -- and you too! \nRoberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it. \nROBERTA Look -- this house is taking every penny of my settlement. I can't afford fancy union workers! \nBRIAN (throwing up his hands) Fine. Do it your way. \nHe stomps off. ANOTHER ANGLE - Nick watches them fight and looks distressed. \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY \nLots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to break it up. \nEXT. CPE 1 - DAY - ESTABLISHING - TIME CUT (1998) \nThe side of the building now has an impressive mural: an urban landscape with three super heroes -- Puerto Rican, Black, and white -- rising up out of the street. It reads ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nRoberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first- graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL, a little older, a little tougher. \nISABEL C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet wants to talk to you. \nJANET Today's a very special day because we're starting the tenth year of the East Harlem Violin Program. This is a wonderful opportunity for you, so I want you to talk to your parents about whether you'd like to try this. \nISABEL My daughter took violin with Roberta when she was your age, and now she's in high school and she still talks about how much she loved it. \nDENNIS Janet and I started this program because we knew how much you kids could benefit from it. \nCUTAWAY to Roberta and Janet exchanging glances over Dennis taking credit for the program. \nDENNIS You should know, however, that the violin is a difficult instrument. \nJUSTIN, a Black boy with attitude, raises his hand. He always wears a puffy red, yellow and green crocheted beret. Isabel nods to him. \nJUSTIN Who's that lady in the back? \nANGLE - DOROTHEA (Doro-taya) VAN HAUFTEN (40's), an elegant, beautiful woman, smartly dressed, takes photographs from the back of the room. \nJANET That's Dorothea Van Hauften -- \nJUSTIN Say what? What kinda name is that? \nISABEL Justin -- sshh! \nJANET -- and she's taking pictures of Roberta's classes for a magazine article about music education. \nJUSTIN I wanna be in the magazine! \nISABEL First things first, Justin. Roberta's gonna explain to you about the \"lottery.\" \nRoberta steps forward. RAMON OLIVAS (7), a small, adorable Puerto Rican boy with a crew cut, watches her with adoration. \nROBERTA I used to just teach fifty kids at this school. But now I teach a hundred and fifty kids at three East Harlem schools and there's so many children who want to take violin classes that we have to have a lottery. \nVANESSA raises her hand, a white girl whose clothes and accessories are always adorned with cats. \nVANESSA Can I be in the class? \nISABEL Roberta's explaining that. Just listen. \nROBERTA After your parents sign your permission slips, I'm gonna put them in a sack, and I'll pick fifty names from each school. \nANGLE - Ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed. \nROBERTA So everyone bring in your slips by Friday, and I'll come back and tell you who's in violin class. \nISABEL Remember, she's just picking names from a hat. It doesn't mean that anyone's better than anyone else. \nRAMON raises his hand. \nRAMON (to Roberta) I really really hope that I get in the class. \nRoberta looks at him, struck by his sweetness. \nROBERTA I hope so too. \nEXT. 118TH STREET - STREET SIGN - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nEXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY \nThe brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it. Graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming in pots in front of the building. Roberta steps INTO FRAME, walking Allegra, now a 10-year-old dog. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY \nThe house is transformed: the first floor is one long open room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful fireplace and a grand piano, and a country kitchen in the rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block. \nNICK (17) practices cello and LEXI (15) practices piano; they play Haydn's \"Trio #13.\" Now handsome young men, their blonde hair has darkened to brown. Nick is huskier; Lexi has a slighter build. Both are passionate, talented musicians. \nOn the couch, RACHEL (12), a mature, beautiful Black girl, rosins her bow. \nRACHEL How come you guys don't play the violin? \nLEXI Well, picture her being your teacher and your mother. \nRachel cracks up but stifles her laughter as Roberta enters from outside with Allegra. \nROBERTA Hi Rachel. Be right with you. \nAs Roberta removes Allegra's leash, Rachel and Lexi share a conspiratorial look. In the b.g., Nick packs up his cello. \nROBERTA (to Nick) You're gonna practice upstairs? \nNICK No. I'm done. \nINT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nRoberta's advanced class plays \"Can-Can.\" Rachel's one of the eight sixth-graders. Roberta plays along, crossing to AMANDA, a white girl in a country-western outfit. \nROBERTA Amanda, what did I tell you about wearing cowboy boots to violin class? They're too slippery! \nShe crosses to a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy with glasses. \nROBERTA Relax your two, Simon... \nShe glances at STEPHANIE, a white girl with red hair, next to KENNY, a Black boy with an earnest expression. \nROBERTA Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny! Stephanie, it doesn't look like you ever had a lesson with me! \nCARLOS (13) hurries in, a handsome Black boy in a baseball jacket that says \"LOS LEONES.\" He looks 15. \nROBERTA Where's your violin, Carlos? \nCARLOS It's coming. \nHe nervously looks down the hall. \nROBERTA What, is it walking here by itself? \nA Black third-grade girl rushes into the room and hands Carlos his violin, then runs off. Roberta crosses to Carlos as he quickly readies the violin. \nROBERTA Your buddies giving you a hard time? \nCARLOS Look, it's just not cool. You wouldn't understand. \nROBERTA Hey, you want your sister to carry your violin, that's fine. But is she practicing for you too? Because lately, that's how it sounds. \nCARLOS I've been busy! I've been -- \nROBERTA I'm not interested! Just get here on time, and commit to this class or I don't want you in here, you understand? \nHe nods sullenly. \nROBERTA You're a good violinist, Carlos -- and it's definitely not \"cool\" to waste your own talent. \nCarlos takes this in as Roberta crosses to another student. \nEXT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nIt's upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street. \nINT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRamon sits on the floor, upset, half-heartedly building with Legos, while his parents argue in the KITCHEN. His father MANUELO is a stocky, muscular man. INTERCUT between the two areas. This is a modest, well-kept apartment. Off the kitchen, religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine. \nMANUELO Why didn't you show it to me? \nCONCEPCION It just needed one parent's signature. \nMANUELO (with some Spanish) Well, I'm his parent and I don't give permission! He should be playing baseball, not the violin! \nCONCEPCION It makes him happy. \nON RAMON, looking far from happy at the moment. \nEXT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - DAY \nRachel steps off a city bus, carrying her violin. She passes two sixth-grade boys and a girl. \nBOY #1 (loudly) Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead. \nGIRL She carry that violin with her all the time 'cause she think she special. \nRachel turns to them. \nRACHEL I am special. \nShe proudly continues on, then sees Roberta walking towards the school and catches up to her. \nRACHEL (nonchalant) So I heard from Julliard. \nRoberta stops and looks at her. \nROBERTA And? \nRACHEL They said yes! \nRoberta gives her a big hug. \nINT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nON THE BEGINNER'S CLASS, including Ramon, as they play \"Lightly Row.\" Roberta walks around, making corrections as she addresses the students. She doesn't see Justin poking Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at his nemesis. Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away from the violin. \nROBERTA So when you take the violins home, tape your music to the wall directly in front of your nose so you can play with perfect posture. Your parents are gonna be so excited to hear you play! \nINT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nROBERTA (to Isabel) What happened? \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nThe beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows. A few chat, but it's quieter than usual, except for RAMON who is \"blessing\" kids with his violin bow. \nRAMON You go to heaven... You go to hell... You go to hell... heaven... \nRoberta enters slowly. She looks very shaken up. She takes note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and Shandra in mid-conversation. \nTOUSSAINT My grandpa died and my uncle, so that makes six. \nSHANDRA I know more than that. At least seven people... maybe even nine. \nRoberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on a child-sized chair in front of them. \nROBERTA (quietly) I know that you've all heard the bad news about Justin. \nMYESHA I didn't hear. \nTOUSSAINT There was a drive-by shooting by his house and he got shot on accident and he died. \nMyesha takes this in, looking sad. \nROBERTA Does anyone want to talk about it? \nRAMON (angry) I think we should just play violin. \nRoberta watches him. \nINT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN AREA - DAY \nConcepcion cooks chicken and Pedro sets the table, whistling along to Ramon's O.S. violin playing \"We Shall Overcome.\" There's a KNOCK on the door. Concepcion answers it, revealing Roberta. \nCONCEPCION Roberta! Come in. \nRoberta enters. \nROBERTA I came by to check on Ramon. \nCONCEPCION (confused) Why? \nROBERTA Didn't he tell you what happened at school? \nConcepcion shakes her head no. \nINT. RAMON'S ROOM - DAY \nRamon is still playing violin as Concepcion and Roberta enter. When he sees Roberta he straightens up even more. \nCONCEPCION Roberta wants to talk to you, O.K.? \nHe nods. Concepcion touches his head, then exits. \nRAMON Did that sound O.K.? \nROBERTA Yeah, it did. \nRamon smiles, pleased with himself. \nROBERTA I've been thinking about Justin. Remember how mad I got the last time I saw him? \nRAMON Yeah. You got very strict with him. \nROBERTA It wasn't always so easy to be nice to him, you know? \nRamon looks away from her, upset. \nRAMON You think Justin's in heaven or hell? \nROBERTA Heaven. \nRamon runs his fingers along his bow. \nRAMON I told him to drop dead. \nRoberta touches Ramon's back. \nROBERTA Justin didn't die because of what you said. I promise. \nRAMON How do you know? \nROBERTA I don't think you're that powerful, do you? I mean, if you had such powers, just imagine what kind of violin player you'd be by now! \nRAMON Yeah. I'd be better than you! \nThey laugh together, then Ramon looks sad again. \nROBERTA It's O.K. to cry, you know. \nRAMON Not for a man. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nIN THE MIRROR - Roberta takes a last look at herself, wondering if he'll find her attractive. She touches her hair, adjusts her dress, then takes a deep breath as she builds up her courage. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRoberta enters the living room where Dan is chatting with Nick and Lexi. Dan sees her and is instantly smitten. \nDAN (shaking her hand) Wow. An honest woman. \nROBERTA Honest? \nDAN Your ad. When you said you were beautiful, you were telling the truth. \nShe smiles, blushing, and avoids eye contact with her sons who are trying really hard not to laugh. As she and Dan start to exit: \nNICK Make sure you're home by midnight, young lady. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON CLOCK \nIt reads 12:30. \nWIDER - Nick and Lexi play a video game on the TV screen. O.S., there's the SOUND OF A CAR. They race to the window. \nLEXI Ten bucks he tries to kiss her. \nNICK That's a no-brainer. Of course he'll try. The real question is whether she'll let him. \nLEXI O.K. -- ten bucks she lets him. \nNICK You're on. \nThey stare out the window intently. \nINT. DAN'S CAR - NIGHT \nDan pulls his car up in front of Roberta's house. Beside him, Roberta holds a program from a Lincoln Center concert. Roberta's tense, but Dan seems relaxed and centered in his attraction to her. \nDAN I had a lot of fun tonight. \nROBERTA Yeah, I did too. \nDAN I have a confession -- I've never answered an ad before. I did it on a dare. \nROBERTA Well, I have a confession -- my boys placed the ad behind my back. \nThey both laugh, then smile at each other. An awkward beat: will he or won't he? Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta turns away, uncertain. \nROBERTA Look, Dan -- I went along with this 'cause it's been a while. Quite a while... And I had a very nice time... but I'm not sure if I'm ready to get involved with anyone right now. \nA beat. Roberta feels badly about rejecting him. \nDAN (deadpan) Does this mean I don't get any lasagna? \nRoberta cracks up. Dan smiles at her. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nRoberta enters. The boys are back to their video game, covering that they've been spying on her. \nROBERTA Why are you guys still up? \nNICK (all innocence) Why? Is it late? \nROBERTA Good try, Nick. \nLEXI So how was it? \nROBERTA Well... he's nice. \nNICK \"Nice\"? As in \"let's just be friends\" nice? \nROBERTA I don't know yet. We'll see. \nNick looks disappointed. \nNICK There's still a lot more letters. \nROBERTA Good night, Nick. \nShe starts heading upstairs. \nLEXI Hey, Mom -- can you loan me ten dollars? \nINT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nTHE BLACKBOARD reads: SPRING CONCERT IN 10 DAYS! PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! \nRoberta rushes in, frazzled, not noticing at first that the beginners are very quiet -- and that most don't have violins. \nROBERTA Tell that to the Board of Education. \nNICK Let me ask you something. Why did you risk your life for a bicycle? \nRoberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance of the question. \nROBERTA I did not risk my life. \nNICK Of course you did! That building? Threatening Henry? And for what -- two hundred dollars? \nROBERTA No. Not for that. \nLEXI Then why? \nROBERTA When someone steals something that belongs to my kids, I'm not gonna sit back and let that happen! \nA beat as she realizes what she's just said. The boys look at her and the three of them stop walking. \nROBERTA Guys -- you need to think about this. If I try to fight this -- with no salary coming in -- I could lose the house, screw up your college plans... It would be a lot safer to just go out tomorrow and get a job in a private school. \nLEXI Yeah, but is that where you really want to be? \nINT. ROBERTA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoberta frantically searches through her purse, then crosses to a hall closet and quickly checks the pockets of her coats and jackets. \nShe feels inside a jacket pocket, then finds it: DOROTHEA'S BUSINESS CARD. \nEXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nINT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DEPT. OF JOURNALISM - DAY \nFOLLOW DAN PAXTON as he walks down the hall towards his office and sees a strange silver object on the floor in front of his office door. He picks it up. \nINSERT \n-- A foil-covered plate with a note on top: DO YOU KNOW ANYONE AT THE NEW YORK TIMES? \nBACK TO SCENE \nDan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of LASAGNA. \nINT. CPE 1 AUDITORIUM - THE CONCERT - STAGE - NIGHT \nSEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play \"We Shall Overcome\" and it's incredibly moving. Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano. ROBERTA proudly leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking. She takes his hand. \nANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly exits the auditorium. \nThe song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN. Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside Dan and taking notes. \nThe STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the mike. \nROBERTA (to the audience) The beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the East Harlem Violin Program. The Board of Education and the District Superintendent don't think that music is important for our children. But they're wrong -- and they're in for a fight. \nThe parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon gives her a thumbs up. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nROBERTA is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts. Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation for a meeting. The doorbell RINGS. \nROBERTA Someone's early. \nFOLLOW ASSUNTA to the DOOR. She opens it, revealing JANET, who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g. Roberta sees Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner. \nJANET Hello, Assunta. How are you? \nASSUNTA I'd be a lot better if my daughter had a job next year. \nROBERTA Ma! \nJANET (to Assunta) I would too. \nJanet briskly walks into THE LIVING ROOM, puts the grocery bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them. Roberta watches her, mystified. \nJANET (to Roberta) Sorry I'm early, but I figured we'd need time to set up. \nRoberta watches Janet for a beat, then addresses Assunta. \nROBERTA Mama, why don't you take Allegra out for a walk? \nAssunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits. Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing unusual about her being there. Cheeses, crackers, bread, salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. She sees Roberta's confused expression. \nJANET You are having a meeting here tonight, right? Parents and teachers? \nROBERTA Well, yes, but ... \nJANET Take it from me. If you want to get parents to help you with something, you have to feed them. \nShe holds up two wedges of cheese. \nJANET You have a cutting board for these? \nDENNIS Who authorized this? \nROBERTA Janet. \nDENNIS Well Janet's not here today and I want these people out of here. \nThe kids quiet down and watch them argue. A CAMERA GUY starts shooting the argument and Dennis sees him. \nDENNIS Turn that off, you hear me? \nROBERTA Why are you doing this? We're not bothering anyone. \nDENNIS You're disrupting school and I want them out of here -- now. \nROBERTA You still don't get it, do you? I don't care if you hate me, Dennis -- that's your business. But think about the students for once. Every time you interfere, you're not hurting me -- you're hurting them. \nShe points to the kids. They're silent, waiting to see if Roberta got through to him. A beat. \nDENNIS Get these people out of here or I'm calling the police. \nROBERTA Go right ahead, call them. That'll look real good on the eleven o'clock news. \nA beat and he exits. Roberta takes a deep breath, then turns back to the kids who are watching her, impressed. \nRAMON I don't hear no sirens. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nON THE TV is the news segment: ROBERTA speaks to an unseen interviewer. \nROBERTA I'm from a blue collar family, and if it weren't for the lessons I got in public school, I never would have learned the violin. \nIt CUTS TO Roberta's beginners speaking to the interviewer. \nINTERVIEWER (O.S.) How does it make you feel to lose your violin program? \nSHANDRA It makes us sad! \nRAMON Yeah, like we're never gonna have no more violin lessons -- \nVANESSA And it's bad because... because we love violin class. \nWIDER - REVEAL Roberta, Lexi and Nick watching the TV. \nINT. ARNOLD STEINHARDT AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nON TV - THE SAME NEWS SEGMENT, ANOTHER SOUND BITE \nROBERTA Yes, I've gotten offers from two private schools, but this is where I want to be. \nDOROTHEA (O.S.) Arnold, these kids need help. \nWIDER - REVEAL a comfortable Upper East Side apartment and DOROTHEA watching T.V. while ARNOLD practices violin. There's FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHY on the walls, signed by Dorothea. \nARNOLD Didn't we send them a donation? \nDOROTHEA They need something bigger. And you can't just write a check -- you have to get involved. \nARNOLD Involved how? \nThe look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained for. \nARNOLD Uh-oh. \nINT. SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY \n1. Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone. His Roladex is open to the name ITZHAK PERLMAN. In the b.g., Dorothea tensely waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes. \n2. Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang \"FIDDLEFEST CONCERT\" posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at THE 92ND STREET Y with ARNOLD STEINHARDT, ITZHAK PERLMAN and STUDENTS FROM THE EAST HARLEM VIOLIN PROGRAM. \n3. Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr. Adams and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS to \"FIDDLEFEST\" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS inside them. \nINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY \nThirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon, Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front. \nROBERTA Listen up, everyone! Quiet down! \nThe students give her their attention. \nROBERTA You are my very best beginner and advanced violin students and I've chosen you to play in Fiddlefest because I trust that you can handle the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold some tickets, but I'm not gonna be back here in the fall if the audience storms out of their seats, demanding a refund! \nShe nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music. \nROBERTA Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and I expect you to listen to her. \nRamon looks through his music sheets. \nRAMON Bach's \"Minuet One\"? \nROBERTA People are gonna be paying good money for this concert -- we're not just gonna play \"Twinkle.\" (handing out papers) I'm passing out a contract that you and your parents need to sign. \nROBERTA Until when? \nDOROTHEA \"Until further notice.\" \nROBERTA This can't happen! We've sold tickets! We've done publicity! The concert's in three weeks! \nDOROTHEA I've been on the phone all morning calling other theaters. Nothing's available. \nThey both sink into the couch, completely undone by this. \nROBERTA Just keep looking. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nThe Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house, (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra, Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon), rehearsing \"Orange Blossom Special.\" They play badly. Rachel helps Roberta correct students. \nROBERTA Stop! Someone's playing the wrong notes! And you shouldn't need your music anymore! Except for the Bach Double, everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal! \nThe kids look at each other, daunted. \nROBERTA And you sound like you're sleepwalking. Your heart's not even in it. \nVANESSA Maybe 'cause we don't have a place for the concert. \nRoberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks on many of the kids' faces. \nROBERTA Well, you're right. This might all be for nothing. So we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place -- or we can just... give up. \nDE SEAN Am I hearing right? Did you use the words \"give up\"? (to the students) Let's take a vote. How many of you want to give up? \nNo one raises a hand. Roberta takes this in. \nGUADALUPE See? You taught us well. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - DAY \nIt's early morning. Lexi cooks breakfast while Nick and Roberta look at scribbled-on, marked-up lists. \nROBERTA What about in the Bronx? \nNICK There's nothing. (beat) Why don't you just do it in one of the schools? It'll be a lot smaller but -- \nROBERTA We won't make enough money. \nLEXI What about postponing it? \nROBERTA Itzhak and Arnold are booked all summer. \nThey all look depressed. Lexi places an equally depressing- looking stack of pancakes on the table. There's a BANGING on the door, startling everyone. \nDOROTHEA (O.S.) It's Dorothea. \nNick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath, talking a mile a minute. \nDOROTHEA I have good news -- really good news. Arnold got a call from his friend Wally Scheur who heard about us losing the Y and wanted to see how he could help -- and then Wally had this brilliant idea and called his friend Isaac Stern and it's all arranged! We have a new place for Fiddlefest! \nROBERTA Where? \nDOROTHEA Carnegie Hall. \nDorothea grins from ear to ear, Nick and Lexi whoop and holler, and all wait for Roberta to jump up and down for joy -- but she looks stricken. \nROBERTA (panicked) Carnegie Hall? \nINT. CARNEGIE HALL - DAY \nCLOSE ON THE CEILING OF CARNEGIE HALL, revolving slowly. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTA'S POV \nShe stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of the stage, then stops. \nCLOSE ON ROBERTA \nWe can see her imagining the audience on the night of the concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin, takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her \"audience,\" then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening. Roberta stops. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Incredible sound in this room, no? \nRoberta turns to see ISAAC STERN approaching her. She's completely flustered. \nROBERTA Oh my god -- Isaac Stern. \nISAAC STERN You must be Roberta. \nROBERTA Thank you so much for helping us. \nISAAC STERN (looking out at the hall) Would you believe in 1960, they tried to tear this place down? They wanted to replace it with a bright red skyscraper -- we called it \"the red terror.\" \nROBERTA You're kidding. \nISAAC STERN We had to fight like hell, but with a lot of help, we saved Carnegie Hall. \nBRIAN Congratulations. \nROBERTA Thank you... \nBRIAN I knew you'd get here sooner or later. I'm glad I'm here to see it. \nA beat. \nROBERTA I am too. \nINT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE WINGS AREA - NIGHT \nGuadalupe shyly approaches Itzhak Perlman, her mother behind her, silently encouraging her. \nGUADALUPE Excuse me, Mr. Perlman? \nHe turns around. \nGUADALUPE (extends a hand) I'm Guadalupe. I've wanted to meet you for a long time. \nHe smiles at her and they shake hands. \nITZHAK PERLMAN A pleasure to meet you, Guadalupe. \nAs Guadalupe introduces him to her mother, CARLOS approaches. \nCARLOS You nervous, Mr. Perlman? \nITZHAK PERLMAN Should I be? \nCARLOS Us kids are gonna be great -- I don't know about you guys. How much did you practice? \nItzhak Perlman laughs. \nINT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - NIGHT \nRoberta talks to Janet with a worried expression. \nROBERTA You called Vanessa's father and mother? \nJANET No answer at either. \nA Carnegie Hall staff person in a suit enters. \nSTAFF PERSON Half hour call! It's now half hour call! So pace yourself accordingly. Don't get more than thirty minutes worth of nervous! \nThe room electrifies with nerves. \nVANESSA \nrushes into the room with her father. She's out of breath, her stocking has a big run in it, and she's in tears. \nVANESSA They stole the car! \nMR. KLEIN With the violin. \nROBERTA Oh my God. (calling) Nick, Lexi -- \nNICK Done. \nThe boys rush over to the extra violins and look to find the right size. \nVANESSA (crying) And then when we were getting a taxi, I fell down. \nRoberta comforts her and Janet moves in. \nJANET C'mon honey -- let's get you cleaned up. \nANGLE - DAN enters with a bouquet of long-stemmed red roses. He's in a tux and looks very handsome. He crosses to Roberta, hands her the flowers, and they hug. \nDAN You're glowing. \nROBERTA It's terror. \nINT.

CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - PODIUM - NIGHT \nJanet stands onstage and addresses the audience. \nJANET When I became the principal of Central Park East Elementary, I envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential, despite the challenges of poverty and racism. Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job, and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin. We put our dreams together and created the East Harlem Violin Program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of what's possible in their lives. When a program like this is cut, our children's future is compromised. I want to thank you for your support. Enjoy the concert. \n", "test1_input": "ROBERTA I'm not talking about Charles. I'm talking about us. \nBRIAN Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person's needs. I just don't buy that. \nThis is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying. \nROBERTA (carefully) What are you saying? If there's some need you have that I don't meet, you'd go and get it \"met\" by someone else? \nHe heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the question. \nBRIAN I'm saying that it's the 80's and it's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days. One out of two marriages ends in divorce! \nROBERTA You didn't answer my question. (beat) If I don't meet all your needs, and we're in a committed relationship -- forget marriage for a minute; I'm just talking about a relationship -- would you go to someone else? \nA beat. \nBRIAN In theory, yes. \nROBERTA In theory. \nRoberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly. \nBRIAN Roberta, we've got something good right now -- that's the important thing. Let's just keep it that way, O.K.? \nHe pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression. \nINT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNICK (O.S.) (whining) Why can't he? \nRoberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and the boys enter, back from the park. \nROBERTA He just can't, O.K.? Brian's at his house tonight, and we're at ours. \nNICK Well then I wanna go to his house. \nROBERTA Enough, Nick. Now why don't you and your brother practice while I make dinner. \nNICK I don't feel like practicing. \nROBERTA Well do it anyway. \nNICK I wanna go to Brian's! \nROBERTA Stop whining, and get your violin. \nNick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly. \nROBERTA What the hell are you doing? \nNICK The problem with you is you're mean to everybody and then they don't want to be with you! \nROBERTA I've heard just about enough from you, young man. Now set your violin up properly and start practicing. \nNick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's speechless. \nNICK I hate the violin! \nROBERTA You pick that violin up right now and don't you ever ever -- \nNick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond. \nNICK It's all your fault! You made Daddy leave and you're gonna make Brian leave too! You're gonna be all alone and I'll have to take care of you! \nRoberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about. \nROBERTA Nick -- you don't have to take care of me. \nNICK Then who's going to? \nROBERTA I'll take care of myself -- and I'll take care of you and Lexi. I promise. \nNICK You didn't try hard enough. You made Daddy leave us. \nThis hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out. \nROBERTA That's not true. I begged him not to leave, but he didn't listen. \nNICK Why not? \nRoberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth. She addresses both boys. \nROBERTA Your father met someone he liked more than Mommy, and then -- \nNICK Who? \nRoberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. She can hardly answer him. \nROBERTA Lana. Remember our friends Lana and Tom? \nNICK Is he gonna marry her now? \n", "test1_true": "Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain. Roberta moves closer to them. \nROBERTA I'll take care of you, Nick. You too, Lexi. I promise. I'm not going anywhere. We're still a family. \nNick starts crying. Roberta takes him in her arms. Lexi starts to cry and Roberta holds him too. \nROBERTA (softly, to both) I promise. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY \nErnie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP SONG. Roberta stands in the middle, about to lose her mind. \nHER POV - Ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring. He's fast asleep. ANOTHER ANGLE - The brick workers build a crooked fireplace. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRoberta sighs heavily, then crosses to the painters. \nROBERTA What color is this? \nPAINTER White. \nROBERTA I told you Eggshell. \nPAINTER Eggshells are white. \nBrian watches this interaction as he sands a door. \nBRIAN You're an idiot! I told you -- you can't be your own contractor. \nROBERTA You're right. I'm an idiot. \nShe crosses to Ernie and shakes him. \nROBERTA Wake up, Ernie. \nHe looks at her groggily. \nROBERTA You're fired. \nShe crosses to the brick workers. \nROBERTA You're fired. \nShe crosses to the painters. \nROBERTA You're fired. \nBrian smiles at her, impressed. \nBRIAN That's more like it. \nROBERTA You're fired too. \nBrian laughs. \nROBERTA No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be with a man who can make a commitment to me. I need that, and my sons need that. (beat) So can you? \nBRIAN (hesitates, then) Roberta -- \nHis tone and expression tell her the words are not forthcoming. \nROBERTA Get out. \nHe looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't give her what she wants. He exits. Roberta stands in the middle of the room, a determined look on her face. \nINT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nROBERTA \nStands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin. \nON STAGE \nThe fifty fifth-grade students play the \"Twinkle\" variations. Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific. \nAs the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start the jazz variation of \"Twinkle,\" a WOMAN elbows her husband: \nWOMAN That's the one Lucy wrote! \nThe CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she hears her song played by fifty. \nTHE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE \nThe students are now playing \"Allegro,\" and they reach the fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds, and Roberta turns to face them. \nShe lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n", "test1_id": 1971, "test2_input": "EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT \nNot a place you'd want to go into, even in the day time. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL this is their POV from INSIDE THE CAR. The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission. \nNICK C'mon Mom, let's get out of here. \nROBERTA Lock the doors. \nAnd she exits. The boys watch as she heads for the building, then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face. \nLEXI I'm dead. She's gonna get me killed. \nNick jumps out of the car and heads after her. \nNICK I'm coming with you! \nROBERTA No. Get back in the car and stay with the boys. \nNick hesitates and heads back. Roberta presses on. Lawrence opens the window and calls to her. \nLAWRENCE Don't take the stairs! \nINT.

O.S. a BABY CRIES, a couple of TV's BLARE. \nINT. TENEMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nAt the top of the stairs, Roberta turns down the hall, passing a door riddled with bullet holes. She finds the apartment and knocks. No response. She knocks again. \nOLD WOMAN (O.S.) Yeah? \nROBERTA I'm a school teacher. Henry has taken my son's bicycle and I want it back. \nA beat, then the door cracks open, an OLD WOMAN visible through the chain lock. \nOLD WOMAN Henry's not here. \nROBERTA Well you tell Henry that if he returns the bike, I won't have to notify the police -- or his school principal. Although since I am a teacher, it would be very easy for me to do that. \nA couple of beats. \nOLD WOMAN He's not home. He doesn't get home till late. \nROBERTA How late? \nOLD WOMAN Not till after ten. \nROBERTA I'll be on the steps of CPE 1 at 11 P.M. I'll be waiting for him. \nThe door closes. Roberta exhales. Did she just do that? \nEXT. CPE 1 - NIGHT \nRoberta, Nick, Lexi and Lawrence sit on the front steps of the school. The street is deserted. \nLEXI You're crazy. He's not gonna show. \nRoberta sits confidently. \nNICK You think he actually cares that you're a teacher? You think he even goes to school? \nLEXI C'mon, Mom -- let's just go. \nROBERTA It's only five after eleven. \nNick and Lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look: she's nuts. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle. Nick, Lexi and Lawrence look towards the sound, incredulous. Lexi stands. \nHenry rides up on the bike and dismounts. Lexi looks directly at him as he takes the bike from him. \nHENRY I was just borrowing it. \nHe glances at Roberta, then walks off. \nINT. CPE 1 - CLASSROOM - DAY \nRoberta stands in front of Isabel's class and calls out names, handing the selected children acceptance letters. The kids are charged up; \"My heart is pounding!\" \"Please pick me!\" \nROBERTA Shandra Wilson. \nA pretty Black girl with braids and tons of barrettes jumps up and down, then runs up for her letter.

She puts it into her cat-shaped backpack. \nROBERTA O.K. One more name... \nRamon crosses his fingers and holds his breath. \nROBERTA Leonard Hood. \nRAMON looks crushed. JUSTIN taunts him some more. LEONARD, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it. He starts to cry. \nLEONARD It's too hard! I don't wanna do it! \nISABEL Don't you even wanna try, Leonard? \nLEONARD (through tears) I don't want to! \nIsabel looks at Roberta. \nROBERTA Well, O.K. then. I'll pick someone else.

And maybe someday the school will give me a parking space! \nShe rushes towards the school and Dorothea follows her. \nDOROTHEA Wait -- \nShe hands Roberta a thin box.

You Double Concerto kids need to be working harder! This is the grand finale of the concert! You're each gonna be sharing a music stand with one of the world's greatest violinists! \nThe kids say \"the world's greatest violinists\" along with her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot.

{"test1_input": "MUSIC OF THE HEART \nWritten by \nPamela Gray \nSHOOTING DRAFT January 25, 1999 \nFADE IN: \nCREDITS OVER PHOTOS IN AN ALBUM \nThe photos include a sepia-tone portrait of an Italian immigrant family... a b&w snapshot of ROBERTA, a nine-year- old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)... \n...Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a wooden music stand... a b&w snapshot of Roberta in a communion dress... Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same refrigerator, eyes on the music stand... \n...a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a sandcastle on a beach... a color photo of a groom in a white naval uniform and his pretty bride, (Roberta at 25), her hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword... \n...a color photo of Roberta and her husband Greek dancing with another couple at an outdoor taverna. Roberta's husband and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile... \nHOLD ON THIS LAST PHOTO as we now see the ALBUM open on the floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed. We are: \nINT. GUASPARI HOUSEHOLD, ROME, N. Y. - BEDROOM - DAY (1988) \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Wake up, Roberta! \nWe hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small, darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through Venetian blinds. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Come on, Bert -- get out of bed! \nThe CAMERA finds a WOMAN lying face down on a twin bed, thick wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Please, Bert -- you need to get out of that bed. \nThe KNOCKING continues, and she puts the pillow over the top of her head. \nEND CREDITS \nINT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY \nThe WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo -- it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young boys' voices. \nBOY'S VOICE (O.S.) Can you come out now, Mommy? Please? \nShe puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into pieces. \nBOY #2 (O.S.) Mommy, Nick broke my crayon! \nBOY #1 (O.S.) Well, Lexi hit me and he almost broke... he almost broke my ear! \nO.S. arguing \"I DID NOT!\" \"YES YOU DID!\" \"LIAR!\" etc. As if that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hear that? Your boys need you. \nEXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY \nASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian- American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street. \nASSUNTA But I have no room for this! \nOFFICER I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to deliver these. \nAssunta looks beyond the man, dismayed. \nHER POV \nLarge wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole lot more. \nBACK TO SCENE \nInstantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than we've seen her so far. \nROBERTA Watch it, you idiots! Be careful with those! \nThe men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the violins, then up at Roberta. \nASSUNTA Why so many? \nRoberta disappears inside and slams the window shut. \nINT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb over the boxes as if they were giant blocks. \nNICK (calling) Mommy, which box has our toys? \nINT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in the same ratty nightgown. \nROBERTA Look, I know he's there, so quit lying to me!... Then check under Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden... Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras that his wife called and -- \n", "test1_true": "ROBERTA Ma! \nASSUNTA No. I want you to listen to me. You can't keep doing this to yourself -- or to the boys. They need their mother now. You're a beautiful, talented woman and you have your whole life ahead of you. \nROBERTA If I'm so beautiful and talented, why did Charles leave me? \nASSUNTA Because Charles is a big jerk. (beat) Now get dressed. \nShe exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words. \nINT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY \nCoffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage. As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or done much with her hair. It's a start. \nROBERTA You really think Charles is a jerk? \nASSUNTA From the day you married him. \nROBERTA Why didn't you say something? \nASSUNTA Since when do you listen to me? \nRoberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits down at the table. \nROBERTA (sighs, then) What am I gonna do? \nASSUNTA First, you eat breakfast. Second, you go out and get a job -- any job. Your boys, god-bless-em, are good eaters -- but I can't afford it. \nROBERTA Mama, he's gonna get tired of her -- you'll see. \nAssunta's face shows she's doubtful about this. \nASSUNTA Well in the meantime, get a job. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY \nRoberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears behind Roberta. \nSUPERVISOR Just wrap. You're not Picasso. \nHe exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Picasso would probably put the bows on the back of the box. \nRoberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket. \nROBERTA Brian Turner? \nBRIAN Hello, Roberta. \nROBERTA I thought you moved away. \nBRIAN I did. I'm in town for my Mom's birthday. \nHe holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture and tries to shake his hand. \nBRIAN No -- that's her gift. \nROBERTA (embarrassed) Oh! Sorry. \nRoberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping. \nBRIAN It looks very pretty. \nROBERTA Thank you. (beat) I heard you had a book published. I didn't read it but... \nBRIAN That's O.K. My parents didn't read it either. It looks good on their coffee table, though. \nRoberta smiles. \nBRIAN So what are you doing here? I thought you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now. \nHOLD ON ROBERTA as she takes this in. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - ROME, N.Y. - DAY \nRoberta sits opposite Brian. Her lunch is untouched. \nROBERTA My college professors said it was too late -- I hadn't had enough training to be a concert violinist. So I got a teaching degree instead. \nBRIAN I'll bet you're a great teacher. \nROBERTA I think I am. It's just that... (sighs) See, every time I'd get started somewhere, Charles would be transferred... then I had my kids and took time off to raise them... and then when I decided to teach again, no one would hire me 'cause you can't count on a navy wife to stick around. I finally decided I'd start my own program -- Charles gave me the money and I bought fifty violins from this little Greek shop -- got started at a private school and then... \nBRIAN Your husband ran off with your best friend. \nA beat. \nROBERTA She wasn't my \"best\" friend. She was a friend. (beat) Charles is the last person you'd think would cheat on me -- he never broke a rule... (a few beats) I wake up one night -- it's like one in the morning -- and he's not in bed. I go outside and our neighbor -- this old Greek guy -- is sitting out there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if he's seen my husband. \"He's taking a walk with the other officer's wife,\" he says. \"He takes a walk every night with the other officer's wife.\" \n", "test1_id": 1971, "test2_input": "ROBERTA I'm not talking about Charles. I'm talking about us. \nBRIAN Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person's needs. I just don't buy that. \nThis is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying. \nROBERTA (carefully) What are you saying? If there's some need you have that I don't meet, you'd go and get it \"met\" by someone else? \nHe heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the question. \nBRIAN I'm saying that it's the 80's and it's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days. One out of two marriages ends in divorce! \nROBERTA You didn't answer my question. (beat) If I don't meet all your needs, and we're in a committed relationship -- forget marriage for a minute; I'm just talking about a relationship -- would you go to someone else? \nA beat. \nBRIAN In theory, yes. \nROBERTA In theory. \nRoberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly. \nBRIAN Roberta, we've got something good right now -- that's the important thing. Let's just keep it that way, O.K.? \nHe pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression. \nINT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNICK (O.S.) (whining) Why can't he? \nRoberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and the boys enter, back from the park. \nROBERTA He just can't, O.K.? Brian's at his house tonight, and we're at ours. \nNICK Well then I wanna go to his house. \nROBERTA Enough, Nick. Now why don't you and your brother practice while I make dinner. \nNICK I don't feel like practicing. \nROBERTA Well do it anyway. \nNICK I wanna go to Brian's! \nROBERTA Stop whining, and get your violin. \nNick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly. \nROBERTA What the hell are you doing? \nNICK The problem with you is you're mean to everybody and then they don't want to be with you! \nROBERTA I've heard just about enough from you, young man. Now set your violin up properly and start practicing. \nNick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's speechless. \nNICK I hate the violin! \nROBERTA You pick that violin up right now and don't you ever ever -- \nNick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond. \nNICK It's all your fault! You made Daddy leave and you're gonna make Brian leave too! You're gonna be all alone and I'll have to take care of you! \nRoberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about. \nROBERTA Nick -- you don't have to take care of me. \nNICK Then who's going to? \nROBERTA I'll take care of myself -- and I'll take care of you and Lexi. I promise. \nNICK You didn't try hard enough. You made Daddy leave us. \nThis hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability start to pour out. \nROBERTA That's not true. I begged him not to leave, but he didn't listen. \nNICK Why not? \nRoberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth. She addresses both boys. \nROBERTA Your father met someone he liked more than Mommy, and then -- \nNICK Who? \nRoberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. She can hardly answer him. \nROBERTA Lana. Remember our friends Lana and Tom? \nNICK Is he gonna marry her now? \n", "test2_true": "Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain. Roberta moves closer to them. \nROBERTA I'll take care of you, Nick. You too, Lexi. I promise. I'm not going anywhere. We're still a family. \nNick starts crying. Roberta takes him in her arms. Lexi starts to cry and Roberta holds him too. \nROBERTA (softly, to both) I promise. \nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY \nErnie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP SONG. Roberta stands in the middle, about to lose her mind. \nHER POV - Ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring. He's fast asleep. ANOTHER ANGLE - The brick workers build a crooked fireplace. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRoberta sighs heavily, then crosses to the painters. \nROBERTA What color is this? \nPAINTER White. \nROBERTA I told you Eggshell. \nPAINTER Eggshells are white. \nBrian watches this interaction as he sands a door. \nBRIAN You're an idiot! I told you -- you can't be your own contractor. \nROBERTA You're right. I'm an idiot. \nShe crosses to Ernie and shakes him. \nROBERTA Wake up, Ernie. \nHe looks at her groggily. \nROBERTA You're fired. \nShe crosses to the brick workers. \nROBERTA You're fired. \nShe crosses to the painters. \nROBERTA You're fired. \nBrian smiles at her, impressed. \nBRIAN That's more like it. \nROBERTA You're fired too. \nBrian laughs. \nROBERTA No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be with a man who can make a commitment to me. I need that, and my sons need that. (beat) So can you? \nBRIAN (hesitates, then) Roberta -- \nHis tone and expression tell her the words are not forthcoming. \nROBERTA Get out. \nHe looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't give her what she wants. He exits. Roberta stands in the middle of the room, a determined look on her face. \nINT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nROBERTA \nStands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin. \nON STAGE \nThe fifty fifth-grade students play the \"Twinkle\" variations. Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific. \nAs the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start the jazz variation of \"Twinkle,\" a WOMAN elbows her husband: \nWOMAN That's the one Lucy wrote! \nThe CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she hears her song played by fifty. \nTHE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE \nThe students are now playing \"Allegro,\" and they reach the fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds, and Roberta turns to face them. \nShe lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n", "test2_id": 1972, "test3_input": "ROBERTA Until when? \nDOROTHEA \"Until further notice.\" \nROBERTA This can't happen! We've sold tickets! We've done publicity! The concert's in three weeks! \nDOROTHEA I've been on the phone all morning calling other theaters. Nothing's available. \nThey both sink into the couch, completely undone by this. \nROBERTA Just keep looking. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nThe Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house, (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra, Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon), rehearsing \"Orange Blossom Special.\" They play badly. Rachel helps Roberta correct students. \nROBERTA Stop! Someone's playing the wrong notes! And you shouldn't need your music anymore! Except for the Bach Double, everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal! \nThe kids look at each other, daunted. \nROBERTA And you sound like you're sleepwalking. Your heart's not even in it. \nVANESSA Maybe 'cause we don't have a place for the concert. \nRoberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks on many of the kids' faces. \nROBERTA Well, you're right. This might all be for nothing. So we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place -- or we can just... give up. \nDE SEAN Am I hearing right? Did you use the words \"give up\"? (to the students) Let's take a vote. How many of you want to give up? \nNo one raises a hand. Roberta takes this in. \nGUADALUPE See? You taught us well. \nINT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - DAY \nIt's early morning. Lexi cooks breakfast while Nick and Roberta look at scribbled-on, marked-up lists. \nROBERTA What about in the Bronx? \nNICK There's nothing. (beat) Why don't you just do it in one of the schools? It'll be a lot smaller but -- \nROBERTA We won't make enough money. \nLEXI What about postponing it? \nROBERTA Itzhak and Arnold are booked all summer. \nThey all look depressed. Lexi places an equally depressing- looking stack of pancakes on the table. There's a BANGING on the door, startling everyone. \nDOROTHEA (O.S.) It's Dorothea. \nNick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath, talking a mile a minute. \nDOROTHEA I have good news -- really good news. Arnold got a call from his friend Wally Scheur who heard about us losing the Y and wanted to see how he could help -- and then Wally had this brilliant idea and called his friend Isaac Stern and it's all arranged! We have a new place for Fiddlefest! \nROBERTA Where? \nDOROTHEA Carnegie Hall. \nDorothea grins from ear to ear, Nick and Lexi whoop and holler, and all wait for Roberta to jump up and down for joy -- but she looks stricken. \nROBERTA (panicked) Carnegie Hall? \nINT. CARNEGIE HALL - DAY \nCLOSE ON THE CEILING OF CARNEGIE HALL, revolving slowly. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTA'S POV \nShe stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of the stage, then stops. \nCLOSE ON ROBERTA \nWe can see her imagining the audience on the night of the concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin, takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her \"audience,\" then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening. Roberta stops. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Incredible sound in this room, no? \nRoberta turns to see ISAAC STERN approaching her. She's completely flustered. \nROBERTA Oh my god -- Isaac Stern. \nISAAC STERN You must be Roberta. \nROBERTA Thank you so much for helping us. \nISAAC STERN (looking out at the hall) Would you believe in 1960, they tried to tear this place down? They wanted to replace it with a bright red skyscraper -- we called it \"the red terror.\" \nROBERTA You're kidding. \nISAAC STERN We had to fight like hell, but with a lot of help, we saved Carnegie Hall. \n", "test3_true": "ISAAC STERN If it's all right with you, I'd like to play in your concert. Maybe bring a couple of friends... \nROBERTA Yes, of course! That would be great! \nIsaac nods, then touches her shoulder. \nISAAC STERN Don't give up. \nEXT. SIDEWALK CAFE, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY \nRoberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. Dan sits across from her, observing. \nROBERTA I just don't see how I'm gonna do this. It's huge. It's gigantic! It's Carnegie Hall! And listen to this: now Isaac Stern wants to play with us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree -- there's other people calling -- \nDAN That's fantastic! \nROBERTA Fantastic? I'll never get the kids up to speed in time, I'll never get myself up to speed. I'm gonna be playing side by side with the world's greatest violinists. \nDAN And \"the world's greatest violinists\" are playing side by side with you because they want to help you win this fight. \nHe offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate cake, but she shakes her head. \nROBERTA Yes, but... you don't understand. Maybe there's a good reason why I never made it as a violinist -- maybe I just can't cut it. I keep blaming it on not having enough early training, but if I were talented, if I had a gift -- \nDAN But you do have a gift. You're gonna put thirty East Harlem kids on stage at Carnegie Hall not because they're prodigies, but because you got them to stick with something that's hard as hell and to strive for excellence -- which, by the way, I certainly wasn't striving for when I was their age. Not to mention the other ten years' worth of students whose lives were changed because of you. That's your talent, Roberta. \nShe takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand over his. He strokes her hand. \nROBERTA I'm scared. \nDAN I know. (beat) And by the way, I happen to think you're a pretty good violinist too. \nROBERTA You've barely heard me play. \nDAN I've heard enough to know you're gonna do just fine. \nRoberta looks at him with trepidation. Dan takes another forkful of his cake. \nDAN Besides, no one's gonna be paying attention to your playing anyway. \nRoberta laughs. Dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up. \nEXT. CPE 1 - DAY (EARLY MORNING) \nThe Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and Kenny -- but RACHEL is absent) stand outside the locked school gate, waiting for Roberta. Some of the kids have their violins out of the cases, tuning them. \nCARLOS Teacher's late. I think she should be dropped, don't you? \nKids laugh. \nRAMON Yeah. I don't think we should let her play in Fiddlefest! \nA few kids start playing \"CAN-CAN.\" It catches on, and more of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids grin at this. \nCARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an uncanny imitation of Roberta: \nCARLOS More bow! To the frog! You sound terrible! I can't believe how terrible you sound! \nThe kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals him that Roberta's watching. \nCARLOS You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their stomachs! That's right, they're gonna pay a thousand dollars a ticket and you're gonna make them throw up on their gowns and tuxedos! \nCarlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense beat as he awaits her reaction. \nROBERTA (in all seriousness) If you're gonna imitate me, do it right. (corrects his posture) Shoulders back. Violin higher. Check your feet. There. (beat) G'head, Carlos. Continue. \nCarlos freezes. \nCARLOS No, that's O.K. You can take it from here. \nRoberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate. \nROBERTA He's right, by the way. You do sound terrible, and you are gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their stomachs. \nThe kids start filing in. Rachel comes up the street and catches up to Roberta. \nRACHEL I need to talk to you. \nRoberta sees how distressed Rachel looks. \nROBERTA (to kids) I'll be right in. Start on Minuet One. (to Rachel) What's wrong? \nRACHEL We're moving away. \nROBERTA What? Where are you moving? \nRACHEL (looking downward) It's a secret... My father... he's been hurting my mom... We have to leave. \nROBERTA (gently) Has he been hurting you too? \n", "test3_id": 1973}

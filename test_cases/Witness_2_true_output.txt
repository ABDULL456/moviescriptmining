Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests. 
DOORMAN Ma'am? 
RACHEL No! We do not stay in hotels. 
Book and Carter exchange a glance. 
EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT 
An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to follow Rachel inside. 
ELAINE How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company 
BOOK Sorry. It's important. 
BACK TO RACHEL 
As she glances in a doorway. 
HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN 
It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the table littered with empty beer cans. 
BACK TO RACHEL 
As she hustles Samuel along. 
BOOK / ELAINE 
Book frowns: 
BOOK Where's Timmy and Buck? 
ELAINE Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think? 
BOOK You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs? 
ELAINE That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut! (and) Anyway, they like Fred. 
BOOK Oh sure, Fred. 
Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides it's pointless. 
ELAINE Who are these orphans, anyway? 
BOOK They're Amish. 
ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM 
Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room. 
Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the other one. 
Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in. 
ELAINE Everything okay? 
RACHEL Yes, thank you very much. 
ELAINE (a beat) John said you're Amish. 
RACHEL Yes. 
ELAINE (blankly) Oh. 
She nods and goes. 
Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up at her bleakly. 
SAMUEL I don't want to stay here. 
RACHEL They are English. They don't understand. 
SAMUEL I wish dawdie was with us. 
RACHEL (swallows) I know. Sleep now, Liebchen. 
She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she frowns, and... 
EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT  PHILADELPHIA  DAWN 
Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into the car. 
Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. Its clear they've worked through the night. 
EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

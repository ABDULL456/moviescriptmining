MARYANNE Who? 
PAUL It's Paul, Mom. Your son. 
MARYANNE My son? 
PAUL It's okay, Mom. How are you? 
MARYANNE I'm fine. 
PAUL That's good. 
MARYANNE Who are you? 
PAUL It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie. 
MARYANNE Paulie? 
PAUL Yeah. Remember? We lived over on Colfax Street, in the duplex. Remember? 
MARYANNE 
(REMEMBERING SLIGHTLY) Paulie? 
PAUL That's right, Mom. 
MARYANNE Is this Paulie? 
PAUL It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's everything at the home? 
MARYANNE Very nice. Your father and I have been playing gin rummy every night. It's almost too much for Paul to take. He cries silent tears over a heartbroken smile. 
PAUL Yeah...I don't think Pop's there with you, Mom. 
MARYANNE How are you doing, sweetie? 
PAUL Not very good. This...uh, this may be the last time I talk to you. 
MARYANNE That's nice, honey. 
PAUL Did you get the flowers I sent a few months ago? 
MARYANNE Flowers?

{"test1_input": "[I comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel.] \nI: Danny. Danny: You're looking very beautiful man. Have you been away? St. Peter preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that. Have you got any food. I: Mmm, As a matter of fact, got a savaloy. Danny: How much is it? I: You can have it for nothing. [Danny sniffs the sausage. Withnail enters from the kitchen gluing the sole back on his shoe. He is wearing a rather expensive looking suit.] \nDanny: I see you're wearing a suit. Withnail: What's it got to do with you? Danny: No need to get uptight man. I was merely making an observation. I happened to be looking for a suit for the coal man two weeks ago. For reasons I can't really discuss with you the coal man had to go to Jamaica. Got busted coming back through Heathrow, had the weight under his fez. We wored out that it would be handycarma for him to get hold of a suit but he's a very low temperature spade the coal man, went into court wearing a kaftan and a bell. This doesn't go down at all well. They can handle the kaftan but they can't handle the bell. So there's this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fucking batman with this really rather far out looking hat Withnail: A wig. Danny: No man, this was more like a long white hat. So he looks at the coalman and says 'what's all this. This is a court man. This ain't fancy dress' and the coal man looks at him and says 'you think you look normal, your honour?'. Cunt give him two years. \n[I laughs a little. Withnail looks on unamuzed.] \nDanny: I'm afraid I can't offer you gentlemen anything. I: That's alright Danny. We'd decided to lay off for a bit. Danny: That's what I thought. Except for personal use I concur with you. as a matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business Withnail [Scoffing]: Doing what? Danny: The toy industry. \n", "test1_true": "Withnail: Thought you were in the bottle industry. Danny: No man, that's a side line. You can have that. Instructions are included. Yeah. My partner's got a really good idea for making dolls. His name's 'Presuming Ed'. His sister give him the idea. She got a doll on Christmas what pisses itself. Withnail: Really. Danny: Then you've got to change its draws for it. Horrible really but they're like that the little girls. So we're going to make one that shits itself too. Withnail: Shits itself!? Danny: He's an expert. He's building the prototype now. [To I] Why's he behaving so uptightly. Withnail: Because a gang of cheroot vendors consider a hair cut beyond the limit of my abilities Danny: I don't advise a hair cut man. All hairdressers are in the employment of the government. Hair are your aerials. They pick up signals from the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain. This is the reason bold-headed men are uptight. Withnail: What absolute twaddle. Danny: Has he just been busted? I: No. Danny: Then why's he wearing that old suit? Withnail: Old suit? This suit was cut by Hawke's of Saville row. Just because the best tailoring you've ever seen is above you fucking appendix doesn't mean anything. Danny: Don't get uptight with me man. Because if you do I'll have to give you a dose of medicine and if I spike you you'll know you've been spoken to. Withnail: You wouldn't spike me you're too mean. Besides, there's nothing invented I couldn't take. Danny: If I medicined you you'd think a brain tumour was a birthday present. Withnail: I could take double anything you could. Danny [removing his sunglasses]: Very, very foolish words man. I: He's right Withnail. Look at him . His mechanisms gone. He's had more drugs than you've had hot dinners. Withnail: I'm not having this shag-sack insulting me. Let him get his drugs out. \n[Danny gets a doll out of a bag.] \nDanny: This doll is extremely dangerous. It has voodoo qualities. \n[Withnail snorts. Danny takes the head off the doll and extracts a handful of pills.] \n", "test1_id": 3108, "test2_input": "[I smiles wriley to himself. Withnail downs the drink he has prepared for himself, pours another and starts making the Bloody Mary for Monty.] \nWithnail: Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff. My agent's trying to edge me towards the Royal Shakespeare again. Monty: Oh splendid. Withnail: He's just had an audition for rep. Monty: Oh splendid. So you're a thespian too? \n[Withnail delivers Monte's drink and sits beside him.] \nWithnail: Monte used to act. Monty: I'd hardly say that. It's true I crept the boards in my youth but I never had it in my blood and that's what so essential isn't it? Theatrical zeal in the veins. Alas, I have little more that vintage wine and memories. \n[He stands and looks at a photograph on the mantlepiece.] \n", "test2_true": "[As Monte rambles in the background I steps over to Withnail and whispers.] \nI: He's a madman. Any moment now he's going to rush out and get into his tights. Withnail: Ok ok. Give me a minute. I: The house or out. \n[Withnail stands and moves over to Monte.] \nWithnail: Could I have a word with you Monte? Monty: Oh forgive me dear boy, forgive me. I was allowing memories to have the better of me. Withnail: Shall I get you a top up? [He moves to the sideboard again. Monte sits down and reminisces.] Monty: Indeed I remember my first agent. Raymond Duck. Dreadful little Israelite. Four floors up at the charring cross and never a job at the top of them. I'm told you're a writer too. Do you write poems? I: No, I wish I could. It's just thoughts really. Monty: Have you published? I: No no. Monty: Where did you school? Withnail: He went to the other place Monte. Monty: Oh you went to Eton?

[He emerges from the phonebox.] Withnail: Bitch hung up on me. [I fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for Withnail who goes back into the phonebox and dials.] \nWithnail: Hello. How are you? Very well. What! Why wouldn't they see me? This is ridiculous. I haven't been up in a job for three months. Understudy Constantine!? I'm not going to understudy Constantine, why can't I play the part? This is ridiculous. No, I'm not in London, Penryth. Penryth! Well, what about TV? Listen, I pay you ten percent to do that. Well lick ten percent of the arses for me. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? How dare you! Fuck you. [He takes out his frustration on the phone, hitting it for a while then leaves the phonebox.] \nWithnail: Bastard asked me to understudy Constantine in The Seagull. I'm not going to understudy anyone, especially that little pimp. Anyway, I loath those Russian plays. Always full of women starring out of windows whinning about ducks going to Moscow. [Returning from Penryth they walk accross a field. I is carrying some shopping.] \nWithnail: What do you think to Desmond Wolf? I: With respect to what? Withnail: I'm thinking of changing my name. I: Too like Donald Woolfe [He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate. It is clearly marked 'Shut this gate'] \nI: Here, changeover point. [Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesn't fasten. They see Parkin on his tractor.] \n", "test3_true": "I: What's up with him? Parkin: Shut that gate, shut that bull! I: You didn't shut the gate! Parkin: Shut that gate, shut that bull! [A bull appears and pushes the gate open. Withnail thrusts the bag into I's hands and vaults the wall. I is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor between two walls.] \nWithnail: Grab its ring. Keep your bag up. Outvive him. Parkin: Hey, listen, show no fear! Just run at it I: Well that can't be sensible can it? The bastard's about to run at me Parkin: Well he's randy! I: Yeah, yeah. I know he is [Withnail has his cigarettes out and is lighting up.] \nWithnail: Wants to get down there and have sex with those cows. I: Shut up Withnail! Parkin: Just run at it, shouting! Withnail: Do as he says, start shouting. It won't gore you I: A coward you are Withnail. An expert on bulls you are not! [He shouts and throws the shopping in the air. The bull roars, I shouts again and runs at it. It turns and retreats to its field.] \nParkin: Shut that gate and keep it shut. Withnail: I think an evening at the Crow! \n", "test3_id": 3110}

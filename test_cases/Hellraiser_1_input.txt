FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold of her face. 
FRANK I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you?  Beautiful. 
KIRSTY This isn't happening. 
FRANK I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.  But why kid yourself?  Some things have to be endured.  Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ... 
As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids. FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams. She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin. 
She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over it.  She falls, heavily. 
Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her. 
On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her. She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now. Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more. 
She raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what she's holding.  His  attack stops. 
FRANK Give that to me. 
She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool. 
KIRSTY (breathless) No. 
FRANK One last time.  Give me the box. 
KIRSTY You want it? 
The monster's eyes glitter. 
Fucking have it! 
She throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes through the window. 
FRANK NO! 
He goes to the window.  She takes her chance.  She's out of the door in a moment. 
NO! 
136  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY 
KIRSTY propels herself out of the Room, and down the stairs, while FRANK vents his anger above her. 
137  INT.   HALLWAY   DAY 
She flings open the front door, and pitches herself - bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond. 
138  EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY 
As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.  She picks it up, and continues to run. 
139  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY 
A series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers along the street.  The sound-track whines; the image threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.  People stare at her as she runs.  A child points. 
Finally, the CAMERA slows.  She stands still. 
A voice, off camera: 
VOICE (O.S.) Are you all right? 
The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of the speaker.  A WOMAN comes into view. 
WOMAN Do you need any help? 
As she speaks, the picture fades to white. 
140  KIRSTY'S DREAM  (PART TWO) 
The whiteness continues to fill the screen.  Distant, incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood in the inner ear. 
Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness, soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous dialogue. 
FRANK Come to Daddy. 
KIRSTY This isn't happening. 
FRANK Some things have to be endured ...

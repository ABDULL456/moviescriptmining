TINA You don't smoke. 
Hub pockets the pack of cigarettes and walks into: 
THE CELL 
Frank hangs back in the doorway. Hub pulls up a chair, turns it backwards, and sits down very close to Khalil. 
HUB Ten thousand dollars. 
Frank translates. Khalil pretends not to understand. 
HUB Khalil. I want to talk about the money. 
Again Frank translates. And again, Khalil looks blank. 
HUB Okay... 
Hub reaches into his pocket and casually takes out the pack of cigarettes. Khalil's eyes widen. Hub smiles at him. At the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on Khalil's forehead. Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- drawing deep so the tip turns bright red. Khalil unconsciously RECOILS in his chair. 
HUB (to Frank, re: Khalil) Doesn't like second hand smoke. 
Hub turns back to Khalil, casually gesturing with his cigarette. Khalil almost jumps out of his skin. 
HUB You ready to talk about money? 
Frank hasn't even begun to translate before Khalil begins SPEED-RAPPING in Arabic. 
FRANK (translating) ...He says he loves America and only wanted to get away from the security services at home. 
Tears stream down Khalil's face. He kneels at Hub's feet. 
FRANK (still translating) ...He says he's sorry but he didn't know he was doing something bad. His cousin introduced him to a man who promised him two hundred dollars for his dowry if he'd bring the suitcase to an address in Brooklyn. (to Hub) He's a cut-out. 
OUTSIDE THE ROOM -- LATER 
Hub hands Tina back the pack of cigarettes. 
HUB Nasty habit. (to Danny) 3830 Flatbush Avenue. 
FLASH CUT -- A SWAT TEAM 
Bursts into an empty apartment. On the floor, a fax machine continuously sending the message: "RELEASE HIM." 
BACK TO -- HUB 
HUB We want every rental agreement from every landlord in Brooklyn. Hotels, motels, flophouses... (to the other agents) It's cash, guys. They're the only ones in America using cash. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
The room is dark. A TECHNICIAN operates an overhead PROJECTOR. 
TECHNICIAN This is a spectograph of the semtex used in the bomb. Look at the benzene spike. This is the genuine article. (another slide) Now... this one's from the barracks in Dhahran. As you can see, the signature is identical. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
A COMPUTER TECHIE (WHITNEY) is cross-referencing data. DIGITAL PICTURES of suspected terrorists scroll past. A surveillance PHOTO of Ahmed bin Talal. The ruined army barracks. 
HUB -- ask it if they've ever hit buses? 
The techie types in a few commands: IMAGES of destroyed BUSES file past. Tel Aviv. Jerusalem. Beirut. None a match. 
WHITNEY -- not according to the mainframe. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
The BOMB SCENE now resembles an archeological dig. Floodlights on stanchions. Forensic EXPERTS, on their hands and knees, use BLACK LIGHT and brushes to search for latent prints. Different color STRING divides the site into a grid. 
HUB -- with a Q-tip. Bone shards, hair, fingernails -- 
Nearby, Danny and Mike observe Hub's intensity. 
DANNY -- He's way over his head. 
FRANK Shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
In THE LAB. A FINGERPRINT EXPERT sifts through a plastic bag of fingertips and teeth. Scans each into a computer. 
FINGERPRINT EXPERT Not yet. 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
Hub is STARING AT THE TV SETS which are all REPLAYING the terrible incident, over and over again. 
TV SOUND BITE "-- Today; Tel Aviv has come to Brooklyn. The question... is why." 
Finally, he turns away so no one will see. His eyes are hot with the emotion. 
WHITNEY You okay?

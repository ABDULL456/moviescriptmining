Day-Day opens it.  A PHONE starts to RING. 
ROACH What is it? 
DAY-DAY Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone. 
Roach skateboards over to the phone. 
ROACH Pinky's. 
Day-Day reads on. 
DAY-DAY It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow. 
CRAIG Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery? 
Day-Day goes for his bank book.  He flips a few pages. 
DAY-DAY 
CRAIG Okay, plan B. 
Day-Day is overwhelmed.  Roach skates back over. 
ROACH That was a girl on a cell phone.  She said she's outside in the parking lot waiting for you to take her to lunch. 
Day-Day looks at Craig.  He runs over to the door. 
OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT 
D'Wana sits in her car with her play sister BABY'D (her name does not fit her body). 
DAY-DAY Oh my God.  That's D'Wana.  And she got Baby'D with her. 
Day-Day locks the door and runs into the back.  Craig and Roach follow. 
CRAIG What's the matter? 
DAY-DAY D'Wana brought Baby'D up here. 
ROACH That the big one, huh? 
DAY-DAY You damn right that's the big one. 
The PHONE starts to RING again.  D'Wana and Baby'D are at the door.  D'Wana is on her phone.  Baby'D starts to knock. 
DAY-DAY (cont'd) Craig, go out there and tell 'em I'm gone. 
CRAIG I ain't trying to get in it. 
DAY-DAY You already in. 
The knocking gets louder. 
CRAIG No I'm not. 
ROACH I'll do it. 
DAY-DAY No.  You can't handle a girl like D'Wana. It's got to be Craig. 
AT FRONT DOOR 
They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign. 
D'WANA That white boy said he was in there. 
BABY'D Day-Day, don't make me break this window! 
Craig is peeking out.  He hesitates.

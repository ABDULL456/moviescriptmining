enters with a glass of water wrapped in a paper napkin and sets it on the bedside table.

It's odd: a convict's meticulousness. He moves the covers up to her chin. There is to his touch, tenderness, as if they were longtime lovers. 
We realize what we are seeing is the emotionality Neil McCauley keeps in the closet.

Neil is gone. He paused for that moment before he left, as if to engrave her image in his memory. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALBERT TORENA'S APARTMENT - ALBERT TORENA - DAY 
Answers the door. Daylight floods in past the silhouette of Hanna who shoves Torena in the chest, knocking him into the apartment. Hanna, following him in... 
HANNA You were supposed to get back to me last night. So where the fuck were you, Albert? 
ALBERT I couldn't break free, man! 
HANNA I oughta violate your ass right now. 
ALBERT I was all night hitting up Los vatos like one of those flamenco matador guys. Cuttin' in real smooth. Generating leads and shit. I'm a dancer, man! 
ALBERT TORENA'S an anorexic Latino fence. Hanna scans the apartment. Religious objects crowd the mantle. Fourteen stolen tv's in packing cases in the dining room. 
HANNA You're a bust-out speed freak jackin' metamphetamine again. (beat) I'm in a hurry. 
ALBERT You talk to my brother, Raoul. He meet you tonight at...

HANNA No.   Right now. 
ALBERT I implore him, man. But he say "no." (beat) He in Phoenix. Tonight's the best I can do for you. The Zebra on Crenshaw. Eleven o'clock. 
HANNA You be there, too. 
ALBERT Mon, I go 
HANNA Be there! 
Hanna leaves. 
INT - TRAILER - CEZAR KELSO - DAY 
CEZAR I picked you out to pitch it to first, but don't think you're the only action in town and I'm giving it away. 'Cause I'm not. 
CUT TO: 
WIDEN TO INCLUDE NEIL - who doesn't say anything.   CEZAR KELSO'S a large crippled man in a wheelchair. 
NEIL What is it? 
CEZAR A bank. On Thursdays it gets cash deposits for distribution to other branches. The branches have to buttress their cash accounts to handle Friday payroll checks from a Toyota and Nissan plant, a steel mill and two refineries. One day a week, Thursday, the main branch carries the full whack. 
NEIL You want a $100,000 advance, against a full 101. Why? 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org   34. 
CEZAR 'Cause I can get it. 'Cause this is the best thing I seen in three years. 'Cause a screw-up makes 10 percent of nothin' equal nothin'. And 'cause those are the terms and they ain't negotiable. 
NEIL On the prowl or strong? 
CEZAR Strong. Through the front door. During the day. 
NEIL How many guys? 
CEZAR Four.   Three plus a driver. 
NEIL That's not a $100,000 worth anything. You're giving me an address to what's strictly a cowboy score: "Get the guns and let's go!" We smash, grab and boogie while they hit the alarm. 
CEZAR Three alarms. And that's why the price. 'Cause you chop-in through the roof the night before on the prowl and bypass 'em. I got circuit diagrams, blue prints, the works. So yeah, they hit the alarms, but nothing gonna happen. 
NEIL Do I have to kill people? 
CEZAR I doubt it. Two men have the two keys to open the box. 
NEIL Full architectural, plumbing and electric, camera placements? 
CEZAR All of it. 
NEIL What do you estimate? 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org          35. 
CEZAR Eight point, one. Eight point, two million dollars. 
That gives Neil pause. Kelso gets satisfaction from Neil's reaction to the amount. Then: 
CEZAR (continuing) Where's Nate? 
NEIL He hadda make a call. (beat) You're on. (rising) Here's five grand earnest money. You get the rest after lunch. 
They shake hands. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRAILER COURT, PAY PHONE - NATE - DAY 
NATE Look, Van Zant. Nobody knew the merch was yours or they would have respected it. Be that as it may: now you get 100% from the insurance company and you're even, plus you can get the bonds back for 60 cents onna dollar. You make an additional 40%. Your operation doesn't skip a beat, and everybody's making out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MALIBU SECURITIES, VAN ZANT OFFICE - VAN ZANT - DAY 
On the phone to Nate. There's green forest and blue water dioramas inset into wood-panelled walls. 
VAN ZANT (into phone) Sure. You got a deal. 
NATE (0.   S.) (phone filter) Good. Cause there's    no percentage in everybody getting   their underwear in a twist   over this. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org          36. 
VAN ZANT (into phone) Absolutely. You have your man call me to set the meet. 
NATE (O.S.) (phone filter) Usually I'm the mailman. 
VAN ZANT (into phone) I don't want to involve extra people. What the fuck do I want all kinds of people meeting each other for? 
NATE (O.S.) (phone filter) Okay. 
VAN ZANT (into phone) Nice talking to you... (click) Van Zant hangs up. He's a tall avuncular man with a flabby belly and Arrow shirts: an accountant. HUGH BENNY, a very large juice collector, is in the office. 
HUGH (incredulous) You gonna deal with these people? 
VAN ZANT So word hits the streets it's okay to steal my stuff? I'm gonna kill the sonsa-bitches.

(1) Black Screen 
SOUND under: MUSIC building in INTENSITY as-- 
PRINCE (over) Dearly belov`ed, We are gathered here today To get through this thing called life. Electric word life, It means forever and that's a mighty long time. But I'm here to tell you that there's something else -- The afterworld. 
Then huge CU of EYES opening, gazing into mirror, HAND applying makeup, sudden BLACKNESS, then-- 
PRINCE (con't) That's right...a world of never-ending happiness, You can always see the sun -- Day or night. 
BURN IN MAIN TITLE:    PURPLE RAIN 
PRINCE (con't) So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills, You know the one -- Doctor Everything'll Be Alright-- Instead of asking him how much of your mind is left, Ask him how much of your time, `Cause in this life, Things are much harder than in the afterworld, In this life, You're on your own. 
Now,  pulsating COLOR -- FLASHES of hot, white LIGHT... 
PRINCE (con't) And if de-elevator tries to bring you down, Go crazy, punch a higher floor. 
and the BEAT provocative now, relentless, BUILDING with fierce intent to-- 
(2)  INT. CLUB (1ST AVE.  ST.  BAR) -- NIGHT 
The MECCA!  The last stop for a band before national fame. 
The HUGE cavernous HALL is PACKED! PEOPLE are DANCING like MAD! VIDEO SCREENS with WILD GRAPHICS hang suspended from the ceilings. Beautiful WAITRESSES criss-cross the floor in a frenzy. 
PRINCE is CENTER-STAGE -- LIPS caressing the mike, black, lustrous hair shining, eyes dancing -- SINGING "Let's Get Crazy" as the CROWD pulsates beneath the LASER  LIGHTS. 
The MUSIC  continues as we ...

(3) EXT.  STREETS #1 -- NIGHT 
A TAXI pulls UP with a SCREECH.  VANITY slouches in the backseat.  Black  boots, black skin-tight pants, and a mane of thick, black hair presents a beautiful and imposing  figure. Her eyes are large and dark -- her look open and ripe.  She knows what she's got, and doesn't make any excuses for it -- but the fact is she's scared as hell, possessing a  vulnerability that surprises her by its suddenness.  An expensive gold chain is fastened on one boot. 
She scrounges through her bag -- pulls out her remaining cash. It's drastically short of what she owes and she knows it. She tosses it onto the front seat, JUMPS from the cab, streaks across the street.  The CABBIE lets out a YELL and JUMPS out after her.

(4) INT.  SHOWER, MORRIS' APT. -- NIGHT 
MORRIS DAY stands in the shower, steam whirling about his face.  He's 22 years old, matinee-idol sexy with large, dark, bedroom eyes.  He headlines a slick techno-funk group called THE TIME which sports gangster suits and wide-brimmed hats. He's gifted with a wealth of self- laudatory humor which he uses like a knife, moving through life with a calm, but ruthless grace. 
Make no mistake, Morris is nobody's fool.   His seeming out-raceousness, his charm -- every move he makes is for a calculated effect.  He knows exactly what the ladies need, and doesn't mind reminding them should they forget ... 
He breaks into a wide grin.  Hair standing up like Don King, he wipes off a hand mirror, regards himself unabashedly as he brushes his teeth. 
"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

(5) INT.  BASEMENT,  PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT 
Prince sits in front of the mirror, finishes applying his makeup.  Black hair flowing, eyes wide and fantastic, he regards himself a moment before jumging up.  He puts on a high-collared overcoat, grabs his guitar  moves quickly to the basement window.  He hoists himself through it, disappears into the night.

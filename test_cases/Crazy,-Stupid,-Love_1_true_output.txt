CAL (LAUNCHING IN) Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver saw Tracy Boyle for the first time, walking the halls of Woodside Middle School -- 
TRACY Cal: are you seriously doing this in front of the kids? 
ROBBIE (QUICKLY) If it goes bad I'm supposed to take Molly upstairs and put the TV on loud. 
Tracy SIGHS, giving up. 
TRACY Well, might as well wait for your daughter. 
CAL She's right next to you, T. 
TRACY No, your other daughter. 
Huh? Just then: 
VOICE (O.S.) Hello? 
From inside the house steps out... 
HANNAH. 
CAL Nanna! 
HANNAH Hi, Daddy. 
WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes. 
JACOB Cal? 
(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (2) 94 CAL What the hell are you doing here? 
JACOB What the hell are you doing here? 
HANNAH Wait, you two know each other? 
TRACY (STILL BLIND) Hi, Nanna. 
CAL Wait, what's going on? 
ROBBIE Hey, Nanna. 
HANNAH Hey, Robbie. 
MOLLY Hey, Nanna. 
HANNAH Hey, cutie. 
JACOB WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!? 
HANNAH It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad? 
JACOB (REALIZING) Oh, God. 
CAL (FREAKING) I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE! 
HANNAH Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob. 
CAL No. No. No. No. 
(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (3) 94 TRACY I want to see the boyfriend! (STRUGGLING WITH SCARVES) Can someone please take this off? 
JACOB HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR- OLD DAUGHTER!? 
CAL I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR SENIOR YEAR HICCUP! IT'S WHY WE GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG! 
JACOB WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT? 
CAL YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY CHILDREN! 
HANNAH So you two, like, really know each other? 
CAL No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now. 
HANNAH Daddy!!! 
JACOB Well, that's not going to happen. CAL Well, then I'm going to murder you. 
HANNAH DAD! 
TRACY (down to two scarves) Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me! 
CAL Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother! (then, looking up) Bernie? 
(CONTINUED) 94 CONTINUED: (4) 94 SLAM! A body flies into Cal and knocks him OUT OF FRAME. It's Bernie! Behind him... 
JESSICA runs after her father, SCREAMING: 
JESSICA Daddy, no!

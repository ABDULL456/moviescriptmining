...NTW strikes her in the chops and EXPLODES, sending the larger woman SMASHING into concrete with UNPRECEDENTED FORCE. 
Now it's Angel Dust's turn to be broken, smoking, seemingly down for the count. NTW approaches carefully to make certain it's all over... 
...but Angel Dust shoots out an arm and GRABS her... DRAGS her in CLOSE... makes to SMASH her head like a walnut. 
ANGEL DUST C'mere, ya little bitch. 
NTW fights back valiantly, PUNCHING fast and hard with FLURRIES of ENERGY. Angel Dust is scorched and battered by the blows, but her adrenaline and rage SURGE. She grabs NTW around the neck, plants her into the ground... 
...and begins to CHOKE the life out of her.        NTW flails, cannot break Angel Dust's grip... 
...but marshals her last remaining energy to live up to her name... 
...and EXPLODE like an ALMIGHTY WARHEAD.         BOOM! 
CUT WIDE to a GARGANTUAN EXPLOSION.

The ship SHAKES VIOLENTLY, then starts to LIST at a DANGEROUS ANGLE. 
72   EXT.   FLIGHT DECK / CONTINUOUS                                       72 
DEADPOOL and AJAX are trading BLOWS again when the DECK SWAYS as if hit by a 9.0 EARTHQUAKE. Then with a thunderous, shuddering, groaning of metal the whole carrier begins to tilt. 
Loose wreckage begins to slide and tumble past. A shipping container barrels towards them and Deadpool kicks Ajax backwards, right into its path. SLAM! It plows into him and carries him with it as it disappears over the side. 
Deadpool scrambles and claws up the tilting floor and grabs hold of Vanessa. 
Deadpool looks around frantically... 
...and then spies the PUNCH-BOWL, sliding toward them. 
Deadpool grabs the side as it slides past and throws VANESSA inside and SHUTS the LID for protection... 
They slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom of the deck and hang there. Deadpool swings by one hand and stares at the scrapyard below. Huge chunks of metal slide and smash past to tumble to the ground a hundred feet below. 
Vanessa hangs onto Deadpool for dear life, her eyes locked on his... 
VANESSA If we survive this.   I'm gonna kill you. 
DEADPOOL We have so much to catch up on. 
...as the CARRIER topples in an AVALANCHE of STEEL! 
An EPIC collapse of SHRIEKING METAL. Flying glass. Nearly seismic booms. A mushroom CLOUD of thick, black destruction. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
73   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - RUBBLE PILE - DAY                                  73 
Black. A crack of light appears, dust sifting down through the beam.

More light, more dust and debris pattering down onto-some kind of scratched glass in front of the lens. Finally a hole of bright sky fills the frame. 
CUT TO: 
COLOSSUS vigorously TOSSING aside MASSIVE SLABS of STEEL as he digs through the wreckage, uncovering the PUNCH-BOWL, damaged, but intact. The LID CREAKS OPEN - pushed by Vanessa's TREMBLING HAND. 
Vanessa climbs out dazed, dusty, coughing. 
COLOSSUS You're OK.     Take it slow. 
Elsewhere in the rubble pile DEADPOOL's HEAD POPS UP from some DEBRIS, again, like the Caddyshack gopher. 
DEADPOOL I'm good. 
Deadpool is just staggering to his feet when AJAX emerges from under another BEAM and TACKLES him. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Â¡Caramba! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) For heaven's sake! 
The impact sends them both flying, rolling, over the edge of a metal container. They fall locked together, punching and grappling. They bounce/slide down the pile of rubble. 
Deadpool gets the better of the grappling and lands on AJAX's CHEST. He goes to TOWN with vicious FOREARMS and ELBOWS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Wham!   Wham! Wham! 
BAM! BAM! BAM. Bam. You can feel Deadpool's adrenalized catharsis. Ajax tries to block-CRACK! Deadpool shatters his elbow. Ajax other fist swings round, tags Deadpool, but he catches it, wraps it tight-SNAP! 
Ajax finally goes limp, both arms bent in horribly wrong directions. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (thrilled/exhausted) There are no words.

Deadpool pulls out BLIND AL's SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL and AIMS it right BETWEEN AJAX's EYES.

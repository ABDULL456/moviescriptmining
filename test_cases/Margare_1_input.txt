LIONEL Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop bombs on women and children? Isn't that just reverse sexism? 
KLEIN I don't know. That's an interesting point. I agree it's a bullshit term. 
LISA This is totally stupid. 
KLEIN (Looking for hands) Uhhhhhh...Monica! 
MONICA Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture -- 
ANGIE Thank you!

MONICA -- and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan! 
LISA They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces! 
MONICA ANGIE Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs -- Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop bombs on the Ku Klux Klan? LISA Because they're white? Yes! No! The Taliban! Do you wish they were LIONEL still there? There's six people with their hands raised before ANTHONY you, Lisa! The correct term is Afghans. 
MONICA 
(TO LISA) But I'm not even saying I disagree with you! I'm only saying I think it's pathetic the way people in this class treated Angie just for saying something they don't agree with. 
KLEIN Because that's censorship, right? Right? 
MONICA LISA Yeah! (a joke:) Right on! It's not censorship...! This class is not the ANGIE government! Thank you... ! 
ANTHONY That's not technically LEWIS true. It's censorship. 
LISA Oh my God, no it's not!

KARL Practicing your horseback riding? 
LISA 
(LAUGHS) Oh yeah, I'm really riding a lot. I'm gettin' these really bad saddle sores. 
_ KARL OK. Well. I would actually seriously recommend you go over to, uh, to Claremont Stables and see about getting some lessons. 
LISA No, I was actually really thinking about doing that... 
KARL So how's everything going? How's school? 
LISA School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in geometry... 
KARL 
OK...? 
LISA But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious... 
KARL Yeah. Math was never my strong suit either. 
LISA Well, I am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard-How are you?

KARL Well -- I don't either, per se. It 
somewhat depends on who it is, obviously... 
LISA Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop generalizing,now...! 
KARL OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your Mom. 
LISA 
OK, I can't wait for our trip.

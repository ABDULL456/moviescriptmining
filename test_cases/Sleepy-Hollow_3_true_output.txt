ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S YARD -- MORNING 
Young Ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not understanding.  Father loads a wagon full of belongings. 
FATHER We are leaving. (long pause) She has gone away. 
Realization comes to Young Ichabod.  He runs, away across the lawn as Father calls after him. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST TRAIL -- MORNING 
Young Ichabod runs, weeping. 
THIRD MAN (v.o.) She has confessed. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- MORNING 
Empty.  Doors are thrown open and Young Ichabod enters.  He goes down the aisle, towards the white door. 
THIRD MAN (v.o.) She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession. 
YOUNG ICHABOD Mother. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND WHITE DOOR -- MORNING 
Young Ichabod enters, halting.  The room contains TORTURE DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles. 
THIRD MAN (v.o.) Do you know what confession is? 
He walks, numb, eyes locked forward... 
In the corner is a SPIKED CHAIR, adorned with sharp iron spikes.  Hundreds of spikes.  It is fitted with straps for holding down the "accused." 
Tears stream down Young Ichabod's face.  He kneels, hands on the spikes of the chair, pressing hard. 
As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
In bed, Ichabod opens tear filled eyes.  He sits up, bringing his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks.  His hands trail blood. He looks to them... 
The old scars are bleeding. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Katrina comes to the door.  Ichabod is seated by the fire, eyes bleary, palms wrapped with bloodied cloth. 
KATRINA Constable Crane? 
Katrina comes beside Ichabod's chair. 
ICHABOD Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone. 
KATRINA What troubles you? 
She moves in front.  Ichabod gets up and crosses to sit facing away.  Katrina takes the chair he deserted. 
KATRINA The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them. 
ICHABOD No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it. 
KATRINA What has happened? 
Ichabod sits silent, puts his head back, eyes closed. 
ICHABOD Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance. 
KATRINA What? 
ICHABOD She is not your birth mother, is she? 
KATRINA No, but... why do you ask that? 
ICHABOD What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive? 
KATRINA She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about? 
ICHABOD Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. (pause) Lord, how I hate this place. 
KATRINA If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave? 
ICHABOD I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel. 
Katrina walks to him.  She touches his back. 
KATRINA Why are you so afraid of that?  Is there truly such harm in uncertainty? 
She kneels, smiles a little for him.  She reaches to touch his face, holds his head in her hands.  Leans to kiss him. 
He rests his head against hers, weary, putting his arms around her.  They kiss passionately. 
EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING 
Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- MORNING 
Ichabod exits his room, satchel in hand.  He looks down the hall, then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase. 
AROUND A CORNER, Ichabod comes to the last door.  He bends, slipping the white rose under the crack of the door. 
EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

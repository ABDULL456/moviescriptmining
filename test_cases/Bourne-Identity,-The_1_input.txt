BOURNE -- let me do this, okay? -- 
MARIE -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture -- (just apoplectic --) -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod -- 
Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and -- 
THE CONCIERGE (muffled but urgent) Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's going on? Is everything all right in there? (-- and she keeps banging and --) 
MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just impossible and -- 
Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and -- 
BOURNE bracing himself but -- 
CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely nowhere -- except -- 
THE WINDOW 
CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and -- 
EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY 
WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- sixty feet above the street -- 
Falling and falling and... 
IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and -- 
INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY 
THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and -- 
THE CONCIERGE (still outside the door--) --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- you give me no choice -- I'm calling them right away! -- 
BOURNE -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- where are your shoes? -- Marie -- 
MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just happened -- 
MARIE He's dead isn't he? 
BOURNE Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this -- 
MARIE He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that? 
BOURNE -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here -- 
MARIE He came to kill us. 
BOURNE -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- 
MARIE You knew he was coming. 
BOURNE No. 
MARIE I trusted you. 
BOURNE You're wrong. I didn't know. 
MARIE I don't trust anybody and I trusted you! 
BOURNE I didn't know this would happen. 
MARIE He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us! 
BOURNE And where is he now? (that gets her quiet) You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous. 
MARIE (totally overwhelmed) Oh, Jesus... 
BOURNE You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- (starting to back away --) But I can't stay here. I can't. 
MARIE But the police -- 
BOURNE -- there's no time --

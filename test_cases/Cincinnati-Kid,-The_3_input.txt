INT. HOBAN'S POOL ROOM - HOBAN AND THE SHOOTER 
We are in the front room where the pool tables are. Through an open door in b.g., we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker game in progress. 
HOBAN You going to tell The Kid, Shooter? 
SHOOTER Hell, I can't not tell him. 
HOBAN It's where he's been headed for years. 
The Kid enters the place through the front door, still a little dishevelled from his escape. 
KID (in greeting) Hey! 
HOBAN What you say, Kid? 
KID Hey, Hoban. 
SHOOTER Where you been? Boys been holding a chair for you in back. 
KID Business opportunity come along. Something too good to pass up. 
SHOOTER Turn a profit? 
KID Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had it took back. 
HOBAN Oh, one of those. 
SHOOTER (concerned) You been in too many rough ones lately, Kid. You can't go on forever, coming out in one piece. 
KID I got to build my stake, Aren't enough chances in this town to let one go. 
HOBAN You're too good, that's your trouble. People who know you're the Cincinnati Kid, they don't want to sit down with you -- 
KID For nickels and dimes... Thing is I've about used up St. Louis. 
SHOOTER (nodding) The streets are getting full of guys you've hustled. 
KID Been thinking about Miami. There's nothing to keep me here. 
SHOOTER (after a moment) The hell there isn't (as the Kid looks at him) Lancey Hodges' in town. 
KID Yeah? (then) The Man himself, here in St. Louis -- I might just stick around Shooter. 
INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM 
Lancey is on the phone, sitting on the bed. 
LANCEY (into phone) Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your enchanting wife?... Tomorrow is quite convenient... I generally prefer stud but you name it... Your stakes are my pleasure, sir... Thank you, why don't we make it after lunch? My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone else's appetite... A pleasure, sir. Please remember me to your charming wife. 
He hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him, as if he had been through too long a sustained effort. His eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply. 
EXT. HAROLD STREET - DAY 
Harold Street leads to the river and we follow The Kid and The Shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk. 
SHOOTER (lighting a cigar) I been seeing it coming for a long time, Kid. Long time. 
KID I ain't exactly been hiding it. 
SHOOTER No, you ain't been hiding it. 
KID Well I got to know. 
SHOOTER Sure, you got to know. We all got to know. 
KID Sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got. 
SHOOTER That's why I had to tell you.

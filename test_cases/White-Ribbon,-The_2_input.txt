BARON: Where did you see my son for the last time? TUTOR: Outside, in the courtyard. He said, he was going to play with the other children. BARON: Where? TUTOR: That he didn't say. BARON: And      my   wife   didn't   notice   anything either? TUTOR: After that business with the cabbage heads, Madame retired to her room. She was indisposed. BARON (sarcastically): Indisposed?! TUTOR: Yes. She had a terrible migraine attack. BARON (almost to himself): My God, this place is a zoo! He turns away and goes out into the courtyard. The tutor follow him with his eyes. He feels he's being badly treated and hates the Baron for his insults. Finally he goes back up the stairs. 
31. MANOR. EXT/NIGHT BACK TO THE SCENE. The torches of the feast have almost burned out. Here and there we see some lanterns, put there to facilitate the cleaning up. Coming from the front door, the Baron crosses the vast courtyard. Half way across he screams: BARON: Br√§ker!! The steward is overseeing a dozen farmhands, who are putting the tables and the benches of the feast back the barn. He walks toward the Baron. BARON. Have you seen my son? STEWARD (surprised): No. BARON (quietly): Could you please ask your boys. Apparently, Sigi has disappeared with a whole bunch of kids. STEWARD:    Immediately.   (shouting    to   the farmhands): When you're finished with the cleaning up, wait for me. There's still a job to do. Get some fresh torches and lanterns! BARON: In the meantime I'll go round up the men. 
The steward goes to his house, the Baron         to   the outbuildings. There, he switches on the SIREN. 
NARRATOR: The steward's children said, they had seen Sigi only for a short time, that he had gone off with other kids, and that they didn't pay much attention to it... 
32. MONTAGE EXT/INT/NIGHT IN THE COURTYARD. Many men of different ages with lanterns and torches. The Baron makes a short speech and the steward assigns the areas to be searched. Most of this is drowned out by the narrator's voice. 
NARRATOR: ...The search began shortly after midnight. Before, the Baron had ridden to the Rectory. But there he found out nothing new from the children who had been specially woken up. 
STABLE AND OUTBUILDINGS OF THE ESTATE. VARIOUS LANDSCAPES: FOREST, FIELD, RIVER MEADOWS. The search. The searchers, who were tired and some of whom were still drunk, were divided into two groups: one group started to search all the buildings on the estate, one by one, while the others combed the surrounding areas. It was around half past two, when some members of the search party had already preferred to lie down   somewhere   and   to   sleep  off   their drunkenness, that the siren suddenly sounded again, calling the men back to the courtyard... IN THE COURTYARD. The men come in with a stretcher. ...They had found Sigi. He had been tied up in the old sawmill, upside down. His trousers had been pulled down and his buttocks were bleeding from cane strokes. He seemed to be in a state of shock, was unable to walk and had to be brought back to the manor on a makeshift stretcher, lying on his belly. 
33. CHURCH INT/DAY The room is packed. The whole village is gathered. 
NARRATOR: The next Sunday, the Baron, at the end of the service, asked the pastor if he could say a few words:

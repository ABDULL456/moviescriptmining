DISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981 
A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange, self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up. The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Mark O'Brien has been going to UC Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien in the motorized gurney heading for class last week. 
The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus. Passers-by just go about their normal business. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) He had polio when he was 6 years old. The disease left his body crippled but his mind remained sharp and alert, and since he wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien entered Cal to major in English and learn his trade. 
We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark in his contraption. 
MARK (V.O.) Graduation Today I hear the crowd's applause Receive congratulations from my friends Today I ask if I've found a place among the rest I hope you see a man upon this stage Who studied...read..wrote, and passed the test In cap and gown, diploma on my chair 
THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS, rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles. 1A. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from Cal, one of 250 English majors to receive degrees today. 
The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the rest of the stage to thunderous applause. 
THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news reporter talks to camera. 
NEWS REPORTER If this report tells us anything, it is that a disability is not necessarily a handicap. 
In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered round him in a jubilant mood. 
NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D) Mark O'Brien teaches us that courage and perseverance overcome obstacles. With Mark O'Brien at UC Berkeley, Bill Hillman, Channel Five Eyewitness News.

SUPER CAPTION: "A FEW YEARS LATER" EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S.    NIGHT It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment. It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially-opened window. 
INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close-by. 
In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep. 2A. 
MARK (V.O.) Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean. Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life. 
Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung. 
It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches. He opens his eyes and grimaces. 
MARK Shit!

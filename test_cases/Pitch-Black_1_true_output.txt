CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back. 
Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator is long gone. 
IMAM (trembling) Please...have we been cut? Can someone tell me if.... 
He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again. Broken. 
In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws. 
PARIS Oh, sweet Jesus.... 
The bottle drops. 
The blood flows. 
The CLICKING STOPS. 
PARIS Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME LIGHT OVER HERE! 
Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him... 
Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur. 
Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly. 
RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey. 
CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out. 
CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS. Oblivious to all the attention she's getting. 
FRY What do you see? Riddick? 
RIDDICK Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger. 
EXT. SKY - NIGHT 
As clouds mass. 
EXT. NIGHT 
Into a rising wind, the survivors range on. 
Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly well, until... 
The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch from Audrey. 
FRY Bottle-count. 
AUDREY Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope? 
Good question. They've just been blindly following... 
The light on Riddick's back. 
FRY Can we pick up the pace? 
Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest, spotting... 
A sled-track. In front of them. 
Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see... 
Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun into the back of Riddick's neck. 
JOHNS We aren't completely stupid. 
FRY Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking -- 
IMAM We crossed our own tracks. 
JOHNS He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look! 
FRY Riddick? What the hell are you -- 
RIDDICK Listen.

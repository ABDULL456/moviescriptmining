INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights. 
A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the streets. 
The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting away on the radio. 
ERIC There.  That's Notre Dame. 
But before Zed can even look it has past by. 
RICARDO Do you like French cars? 
All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour. 
ZED (answering Enrique's question) Yes. 
RICARDO I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to seventy-five.  Very nice. 
ERIC Up here you can see the Eiffel tower. 
Zed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric. 
ZED Is tomorrow really Bastille day? 
ERIC Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history.  And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo. 
The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers. 
EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT 
The two cars are franticly racing through traffic. 
INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is they're going to. 
Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice. 
CLAUDE [Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat them!] 
Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke. 
EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT 
Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and cuts off Ricardo. 
INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric. 
RICARDO [Shit!  That bastard.] 
ERIC (to Ricardo) Watch it!  Don't crash my car. 
Eric takes a big hit. 
ERIC Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves.  Do you see? 
No, Zed doesn't see. 
Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows. 
OLIVER (out the window) Fucking fags! 
ERIC (also out the window) Suce ma bite?! 
RICARDO Perverts d'homosexuels! 
Eric laughs. 
ERIC (into Zed's ear) This is good to have you here.  We could not do this without you. 
Zed nods. 
ERIC Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.  That's good. 
Zed nods, delirious. 
ERIC You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.

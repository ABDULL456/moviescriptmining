The cops are still talking to Fogell. He looks completely flustered. He's lost his composure. 
OFFICER SLATER Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's no need to get irrational. 
In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we see DRIVER of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is lying, apologizing frantically. 
OFFICER MICHAELS A lot of people have strange names these days. 
(CONTINUED) 61   CONTINUED:                                                       61 
OFFICER SLATER I once arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Pearl Necklace." 
FOGELL It's just... I changed my name. I was going to be a singer. R&B. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Fine. That's not illegal. 
OFFICER SLATER And, how old are you McLovin? 
Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again. 
FOGELL Old enough. 
OFFICER SLATER Old enough for what? 
OFFICER MICHAELS Can I see your ID? 
FOGELL Um...okay... 
Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads of sweat are running down Fogell's face. 
In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth. 
OFFICER SLATER You're an organ donor? 
FOGELL What? 
OFFICER SLATER I didn't want to be one but my wife insisted. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Just like a woman. Even after you're dead, they want to tear your heart out. 
The officers start laughing. Fogell is shocked. They hand back the ID. 
(CONTINUED) 61   CONTINUED: (2)                                               61 
FOGELL Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't really have any information. I didn't really see him. His fist hit here. 
Fogell points at his giant black eye. 
OFFICER MICHAELS Are you in a hurry or something? 
FOGELL Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a bus. 
OFFICER SLATER Where were you going? 
FOGELL Umm... near thirteenth and Granville. 
OFFICER SLATER We'll take you there, get your information on the way. Sit tight. 
Fogell is completely dumbfounded. 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 
The driver is pleading with Seth and Evan. 
DRIVER I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you at all. Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm sorry, man. Look, what can I do? Are you okay? 
The driver glances at the cop car. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) I mean, please don't report me, we can figure this out, okay? 
SETH Why wouldn't I report you? 
DRIVER Because I'll do anything! Please! Anything! What can I do? 
SETH You have any money? 
(CONTINUED) 62   CONTINUED:                                                        62 
EVAN (quietly to Seth) What are you doing? 
DRIVER (beat) Fine. Just take it. 
The driver reaches into his pocket and hands Seth some money. Seth looks at it. It's seven dollars. 
SETH What is this? This isn't enough. 
Seth stuffs the money in his pocket.

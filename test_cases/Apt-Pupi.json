{"train": "APT PUPIL by Brandon Boyce \nApt Pupil \nby \nBrandon Boyce \nThrough the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of small, middle-class houses.  This could be any suburban street in America. \nINT. CITY BUS - DAY \nA boy is seated near the back of a moving bus.  This is TODD BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come.  He stares out at the other passengers indifferently.  Then something catches his eye. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY \nTODD Call them if you want. \nDUSSANDER Fine. \nThe heavy door slams shut. \nTODD It's okay by me Herr Kommandant.  I'm sure the police would love to meet the \"Blood- fiend of Patin.\" \nDUSSANDER You'll do no such thing. \nTODD I won't?  Listen, old man, if I want to start screaming right here, I will.  If I want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself, then I will.  I will do what ever I want.  Do you understand? (pause) But if you like, I could come in for a minute.  We could talk. \nPause. \nDUSSANDER I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home. \nDussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old man.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary.  Todd looks around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle.  But he doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of a woman sits framed on an end table. \nDUSSANDER My wife.  She died in 1955 of lung disease. At that time I was working at the Menschler Motor Works in Essen.  I was heartbroken. \nTodd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a lampshade next to the photograph.  He begins to feel it as though he were inspecting it for something. \nDUSSANDER (CONT'D) Stop that! \nDUSSANDER Denker.  Denker.  Denker.  You don't listen, boy.  The television has fried your brain. \nPause. \nTODD Your hands are shaking. \nDUSSANDER Yes, they're shaking.  I'm old.  We all shake.  You are most tiresome, and rude.  Now if you have a point I wish you'd come to it. \nTODD Of course, I followed you.  You think I normally go around to peoples' houses and accuse them of being Nazi fugitives? \nDUSSANDER Perhaps for me you made an exception. \nTODD No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt Dussander I had to be absolutely certain. ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here. \nTodd sits on the sofa. \nDUSSANDER Your what? \nTODD My One Great Interest.  Well, not you personally, but, ...well, it's something I learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher, Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our One Great Interest in life.  You know, the thing that would really grab us.  Once we did that, everything would fall into place.  Like hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I guess there's no money in that, so she has to be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing happened.  Until the following summer, in Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found it. \nINT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY \nTodd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in the corner of the garage.  We see that the boxes are filled with old war magazines.  Ronny tosses several of them to the ground as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse.  Ronny selects one Penthouse and rifles through it.  He discards it a moment later. \nAs young Todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes in... \nTODD (CONT'D) It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd never seen, stuff they never put in the books anymore, especially the ones they give us to read.  And here were stacks of them. \nINT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nTodd speaks excitedly.  Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges him. \nTODD You know, accelerated.  I skipped two grades, second and ninth.  I didn't need them. That's why I'm already a junior. \nDussander sits. \nDUSSANDER I see... \nTODD Some kids resent me for it.  That's not important.  Anyway, my paper really floored my history teacher.  I guess because I got through all those books without throwing up. But I learned something.  I learned that when you talk about the camps now, you have to remember to sound really disgusted.  I mean, you can't just say what happened like the magazines did and leave it at that.  If I tried that the teacher would have freaked and called my parents in. \nTODD What? \nRONNY (suddenly wary of Todd) Your mom's on the phone. \nANGLE on Todd. \nINT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nDUSSANDER I am sure you trouble your parents to no end. \nTODD Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's what my dad says. \nDUSSANDER You told your parents about me, then? \nTODD You think I'm crazy? \nTODD And then it happened... I was on my way to the library.  It was raining... \nFLASHBACK: INT. CITY BUS - DAY \nTodd's voice narrates what we are seeing.  Todd, seated near the back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard.  Todd thinks nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take his eyes off him.  Todd is trying to place the old man's face in his mind... \nTODD (V.O.) You climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle.  Just like you were examining a new batch of inmates.  I don't think anybody gave you a second glance but me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out of your way.  And under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella.  But what really did it, what really set me off was the coat.  You were wearing this long black rain coat.  My mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at Patin.  You in your S.S. greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm. \nHe storms toward the kitchen and stops. \nDUSSANDER (CONT'D) Would you care for a drink, boy? \nTODD Sure, you got a Coke? \nDUSSANDER No Kok. \nTODD It takes eight good matches, they're called compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get accepted in court. \nDUSSANDER (O.S.) Is that right? \nFLASHBACK: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY \nTodd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly.  He pulls the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the mailbox for prints. \nTODD Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it. \nINT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY \nHe reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks. \nTODD I found fourteen compares. \nDUSSANDER (CONT'D) You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a smiling cow. \nTodd pauses and then begins to drink. \nDUSSANDER (CONT'D) (more to himself than Todd) ...And two missing children. (pause) Boy what you have done, I have to explain this to you because clearly you don't understand, what you have done is a violation. \nTODD A violation? \n", "test1_input": "DUSSANDER (O.S.) All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it go! \nTodd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle. Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth, he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein. Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly cannot. \nDUSSANDER (continuing) A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't you read?  I thought all American boys could read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day. \nThe door begins to close.  Todd waits till the last moment before speaking. \n", "test1_true": "The door stops.  Dussander opens it slowly.  He unlatches the screen and slips his fingers around the paper.  Todd does not let go. \nDUSSANDER Give me my newspaper. \nTODD Sure thing, Mr. Dussander. \n", "test1_id": 1161, "test2_input": "Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door. Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's bicycle. \nDUSSANDER My name is Denker.  See? (pointing) Denker.  Perhaps you cannot read after all. What a pity.  Good day. \nAs the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap. \nTODD Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44.  Then you went to Patin. \n", "test2_true": "TODD (CONT'D) After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires. From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know.  No one does.  But in 1965, you popped up in West Berlin, where they almost got you. \nThe door opens wider. \nDUSSANDER Listen, boy.  I don't know what is the matter with you.  But I don't have time for this game.  Now, get out of here before I call the police. \n", "test2_id": 1162, "test3_input": "TODD Well, it wasn't that easy.  I mean, I had to really check up on it.  And every picture of you in those books is forty years old, at least.  I went back to the library to find the picture.  And then I matched it with the photos I took. \nDUSSANDER You took photographs of me? \nTODD Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right in the palm of my hand. \nDUSSANDER (crunches cigarette into ashtray) Clever boy. \n", "test3_true": "DUSSANDER You... put dust on my mailbox?  For fingerprints?  You took photographs of me? What else did you do?... I don't believe any of this. \nTODD I already had a copy of your fingerprints. They're on your want sheet from the Israeli government.  It's on database at UC Irvine. Can you believe that? \nDUSSANDER Bourbon. \n", "test3_id": 1163}

The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the cockpit alongside VICKI. 
Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of the alley at ninety miles an hour. 
THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off. 
JOKER I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!! 
The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind him, the other half into a second car nearby. 
EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT 
SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim. 
INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT 
roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC. 
VICKI Look! Police! 
BATMAN I called them. 
VICKI Shouldn't we -- 
A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response. 
INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT 
TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out from the front of the van. 
GOON There they are! Dead ahead! 
THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE. 
JOKER ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW! 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the streets, eager to join the chase. 
SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS 
COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path. 
INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT 
PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE PAVEMENT. 
VICKI What about her? What about the girl? 
BATMAN He won't kill her. (gritting his teeth) GODDAMMIT! 
They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION. 
BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on collision with a lamppost. 
He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast. 
ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a crowd around them. 
VICKI Can't we -- 
BATMAN Too many people. Come on! (as she scrambles out) SHIELDS!! 
The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies: 
COMPUTER Shields. 
With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL. 
BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble. 
INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT 
THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE. 
GOON AT WHEEL Are they ours? 
JOKER ... I don't know. We'd better get out of here. (into RADIO MIKE) Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY?? 
The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately down the street. 
EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS. 
INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT 
FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio: 
GOON I We got 'em! 
JOKER (V.O.) (over radio) Take 'em! I want his head! 
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

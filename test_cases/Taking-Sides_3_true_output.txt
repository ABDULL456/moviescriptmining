German modern paintings stacked untidily. 
Dymshitz, carrying a vodka bottle and his glass, shows Steve the paintings. Steve, too, has a glass. 
DYMSHITZ A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone. 
STEVE That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini. 
Dymshitz pours vodkas, raises his glass, drinks. So does Steve. Now, their moods swing with the drink. 
Dymshitz drinks; then sits, sinks into his own world. 
DYMSHITZ (lost for a moment) Perhaps... perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important, things like an orchestra, a school. That's his country. Maybe he has an old mother who can't be left alone. Maybe he has brothers, sisters... you can't... 
A forlorn look at Steve. His eyes are misty, he is visibly drunk. 
STEVE (a wry smile) Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs. 
DYMSHITZ Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why? 
STEVE But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel? 
DYMSHITZ (suddenly exploding) Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship! 
STEVE (dismissive) Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that. 
DYMSHITZ (angry) In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises. 
STEVE This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts. 
DYMSHITZ There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges. 
Pause. 
DYMSHITZ And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example. 
STEVE What museum? 
DYMSHITZ I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. (another sudden change of mood to earnest, intimate) Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve. 
STEVE No can do. 
DYMSHITZ Let Furtwängler go. Please.

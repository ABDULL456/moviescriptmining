CHARLOTTE He's here. And he's staring at me again. 
SHANNON No way! 
Both Shannon and Simon turn to look, but like lightning Charlotte grabs them both -- 
CHARLOTTE Don't! (to Simon) Wait a few seconds, then go to the bathroom. 
SIMON How will I know him? 
CHARLOTTE He's beautiful. And much older. 
SIMON Really? (getting up) If he's rich you might have a fight on your hands. 
Charlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his chair and walks over. As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive smile. Wills is confused by it. 
CHARLOTTE Okay, look. 
Shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare in Wills' direction. Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth agape -- 
SHANNON He's as old as my dad! 
Charlotte laughs. 
BACK ON WILLS. He does his best to be attentive as Dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face -- 
DOLLY Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a New Englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf. 
WILLS It only took me twenty years to come to my senses. 
DOLLY So what're you doin' now? You owned some restaurants out there, didn't you? 
ON CHARLOTTE. She sits listening to Shannon -- 
SHANNON And so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! Nothing but losers and -- 
Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening -- 
CHARLOTTE Oh, shit. 
SHANNON What? 
Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm -- 
DOLLY Kids! I want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment -- Wills Keane! 
The table greets him. Wills, slightly self-conscious, looks at everyone but Charlotte. 
DOLLY And that over there's the birthday girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte. 
The news hits Wills hard. But he does his best to hide it. He musters a casual smile -- 
WILLS Not Katie and Jay's daughter? 
DOLLY You bet. She got her height from her dad. But her talent's all Katie's. 
Dolores indicates the hat that Charlotte's wearing -- 
DOLLY Made it herself from scratch. That one, too. (to Shannon) Honey, show 'im. 
Shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat she's wearing. The table laughs. 
Wills levels his gaze at Charlotte -- 
WILLS Impressive. 
Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, Charlotte can't help but grin. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks. 
The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him -- 
WILLS I think we can do better than that. 
The steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the champagne with him. 
WILLS Happy birthday, Charlotte. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks. 
SHANNON (under her breath) Twenty years old and never been... 
CHARLOTTE (laughing) Shut up! 
Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile. 
WILLS I'll let you get back to your celebration. (kissing Dolly's cheek) A pleasure to see you again.

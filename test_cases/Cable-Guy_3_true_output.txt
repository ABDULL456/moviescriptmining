He leaves. Robin looks relieved to have a break. 
47	INT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Ray enters the restroom. The Cable Guy is now wearing the bathroom attendant's blue shirt white pants and a thin fake moustache. A DISTINGUISHED MAN walks over and washes his hands. 
MAN (to Cable guy) Towel please. 
CABLE GUY My pleasure. 
The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're dry. The man is aghast. 
CABLE GUY Enjoy your meal 
The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls. 
CABLE GUY Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't it? 
RAY (curt) Yeah. 
CABLE GUY But I guess the weather's always pleasant in here. The winters are remarkably mild. 
He laughs at his own joke. Ray walks into the handicapped stall. 
CABLE GUY (OS) If you need anything, just let me know. Anything at all. 
RAY (getting annoyed) I think I can handle it. 
Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him. 
CABLE GUY I'm here to serve you. 
RAY Jesus! Get out of here! 
CABLE GUY Most people never bother to take advantage of all my services, for instance  
The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong. 
CABLE GUY I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is so very important. 
He pulls his face out. CABLE GUY Then once you're done I have a variety of skin care products which can make you look years younger. 
The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion. 
CABLE GUY This lotion is superb at removing liver spots. 
He slaps it onto Ray's face. 
CABLE GUY This one is an excellent moisturizer. 
The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's about to put it on Ray's face. 
CABLE GUY And one can never underestimate the effects of a good cologne. 
The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face. 
CABLE GUY (sniffs) Mm High Karate. And now a touch of powder. 
He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him. 
CABLE GUY (grabs a tweezer) Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very important to be properly tweezed. 
The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows. 
CABLE GUY You're on a big date, you'll need fresh breath. 
He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth. 
CABLE GUY Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that reminds me. Proper hair care is a must. 
The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part. 
CABLE GUY Looking good, now let's dry you off. 
He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable Guy puts his face right up next to the air. 
CABLE GUY Now suck it. Suck the air!

Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from under the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls Dmitri into an open wall panel. 
IVAR (angrily) You're a servent! Never forget your place! 
DMITIRI (defiant) Someday my place will be out there! 
IVAR Never! You're a peasant, Dmitri! Back in the kitchen 
RULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.) 
UNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from his hiding place under the table and back to the kitchen. It's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICAL CONFUSION. The servants sing about their demanding employers and mockingly imitate their behavior:  they imply that they have their own "party",  that change is coming. 
While back in the ballroom, the Royalists are oblivious to the servants discontent and sing their satisfaction with their own lives. 
DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following scenes. 
ON TATIANA 
in a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious and very regal. She slides over to make room for Anastasia who sits next to her. 
TATIANA Why were you so late tonight 
ANASTASIA I was showing Sonya something . . . 
TATIANA What were you showing her? 
ANASTASIA (sheepishly) How to read. 
TATIANA I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore. 
ANASTASIA I know, but I had to because . . . 
Anastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with pride.  Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain. 
ANASTASIA (cuddling) Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris? 
TATIANA It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . . 
Tatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a beautiful MUSIC BOX.  Tatiana takes the key, a small silver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and winds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key. 
CLOSE UP 
the key bearing the inscription "Together in Paris". 
ANASTASIA "Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?! 
TATIANA When you're older . . . 
Anastasia makes a disgruntled face. Tatiana laughs. 
TATIANA Until then, whenever you hear this song, think of me and know that I'm waiting for you.

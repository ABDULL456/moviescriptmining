LENNY MEYER We're pure. Give us the number! 
MAX The number is nothing. You know that! 
RAV COHEN We can use it. We can wield it. 
MAX It's just a number. I'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen number. You've translated all of them. You've intoned them all. Haven't you? But what's it gotten you? It's not the number! It's the meaning. It's the syntax. It's what's between the numbers. If you could understand you would. But it's not for you! I've got it. I understand it. I'm going to see it! (Whispers to Rav Cohen) Rabbi...I was chosen. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY 
Max races through the streets of New York. He is wide-eyed. 
MAX (V.0.) Suddenly, it's all there. It all makes sense. I can crack it. I can know it. I know what it is. Sol knows, too. I need to tell him. I need to show him. I need to bring him with me. People fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind. 
EXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell. 
The door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful woman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON and she is Sol's niece. 
JENNY ROBESON Can I help you? MAX (Confused) Sol? JENNY ROBESON Were you a friend? MAX What do you mean? JENNY ROBESON He had a second stroke. MAX Where is he? Jenny's eyes drop. 
MAX No. Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P, research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of retirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a piece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is THE number. Max slides it into his pocket. 
Max looks at the Go board. The pieces are arranged in a giant spiral across the board. 
DISSOLVE TO 
INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Max sits on his bed staring at Sol's handwritten number. Then he notices that his thumb is twitching. He drops Sol's note. 
MAX Stop it, please!

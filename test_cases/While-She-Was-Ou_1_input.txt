The Plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud. 
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
She closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the car, clutching the toolbox and the wrench. She reaches back into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash. Pop. She softly closes the door again. Punches her way through the branches. Slides her fingers under the hood, pries up the lever. It pops up only a few inches. 
DELLA Damn! 
She tries to manually lift it. But it's heavy with the weight of pine branches. 
Voices drift towards her. 
TOMAS (O.S.) Keep hitting on the gas and you gonna dig them wheels into a dirt grave. 
CHUCKIE (O.S.) Save yo talk and get out and push. 
The sound of car doors opening, feet squishing into the mud and cussing. The boys materialize in the light from the headlights. 
TOMAS Hell, no. 
HUEY Shit! 
Scene 77Page 41 
CHUCKIE (O.S.) What's aggravating you now? 
HUEY Our new sneakers are stuck up in the dirt like they was last years. 
Doors slam and two sets of footsteps join the others. 
CHUCKIE Soon as we taken care o' Mrs. Podunk you and the Spanish dancer can hit the next mall. But first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth. 
VINH Stupid ass car got nowhere else to go. There's nothing but trees up ahead. 
TOMAS Screw the car, Chuckie. Case you forgot we got a witness on the loose! I ain't want to end up in the clink as some chimp's prison pillow. 
CHUCKIE Trust me dog, hoe's going down execution style before we see the other side o' them bars. 
Della drops the hood. It makes a faint squeak but doesn't slam down, seems it's stuck open these last few inches. 
TOMAS Yo talk a real mob threat, Chuckie. But what if she gone already? 
Chuckie's eyes scan the housing estate. 
CHUCKIE She ain't gone. 
Della frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the hood. But some larger branches are jammed, wedged by the broken tree. 
When she looks back over for the boys she sees the car headlights are off and there's no sign of them. 
Scene 77Page 42 
She stands stock still, listening, scanning the landscape for a sign of them. 
The sound of glass shattering breaks the silence. 
Della jumps out of her skin, spins around. Her eyes settle on a light in the distance. 
EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING 
The light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving truck. The cabin glows like a box in the darkness. There's a figure inside: it's Chuckie. He's inspecting a powerful construction flashlight. He switches settings from broad light to concentrated beam. He points the beam through the broken glass window onto Tomas, who's standing on a truck tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow. Chuckie leaps down through the broken window, pleased with his find. 
He switches it to broad beam, whistles. 
CHUCKIE Won't be long before we find her now. This baby could spot a needle in a haystack! 
The light dances around illuminating each of their faces for seconds at a time. Eerie distorted glimpses. They're traipsing along the rough road, through the mud, towards Della. Their voices grow louder. 
HUEY We caught up in this bitch's life like a soap opera. We could just bail, blast out of town like we was never here. 
CHUCKIE This boy loves weed so much he tried to marry Juana. 
HUEY Ain't no one cares about the Rent-a- Pig. He just collateral damage to the peeps at the mall. 
Chuckie pushes Huey half playfully, half annoyed. 
CHUCKIE Listen up skippy: SHE THE ONLY WITNESS. 
Scene 78Page 43 
HUEY But if we hit the road now we'll be five hundred miles away before they find him....we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin' in the Atlantic....just like you promised. 
Huey stares off into space like he's having a vision.

The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by the rising sun. Below them, the convoy is thundering down a winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range. 
INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
A RADAR DISH on the rear Cougar sweeps vigilantly. Inside, a SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER watches the RADAR MONITOR, clear except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks. 
INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out. 
RIPCORD Hey Duke, ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs? 
DUKE Keep your eyes on the road, Rip. 
RIPCORD And you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty? 
DUKE Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty of thoughts up there. (into radio) Keep rear security tight, boys.

RIPCORD Funny. Real funny. 
DUKE I don't wanna transfer to the Air Force, okay? 
RIPCORD It's always about you, isn't it? Give me one good reason?

RIPCORD Won't be saying that when you call in an air strike and I come screaming in to save your-- 
DUKE --Eyes on the road, Rip. 
EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
Behind the Blackhawks and the convoy an ominous, DARK SHAPE suddenly drops INTO FRAME. ENGINE EXHAUST blurs our view of the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy. 
INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
On the rear Cougar's RADAR SCREEN, we see the two Blackhawk signatures still appearing in position.. .but nothing else.

PILOT Holy... LET'S GYRATE! 
As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for auto-gyration.  But the bank they started is working against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling like a huge steel feather. 
Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees ocean rushing up at him.  Fast. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
MCCOOL What the shit is... 
Jordan whirls.  She's just in time to witness... 
The helo hitting the water.  In seconds it's gone. 
A stunned beat.  We never knew the ocean could be this quiet.  When the anesthetic of shock wears off: 
SLUTNIK You don't suppose this is just part of... 
JORDAN FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for? 
Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB, inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs like a dog to find a radio. 
JORDAN Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We have a downed helo 12 miles west- south west of base with three aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed helo with three aboard... 
Slutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard MOTOR ROARS to life.  The boat does a donut in the water and blasts away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
The ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow, nose to the wind like a hunting dog. 
FLEA CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE! 
Slutnik motors down. 
FLEA Close as I can get, el-tee! 
JORDAN Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO! 
They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins. Jordan snaps up the radio. 
JORDAN Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo? Over. 
BASE (V.O.) Crew Leader, we have a Medevac rerouting from Long Beach, but no other helos prepped at this time. Seafox One and Two are launching now.  Over. 
A beat. 
JORDAN Base, don't think you copied me.  We are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out at 30 knots, which makes it a no- show for 18 minutes.  Over. 
BASE (V.O.) You copied right, Crew Leader. We're looking for options ourselves. 
SLUTNIK Maybe we should call the Coast Guard. 
JORDAN Shut your hole, Slutnik. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
McCool surfaces. 
MCCOOL Visibility drops dead at 40 feet. If they're deeper than that... 
The others surface and swim in. 
CORTEZ Nobody's comin' outta that crash, el-tee.  Nobody. 
A grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.  With a voice seemingly from the far side of the moon: 
THE CHIEF (V.O.) Base, this is Basher One.  I've got a small problem here.  Do you copy? 
Jaws drop. 
JORDAN (into radio) Basher One, this is O'Neil.  We are barely reading you.  What is your situation? 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf.

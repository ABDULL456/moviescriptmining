Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position. \nShe stares at him. \nTALAMASCAN #3 For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior.

That is called running. \nTALAMASCAN #2 (leaning forward, trying to help) But, Jesse, tell us, what did you see? \nJesse turns to her. \nJESSE Vampires.   Gathering.   I'm sure of it. \nJesse steps from the podium, moving through the Talamascans as she pleads her case. She talks a mile a minute, her passion rising... \nJESSE You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics.

Plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years Lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. He refers to Marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the Bay of Naples in the late 18th Century. What I'm trying to say here, and maybe I'm not doing the best job of it, is that Lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented! \nJesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening. But Talamascan #1 shakes his head... \nTALAMASCAN #1 It doesn't make any sense. Why would he be forecasting this to the world? He's all but drawn a map and marked an X. What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. They'd be hunted down. \nJESSE Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know why... (glancing at skeptical Talamascan #1) But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution. \nAll the Talamascans gaze at her a moment.       Jesse holds her breath.

(snorts) C'mon. It looks like the Blair witch! \nThe Talamascans burst out laughing, even Talamascan #2. Jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. She's lost them, blown it. Made a fool of herself. \nHer frustration rises, she can no longer contain it.       It bursts out of her. \nJESSE Fine. Well then, I guess I'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here! \nAs they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her materials, starts out. Several start shouting back at her. Amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room. \nTALBOT (O.S.) Jesse. \nEveryone turns. Quiets down. DAVID TALBOT stands in the back of the room. He's clearly the superior Talamascan, though younger than some, very charismatic. \nTALBOT My office.   Now. \nHe turns, walks out. All the Talamascans look at Jesse. It doesn't look good.

A huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees... \nAn indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting. Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when... \nLestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly... \nThe sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck. Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally... \nThe strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious figure.

They'll send an army of men to look for me. \nMARIUS I doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long way from home... \nHis strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the floor. \nMARIUS You're weak... near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat. \nLESTAT I'll kill you! \nMarius smiles, impressed. \nMARIUS You really do fear nothing. It is why I chose you. Because you think things are possible which aren't possible... \nLestat stares at him, his eyes wide. \nLESTAT Chose me? For what? \nMARIUS My companion.

You've been brave enough for one night, my son. \nMarius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips. Lestat hesitates, but then suddenly... Feeds hungrily as Marius's face fills with the bond.

Lestat, no more! \nWith one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. Marius reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the rush. \nSlowly, Lestat starts to feel something. Pain begins travelling through his body, consuming him until he screams. Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the floor. He kneels and gently wipes his brow. Lestat's body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs... \nMARIUS Don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies... \nWiping his brow as he dies... \nThen, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins to laugh almost drunkenly. Raising his head, his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power. \nLESTAT More! \nLestat smiles with red glistening lips.     A beat on Marius as he slowly smiles, too. \n54   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                             54 \nA million stars... \nLESTAT (V.O.)

When you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death. You must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die... \nThe fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength, drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat. Water starts bubbling in. \nMARIUS Remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, Lestat. A man wears his history on his skin... \nMarius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him. \nMARIUS I'm talking about humanity. \nAs Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom of the boat... \nLESTAT Humanity? (snort) We're murderers. \nMARIUS We're more than that. Their blood that we take into us carries with it life... their life, their knowledge, their complexity. Appreciate your prey, Lestat. \nMarius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean. \n55   EXT.

My solace, my delight, is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny... \nLestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual fervor.

BACKSTAGE - MEANWHILE                                   177 \nRoger is trying to manage the building chaos backstage as the FIRE MARSHAL and several firemen follow after him. \nFIRE MARSHAL You don't have a permit for any of these stunts! \nROGER I told you I don't know anything about it! \nA WALKIE-TALKIE distracts the Fire Marshal long enough to allow Roger to run. \n(CONTINUED) \n177   CONTINUED:                                                      177 \nROGER Last time I work for a bloody vampire... \nLooking up at the sky, he stares in awe... There is a low powerful RUMBLE... \nThe mortal crowd looks around, distracted from their panic, as they sense something truly awesome... \n178   LESTAT                                                          178 \nsenses it too. He looks up, not knowing from which direction the attack will come. The STAGE starts to SHUDDER and SHAKE violently... \nJesse, now almost to the stage, screams to him. \nJESSE Lestat!    Lestat! \nSuddenly the wooden platform beneath Lestat begins to buckle under his feet. Fragments of WOOD EXPLODE upwards around Lestat. Marius loses his balance and staggers backwards... \nFragments of sharp wood fly into the audience. Jesse raises her hands to protect herself. She looks up. Freezes. Akasha rises up through the stage. Beautiful and terrifying. She grabs Lestat and the two of them shoot up into the air. The crowd stares in awe. Jesse is frozen. \nRoger, the Fire Marshal, the band, everyone is frozen. Talbot stares up at Akasha, his face white, unable to believe his eyes. Even the Ancient Ones are stunned to see their Queen come to life. \nScaffolds collapse in an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL SPARKS... (NOTE: Practical explosion.) The Ancient Ones stare up into the sky as... Akasha and Lestat vanish. Jesse stares in horror after them. \n179   EXT. SKY - EVENING                                              179 \nBLACKNESS. \n180   EXT. DEATH VALLEY PEAK - NIGHT                                  180 \nLestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the desert, the tiny lights of the concert far below. \n(CONTINUED) \n180   CONTINUED:                                                      180 \nLestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him Akasha in an extravagant Egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold draping her godly form. Lestat is awestruck. Akasha comes to life... \nLESTAT Akasha... \nAkasha still says nothing -- she advances with a luscious, curling smile. \nAKASHA Why so surprised, my love?    You called, and I have come. \nLestat is awestruck. There is such an unearthly power in Akasha's voice. Everything seems to hum and vibrate with her breath. \nAKASHA Never fear me, Lestat. Your wishes have all come true. \nLESTAT My wishes...? \nAKASHA You have yearned for a companion to share eternity. You have cried out to the world. I have answered your call. \nAkasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to Lestat. \nAKASHA You are so bold, like your music. It woke me. You live your life in the open, like I did long ago, when I had a King. \nLESTAT Had a King? \nAKASHA He's no more. You are my consort. I've kept you safe -- alive. \n", "test3_id": 2879}

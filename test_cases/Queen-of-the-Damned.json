{"train": "QUEEN OF THE DAMNED \nWritten by \nScott Abbott and Michael Petroni \nBased on the novel by \nAnne Rice \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               1 \nAn empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth- century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance. \nVOICE (V.O.) There comes a time for every vampire when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable... \nAs we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal: \nA FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb, silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird. \nVOICE (V.O.) The wounds suffered from love and failed friendships don't heal like a human's, but seem to only gape larger. The longing to be mortal returns, a longing for finiteness. \nA beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night... \nCUT TO: \n2   OMITTED                                                     2 \n4   EXT. TOMB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               4 \nThe figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door. \nVOICE (V.O.) In 1883 I suffered such a spell and decided to cease feeding on blood. Just lie in the earth and let time return to its natural state... \nAs the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up. Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns all around the tomb. \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                    4 \nVOICE (V.O.) I had hoped the sounds of the passing eras would fade out, and a kind of death might happen. A kind of forgetting where I would be healed from my wounds. \nThe CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES. \nVOICE (V.O.) But as I lay there, the sounds didn't fade but grew with the world. \nThe BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS. \nVOICE (V.O.) And gradually the world didn't sound like the place I had left, but something different... better... \nAs we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST... \nVOICE (V.O.) A new fearless attitude had possessed the world, brave and Godless. I began to wonder if it was not time to resurrect. But the thing that eventually brought me back -- the decisive thing really -- came like a bolt out of the blue. \nGUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw and dark. \n5   SERIES OF GLIMPSES                                            5 \nSlender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments. Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and LOUDER than the rest. \n(CONTINUED) \n5    CONTINUED:                                                  5 \nA SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its emotion. \nVOICE (V.O.) A music so sublime, so deeply vampiric, I had no doubt it could be heard in Hades. I had no choice... it summoned me. \nAn ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its energy. \n6    INT. TOMB                                                   6 \nThe BAND'S sounds ECHO about the stone chamber, thrumming a deep, life-giving pulse. Suddenly, the LID of a SARCOPHAGUS SCRAPES and slides to one side. \n7    EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               7 \nThe Figure re-emerges from the tomb, his cape now in tatters -- posture bent. He creeps across the cemetery in unnatural, staccato movements as if hindered by the physics of distance and time. All the while the SONG plays, drawing the figure toward it. \n8    EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT                                 8 \nThe Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill of yellow light from the street lamps. Stopping in a darkened alleyway, he gasps for air, exhausted by his movements. He listens again to the mesmeric TUNE of the band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a voice... \nVOICE #2 (O.S.) (in French; subtitled) Need a fix? \n9    CLOSE ON FIGURE'S EYES                                      9 \nstaring hungrily at... \n10   BACK TO SCENE                                               10 \nFLYING ACROSS night skies, as the distinctive dark sound of SATAN'S NIGHT OUT KICKS IN to join Lestat's soaring voice. (CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                                    15 \nLESTAT (V.O.) It was a bold move, I admit. But from that moment on, they were my friends, my children, my band. Together we rode on the wave of my preternatural ambition to superstardom, giving the world a new god... me. \nWe COME ACROSS the city lights of London. Below, police cars section off a few blocks around a very sleek, ultramodern office building where a huge crowd has gathered. \nSUPERIMPOSE:    LONDON (6 MONTHS LATER) \n16   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      16 \nThrough the crowd, a very long, black limousine snakes its way toward the building. Rows of fans dressed as Goths, ghouls and vampires scream out... \nFANS Lestat!    Lestat! \nGirls press their breasts and necks up against the limousine. Thump! Thump! Fan after female fan flings herself on the car. Groupies scream with pure excitement. \nConfusion of screams as the door to the limo opens. The crowd's scream reaches a fever pitch as... James, Alex and Maudy climb out, ogle at the sight. ROGER SMYTHE, their business manager (40s), gets out next, hustling them through the crowd. \nA wave of hysteria hits the fans. Roger hustles the band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church, past the giant billboard with their own images written huge, Lestat's smiling face above them all and the announcement -- \nLESTAT -- LIVE & UNDEAD -- OCTOBER 31, ALL HALLOW'S EVE, DEATH VALLEY, U.S.A. \n17   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SOON AFTER                             17 \nA high-tech conference room. The band, sitting up front, is faced by an audience of over fifty journalists and then another fifty photographers and TV cameras. The room crackles with anticipation. Roger steps to the podium. \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                                   17 \nROGER May I present the Vampire Lestat. \nHe pushes a button and a black curtain slides open to reveal a huge monitor on the wall. \nEvery eye is glued to the SCREEN... CRACKLE, CRACKLE. Nothing. Then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow appears... Lestat. His voice booms out over the crowd. \nLESTAT Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm late. I was just having my... breakfast. \n18   OMITTED                                                      18 \n19   BACK TO SCENE                                                19 \nThen Lestat leans forward into the light. Hushed whispers move through the crowd. Lestat's eyes burn unnaturally bright. His white skin absolutely glows, luminous. Lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile. Then grins wider, revealing his fangs. \nJOURNALIST Excellent makeup job.   Marilyn Manson, look out... \nA thousand questions suddenly burst out of the journalists. \nROGER Hey, hey! We're gonna keep this short here! One at a time. You! \nHe points to a PRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST. \nPRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST So, Lestat. You say you're a real vampire. Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I remember about vampires is you guys usually keep your identity secret. \nLESTAT Yes. But why hide it in this day and age? I've hidden in the shadows for centuries. It's time to share myself with the world. \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:                                                   19 \nIn the corner, Roger gives a big winking smile to the camera crew. The journalists smile, playing along. A younger, hipper MUSIC magazine JOURNALIST pipes in... \nMUSIC JOURNALIST And it doesn't hurt the record sales, huh? Your album just topped all kinds of sales records. \nLESTAT Our label isn't complaining, no. \nPRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST Could you prove it? You know give us a demonstration of your powers? \nLESTAT If you like, I'll give you a private demonstration in your hotel room tonight. \nThe journalists laugh. The French Journalist looks a little frightened/fascinated by Lestat's leer. \nLIFESTYLE JOURNALIST Why not a demo at your own house? I mean, what's with all the secrecy about where you stay? Is it true you move residences every few days? \nLESTAT (smiles, giving away nothing) After calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long, I like to experience as much diversity as I can. Wouldn't you? \nThe Lifestyle Journalist smiles. \nMUSIC JOURNALIST There are a lot of rumors flying around the internet about the hidden meaning in your lyrics, that you're giving away 'vampire secrets.' Something in all that? \n20   SMALL TV SCREEN                                              20 \nIn a dark room, the interview continues. \n(CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED:                                                    20 \nLESTAT (V.O.) Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few old friends with my words. Daring them to come out. \nCUT TO: \n26   CLOSE ON SET OF HEADPHONES                                     26 \nas it plays LESTAT'S SONG. \nPULL OUT ON... \nA beautiful young woman, JESSE, 22, lays in black satin sheets. Her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as she sleeps to Lestat's voice, still as death. Flickering candles all over the room reveal her lithe, strong body, pale as the moon. She is surrounded by her work, ancient language books, her laptop computer. Another book is clenched in her hand. The Unconscious Vampire. We MOVE IN ON her fluttering eyes. \nCUT TO: \n27   DREAM SEQUENCE - EYES                                          27 \nopening. Blank. Still. Unsettling. PULL BACK to reveal these eyes belong to a 19th-century porcelain doll. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls from different eras, all exquisitely detailed. TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to-ceiling curtains to reveal a six-year- old girl lying awake in a large bed, Jesse, green eyes and long red curls. LAUGHTER wafts in with the breeze. \n28   INT. CORRIDOR                                                  28 \nJesse's bare feet pad down the endless corridor. The little girl is dwarfed by the stone pedestals, all lit with candles. LAUGHTER ECHOES through the halls. \n29   INT. GREAT HALL                                                29 \nJesse moves past rough-hewn columns, watching something with great curiosity. Behind her, we glimpse a giant mural of names cut into the stone walls. A family tree, extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor. \n30   JESSE'S POV                                                    30 \nA grand party is in progress. There are about thirty vampires, all thin, pale and beautiful. An eclectic group, elegantly-dressed in Indian silks, Arabic veils, mixed with a few gaudy Versace outfits. Guests lean into each other's necks, showing blood-red tongues and fangs. \n31   BACK TO SCENE                                                  31 \nA young VAMPIRE scoops Jesse up and puts her on his knee. \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED:                                                  31 \nVAMPIRE Ah, Jesse. You want to come and play with us, don't you? \nShe stares at him, nervous, intrigued. \nWOMAN (O.S.) (urgent) Jesse! \nVAMPIRE Soon, soon, little one. I'll make sure you're with us forever. \nWOMAN (O.S.) (more urgent) Jesse! \n32   INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM (PRESENT)                              32 \nJESSE No! \nJesse sits up with a start. She stands, heart pounding, trying to shake the dream off. We see on a bulletin board behind her, a flyer for Lestat's concert. She takes off the headphones. Walking over to the mantel above her fireplace, she picks up a solitary, framed photo -- holds it tight... \n33   CLOSEUP - PHOTO                                             33 \nYoung Jesse (the girl from the dream) stares straight at camera. She is held in the arms of a red-haired woman, her back to camera. \n34   BACK TO SCENE                                               34 \nJesse puts the photo down, catches her reflection in a mirror, lit by flickering candlelight. Her face is distressed, troubled by the dream. She goes to the window, stares out into the black night. The dark waters of the Thames snake through the London cityscape. Jesse blows out the candles. Darkness. \nCUT TO: \n35   EXT. TUBE STATION (LONDON) - THAT NIGHT                      35 \nFluorescence pierces the black night. Jesse comes out of the tube station in a tight, short skirt, boots. She looks down the street. In one direction, a busy, brightly-lit street. Jesse gazes at a group of tourists coming out of a pub, laughing. Then she turns, looks the other direction. A dark street. She hesitates a long moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself, plunges toward the darkness, the LAUGHTER ECHOING, then DYING. \n36   EXT. ALLEY - JUST AFTER                                      36 \nJesse passes \"rent-boys\" stepping from the shadows as cars cruise by. Jesse, unable to look away, gazes as one gets in a car. He stares back at her, disappears into the car. \n37   EXT. BRIDGE - JUST AFTER                                     37 \nJesse passes couples using the shadows for privacy in the dark, filthy streets. She strides past a girl leaning against a brick wall, the man grunting, moving rhythmically against her. \n38   EXT. LONDON STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                        38 \nFog floats in the yellow vapor lights. Jesse pauses at the intersection of a narrow alley. She hesitates, nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into the blackness... \n39   EXT. WAVERLY ARMS - NIGHT                                    39 \nJesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign and a dull blue light mounted above. \nJesse hears strange whispering. She sees now figures moving through the fog. One pushes a buzzer. Jesse stares, barely breathing, her heart pounding. \nThe figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright, glowing eyes. Their fingernails are glass-like. A moment later, a slot in the door opens. The glowing eyes of another creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. The door closes quickly. \nJesse stands there, deliberating. She takes a step closer to the door. Stops. Takes another nervous step. She hears something, whirls around. \n(CONTINUED) \n39   CONTINUED:                                                       39 \nJESSE (excitement dampened by embarrassment) Well... it was taken... while... (clears throat) ... in motion. \nTalamascan #2 smiles at her sympathetically. Jesse gazes out at the other Talamascans, sees she's losing their interest. \nJESSE (quickly, trying to cover) But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. I'm sure of it. And Lestat's leading us to them and -- \nTALAMASCAN #3 (interrupting) Interesting. Perhaps we should assign someone to observe -- \nTALAMASCAN #1 Oh please, based on this so-called 'data'? That's a waste of time. \nJESSE But... uh... \nTALAMASCAN #2 (looking up for a moment, interrupting) Wait a second. Who took this picture? \nJESSE (a beat, softly) I did. \nMurmurs bubble through the entire group now.      They stare at Jesse, dismayed. \nTALAMASCAN #2 You went there? \nJESSE Yes.   Last night. \nTALAMASCAN #1 And who gave you this directive? \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:    (4)                                            40 \nJESSE No one.  I... just... went. (quickly) Look, I know it was breaking protocol and I'm really sorry, it's just I think -- \nTALAMASCAN #1 Jesse! You're just an apprentice here! You must follow our rules... Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position. \nShe stares at him. \nTALAMASCAN #3 For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior. But never get involved. You're getting far too close. \nJESSE (gesturing to photo, defending herself) Hey, does it look like I got involved? That is not called involvement. That is called running. \nTALAMASCAN #2 (leaning forward, trying to help) But, Jesse, tell us, what did you see? \nJesse turns to her. \nJESSE Vampires.   Gathering.   I'm sure of it. \nJesse steps from the podium, moving through the Talamascans as she pleads her case. She talks a mile a minute, her passion rising... \nJESSE You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics. They're amazing. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:    (5)                                                   40 \nJESSE (CONT'D) Many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the Bibliotech de Paris, which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties. Plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years Lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. He refers to Marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the Bay of Naples in the late 18th Century. What I'm trying to say here, and maybe I'm not doing the best job of it, is that Lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented! \nJesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening. But Talamascan #1 shakes his head... \nTALAMASCAN #1 It doesn't make any sense. Why would he be forecasting this to the world? He's all but drawn a map and marked an X. What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. They'd be hunted down. \nJESSE Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know why... (glancing at skeptical Talamascan #1) But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution. \nAll the Talamascans gaze at her a moment.       Jesse holds her breath. Has she gotten them back? \n(CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:    (6)                                                40 \nTALAMASCAN #1 And this photo is your evidence? It's hardly conclusive. (snorts) C'mon. It looks like the Blair witch! \nThe Talamascans burst out laughing, even Talamascan #2. Jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. She's lost them, blown it. Made a fool of herself. \nHer frustration rises, she can no longer contain it.       It bursts out of her. \nJESSE Fine. Well then, I guess I'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here! \nAs they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her materials, starts out. Several start shouting back at her. Amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room. \nTALBOT (O.S.) Jesse. \nEveryone turns. Quiets down. DAVID TALBOT stands in the back of the room. He's clearly the superior Talamascan, though younger than some, very charismatic. \nTALBOT My office.   Now. \nHe turns, walks out. All the Talamascans look at Jesse. It doesn't look good. Her face burning red, Jesse turns, leaves. \nCUT TO: \n41   EXT. METROPOLITAN BAR (LONDON) - NIGHT (SAME TIME)               41 \nA line of hopefuls wanting to enter the exclusive club wait for the judgement of two BOUNCERS, one buff, one SLEEK. \n(CONTINUED) \nJAMES I'm ready for Los Angeles... \n(CONTINUED) \n47   CONTINUED:                                                  47 \nMAUDY I'm ready for Death Valley. (jazzed) Two days till we go... \nTHROUGH the broken glass we see Roger slump into a chair, his nerves totally frayed. \nALEX Think we can call that a night. \nUnhooking their instruments, Alex and James start to pack up as Maudy slowly approaches Lestat and nuzzles his neck. \nHe shivers with temptation. Her hand moves down the front of his pants. Lestat pulls her into his arms. Leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent, closes his eyes and... Suddenly opens them right at Roger who looks on, extremely perturbed. Smiling like the devil... \nLESTAT Oh, the sweet song of her blood. \nRoger stares on, terrified. \nLESTAT I'll hear it in my head all night. \nGently letting Maudy go... \nLESTAT Roger... \nHe goes directly to Roger, reaches into his open shirt, pulls out the crucifix around his neck. \nLESTAT I didn't know you were religious. \nRoger tries to laugh it off. Lestat sniffs the air. As Roger backs away, he turns to open the door, stumbles, cutting his hand on a fallen shard of glass. Blood trickles from the cut. Roger looks up at Lestat whose dark eyes stare intensely at Roger's blood. Roger quickly sticks his hand in his mouth. With a horrified expression, he realizes he's sucking his blood. He quickly heads out. But Lestat is faster and reaches into Roger's shirt pocket. Pulls out a clove of garlic.     Lestat shakes his head with a smile. \nLESTAT Roger... \n(CONTINUED) \n47   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 47 \nRoger tries to laugh. Reaches for the garlic to put it back in his pocket. But Lestat grabs Roger's hand, blood trickling down his wrist. Lestat speaks intensely. \nLESTAT Be careful, Roger.   Very careful. \nLestat walks away.    Roger exhales with relief. \nCUT TO: \n48   INT. TALBOT'S CHAMBER - SAME TIME                                 48 \nA wood-lined room -- walls covered with books, artifacts, paintings. Jesse stands before Talbot. He fixes his eyes on her, pours her some coffee. \nTALBOT How's everything? You alright? You sleeping okay? \nJESSE Yeah, I'm great. I just found a vampire. \nTALBOT (considers her) Jesse... you're taking this Lestat stuff pretty seriously... why? \nJESSE Cause I think I'm on to something pretty big. The most important sighting Talamasca's had in years... (beat, sighs) Jesus, I don't know, David... I thought I was onto something... Maybe I didn't see anything... \nTalbot takes in the dark circles around her eyes, how quickly she's emptied her coffee cup. He pours her more, smiles gently. \nTALBOT You know we work in a really strange field? The supernatural is beguiling at times. It doesn't like to just be observed, it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely. I know cause I've felt these things myself. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n48   CONTINUED:                                                           48 \nTALBOT (CONT'D) That's what we have to resist, as Talamascans... (as a shadow crosses his face) It's not always easy. \nJESSE (leaning forward) Talbot. C'mon. You know me. I'm not freaking out on you. I'm just onto what looks -- alright looked \n-- like a good lead. You're the one who taught me how to do all this. You're the one who taught me to keep pushing and pushing... \nHe still looks at her with a penetrating glance.         She looks back at him. \nJESSE David. There's nothing else. Nothing is 'beguiling' me, alright? Nothing. C'mon. \nHe gazes at her as she downs her whole coffee, registering her strong denial. He smiles at her, forcefully changes the mood. \nTALBOT Alright.   Just checking... \nJesse starts out. Looking down at papers on his desk, Talbot calls out, almost casually... \nTALBOT Well, all I can say is you're really lucky you're not lying dead in a gutter with two holes on your neck. \nJESSE I'd be even luckier if that damn picture came out... (stops in her tracks, turns back, gazes at him, amazed) Wait a second. So you do believe me? You do think it's a vampire coven. \n(CONTINUED) \n48   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           48 \nTALBOT (looks up, eyes sparkling) Yes. But not exactly for the reasons you think. Though your research is top-notch of course... (smiles) Come back here. I'm gonna show you something. \nTALBOT My pleasure. When I took you on as an apprentice, I knew it was the smartest thing I'd ever done. Now you and I'll meet when you're done... This will be our project... \nAs Jesse goes out, holding the journal, Talbot smiles after her. \nBut after the door closes, his gaze turns again to concern. He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a moment, staring up into Marius's eyes. Then Talbot covers each with the black velvet. \nCUT TO: \n49   INT. JESSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  49 \nJesse sits on the floor, curtains drawn, the room lit with candles. A LESTAT SONG plays in the b.g. She opens the journal. \nJESSE Je suis le vampire Lestat... (a beat) I am the vampire Lestat. \n50   FLASHBACK - EXT. MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND - FULL SHOT               50 \nA solitary paradise in a rough, nighttime sea. \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:                                                     50 \nLESTAT (V.O.) It was the winter of 1788 and I was brought to a Mediterranean Island by the man who made me... \nA lightning flash illuminates a sprawling 18th-Century sea-front villa. \nLESTAT (V.O.) ... if a man is what you'd call him. \n51   INT. VILLA BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     51 \nA great round room encircled with candles, their reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving back the outside STORM. A huge antique bed sits in the room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees... \nAn indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting. Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when... \nLestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself, he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his own image, when suddenly... \nThe sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck. Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally... \nThe strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious figure. Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's cloth -- \nMARIUS Lestat.    Welcome. \nWeakened and helpless, Lestat drags himself back across the floor in terror. \n(CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED:                                                   51 \nLESTAT Who are you? Do I know you? \nMARIUS I'm unknowable by nature. \nMarius advances again on the young man... \nMARIUS But you may call me Marius. \nAs Lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away. \nLESTAT I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army of men to look for me. \nMARIUS I doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long way from home... \nHis strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the floor. \nMARIUS You're weak... near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat. \nLESTAT I'll kill you! \nMarius smiles, impressed. \nMARIUS You really do fear nothing. It is why I chose you. Because you think things are possible which aren't possible... \nLestat stares at him, his eyes wide. \nLESTAT Chose me? For what? \nMARIUS My companion. Someone to share my burden. \nBending down, he gazes at Lestat. \nMARIUS You've lost a great deal of blood. \n(CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              51 \nLESTAT (near tears) I'm dying. \nSuddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his belt. With the last of his strength, Lestat grabs his attacker's wrist. \nMARIUS Then drink. \nThe Punk Vampire pulls down her collar. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #1 Don't see any marks. \nJESSE You haven't seen the rest of my body. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #2 Is that an invitation? \nJesse finds herself surrounded by the three Vampires. She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #3 So, where's your host? \nJESSE My host... oh he's here somewhere. \nShe peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the door... \nFinds herself blocked by Punk Vampire #2. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #2 Your host. What's his name? \nJesse looks around, trying not to panic. Pale faces, pale eyes stare at her. A long, terrible pause... Suddenly -- \nJESSE Marius... \n72   HOODED FIGURE                                                   72 \nleans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal, fascinated. \n73   BACK TO SCENE                                                   73 \nPUNK VAMPIRE #1 Sorry.   Don't know the guy. \nThe Punk Vampires laugh.     Jesse desperately tries to cover her terror. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:                                                 73 \nJESSE Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #2 There aren't any ancients left. They all turned to dust... \nJESSE That's a myth. Marius is around here somewhere... \nJesse again heads for the door. But Punk Vampire #1 has appeared in front of her. She stares at him, terrified. \nJESSE You... you really should meet him. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #1 And why is that? \nJesse watches the other Punk Vampires slowly begin to close in on her. As she speaks, she slowly edges to the door... \nJESSE Because... because... he's wise, a philosopher... he asks the big questions. Like how are you going to get through eternity? It's easier for us mortals. Life is brief, but for you... \nShe inches toward the door, desperately stalling. Their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. She struggles to get the words out... \nJESSE I mean... what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness? \nThe Punk Vampires pause, staring at her, as her words sink in. The hooded figure leans forward revealing his face... \nIt is Lestat. He stares at Jesse, amazed. Jesse glances desperately at the door. It's just a few feet away now. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             73 \nJESSE You know, it's like they say -- the more things change, the more they stay the same. For you that's forever, right? \nAll around her, vampires are turning to look. The Punk Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. Jesse is now inches from the door. She can barely breathe. Punk Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning to anger. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #1 You know, you're really a downer... \nHe bares his fangs. Jesse bolts out the door... PAN ACROSS vampire faces staring after Jesse TO Lestat who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. He watches the Punk Vampires head after Jesse. \nCUT TO: \n74   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                            74 \nJesse hurries up the alley. Breaks into a run. But the three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside. They land in front of her, beside her, behind her. Heart racing, she shakes with fear. They close in, smiling. \nPUNK VAMPIRE #3 Now this isn't gonna hurt.    You might even enjoy it... \nHe runs his hand up and down her body. Jesse starts to shake. She breaks out in a cold sweat. The others grin. He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the air... \nSuddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy. Finds herself staring at... \nLestat... \nJesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned. \nHe drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks, her pulsing jugular. \nLESTAT Talamasca's been following me for years. I've never known one to be so brave. Or is it just foolish? \nJESSE I... I'm only an apprentice. \nHe waves her off, dismissive. \nLESTAT Go. I'm through with you. Your kind never satisfies my thirst. \nHe turns, walks away. Jesse lets out a sigh of relief, then stares after him. She hesitates, then suddenly calls out: \nJESSE Does anything, Lestat? \nA pause in his gait. But he keeps walking away.       Jesse hesitates again, but still calls out. \nJESSE I mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you? \nBut he keeps going.    She takes one last chance -- \nJESSE You want the world to see you're real, don't you, Lestat? Don't you? Well, here I am! \nSuddenly Lestat spins. Stares at the fragile mortal girl risking everything. Flash. Jesse gasps. \nHe now stands right before her. He grabs her, pulls her to him close, tight, hard. He could just snap her neck and be done with it. \n(CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:    (5)                                                74 \nLESTAT You better just stick to your books, Talamascan. 'Cause you have it all wrong. I love all this. I delight in it. The dark, dreary world I went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th Century -- can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world? It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it. I scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer. I adore being back in action... every moment, every single drop of it! Now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go! \nHe pushes her away.       She gasps, humbled by his physical power. \nShe retrieves her rucksack. Starts away. As she reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath, turns back, daring everything. \nJESSE Lestat! \nHe turns back, stares at her, astonished. \nJESSE There's something you left out of your diary. \nLESTAT (amazed) What? \nJESSE (stares right into his eyes) You kept her violin, didn't you? \nA beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the absurdity of what she's saying. But Jesse is undaunted. \nJESSE Hey, it's okay. I understand... (softly) After all, it's only human. \n(CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:    (6)                                              74 \nThat stops him. Their eyes bore into each other again. Electric. Then Lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound filling the alley. Lestat lunges, fangs bared. Jesse screams. Turns. Runs. Finds herself -- \nEXT. BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nIn the midst of traffic on a busy street.     People walking by. \nJESSE Jesus Christ. \nShe stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive. Then it sinks in. She realizes -- Lestat let her go. \nShe glances back at the alley, but Lestat is gone. \nShe brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in, tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something else -- desire. \nWhat she doesn't see is... \nLestat in the shadows, silently watching her. He gazes at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal passion. She has affected him. \nHe watches as she turns and runs away. \nCUT TO: \n75   INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LONDON) - NIGHT                           75 \nThe CAMERA TRACKS WITH two young GROUPIES as they walk through the lavish palace. \nGROUPIE #2 I heard that Lestat keeps all these girls in all his wine cellars, and it's really nice, and they give you food and cable and weed. \nGROUPIE #1 Oh, please... \nGROUPIE #2 That's what I heard. But you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants. Doesn't sound too bad. \n(CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:                                                   75 \nGROUPIE #1 (grins) We've done worse. \nGROUPIE #2 (giggling) Damn straight... Hey, do you remember that cute guy's name at the Kid Rock concert? The one behind the bathroom. \nGROUPIE #1 C'mon, don't you want to have some fun? \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             77 \nShe reaches for his belt. But he recoils at the touch and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace. \nLESTAT Don't do that. \nGROUPIE #1 (giggling) Are you ticklish? \nLESTAT (deadpan) I'm very ticklish. \nThe Second Groupie giggles as well... \nGROUPIE #2 Hey, you ever been tickled by four hands at once? Hey, can you take both us, Lestat? What'd'ya think? \nAnd at once they both start after Lestat on all fours to tickle him. He gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the sight and gets down on... \nAll fours as well as he leads them around the room in a childish game. \nLESTAT I don't know.     Let's see. \nThey try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of them the whole time. The girls giggle as they pursue... \nLestat crawling just   ahead of them across the floor and... Up the wall.    The teenagers keep giggling as they watch him ascend the   wall like a spider. They can't believe what they're   seeing as... \nLestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down across the ceiling. The girls begin to giggle and half-cry... as they arch their necks all the way back to see... Lestat crawling down the opposite wall. The girls sit open-mouthed with terror as Lestat reaches the ground -- \nHe heads straight for them. \nThe girls begin to scream... SCREAMS CONTINUE OVER... \nBLACKNESS. \n78   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME                                      78 \nCLOSE ON Jesse, her face bright, walking quietly, talking intensely on a cell phone. \nJESSE You're right, David. The journal has everything in it. \nTALBOT (V.O.) I knew you'd appreciate its scientific significance. \nJESSE David, listen... (struggles a moment) I'm going to Los Angeles for the concert. \nTALBOT (V.O.) What?   You are not! I forbid it. \nJESSE David, I... I talked to him... Look I'm sorry. But I... I have to see what's out there with my own eyes. I'm onto something. I just don't know what yet... I have to find out... \n79   INT. STUDY - ON TALBOT                                         79 \nHolding the phone, stunned.   He leans forward, speaks intensely, his face grave. \nTALBOT Jesse, you listen to me very, very carefully now. You are no longer seeing things clearly. Your emotions are clouding things. \n80   BACK TO JESSE                                                  80 \nJESSE It's not emotion. It's instinct... I'll return when I have my findings. Good-bye. \nTALBOT (V.O.) (angry) Jesse, wait! \nShe hangs up. Can't quite believe what she's doing. REVEAL Jesse is heading for a boarding gate at Heathrow airport. She hands over the ticket, boards the plane. \n81   DAVID TALBOT                                                   81 \nin his inner sanctum. He looks at all the paintings. His neat, protected world. It's as if Marius is taunting him. He slams his fist down in fury. Stares at the rising dust. \n82   INT. PLANE - NIGHT                                             82 \nJesse puts on headphones, listens to LESTAT'S MUSIC.   As she opens the journal, LESTAT'S MUSIC DISSOLVES INTO VIOLIN... \n83   FLASHBACK - INT. VILLA - BEDROOM - LESTAT                      83 \nLestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie, playing the violin, with incredible passion. \nHis playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the strings with a maestro's speed and precision. \nLESTAT (V.O.) Yes, Marius was impressed with my thirst for knowledge... But it \nturned out that there was such a thing as knowing too much. There were things Marius was not yet ready to teach me... and Marius and I parted ways. \nSuddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase. Lestat comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it. Having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor when he sees something... \nCarved into one of the floorboards is an Egyptian eye with a hole dug out of its iris. Stepping aside, he realizes he is standing on a manhole. A beat ON Lestat as he thinks... Poking his finger through the hole of the Egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set of steps leading down into the villa's basement. \nLESTAT Marius! \nNo answer. Lestat looks around wondering what to do. Taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the stairs, peering down into the darkness. \n84   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE - NIGHT                84 \nMARIUS She made you quite powerful. (withdrawing a saber from its sheath) Don't make me use this! \nLestat still struggles.       The manacles strain. \nLESTAT Marius, please, just one more time. I felt the sun. The light, Marius, the light! \nSuddenly pressing the knife to Lestat's throat -- \nMARIUS Lestat, listen to me! I have watched over Akasha and her King for 2000 years! They must never awaken! \nLestat stares up at him. \nMARIUS Akasha and her King nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over Egypt. They drank until they lost their will to drink. They became living statues. And yet Akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires. It is believed what happens to her, happens to all of us. \nLestat gazes up at him, taking it in.       Marius moves slowly away. \n(CONTINUED) \n91   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                91 \nMARIUS If she were ever to rise, she would again desiccate the earth! She has no respect for anything except the taste of blood. Immortal and human alike... \nLestat roars and struggles against his manacles. \nLESTAT You'll not stop me... \nMarius stares at him, shocked. \nMARIUS I hear her blood in your voice... In all the years I've cared for them, not once have they moved... \nLESTAT Until tonight. And she chose me! Me! Never you! You'll not stop me! \nMarius moves at super-speed, grabs Lestat by the neck, and pins him down. \nMARIUS You are part of a great coven! You take responsibility for your kind! \nLESTAT (snarls) I must have more! \nLestat, lost, looks at Marius, his eyes intoxicated with Akasha's blood. Marius steps back. Looks at his fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment. \nMARIUS I chose you for your bravery, but I was wrong. You know only selfishness. I can no longer trust you... It gives me no pleasure to look upon what I have created. \nMarius turns his back on Lestat.     Lestat stares after him. \n92   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - NEXT DAY                                 92 \nTHROUGH the balcony we see the last warm colors of the sunset vanish into the blue of night. Lestat awakens, his manacles removed. He stretches, shakes his head, as if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop... Something has changed. Marius's paints have gone. Some of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded marble floor. \nLESTAT Marius! \nNo response. \n93   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE                         93 \nLestat runs down the staircase, which is dark except for the candelabra in his hand. \n94   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND SANCTUARY                    94 \nLestat throws open the doors and enters to find... Akasha and Enkil have been taken, as have the thrones and most of the royal paraphernalia. \nLESTAT Marius!    Please! \n95   EXT. MARIUS'S VILLA/BEACH - NIGHT                              95 \nLestat runs down the beach, the sand showing no footprints. \nLESTAT (V.O.) Many times since, I have called to Marius. I howled into the night in loneliness and pain. \nLestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair, grief. He disappears off into the night. \nLESTAT (V.O.) But there was no answer -- just the endless procession of days, months, years... My teacher left me to my darkest lesson -- that in the end, we are alone. \nLestat looks up from feeding on a mortal. Wipes the blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night. \n96    INT. PLANE - NIGHT (PRESENT)                                   96 \nJesse closes the journal, her eyes wide with the new knowledge of Lestat's past. She sits there a moment, speechless, then stares out at the vast, black night. \nTILT DOWN TO: \n97    EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT                      97 \nSUPERIMPOSE:    LOS ANGELES \nPAN DOWN to Lestat standing on the edge of a very high fence high above the sparkling lights of downtown, gazing into the dark night. The fence encircles his Hollywood Hills home, a high-tech modern version of a medieval fortress of steel and glass, hidden deep in the canyon, his only neighbors, chaparral and coyotes. \nLestat closes his eyes as if listening to something. As we PULL BACK again, and RISE UP INTO the sky, a LESTAT SONG begins to play and magically we are in the MUSIC and with a visual splash we are... MOVING SWIFTLY ACROSS the globe with the MUSIC -- as we CUT ACROSS the world INTO the west and INTO... The night fallen over Asia where we soon find ourselves in... \n98    ASIAN FACTORY                                                  98 \nwhere LESTAT'S MUSIC plays for the evening       shift over a sweatshop BOOM BOX. \nCLOSE ON HIS PUZZLED FACE \nHe turns... \nShe's dancing across the floor now. Vampire Lover's smile is not so friendly now. He steps toward her, determined... She moves behind him. Her body pressed up tight against his. He smiles, shudders with a rush of desire. All the other vampires watch, envious. Her lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his body pausing on his chest. He reaches for her. She kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl. On Vampire Lover's face, pure pleasure... \nAKASHA Then again, you could always do this... \nAkasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same time, plunges her hand down. We can't see where... We STAY ON Vampire Lover's face as Akasha disappears FROM FRAME. The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH. LOUD SUCKING. A look of horror appears on Vampire Lover's face. Akasha REAPPEARS. In her hand, she now holds... \n(CONTINUED) \n125   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             125 \n... his dripping heart.    She brings it to her lips, sucks again thirstily... \nVampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry husk, then tosses it. She turns back to Vampire Lover, his face frozen in a grotesque mask. She laughs, drops him unceremoniously to the floor... \nAkasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires. They begin to back away. But the DOOR LOCKS itself LOUDLY. \nAkasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if refreshed. \nAKASHA Turn up the music! \nThe terrified barman quickly COMPLIES. \nAKASHA (smiles, to herself) Oh, I do love the 21st Century. \nAkasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching for a snack. He flails but is overwhelmed by her strength... \nThe Vampire Girl who Jesse saw vanish with the Yuppie, flies towards Akasha, knife raised, but Akasha just turns... Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of FLAMES. The Vampire Girl screams as she is consumed. The piano player and guitar player go up in flames... \nAll hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the door. The lock won't budge and it's too late anyway as the flames overwhelm them... \nAnd THROUGH the flames, we see Akasha smiling, now sucking on the Punk Vampire's aorta like it's a straw. She tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her bloody, thirsty lips. She strides out through the flames. In a whispery, sing-song voice. \nAKASHA \nLesta-at... come out, come out wherever you are. \n126   EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT                                    126 \nMarius stands in the hills by the Hollywood sign, gazing down, his brow furrowed, at Lestat's fortress-like mansion hidden in the canyon below. The WIND BLOWS the trees, bushes. Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something, peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign. Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows. \nIt is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak. \nMAEL Marius, you've broken your oath. You were to watch over Akasha and Khayman. You are a great disappointment to me. \nMarius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair, alabaster skin. \nMARIUS Pandora, Armand, it's been a long time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do I owe this honor? \nKHAYMAN You have been summoned because of your errant child... \nKhayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the distance at Lestat's house. \nPANDORA (giving deep, sexy laugh) He's quite the devil, isn't he? \nARMAND His music mocks us, Pandora! \nPANDORA His music moves my blood. \nARMAND Keep your amorous thoughts to yourself. His music is a threat to all vampires. We will let the covens dismember him at his concert. \n(CONTINUED) \n126   CONTINUED:                                                  126 \nMAEL Yes.   It will set an example. \nMARIUS I don't see how this solves things. This isn't thought through. \nKHAYMAN Marius, we understand your affection for Lestat, but your duty is to us! \nHe gazes again down at Lestat's house with a threatening glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning. \nKHAYMAN We could always get rid of him right now. \nMAEL No. We will contact the covens. Let them know we condone the slaying. It will be better for all to see. \nMarius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael. Maharet steps up. \nMAHARET Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We have greater problems... \nMARIUS (stepping up) Maharet is right. It is Akasha we face now. \nPANDORA (joyous) Is it true, Maharet?   Has our Queen really risen! \nMAHARET Don't be so happy, Pandora. I knew Akasha when she walked this earth. I was her slave. I am now her enemy. I know what she is capable of. \n(CONTINUED) \nLestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her face, brushing his lips against her cheek. She shivers... \nLESTAT (groans) Your blood... \nJESSE (murmurs) Do you like it? \n(CONTINUED) \n132   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              132 \nLESTAT (losing himself) Yes... \nHe comes down to her slender neck.     Stares at the soft, pulsing skin. He bares his fangs. \nJESSE (whispering, overcome) Do it to me... Please... With your blood I'll know you... \n133   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                133 \nHe can't help himself.    He moves to Jesse's white neck... closer... closer... \nJESSE I'll know everything... \nBut suddenly her words catch him... His head flails as he tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him, surprised. He looms over her, angry. \nLESTAT You want to know everything. You want to see what it's like. Then come! I'll show you. \n134   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT                                     134 \nLestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees. Lestat stops on a dime -- senses tuned. He looks into the dark. Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves forward. Jesse gingerly follows. \nTaking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches, fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone. Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too. Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the bench. (CONTINUED) \n134   CONTINUED:                                                    134 \nJESSE Is she alright? \nLestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained lips. Jesse reflexively looks away. \nLESTAT Come closer, Jesse. You want to see? You want to know? \nJESSE Lestat, no! \nLestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as... the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens... finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm. Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his mouth, approaches Jesse. \nLESTAT You see now? Are you ready?     Now do you want it?! \nHe gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in Jesse's face says it all. \nLESTAT No.   Of course you don't. \nShe backs away from him, now terrified. Something's changed in his eyes. They are cold, blank. \nLESTAT Well I didn't grant your final wish. (shakes his head) It was an impossible wish to begin with. You see, I am unknowable. \nHis eyes still as death, he starts moving away. \nJESSE Lestat!    Wait! \nLestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully, pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes. \nLESTAT Good-bye, Talamascan. \n(CONTINUED) \n134   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             134 \nJesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is about to be over. \nThen Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched by something when... the IMAGE of Lestat's lips kissing her lips flashes by in VAMPIRE TIME as... Jesse's face is completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams, backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her cries... WHOOSH. \nCUT TO: \n135   OMITTED                                                       135 \n137   STARING EYE                                                   137 \nPULL BACK to reveal a porcelain doll, beautiful, perfect but unsettling. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls from different eras. TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to- ceiling curtains to reveal Jesse -- still an adult, but lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl. Jesse gets out of bed, trapped in her own childhood memory. Is she dreaming now? \n138   INT. DESERT MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                         138 \nMaking her way down a long hall she passes an amazing array of medieval tapestries. \n139   FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY                                      139 \nJesse as a child picking at the thread of a wall-hanging in a large room. \n140   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                       140 \nShe stands wondering -- eyes moving back and forth with rapid thoughts when... She sees a door at the end of the hall. Walking a little faster now, she draws toward it as... \n141   FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY                                       141 \nMAHARET I know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be. You have found that out now. \nJesse sits on a stone bench, confused.       Maharet smiles sadly, feeling Jesse's inner turmoil. \nJESSE Lestat's all I can think about... I felt like I belonged with him. Now I know why... \n(CONTINUED) \n144   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             144 \nMaharet sits beside her, speaks emphatically. \nMAHARET Jesse, you must forget about him. You must trust me... \nJESSE (gazes up at her a long moment) I missed you so much, Aunt Maharet. \nMAHARET Me too. \nJust then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to illuminate the windows of the great hall. \nMAHARET You will go home to London in the morning. \nJesse holds Maharet's eyes. \nJESSE But this is my home. This is where I belong. Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly? \nMaharet touches her face gently. \nMAHARET Now is not the time to be here... \nThe light is getting brighter.    Maharet stands. \nMAHARET You were seeking answers. Now you have found them. The family is who you are. \nMaharet goes to Jesse, wraps her arms tight around Jesse. Despite the coldness of her skin, Jesse warms to the embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. Then, beaten by the sun, Maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns back to Jesse, gazes at her. \nMAHARET You will go home to London tomorrow. \n145   INT. LESTAT'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     145 \nLestat stands by his bed, playing the ancient violin... a long mournful note. He stops a moment, lost in his thoughts. A flash of the first morning light reflects off the ancient wood. Lestat puts the violin away. A tear of blood trickles down his cheek. His face is filled with sadness at what will never be. A word escapes from his lips. \nLESTAT (whisper) Jesse. \nLestat draws the curtains and enters his sanctum where his coffin sits in the safety of darkness. \n146   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                            146 \nThe sun breaks through the date palms. \n147   INT. MANSION - JUST AFTER                                      147 \nJesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires. She pauses at one of Maharet. As Jesse shifts, the glass over the painting catches Jesse's reflection. Jesse moves slowly until her face just covers Maharet's. In the reflection, Jesse's eyes now glow with Maharet's luminescence. Jesse stares a long, long moment. \n148   INT. MANSION - JUST AFTER                                      148 \nJesse sits at a desk, writing a note, torment, confusion on her face. \nJESSE (V.O.) Dear Aunt Maharet, my whole life, I've felt... kind of crazy I guess, different from everyone, and now I know why... You say I now know who I am meant to be... I have found my answers. You are right... \nShe takes a deep breath. \n149   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - FRONT ENTRANCE -               149 CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJesse moves to the front entrance, gazes at the walls surrounding the front gate. \n(CONTINUED) \n149   CONTINUED:                                                   149 \nJESSE (V.O.) I know you want me to be a regular human girl... but I'm not. I can't be... \nShe looks back at the house, then quickly slips out the gate. \n150   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                          150 \nMaharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty desert. Nothing for as far as the eye can see. \nJESSE (V.O.) Lestat is my destiny... I know that now. I love you, Aunt Maharet. Good-bye. \nJesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway, she reads a sign -- \"DEATH VALLEY 120 miles.\" Just then, a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction. She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid with white face-paint and fake fangs. \nVAMPIRE DRIVER Need a ride? \nJesse peers past the driver to a crowd of Goths and fake vampires. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT BLARES FROM the SPEAKERS. \nJESSE (smiles) Yeah. \n151   EXT. DEATH VALLEY - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DUSK                   151 \nWe see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky. A distant sound of DRUMS BEATING chaotic rhythms is heard. As we FLY CLOSER, the DRUMMING becomes LOUDER and clearer. Until we are RIGHT ABOVE an incredible scene... A mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock. \nBOOM, the torches relight and an enormous CHORD surges through the crowd louder than a jet on takeoff. The mass surges forward... The stage lights up in a huge halo of blood-red light. The band plays a hypnotic tune that would put the devil in a spell, as... We wait for Lestat. The band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as... \nThe audience doesn't see Lestat anywhere and cheers over the sound, and it seems as if the whole of Death Valley is shaking, when... Lestat appears above the stage, inhumanly levitating and... \nLESTAT I'm so glad I decided to rise... (shouting) After tonight, Death Valley will live up to its name! \n(CONTINUED) \n164   CONTINUED:                                                   164 \nThe place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks it in. \nHe swoops down through the air over the stage and into their very midst. Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to him... But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams for him. Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note, filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be replaced with hell. \n165   AT BACK OF CONCERT - MIXING BOARD                            165 \nTwo STUDIO ENGINEERS sit dazed. \nENGINEER #1 (Cockney accent) Could we turn it down a tad? \nThe second Engineer looks to the mixing panel. \nENGINEER #2 His mic's not even up. \nThey stare, dumbfounded. \n166   BACK TO CONCERT                                              166 \nThe pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front of this papal devil. All move and sway except for... Jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get closer and closer to... \nLestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice. Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand. Lestat's dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into an even higher unworldly octave, and then... \n167   LESTAT'S POV                                                 167 \nThe vampires move through the crowd. Goth girls in the front row, weeping... Maudy, James and Alex off in the clouds, playing the best music of their lives. The place has gone wild, living off its own energy now as waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into the night sky. \n168   BACK TO SCENE                                                    168 \nLESTAT You want more?! \nThe crowd screams... \nCROWD Yes! \nLESTAT This one's for those who've come for me! \nAll yell that they have, but the covens know it's for them. Lestat launches the band into a new number that makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. He eyes the coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to them. His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting them with satire. Jesse whirls around, spying the assassins in the crowd. She shakes her head no... The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to move through the crowd toward the stage. We RISE UP OVER the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural speed, unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage. \nCUT TO: \n169   ANCIENTS - NIGHT                                                 169 \nMarius spies the covens slipping through the crowd at a strange velocity. He looks to Lestat, worried... \n170   BACK TO STAGE                                                    170 \nThe assassins approach closer   -- Lestat assaults with relentless lyrics... Reaching   the stage, they are suddenly on it -- roadies run   in and are immediately cast aside by inhuman powers.    We speed into vampire time as... (NOTE: In camera,    no C.G.I.) \nThe assassins draw knives and lunge, determined to dismember Lestat. Lestat does an acrobatic leap, dodging the knives. He rips the microphone from the stand and holds it up just in time... as an assassin is impaled. The assassin squirms and convulses. The crowd goes insane... Lestat snarls at the audience as if this really were part of the performance... The assassins attack again, this time hurtling massive light stands like they were small spears. Lestat dodges them. The assassins BREAK GLASS BOTTLES, lunge with the deadly shards. (NOTE: Band should not be seen in this part of sequence.) \n171   MARIUS                                                             171 \ncan hold himself back no longer. He flies over equipment and roadies, up into the air. The Ancients gaze after him and... \n172   ON STAGE                                                           172 \nHe lands square in the middle of the fray. Back to mortal time. The crowd cheers at the sudden appearance of the figure on stage, loving the show. Lestat grins at Marius. The band keeps playing. Marius hurls a huge LIGHT at the assassins. It EXPLODES as it hits them, pinning one with shards. But an assassin hurls a sickle at Lestat. Lestat is struck down, his singing stopped. The assassins move in. \nCUT TO: \n173   ANCIENT VAMPIRES                                                   173 \nwatch from their rocks.       Pandora's face, filled with excitement. \nPANDORA There are too many of them! They're going to dismember him. \nArmand is enjoying the show. \nARMAND Good! \n174   BACK TO STAGE                                                      174 \nAssassins corner Lestat and Marius -- blades, broken bottles reflecting the spotlight. Lestat raises his arms for the crowd. The crowd jeers. Lestat looks to Maudy and the band. \nLESTAT Get out of here! \nThe band scampers off stage as the assassins fly past, the reverb from their guitars whistle into a deafening pitch. \nJesse joins the screaming crowds. \nJESSE Lestat!    Lestat! \nLESTAT You? \n(CONTINUED) \n180   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              180 \nAKASHA You thought it was all you? (laughing) You have the ego of a king as well. I know you, Lestat. I know that you crave to have the world at your feet. I have come to give it to you. \nAkasha bites her own lip. Blood trickles slightly across her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it, as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around Lestat, she braces him, licks his face. \nAKASHA Has your tongue lost its taste for blood? \nLESTAT (melting) Never. \nAKASHA But you didn't kill the mortal girl. \nLestat looks caught. \nAKASHA Instead you kissed her.   Now kiss me. \n(NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him, hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as... \nAkasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into him. Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers in him and floods his body with an electric rush. \nAKASHA Be my King. Forget about everything else. \nLestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed.    His eyes are empty of everything except her blood. \nAKASHA What's your answer? \n(CONTINUED) \n180   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            180 \nLestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin together, detached from time and space. \n181   FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE                                   181 \nAll INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching. Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest, his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins. Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of his hand. \nLESTAT Can we try that again? \nAkasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips. \nLESTAT Show me the world... \nAkasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up into the air and off into the night. \n182   INT. MAHARET DESERT MANSION - NIGHT                          182 \nMael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora, Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered before Maharet's \"Great Family Tree.\" CAMERA SWEEPS OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved. Maharet turns to them. \nMAHARET We see now what Akasha means to do. Rule as Queen again. (pointing to the great family) This is why we must fight Akasha! \nMaharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the immortals. \n(CONTINUED) \n182   CONTINUED:                                                   182 \nMAHARET For the sake of all mortals. She must be stopped, or the mortal world will end. \nThe Ancients fall silent as they take this in. They gaze again at Maharet's Great Family, humbled for a moment by her life's passion. \nMAEL But is there a way?   We don't know. \nKHAYMAN When she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable. \nMARIUS Then we weaken her. Drain her of almost all her blood, but leave her just one drop. \nMAHARET We can't take that chance.    We must finish her. \nARMAND If she dies, we all die. \nPANDORA We're damned no matter what happens. \nMAHARET Perhaps. \nMaharet gazes at them, her mind working... Pandora, Khayman, Mael gaze at each other, still uncertain. \nJESSE And what about Lestat? \nMAHARET Lestat has joined with Akasha. He is lost to us now. He is never coming back. \nJESSE I don't believe that. \nCUT TO: \n183   LESTAT                                                         183 \nBeaming with a possessed look, his eyes brimming with visions. \n193   INT. MAHARET'S MANSION - GRANDE HALL - NIGHT                    193 \nThe Ancients are still debating. Suddenly, the whole place begins to shake. (NOTE: Practical shadows not C.G.I.) A shadow passes over the Ancients' faces. \nMARIUS She comes... \nThe WINDOWS along one side of the hall EXPLODE with a startling GUST. The Ancient Ones look up to see... Akasha's silhouette looming, dark and foreboding. \nAKASHA My children. It warms my blood to see you all gathered... plotting against me. \nThey trade glances and begin to fan out around the room. \nMAHARET Akasha. \nAKASHA Maharet. You will address my King first... \n(CONTINUED) \n193   CONTINUED:                                                       193 \nLestat enters, his possessed eyes showing only evil now. Unable to help herself... \nJESSE Lestat! \nHe turns slowly to the corner where she sits.      They lock eyes. Lestat's face stares cold and hard. \nJESSE What has she done to you? \nLESTAT Made me see. \nTaking his arm, Akasha draws Lestat to her. The Ancient Vampires subtly position themselves under the medieval weapons hanging on the walls, as Marius moves toward his son. \nMARIUS Lestat... step aside. \nLESTAT Never.    She is my Queen. \nMarius looks for some recognition in Lestat's eyes. There is none. Maharet turns to Akasha. \nMAHARET Akasha. The world has changed since you reigned. \nAKASHA Then we shall change it back. Humans are animals, brute creatures. Their destruction can only make sense. \nMAHARET We've found other ways to co- exist. \nAKASHA Yes. In the shadows. In silence. In shame. For what? For respect of mortals? They are nothing to us. They are only... food. \nShe casts a dangerous eye towards Jesse. Maharet instinctively moves forward to protect her. \n(CONTINUED) \n193   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             193 \nAKASHA Poor Maharet. Still trying to hold onto what I took from you. \nMaharet doesn't even flinch. \nMARIUS Akasha, please... \nAKASHA (venomous) You think you can change my will? I'm tired of this discussion. Join me, or die. \nMAHARET I will not. \nMARIUS I will not. \nAKASHA I want to hear it from every one of you. What will it be? \nAkasha scans the faces of the other Ancient Ones, staring deep into their souls. Akasha sees Khayman glance at the family tree. Akasha's eyes blaze with anger. \nAKASHA Don't tell me, you have feelings for these ridiculous mortals! \nShe crosses to the family tree, traces the names down to one. Jessica Reeves. Akasha is beyond fury, yet she keeps her temper under control and turns to Lestat. \nAKASHA Do you love me? \nSmiling, she bites her lip, letting a drop of blood glisten there, tempting Lestat. \nLESTAT Yes... \nHe draws closer. Jesse stares, mortified. Akasha and Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away. Akasha slowly turns to Jesse. \nAKASHA Prove it. Kill her. \n(CONTINUED) \n193   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               193 \nLESTAT She's nothing to me. \nAKASHA Just the same, I'd like you to kill her. For me. (to the Ancients) I've had enough of this 'great family.' It's time to end it. \nMaharet steps between Lestat and Jesse. \nThe Ancients are still flung around by Akasha's great strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally begins to subside. The mass of bodies sinks to the ground. The Ancients pull back to reveal that... \nAkasha's skin is deathly blue white.    In horror, she manages to spit out her words. \nAKASHA You kill me, you kill yourselves. \nThe Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment. \nAkasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze on Lestat. He gazes back at her. \nSuddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare green, marshalling the last of her wrath. Lestat cries out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs. \nFiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat, this time for the kill. Akasha sinks her nails into his throat. He hangs on, his teeth deep. They are locked in mortal combat. Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes. \nMAHARET Wait, Lestat! You must stop! \nLestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted, unnatural angle. \nThey all stare waiting to see what will happen... \n... Maharet moves quickly. She strides over to Akasha and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room. \nThe Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe. Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see... \nAkasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures. Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on the stone floor like porcelain. \nA silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other, astonished, as they realize they're still \"alive.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n193   CONTINUED:    (7)                                             193 \nKHAYMAN (whisper) We survived! \nThe Ancients let out relieved hisses. \nBut Lestat is only concerned about Jesse. He rushes to her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the floor and slices his wrist. He brings the open vein to Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. Lestat bends down to her ear and whispers. \nLESTAT I left you one drop, my love. Drink deep and live. \nJesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the blood. She begins to take the blood inside her and then finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her. She pulls away, gasping. Lestat looks into her eyes. \nJESSE I thought I'd lost you... \nLESTAT Drink, my love. \nHer lips move to his wrist. Lestat strokes her hair, soothes her. Jesse gasps as pain courses through her. Lestat holds her close. She looks up at him, their eyes are locked together. \nLESTAT I will never leave you again. \nHe holds her tight in his arms. \nAll the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what he did. \nSlowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her eyes glowing. Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet. All the Ancients turn, follow her gaze. \nA whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin. Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to stone. Jesse goes to her. \nJESSE Maharet... \n(CONTINUED) \n193   CONTINUED:    (8)                                                    193 \nMAHARET My child, let me look at you... You are finally happy. It is as it should be now... I will watch over you always. \nMaharet reaches out, embraces Jesse. Then Maharet sinks into a chair and freezes into a statue. \nARMAND (a reverent whisper) She took Akasha's last drop, took Akasha's death into herself. Behold, our Queen... our new mother... \nThe Ancients slowly bow to Maharet. Jesse slowly slips from Maharet's arms. Goes into Lestat's arms. \nJESSE Is she... dead? \nKHAYMAN No, she will live forever. She sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of us. \nJesse and Lestat hold onto each other, gazing at Maharet's face. On Maharet's lips is the most content of smiles. Jesse wipes away a tear. \nMarius turns to Lestat.    Their eyes meet.

You're no longer in his realm. Now we must leave. \nRelenting, Lestat starts to follow. But the music quickens. Lestat pauses, turns back. As if the music is calling to him. \nThe girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands there frozen to the spot.

Lestat starts clapping along to the music, exuberantly. \nThe girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play. Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that sitting on the ground by the girl are several instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with his new powers, as if by osmosis... \nBegins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her movements. \nThe girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful, exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold. \nUnconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into firelight. The Father and his daughter become less certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes. The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in horror at Lestat. \nFATHER Fantasma!! Teras!! \nLightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius. He grabs the Father. The girl drops her violin, turns, starts running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance. \nMARIUS Stop her, Lestat! \nLestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror. \nMARIUS You must! \nLestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. She turns back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream... Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her mouth, covering her muffled scream.

You will mind our laws! \nPicking up Lestat's victim, Marius tosses her into the boat as well. \nMARIUS We remain in the shadows.   To do otherwise is a road to destruction... \nMarius turns to Lestat, who stands in silence, gazing at the girl and her Father. \nMARIUS (quietly) I see you still have a few lingering mortal emotions.

She starts, quickens her pace... \nRuns straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises from her stomach.

Another couple is necking hot and heavy in the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire coven. Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt.

We'll entertain ourselves. \nAs Roger leads Lestat to the guest room, he can hear FAINT GIGGLING. Lestat turns back to the night. The PULSE of Akasha still ECHOES in his ears. \n130   INT. GUEST WING - JUST AFTER                                 130 \nRoger and Lestat walk in.   A young GROUPIE giggles nervously. \nGROUPIE #3 Oh my God, it's him!    It's really him... \nShe turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to her. Lestat stares, taken aback. It is Jesse. Dressed in Goth gear. Jesse stares back at Lestat brazenly. A long moment. \nLESTAT Perhaps you would like a tour of the place... first. \n(CONTINUED) \n130   CONTINUED:                                                    130 \nGROUPIE #3 Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that. \nLESTAT Roger... would you be so kind? \nROGER (surprised, relieved) Sure. Right this way, girls. \nAs they start off, Lestat puts up his hand, points to Jesse. \nLESTAT Roger. Not that one.   Leave her to me... \nThe other groupie pouts, disappointed. She goes out with Roger. Lestat turns to Jesse... considers her... \nLESTAT You must be very keen to die. \nJesse's heart pounds with terror. \nLESTAT The Talamascans have become quite stealthy. I didn't know infiltration was quite their style. \nJESSE It's not. I... I came on my own. \nHe stares at her, taking her in. \nLESTAT How did you find me? \nJESSE I've been tracking your manager for days... (gesturing to her Goth outfit) Then I figured out you simply have to look the part. \nLESTAT Clever librarian... You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again. \n(CONTINUED) \n130   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              130 \nJESSE I'm not a groupie... \nLestat gazes at Jesse's pulsing jugular.      He steps closer. \nLESTAT Then why are you following me? What do you want? \nJESSE (terrified, in a whisper) Are you granting wishes? \nLESTAT (smiles, in a whisper playing    with her) Last wishes. What's yours? \nJESSE Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat. \nHe stares at her, feeling some connection with this strange mortal girl. She stares at him with penetrating eyes. He again finds himself drawn to her. Tries to fight it. \nLESTAT (turning away) I don't have time for this. \nJESSE All a vampire has is time. \nLESTAT Maybe not. \nJESSE (softly) Right. The covens are coming for you. (softly) I understand why you're doing it. You have to be who you are, no matter what happens. \nHe turns, gazes at her.       She steps forward. \n(CONTINUED) \n130   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             130 \nJESSE But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat? As you always have... Alone. \n", "test3_true": "JESSE Don't kill me yet. Let's spend our last nights together. Share it with me.   Show me what it's like to be you. \nLESTAT You don't know what you're asking! I don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think. \nJESSE That's right. You don't know what's in my head, Lestat. Do you want to? \nLESTAT I'll know when I kill you. \nJESSE Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone. Here. I'll give you a preview. Coming attractions. This is what you'll find. \nShe crosses to him, stands close. \nJESSE I have this recurring dream that I'm a child and I'm living in this big house filled with vampires. And every night when I go to sleep, I wish to God the same thing... you know what that is, Lestat? \nHe gazes at her.    She leans forward. \n(CONTINUED) \n130   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             130 \nJESSE That I will have the dream again... Because in the dream I'm happy. And the dream is more real than my life... I don't know how, but I know you, Lestat... My life is a big mystery and you, you have the answer... \nHe gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it. Jesse moves even closer. He stares down at her, the softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat of her body. \nJESSE I can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. I can't live a lie... I'm just like you Lestat. We're the same... \nLESTAT (softly) Are we? I seek the light.     You seek the shadows. \nJESSE No. We're looking for exactly the same thing. You know it... Please. Show me. \nHe stares at her. Her eyes gazing directly into his... Suddenly... \nLESTAT Alright! \nJesse breaks into a smile. \nLESTAT This may be painful for a mortal. You're still attached to your skin. \nJESSE (an excited whisper) I don't care. \nLESTAT Close your eyes.    Don't breathe. \nHer heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, Jesse holds one deep, hesitant breath and... Flash -- with preternatural speed -- \n131   LESTAT AND JESSE                                               131 \nwhisk through the night, flashing past trees and houses. Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches the world whiz past her at incredible speed and suddenly -- they stop on a dime. \nJesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying out before her like a glimmering blanket. \n132   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT                         132 \nLooking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't believe what's just happened. She laughs, intoxicated by the experience. \nJESSE Do that again! \nLestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her. She knows it. He turns away. \nLESTAT And now for my next trick. \nLestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open. \nJesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She stares, impressed. \nJESSE Did it hurt? \nLESTAT Yes. For just a moment. But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy. (gazes at her) You see, we love our victims. \nJESSE Love?    I thought it was the blood. \nLESTAT No, although the taste is so rich and sweet. Love is the essence of the dark gift. The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else. \n(CONTINUED) \n132   CONTINUED:                                                          132 \nLestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular, the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch, terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm of his voice. \nLESTAT As you drink, you feel the heart weakening... it struggles even though there's no hope. You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. The taste of mortality you can no longer experience... and it is beautiful... (pulls away sharply) No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience. \nBut Jesse steps forward.       Lestat turns, stares at her. \nHer eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced. One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens her blouse down to her navel. \nLestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast. \nWith her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the point across her breast. She inhales through clenched teeth... then settles as we see: \nThe long incision go from pink to red; then the blood, like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping down her chest. \n", "test3_id": 2879}

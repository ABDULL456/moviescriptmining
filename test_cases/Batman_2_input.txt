INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT 
A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed. 
The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie: 
JOKER I'm in the belltower. Don't land. 
INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT 
A PILOT replies through his radio headset. 
PILOT E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on. 
The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc. 
INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead. Dried blood cakes his face, his chest. 
Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule back onto his dry, swollen tongue. 
Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs. 
THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step. 
It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell. 
Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS. 
For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last ounce of strength. 
The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it. 
He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side. 
THE BATMAN is out like a light. 
INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs. 
JOKER ... Batman? 
No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS BATMAN up into the belltower. 
He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- pats his face. 
JOKER (cont.) Batman? Batman? 
THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak. 
JOKER (cont.) I thought you'd be more comfortable here in the belfry. (chuckling to himself) Before I kill you I'd like to see who you are. Would that be okay? 
BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl. 
BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face. 
JOKER (cont.) Oh my, aren't we pretty. (brightening suddenly) I know you! You're the rich boy!! 
The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps his hands together in sheer glee. 
JOKER (cont.) My goodness, what in the world made you do it? It must've been something pretty terrible! 
He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend. 
JOKER (cont.) You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously. 
BATMAN Mad... man... 
JOKER Well now, you're not exactly the picture of mental health, are you. 
BATMAN ... Murderer... 
JOKER Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. 
A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his helicopter approaching in the distance. 
BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins. 
The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly. 
JOKER (cont.) I have to do it now, Bruce, but it won't even hurt. Now relax. The bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world... 
He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection. 
JOKER (cont.) Why, Bruce... 
Then he hears ticking. 
Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds. 
He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR. 
BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

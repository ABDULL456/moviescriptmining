SHOOTING DRAFT 
EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY 
A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. [Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & WHITE.] 
FOLLETT (V.O.) I get outta the truck in this two- bit town. I got no money and no prospects. What I need right now is a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order they come... 
EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY 
Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- an angle. 
He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) I was thinking -- if it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all... 
LANDLADY (O.S.) Can I help you? 
The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) Either my luck had just changed, or Fate just bought me another round of trouble. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY 
The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE: 
LANDLADY ...not very fancy... house needs repairs... We haven't had a man around here for so long... 
FOLLETT (V.O.) She kept yammerin' the whole time, but her hips were doing all the talking... 
The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage. 
FOLLETT (V.O.) It couldn't 'a been any clearer what the set-up was. The next move was up to me... 
The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction -- 
MUMFORD (V.O.) Don't tell me! 
INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY 
CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing. 
MUMFORD (softer) -- That's all the time we have. Sorry... (indicates his watch) ...next time. 
We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford. 
FOLLETT I have eighteen more minutes! 
MUMFORD I don't want to hear any more today. 
FOLLETT Why not? 
MUMFORD Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you? 
FOLLETT Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you -- 
MUMFORD Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come. 
FOLLETT Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come -- 
MUMFORD Good, then go. 
INT. LILY'S CAFÃ‰- DAY 
Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, crossing from the two-story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works. 
LILY You're early... it's not ready. What happened? 
MUMFORD My patient had to leave early.

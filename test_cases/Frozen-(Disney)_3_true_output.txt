HANS I would never shut you out. 
ANNA Okay, can I just say something crazy? 
HANS I love crazy. 
"Love is an Open Door" 
ANNA (singing) ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF DOORS IN MY FACE. AND THEN SUDDENLY I BUMP INTO YOU. 
HANS I was thinking the same thing, because like. . . (MORE) FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS (CONT'D) I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE TO FIND MY OWN PLACE. AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING, OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE. 
ANNA BUT WITH YOU- 
HANS BUT WITH YOU, I FOUND MY PLACE. 
ANNA I SEE YOUR FACE. 
BOTH AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER KNOWN BEFORE. 
They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door. 
They come out on top of one of the castle's towers. 
BOTH (CONT'D) LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR! 
Cut to them sliding across an empty hallway in their socks. 
BOTH (CONT'D) LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR 
ANNA WITH YOU! 
HANS WITH YOU! 
ANNA WITH YOU! 
HANS WITH YOU! 
BOTH LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR. 
They hop up on the castle roof and watch a shooting star. 
HANS I MEAN IT'S CRAZY. 
ANNA What? FROZEN - J. Lee 
HANS WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S- 
ANNA SANDWICHES! 
HANS That's what I was gonna say! 
They slide down the back of the roof out of sight. 
We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge. 
ANNA I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE- 
BOTH WHO THINKS SO MUCH LIKE ME. 
BOTH (SPOKEN) (CONT'D) Jinx.. . .jinx again. 
Are they doing the robot? No. They're imitating the mechanical figures on the clock tower. 
BOTH (CONT'D) OUR MENTAL SYNCHRONIZATION CAN HAVE BUT ONE EXPLANATION, 
HANS YOU- 
ANNA AND I- 
HANS WERE- 
ANNA JUST- 
BOTH MEANT TO BE. 
Anna and Hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing shadows across the sails of ships in the docks. 
ANNA SAY GOODBYE- 
HANS SAY GOODBYE- FROZEN - J. Lee 
BOTH TO THE PAIN OF THE PAST. 
BOTH (CONT'D) WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT ANYMORE! LOVE IS AN OPEN- 
They play hide and seek amongst the stable doors.

BAINES I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them. 
STEWART Yes, I suppose you would. 
BAINES remains silent. He looks away. 
STEWART Well Ada can play. 
BAINES shrugs. 
STEWART I have it in a letter she plays well. She's been playing since she was 5 or6. 
FLORA has stopped stacking. She is lying along the top of the wood, lifting a leg up and down, watching the men.

STEWART, flushed with his plans, is pouring tea into cups. FLORA peers at cup level through the steam. ADA sits beside her at the table. 
STEWART I have got us some excellent land. Baines has taken some queer idea to have a piano, and you are to give him lessons. Have you taught before? 
ADA signs to FLORA. 
FLORA What on? 
STEWART On your piano, that is the swap. 
ALA finger signs, her face furious. 
STEWART What does she say? 
FLORA She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant. 
STEWART He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ... (ADA is not responding well) Teach him to look after it. 
ADA's breathing becomes heavy with anger, she writes Curiously on her pad. 
NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S MINE! 
STEWART regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain 
STEWART (getting up) You can't go on like this, we are a family now, all of us make sacrifices and so will you. You will teach him. I shall see to that! 
ADA's emotions are suddenly removed and she views STEWART blankly, eerily so. 
Sc 37     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     SC 37 
The piano is taken up through the bush by a group of six to eight MAORI MEN. It's very heavy and awkward and they grunt and struggle with it. 
HiM na ake 'nun na'. (Lift up the back) UNSUBTITLED 
Tern - tern! (Ass hole!) 
Hei niti niti maan! (turning around) You lick it.) 
Someone stumbles and the back of the piano comes crashing to the ground thundering out in the bottom end of the scale. People scatter. Only one stays who warrior like challenges the piano.

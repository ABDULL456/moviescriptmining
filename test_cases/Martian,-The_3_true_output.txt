BECK Commander, I know you don't want to hear this, but Watn... Mark's dead. 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) Copy. (THEN) Martinez, try the radar. 
MARTINEZ Roger. 
As Martinez waits for the radar, he glares at Beck. 
MARTINEZ (CONT'D) What is wrong with you? 
BECK My friend just died. I don't want my Commander to die too. 
EXT. STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Lewis fights her way through the storm. 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) Negative contact on proximity radar. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEWIS Nothing? 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
MARTINEZ It can barely see the Hab. There's not ENOUGH MET-- 
SCREEEACH -- the MAV lurches, begins to tip -- 
MARTINEZ (CONT'D) Strap in! We're tipping! 
JOHANSSEN VOGEL 13 degrees -- -- We're past balance. We'll never rock back -- 
BECK Let it tip. We can't leave her. 
MARTINEZ We'll never be able to fix it if it tips. I got one trick left, then I'm following orders. 
EXT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
WHOOSH -- Martinez fires a burn from the nosecone array. The thrusters fight against the slow tilt of the spacecraft... 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
VOGEL You are firing the OMS? MARTINEZ JOHANSSEN C'mon... c'mon... 12.9 degrees... 
BECK Commander. You need to get back to the ship. Now. 
MARTINEZ Agreed. He's gone, Ma'am... 
EXT. STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Lewis stands alone in the storm. 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) Watney's gone. 
She stares out at the darkness all around her. 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Martinez fights the controls. Beck and Johanssen share nervous glances. Finally: 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) Copy. On my way. 
JOHANSSEN 11.6... 11.5... holding at 11.5... 
INT. MAV - AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
WHOOSH. Down below, Lewis slams the airlock door shut. She tears off her suit. Makes her way to the flight cabin. 
She doesn't say a word as she straps herself in to her couch. 
For a moment, nobody speaks. Then: 
MARTINEZ Still at pilot release. Ready for launch. 
Lewis closes her eyes. Nods. 
MARTINEZ (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Commander. You need to VERBALLY -- 
LEWIS Launch. 
Martinez nods. Activates the sequence. The pyros FIRE. The main engines IGNITE... 
CLOSE ON LEWIS. Just as the MAV LURCHES UPWARD, we -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. NASA - PRESS ROOM - DAY 
THEODORE "TEDDY" SANDERS, Director of NASA, steels himself before he steps to the podium. Normally, he leaves these briefings to his press secretary. 
Today is different. He opens a RED FOLDER. 
TEDDY At around 4:30 a.m., central standard time, our satellites detected a storm approaching the Ares 3 mission site on Mars. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TEDDY (CONT'D) By 6:45, the storm had escalated to "severe," and we had no choice but to abort the mission. Thanks to the quick action of Commander Lewis, astronauts Beck, Johanssen, Martinez, and Vogel were all able to reach the Mars Ascent Vehicle and perform an emergency launch at 7:28 central time. (THEN) Unfortunately, during the evacuation, Astronaut Mark Watney was struck by debris and killed. Commander Lewis and the rest of her team were able to intercept safely with the Hermes and are now heading home... (wavers, then) But Mark Watney is dead. 
As the CACOPHONY of questions erupts from the press --

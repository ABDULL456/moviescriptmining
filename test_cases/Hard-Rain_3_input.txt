HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS. 
IN THE TRUCK 
CHARLIE Goddammit! 
TOM It's a little dip in the road or something. You can see the reflectors come up the other side. 
CHARLIE (curses to himself) I knew this would happen. (grabs radio mike) 
TOM I'll see if there's anyone coming. Maybe we can get pulled out. 
Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency selection button; clicks on. 
CHARLIE Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling dispatch. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) (over radio) 31, this is dispatch. 
CHARLIE (into radio) Dispatch, we're stuck outside of Huntingburg. Truck's dead. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) Where are you? 
CHARLIE We're on 231, headed for the Interstate. Right by a sign saying "Welcome to Huntingburg." 
Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck. 
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK 
Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the town. But there are no cars coming. 
IN THE TRUCK 
Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the doorway. 
TOM The town's been evacuated. We won't get any help from there. 
CHARLIE Dispatch can't get anyone out. 
TOM They are aware we're carrying a shitload of money...? 
CHARLIE They called the National Guard. They're gonna be here in about ninety minutes. 
TOM Ninety minutes? Jesus. 
CHARLIE (nods; into radio) Dispatch, we're gonna need help a little sooner than -- 
There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and interior lights and the headlights go out. 
TOM Oh, shit. 
INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW 
Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water- covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings across the window. 
EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR 
The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone. 
SHERIFF (into mike) Henry, I saw you. Come on out. 
No one comes out of the house. 
SHERIFF Henry, I'm not leaving until you come out. 
A few moments pass and then... 
HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY 
Late 70s, step out onto their porch. 
DOREEN Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you to stay away from the damn window. 
THE SHERIFF 
Gets out of the car. 
SHERIFF What are you still doing here? 
HENRY We're just -- 
DOREEN We're setting traps. 
SHERIFF That's illegal, Doreen. 
DOREEN You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? Didn't you lose an election? I sure as hell know I didn't vote for you, and neither did Henry. 
HENRY Doreen... 
SHERIFF You don't need to set traps. 
DOREEN That's what they said in '73. When we got back, anything the bastards didn't steal they broke, just for the hell of it. 
SHERIFF That's not happening this time. 
DOREEN Damn right it's not. 
SHERIFF You can't stay, you know that. 
HENRY We're going to my sister's. 
SHERIFF Good. 
DOREEN Soon as we finish setting the traps. 
The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the car.

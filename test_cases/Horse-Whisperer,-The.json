{"test1_input": "ANNIE Why don't you go lie down? \nGRACE I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough. \nROBERT You want to watch some television? \nGRACE (edgy) Maybe... look -- just... \nRobert and Annie wait. She doesn't continue. She rises, reaching for her crutches. Robert moves to help. \nGRACE I got it! I got it! \nShe exits into her room. Annie looks at him disapprovingly. \nINT. ANNIE AND ROBERT'S BATHROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie and Robert stand before their separate sinks, talking to each other through their separate mirrors, as they wash up for bed. \nANNIE You've got to stop doing that? \nROBERT Doing what? \nANNIE Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time. \nRobert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word. He exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed. For a beat, he stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly. \nROBERT You know, Annie, this didn't just happen to you. \nAnnie is applying moisturizer when she hears this. As it sinks in, she doesn't like it. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGrace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled, tense voices. Annie is angry at his complacency. Robert just wants what's best for Grace. She closes the door. Silence. She puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk towards her bureau without them. It is a struggle, but she does... almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time. The 8X10 of her and Pilgrim, falls face down. She props it up and looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on Judith. Suddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the floor... \nROBERT (O.S.) Honey, you all right? Did something fall? \nGRACE (angrily shouts) NO! \nEXT. GRACE'S PRIVATE SCHOOL - MORNING \nAnnie pulls up in a Range Rover and stops. Grace moves for the door. Annie asks respectfully; \nANNIE Do you want any help? \nGrace doesn't even bother to answer. She manages to get onto the pavements, then turns for her bag... \nAnnie notices other kids looking at Grace from behind, as they enter the school. \nANNIE Dad'll pick you up today, all right? \nGRACE Okay. \nGrace looks up to her mother. What is unspoken between them is the understanding that today will be difficult and there's nothing either one can do about it. \nANNIE You'll be fine. \nGrace nods and turns to the school. Annie watches her go. \nINT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - MORNING \nGrace makes her way through the hall. It is the first time she has had to maneuver through a crowd. Some of the younger children are especially unconscious. Grace sweats her way through, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity. \nAs Grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had that she could get through this day, begins to diminish. \nINT. ANNIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nAnnie moves about the office, hands in pocket, in front of her wall of windows. LUCY and her staff sitting around the office. Annie is speaking to a YOUNG WOMAN staff member; \nANNIE I don't care what he told you! The man's a liar! The man's an actor, for Christ's sake. They're all liars! They'll say anything to get a cover... \nThe Young Woman looks insulted. AN ASSISTANT comes in to give Annie a note; \nEXT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - DAY \nAnnie is crossing an empty school yard. Grace is sitting on the ground, her back against a wall, her \"legs\" in front of her. She has been crying. She looks up to her mother. \nGRACE It's too hard. \nAnnie kneels before her sympathetically brushing her hair away: \nANNIE Oh, honey... What happened? \nGRACE Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all. \nANNIE (softly) Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what -- \nGRACE (snaps) I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home! \nANNIE Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well... \nGRACE Is that your version of a pep talk? \nANNIE You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. \nGRACE (snotty) Fine! \nANNIE It's still early. What's your next class? \nWith secret delight, Grace viciously utters the word: \nGRACE Gym! \nINT. ANNIE AND ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie is at her desk studying Grace's book on Horse Whisperers. Robert is on his bed with briefs laid out before him. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nThe door is closed. A SONG blares on her stereo. Grace is in her bed watching a video of her and Pilgrim... riding at a horse show. There's a shot of Annie standing proudly, watching her ride. Another shot of her and Judith, both of them on their horses, waving to camera. \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nGrace enters. \n", "test1_true": "Both Robert and Annie look up. \nROBERT What, sweetheart? \nGRACE (beat) I want to see Pilgrim. \nRobert and Annie exchange an anxious look. \nEXT. DYER HORSE FARM, CONNECTICUT - DAY \nIt's raining. The MacLean car is parked by the barn. They are walking towards the stables under their umbrellas as Liz runs to greet them. \nLIZ Hello... (to Grace) It's so good to see you. How ya doing? \nROBERT She's doing just grea. Aren't you kiddo? \nGRACE I'm fine. \nLIZ Well, come on. He's out back now... (leads them) Mind how you go. It's pretty muddy back there. \nGRACE Why is he in the back? Why isn't he in the barn with the other horses? \nLiz stops, causing everyone to stop. She turns to face Grace, realizing she doesn't know. She looks at Robert and Annie, accusingly. She tries to explain: \nLIZ Well, Grace, you see... Pilgrim just... isn't the same horse he used to be. (to the parents) As a matter of fact, maybe now's not the best time to -- \nGRACE I really want to see him. \nLiz looks at Annie. Annie nods. Liz leads them on. \nThey reach a row of empty old stalls. They cross to one of the stalls -- its doors are closed. Liz draws back the bolt on top half of the door. \nThere is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall, the sound of fear, startling them. Then it's still. Liz slowly opens the door. Grace, with the aide of her cane, walks to the stall. She hesitates, then looks in. It takes a moment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark. She sees Pilgrim with his head down in the shadows... \nGRACE Hello, beautiful boy... \nHe lifts his head at the sound of her voice. Grace, and the audience, see him for the first time -- His mad eyes, his terrible disfigurement... \nGrace cries out, stepping backwards, nearly stumbling in the mud... What is left of her horse are gone. Annie realizes what's happened and, together with Robert, rush to her... They too see the monster Pilgrim has become and are horrified. Grace angrily pushes away from them and \"runs\" off. Robert goes after her. \nAnnie is standing in the rain with Liz -- her eyes unable to move away from the sight of Pilgrim. \nLIZ (O.S.) You should have told her, Annie. I tried to explain to you how bad it was... I guess you had to see it. But, there's nothing to be done. This animal's beyond help. Annie, can I have your permission now to put him down? \nAnnie stands in the rain, hands in pocket, fixed on Pilgrim and more determined than ever; \nANNIE No. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAlone in her study, Annie sits before her computer searching the Internet for information on HORSES -- Veterinarian Journals, Therapies, Accidents, Eistories... We sense she's been at it a while... \nShe locates an ITEM TITLE -- HORSE WHISPERERS. Interested, she brings it up on the screen. \nINT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT \nAnnie sits in the huge reading room, books spread out before her, under a green reading lamp. Her voice tells us what she's reading: \nANNIE (V.O.) \"It was in America that horses first roamed...\" \nIn the books, we see pictures, lithographs, paintings and drawings... \nANNIE (V.O.) \"A million years before the birth of man, they grazed the vast empty plains of grass and crossed to other continents over bridges of rocks... They first knew man as the hunted knows the hunter, for long before man saw horses as a means to killing other beasts, man killed them for meat...\" \nANNIE'S V.O. CONTINUES OVER; \nINT. PILGRIM'S STALL - NIGHT \nANNIE (V.O.) \"...The alliance with man would forever be fragile -- for the fear he'd struck into their hearts was too deep to be dislodged... Since that Neolithic moment when a horse was first haltered, there were those among men who understood this...\" \nINT. GRACE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nGrace sits alone in her darkened room, staring out the window but not looking at anything. There's a discomforting distance in her expression. \nANNIE (V.O.) \"... They could see into the creature's soul and soothe the wounds they found there...\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A FAIRGROUNDS PARKING LOT, CALIFORNIA - DAY \nA hot, dusty fairgrounds horse arena. The worn wooden bleachers, crowded. Lines of cars and pick-up trucks. \nANNIE (V.O.) \"...For secrets uttered softly into troubled ears, these men were known as The Whisperers...\" \nOne particular pick-up truck has its back door opened. A MAN'S LEG is sticking out, putting on a pair of boots. \nA moment later the Man gets out of the car. Holding a cowboy hat, he has a certain quality, a self-respect, that men who know themselves seem to have. TOM BOOKER. \nA weathered redheaded woman named RONA -- late forties, strong, wiry horsewoman's build -- is walking towards him. \nRONA Hey, darlin'. \nTOM Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late. \nRONA I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time. \nThey walk together towards the fairgrounds. \nTOM You're looking fit. \nRONA Fit? You want to check my teeth. (Tom laughs) Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner? \nTOM If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might. \nRONA (playful) Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for. \nTOM Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck. \nRona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena. \nEXT. HORSE ARENA, CALIFORNIA - DAY \nInside the corral, a small black thoroughbred is being worked by Tom. As he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to the crowd, we sense this is a man of good humor and great skill --  guileless, sensible, of the earth. \n", "test1_id": 816, "test2_input": "DAVID GOTTSCHALL (V.O.) If nothing goes wrong. If the faxes don't go down. If the phone lines are opened. I can't have this magazine hitting the streets by the skin of its ass, Annie. \nDuring David's lines, Diane has entered, carrying fresh towels -- she crosses into the bathroom. \nANNIE Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement. \nWithout Annie's awareness, Diane re-enters and takes her time leaving, so she can take in all of Annie's things; her business \"office,\" books, etc... \nANNIE What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me? \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana? \nDiane can't help but notice a slight vulnerability in Annie. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) Look, this is what we're going to do. Finish up this issue. I'll set up a conference call in a few weeks. Just you, me and your lawyer and we'll just work this out so that everyone will be taken care of. Fair enough? \nAnnie is now aware of Diane's presence and chooses to play it cool. It's not the moment. \nANNIE Uh, yes... Sure, David. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) All right. Speak to you then. \nHe hangs up. Annie forces a smile to Diane. \nANNIE Thank you. You're all doing too much. \nDIANE Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway. \nAnnie doesn't know whether or not to accept. \nANNIE Oh... Well... thank you very much. I don't -- \nBefore she finishes her line, the Phone Rings again. \nANNIE Sorry. (to phone) Hello? Hi, yeah, I just spoke to him. Oh, you know David, Mr. Strong Arm... \nDiane feels out of place and exits. Annie doesn't notice until she hears the door close. She pushes back her hair and takes a deep breath. She looks out through the side window and sees: \nGrace and Joe doing chores. Grace looks involved and not at all self-conscious. A moment of gratitude and calm for Annie. \nEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nPilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena. He runs to the far end and abruptly stops. Tom is holding the orange flagstick, and coiled rope, coming through a gate into the arena, crossing to the middle of the ring. Something in his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over. \nPilgrim and Tom stand there, motionless, eyeing each other. Pilgrim snorts and takes a few, small steps backward. Tom takes a beat, then starts slowly towards Pilgrim, lifting the flag and \"cracking\" it. At the sound, Pilgrim whirls away from him and runs, around the arena. He starts to slow, looking at Tom. Again, Tom cracks the flag and Pilgrim runs, round and round the arena... like a ringmaster, Tom keeps Pilgrim moving, cracking the flag. \nSomething about Tom's demeanor tells us it isn't going well. \nEXT. THE RANCH - DAY \nTom, carrying a saddle, comes around the side of the barn. Through the slats, he sees Grace working in the barn, watering a horse. She has stopped and is looking through the cracks of Pilgrim's stall at him. She turns and sees Tom through the slats. She goes back to work as Tom comes to the barn door. \nTOM Come and take a ride with me. \nEXT. THE RANCH - DAY \nThey walk towards his pick-up truck. \nTOM Can you drive? \nGRACE Drive? I'm not old enough yet. \nTOM It's never too soon to start. \nHe enters the passenger side. \nGRACE I can't... \nTOM I don't have all day. \nShe hesitates and gets into the truck. \nINT. PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY \nGrace doesn't know what to do. \nTOM Put the key in and turn it. (Grace obeys) The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake. \nGRACE I don't know if I can with my leg. \nTOM Well, there's only one way to find out. (puts truck in gear) Give it a little gas. \nShe awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal. Too much. It lurches forward. She takes her foot off. \nTOM Well, we know you can. Now you just got to feel how much. Try it again. \nShe does. They slowly, very slowly, move along the dirt road. \nTOM Nice, real nice. There's a little road down at the end here, turn onto it. \nGrace badly oversteers, but makes the turn. She drives along the road, across a pasture, heading toward distant mountains. \nTOM Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road. \nGRACE (afraid) I don't know if I can. \nTOM Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself. \nFolding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, Tom relaxes back. Grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and her eyes straight ahead... \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nThe truck is parked at the foot of a mountain. Grace, very pleased with herself, sits beside Tom on the cab's roof, looking around them at the great Montana. After a beat; \nTOM Where did you get Pilgrim from? \nGRACE We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him. \nTOM That must have been pretty special. \nGrace nods. It is a pleasant memory. He motions for her to be quiet. An old ELK with a prodigious rack of antlers, has come down out of the mountains. Seeing them, he stops in his tracks, dead still. They watch each other. Then the elk turns and runs back up into the mountains. Tom smiles at Grace who smiles back -- partly because of the elk, partly because she's alone with Tom. \n", "test2_true": "TOM (thinks) Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. (beat) What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim? \nGrace doesn't say anything. Tom nods then; \nTOM You see, Grace, I've got a problem. When I'm working with a horse, I like to know its history. Now, most times, the horse can tell you pretty much the whole story, but sometimes he can be so messed up in his head that you need more to go on. You need to know exactly what went wrong. Often times, it's the obvious thing, but something that went wrong just before that, maybe even some little thing... \nGrace is quiet. She doesn't want to think about that. \nTOM It's like if I'm driving and run into a tree. When somebody asks me, \"Well, what happened?\", I don't say, \"Well, I plowed into a tree.\" I'd say, \"The sun was in my eyes.\" or \"I skidded.\" or \"I took my mind off the road for a second.\" See what I mean? (Grace nods) I don't know how you feel about talking about it and I can understand you might not want to. But if I'm going to figure out what's going on in his head, it'd sure help if I knew exactly what happened that day. \nGrace looks away. Tom smiles and gently puts his arm around her shoulders, which has a soothing effect on Grace -- making her feel safe... \nTOM Not today -- whenever you feel like it. I leave it up to you. \nGrace looks into Tom's eyes, wanting so much to unburden herself to him and have him make everything all right. She nods. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT \nTom is making his way to the house at the end of the day, when he stops and looks over to the Creek house -- \nPOV -- the lights are on. And he can see Annie, exhausted... approving pages, talking on the phone and faxing all simultaneously. \nHe gets an idea. \nEXT. CREEK HOUSE - MORNING \nAnnie sits on the porch of the creek house, with a guilt over herself, sipping coffee and deep in thought. She looks up to see: \nTom riding towards the house on his horse, leading another horse behind him. He looks to her and smiles. \nANNIE (murmurs) Oh-oh. \nTom reaches the house as Annie rises. \nANNIE The answer's no. \nTOM You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out... \nANNIE Poor thing. \nTOM He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you. \nANNIE Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill? \nTOM No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra. \nShe gives him a crooked smile. \nEXT. THE RANCH, PASTURE - DAY \nAnnie, in Levis and a jacket, rides Rimrock beside Tom across the pasture. We overhear them in the midst of talking. \nTOM Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket. \nANNIE Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas... \nTOM OK. I'll stop talking then. \nHe rides a few steps ahead as Annie realizes she doesn't remember. She just went into automatic \"I don't have to be told anything\" mode. \nANNIE Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead. \nTOM Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse. (watches her ride) Good... You have a nice seat. \nANNIE Thanks. \nTOM Feel good? \nANNIE Yeah. \nTOM You look all right. You want to pick it up a little? \nANNIE OK. \nTom urges his horse into a center. Annie canters alongside. \nTOM Watch your reins, he'll go with you, give him some room, let him do the work. Relax, don't grab him with your thighs, just so long as he can feel your body. \nAnnie responds to every suggestion without resistance. And she experiences this sense of pleasure -- this great animal beneath her, the physicality and the surrender of letting someone else lead... \nTOM You want to let it go some more? \nShe begins to let herself go, losing herself in the experience. She just nods... Tom breaks into a full gallop... Annie follows suit... She lets everything go -- her job, her marriage, motherhood, guilt, anxiety... all of it. Her only focus is the horse beneath her, and the man on the horse leading her... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nThey ride along the creek, crossing at a ford. They ride up towards the mountains. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DAY \nThey ride through a narrow pass with sheer rock walls, riding by a waterfall... \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nThey ride across a meadow, cattle stepping lazily aside to let them pass. And as they ride alongside each other, appreciating the silence... \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nThey ride up along a sloping ridge covered with pine trees. They come to the rim of a high bluff. They stop. They look out at the twin valleys that gave the ranch its name. And they can just see the old CREEK HOUSE hidden in the shade of some trees along the creek... \nTom looks over at Annie, who is looking out over this beautiful vista. \nANNIE It's a whole other world you have going on here. It just goes along, doing what it has to. And you're a part of it, you just wake up and, and there you are... And everything that seems like life or death some place else -- doesn't affect any of this one bit. \nTom is impressed by her feelings. He sees her saddle cinch needs fixing and gets off his horse. \nTOM Lift your leg. \nAnnie complies once she realizes what he's doing. \n", "test2_id": 817, "test3_input": "Robert takes an isolated hike up the mountain until he comes upon a ridge overlooking an inspiring vista. We can tell Robert is moved by the sight. Sweaty, tired, he find a place to sit... to be still... and to consider his life. \nEXT. THE RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nFrank's car is parked up for the trip to the airport that will take the Bookers to Branton, Missouri for Diane's cousin's wedding... \nGrace, Annie and Robert are outside saying goodbye to the Bookers; Diane, the Twins... and Joe... Joe awkwardly shakes her hand... then removes his hat and puts it on her head. Everyone laughs. They want to hug each other, but don't know if they would... \nFrank and Tom are packing the car... \nDIANE Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. (to Robert and Annie) I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter. \nFRANK Diane! \nDIANE (whispers) Frank's touchy about his cousins. (they laugh) Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean. \nROBERT Same here, Mrs. Booker. Thank you again for all your kindness. \nDIANE Ah... \nDiane turns to Annie. Robert instinctively steps away, saying goodbye to Joe and the boys... The two women look at each other with respect and concern. \nDIANE Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing. \nANNIE I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for. (Diane nods) Between you and me, I could use the time alone. \nDiane understands. \nDIANE And you'll be all right by yourself here, (referring to Robert and Grace) after they've gone? \nTom hears this bit of info as he passes by with the wedding present and puts it in the truck. Annie makes sure to avert her look. \nANNIE It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks. \nDIANE (double meaning) Promise? \nANNIE Promise. \nDiane just nods, knowingly. She extends her hand. The women shake. \nDIANE Good luck to you, Annie. \nANNIE You too, Diane. \nThey part. Diane starts giving order as she gets in the car: \nDIANE All right, everybody in. Frank, we all set... \nCamera wides as we hear the voices of departure... see the MacLeans waving... See Tom off by himself, waving... but thinking of something else... \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the midst of packing, Annie has made dinner for Grace and Robert. In the midst of eating, Robert asks: \nROBERT Shouldn't we have invited Tom over? \nGRACE I did. He said he had work to do until late. \nAnnie remains silent. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE -- NIGHT \nTom exits with a small, leather satchel. He crosses to his truck, tosses in the satchel, gets in and drives off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARN - MORNING \nGrace enters the barn to say goodbye to Pilgrim. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nShe moves to his stall and opens the doors. He stands there, without any fear of her. She smiles and enters. She wraps her arm around his neck, pets him and whispers. \nGRACE I'll see you home... OK? \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - DAY \nEverything is being packed up. Robert is dressed for travel. Annie is taping up the boxes containing her computer equipment. \nANNIE Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut? \nROBERT Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back? \nANNIE Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark. \nROBERT May I have a suggestion? \nANNIE Yeah, what? \nROBERT Take your time. \nANNIE (innocently) What do you mean? \nAnnie looks up from the box to see Robert is calmly staring at her. His demeanor is different. Something's going on. \nANNIE You look like something's wrong. \nThis is Robert's moment. He knows it. He takes a breath and hopes it comes out right: \nROBERT I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me. \nANNIE I don't understa- \nROBERT (continues) And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them. (Annie waits; he smiles) See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more. (smiles) But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore... (bravely) And I don't want you to come home until you do know... (the hard part) ... one way or the other. \nAnnie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband more than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to say this. She would not disrespect it with denials. Her throat is choked with tears, she swallows down. She nods. \nRobert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same moment. He picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nAnnie and Robert walk towards the car to find Grace, leaning against it -- looking depressed. \n", "test3_true": "GRACE Tom's gone. \nBoth Robert and Annie are surprised. \nGRACE Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye. \nANNIE (hiding her own distress) Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home. \nShe embraces Grace and, over her shoulder, watches Robert enter the car. Grace follows suit. The car drives off leaving Annie alone at the Double Divide. \nEXT. CREEK HOUSE - DUSK \nThe ranch is still. Annie stands on the porch, her arms folded, vulnerable, looking at the ranch. All her boxes are packed and stacked in the room. She looks over to the Ranch House... to Tom's window. \nINT. TOM'S ROOM - DUSK \nA light goes on. Annie enters, cautiously. She's never been in this room. She crosses to the desk, touches it. She notices a tape player and pushes it on. MUSIC PLAYS... She sees a small framed photo -- of Tom's son, years ago. \nSuddenly, she feels like an intruder. She shuts the music off and exits... \nINT. BARN - DUSK \nAnnie faces Pilgrim... she gently lifts her hand and caresses his face. He returns her gentleness. Annie is remembering Robert's words, her heart is heavy with conflict. She jokes: \nANNIE Why do I get the feeling you know what I should do, but you're not telling me? \nShe hears a truck pull up... Then, a door open and close. Her heart races... \nEXT. BARN - DUSK \nAnnie exits the barn and sees: \nTom, walking away from the truck with the headlights left on... is walking right towards her. \nAnnie begins moving towards him, When they meet: \nTOM I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody. \nANNIE I won't ask you to. \nHe takes her in his arms and they kiss. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT \nTom leads Annie to the front door. She waits as he unlocks it. \nINT. RANCH HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR, TOM'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTom leads her to his room. Annie cups his grasp on her with both hands. He opens the door for her, ushers her in, then closes the door. He hangs his hat. She turns to him. They embrace, surrendering to each other's passions. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RANCH - DAWN \nCamera pas from Tom's window, bright with dawn, past his desk upon which his classical music is playing, over to the two lovers in bed, kissing and embracing. Then: \nANNIE Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to -- \nTOM Ssshhh... (she stops) Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that? \nBeat. She nods. The permission Tom is giving her acts like a great burden being lifted, and for the time being, she surrenders and accepts the gift of what they feel. They kiss. \nEXT. THE RANCH - DAY \nSince the ranch must continue, Tom and Annie move through a day of ranch chores -- \n-- TOM AND ANNIE CLEANING STALLS AND FEEDING THE HORSES. \n-- TOM IS TRYING TO SHOW ANNIE HOW HE HAS TO FIX SOMETHING. ANNIE INTERRUPTING WITH HER OWN IDEAS... TOM TRIES TO EXPLAIN BUT ANNIE KEEPS TALKING, EXCITED BY HER PLAN... TOM LAUGHS. \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - DAY \nANNIE HAS UNPACKED HER COMPUTER AND HOOKED IT UP, SHOWING TOM HOW TO USE IT. HE PUSHES THE THRONG BUTTON AND MAKES A FRIGHTENED FACE... ANNIE SCREAMS, THEN LAUGHS AND HUGS HIM. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHEY ARE MAKING LOVE ON A BLANKET AMIDST OF THE MOVING BOXES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. \nINT. KITCHEN, RANCH HOUSE - DAY \n-- ANNIE COOKING LUNCH IN THE KITCHEN, SEEING TOM WORKING WITH SMOKEY... \nEXT. PASTURE - DAY \n-- THE TWO ARE EATING LUNCH IN THE PASTURE. THEY ARE TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT SOMETHING... PERHAPS EVEN DISAGREEING... ANNIE SHAKES HER HEAD, NOT WANTING TO LISTEN. THEY EAT IN SILENCE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n-- THEY ARE WALKING AND DISCUSSING, HOLDING HANDS... UNTIL TOM WRAPS HIS ARM AROUND HER AND HOLDS HER CLOSER... ANNIE, BURYING HER HEAD IN HIS BODY. \nEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DAY \nTom and Annie, their horses packed with gear, ride across the high mountain pasture through the grazing cattle... \nEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DAY \nAnnie and Tom sit overlooking a breathtaking view. Tom is showing her the rope trick... She looks down at their touching fingers and he gently pulls the rope away, still knotted, and without ever breaking their touch... Annie looks into his eyes, understanding what this means, raises his hand to her mouth and kisses it. She looks up at him with a curious expression; \nANNIE Show me again. \nTOM Annie! \nANNIE One more time. \nEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DUSK \nAnnie lays asleep in Tom's arms, under a blanket. He picks up another blanket with his free hand and shimmies it under her head, laying her down. She snuggles with the blanket and keeps sleeping. \nTom takes a moment to look at her as she sleeps, gently brushing her hair away from her eyes. He's deeply in love with this woman and wants to keep her with him. But there is a sad resignation in his look. A confusion. \nHe rises and walks to a stream nearby. He bends down to take some water when he hears something. He looks up and sees on the other side: \nA WILD HORSE giving birth to a foal in the tall grass. And a WHITE STALLION steps in between Tom and the mare, as if protecting her. \n", "test3_id": 818}

{"train": "THE HORSE WHISPERER \nThe Horse Whisperer \nScreenplay by Eric Roth \nRevised by Richard LaGravenese \nScreenplay by Erich Roth \nBased on the Novel by Nicholas Evans Revised by Richard LaGravenese \nSecond Draft \nFADE IN: \nA DREAM: \nINT. STABLES; PILGRIM'S STALL - MORNING \nSunlit illuminates the darkened stable, highlighting the contours of a magnificent HORSE (PILGRIM) in surreal, dream- like imagery: his legs, his muscles, his sheen, his mane... his eyes. He shakes his head and stamps his feet. He seems confined. Eager to run. \nINT. STABLES - MORNING \nPilgrim bursts through the stall and runs out the stables into a blinding white morning. \nEXT. AN OPEN FIELD LEADING TO WOODS - BRIGHT MORNING \nWhiteness. Snow and sky without any discernible line between. \nCamera is POV, as if on the horse, riding through the whiteness. Snow kicks up from the side. We hear the breathing of the horse. As we travel on hills, through trees, we experience of sense of wild, exhilarating freedom. \nWe hear the giggles of a GIRL (GRACE) on the horse. An occasional line; \nGRACE (O.S.) Yeah, fly boy... that's it... go... go... go... \nEND OF DREAM as we CUT TO: \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nGrace awakens, calmly. Takes a breath. Slides out of bed and stands before a window, overlooking a beautiful Connecticut country house. We see a snow-covered field and distant woods. Grace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window eager to get out. \nINT. MACLEAN NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING \nAlarm rings, ANNIE MACLEAN awakens. She shuts the alarm and scoots up in bed. She waits. Seconds later the television across the foot of her bed turns on from a timer -- to a CNN 24 NEWS channel. \nINT. HALLWAY/ANNIE & ROBERT'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nGrace, fully dressed except for her boots, tiptoes past a partially opened bedroom door. Her father ROBERT is asleep, alone, on his huge king size bed. \nINT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING \nGrace is putting on her boots on a bench beside a back door. She is wearing her mother's outfit. As she slides the boot on, we see behind her a row of framed photos -- Robert, Grace and Annie in happy times. \nShe slaps a note on the refrigerator, with a magnet -- \"Gone riding. Back around 10. Love, G.\" \nEXT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE, BACK ENTRANCE - MORNING \nGrace slips on her jacket and hat as she comes down the steps, her feet hitting the walk... \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING \nAnnie's feet hit the ground, running -- her breath showing in the cold air. She passes other joggers with ease. She crosses the street and heads for an elegant CPW building. \nINT. MACLEAN'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING \nDressed in running clothes, Annie opens the door and picks up several newspapers that were delivered. She carries them into the kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications, magazines, papers, etc... Knowing she must read all of them at some point, she breathes a disgusted sign. She thumbs through the POST as she pours herself a cup of coffee. Something catches her eyes and she snarls: \nANNIE That little shit! \nShe dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as she talks: \nANNIE Hi Lucy?... Did I wake you?... Have you read the Post?... They've got a little item about me and Fiske. He's saying I fired him and that I faked the new circulation figures.. Ha, ha... Oh, please... It's the last act of a desperate gnome... Set up a phone call with Don Farlow for 9:30... \nThroughout the phone call, Annie is selecting clothes, turning on the shower, undressing... \nEXT. DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING \nThe snow has stopped falling. Grace walks along a hill, hands in pocket. Spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse farm, standing like statues in the white covered fields. \nAs Grace comes along the hill, we see another GIRL (JUDITH) coming from the opposite direction. She doesn't have Grace's lean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her face. Upon reaching her, Grace returns the smile with a hug. \nJUDITH It's warmer than I thought. \nGRACE You want to go to a movie tonight? \nJUDITH I thought your mom's coming up? \nGRACE (prickly) So? \nJudith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, as they begin walking away from Camera... \nJUDITH My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger. \nGRACE Can I come? I'll start a fire... \nJudith laughs as they continue talking, their voices trailing off, as the girls head for the stables. \nINT. STABLES, THE DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING \nThere are several horses in their stalls. Grace and Judith enter, talking, carrying their English saddles. Judith stops at a stall, disappearing into it as she says \"Hello?\"..., Grace continues to the end stall. \nPilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her. \nGRACE Hello, beautiful boy. \nHe's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition. She enters, touching his muzzle. He plays with her by nudging her back. \nGRACE Stop... Will you stop! \nEXT. DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING \nThey lead their horses, now saddled and ready, from the barn. Pilgrim tosses his head, prancing, playing with the snow. \nThat was too much information for Annie; \nANNIE Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive... \nLIZ Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain... \nANNIE Well, of course, right... \nROBERT What is it? \nLIZ (overlapping) We really shouldn't wait... \nANNIE (overlapping) Hold on, Liz... (to Robert) Something about Pilgrim... \nThe Doctor pokes his head in. \nDOCTOR (overlapping) Mr. and Mrs. MacLean... \nANNIE (overlapping) -- put him down. She says... \nROBERT (overlapping, to Doctor) Yes. Hi. (to Annie) Tell her you'll call her back. \nHe exits with the Doctor. \nANNIE Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so -- \nLIZ (interrupting) I understand, but Annie, please... \nANNIE (overlapping) - See, what you can do for him --... \nLIZ (overlapping) Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same. \nANNIE ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- \nLIZ It isn't right to make him suffer... \nANNIE And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! (Liz is quiet) I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? (softer) Please. \nLiz is stopped by Annie's almost pleading tone. \nLIZ All right... \nThey hang up. Annie takes a breath. Robert re-enters. \nANNIE What did he say? \nROBERT Nothing new. He's just going off duty. \nBeat. Silence. \nANNIE I'm going to get all the nurses' names... It's good to know all their names. \nRobert nods. But neither of them moves. They stand motionless for a beat, then Annie begins to break down and eases herself into Robert's arms. \nRobert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly comfort. His expression tells us it's the moment he's been expecting... and wanting. Now she'll be all right, in his arms. Whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment -- for Robert -- gone. \nBut Annie's expression tells us something different. Her instinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the same anymore. Something doesn't feel right. Something isn't working anymore about his comforting embrace. \nANNIE I should go get some of her things. \nROBERT No, let me go. \nANNIE (gently pushing away) No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up. \nINT. THE UNIVERSITY ANIMAL HOSPITAL, RECOVERY STALLS - NIGHT \nA line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals. Liz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall. There's a slight scratching sound. A hoof against the stall. It gets louder, awakening Liz. She gets up and looks inside the paddled stall: \nPilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged. He is waking up. His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls. He looks at Liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to still be alive. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM IN FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nAnnie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light. Camera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the bed and opens it. She begins her task with cool efficiency. Opening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken, what isn't necessary. \nSuddenly, she stops. She feels disoriented for a moment. She can't remember the last time she was inside this room. She takes a moment to pause and actually look around. \nIn the light, we now see more of Grace's inner sanctum. Horse riding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls. Books. A girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession ranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching towards adulthood. Annie examines some items, affectionately. A GOOD LUCK CHARM from India sits among her things. Annie takes it to pack in the suitcase. \nShe notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop Pilgrim with Judith at her heel. She then notices the edge of another picture behind this one, in the frame. She pulls the Pilgrim photo out to reveal: An old 8X10 of Annie hugging Grace as a toddler. With her back to Camera, Annie remembers: \nMEMORY: \nINT. GRACE'S ROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED \nAnnie is playing with toddler Grace. Chasing her around the room. Picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed. Blowing into her stomach. Grace is laughing uncontrollably. \nEND OF MEMORY \nAnnie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame, then returns to her task of packing. \nINT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie enters. No one else is there. She places the suitcase on a chair and opens it. She takes out the INDIAN LUCKY CHARM and some horse books, and places them on her bedside table. She takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm. \nShe wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently wipes Grace's sweaty brow... INSERT VISUAL FLASHBACK HERE, instead of in Country House. \nAnnie then continues unpacking the suitcase. She opens Grace's closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Grace's clothes at the time of the accident. Annie examines them and discovers they are hers. Annie shoves the clothes into a bag and starts unpacking. \nINT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - PRE-DAWN \nThe Clock is ticking on the wall. The cafeteria is empty except for one tired Intern, drinking coffee on a break. \nRobert and Annie are having a cup of coffee. In the silence, they search for things to say. Until: \nROBERT I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... (Annie listens) I wanted to say something... (beat) But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter. \nANNIE We're very lucky. \nROBERT (nods) The funeral's on Friday. \nHe rises and crosses to the self-help coffee dispenser as he continues... \nROBERT Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over... \nANNIE Why don't you go lie down? \nGRACE I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough. \nROBERT You want to watch some television? \nGRACE (edgy) Maybe... look -- just... \nRobert and Annie wait. She doesn't continue. She rises, reaching for her crutches. Robert moves to help. \nGRACE I got it! I got it! \nShe exits into her room. Annie looks at him disapprovingly. \nINT. ANNIE AND ROBERT'S BATHROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie and Robert stand before their separate sinks, talking to each other through their separate mirrors, as they wash up for bed. \nANNIE You've got to stop doing that? \nROBERT Doing what? \nANNIE Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time. \nRobert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word. He exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed. For a beat, he stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly. \nROBERT You know, Annie, this didn't just happen to you. \nAnnie is applying moisturizer when she hears this. As it sinks in, she doesn't like it. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGrace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled, tense voices. Annie is angry at his complacency. Robert just wants what's best for Grace. She closes the door. Silence. She puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk towards her bureau without them. It is a struggle, but she does... almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time. The 8X10 of her and Pilgrim, falls face down. She props it up and looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on Judith. Suddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the floor... \nROBERT (O.S.) Honey, you all right? Did something fall? \nGRACE (angrily shouts) NO! \nEXT. GRACE'S PRIVATE SCHOOL - MORNING \nAnnie pulls up in a Range Rover and stops. Grace moves for the door. Annie asks respectfully; \nANNIE Do you want any help? \nGrace doesn't even bother to answer. She manages to get onto the pavements, then turns for her bag... \nAnnie notices other kids looking at Grace from behind, as they enter the school. \nANNIE Dad'll pick you up today, all right? \nGRACE Okay. \nGrace looks up to her mother. What is unspoken between them is the understanding that today will be difficult and there's nothing either one can do about it. \nANNIE You'll be fine. \nGrace nods and turns to the school. Annie watches her go. \nINT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - MORNING \nGrace makes her way through the hall. It is the first time she has had to maneuver through a crowd. Some of the younger children are especially unconscious. Grace sweats her way through, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity. \nAs Grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had that she could get through this day, begins to diminish. \nINT. ANNIE'S OFFICE - DAY \nAnnie moves about the office, hands in pocket, in front of her wall of windows. LUCY and her staff sitting around the office. Annie is speaking to a YOUNG WOMAN staff member; \nANNIE I don't care what he told you! The man's a liar! The man's an actor, for Christ's sake. They're all liars! They'll say anything to get a cover... \nThe Young Woman looks insulted. AN ASSISTANT comes in to give Annie a note; \nEXT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - DAY \nAnnie is crossing an empty school yard. Grace is sitting on the ground, her back against a wall, her \"legs\" in front of her. She has been crying. She looks up to her mother. \nGRACE It's too hard. \nAnnie kneels before her sympathetically brushing her hair away: \nANNIE Oh, honey... What happened? \nGRACE Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all. \nANNIE (softly) Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what -- \nGRACE (snaps) I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home! \nANNIE Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well... \nGRACE Is that your version of a pep talk? \nANNIE You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. \nGRACE (snotty) Fine! \nANNIE It's still early. What's your next class? \nWith secret delight, Grace viciously utters the word: \nGRACE Gym! \nINT. ANNIE AND ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie is at her desk studying Grace's book on Horse Whisperers. Robert is on his bed with briefs laid out before him. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nThe door is closed. A SONG blares on her stereo. Grace is in her bed watching a video of her and Pilgrim... riding at a horse show. There's a shot of Annie standing proudly, watching her ride. Another shot of her and Judith, both of them on their horses, waving to camera. \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nGrace enters. \nINT. TRUCK STOP DINER - DAY \nAnnie and Grace enter. They look around: \nFormica floors, truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed into booths or at the counter. There is not a single space available. \nAnnie and Grace stand near the entrance. Another Trucker enters and they step aside, huddled together in this foreign land. \nINT. MOTEL IN IOWA - NIGHT \nGrace and Annie enter the room to find A DOUBLE BED instead of two twins. Neither comments. \nAnnie exits O.S., carrying the bags inside, as she says: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nANNIE You should call your dad before it gets too late. \nGRACE I already did. (Annie's surprised) This morning. When you went running. \nANNIE Oh. You didn't tell me. \nGRACE I didn't know I had to. \nANNIE (stares angrily, speaks softly) You don't. \nSilence. Annie exits past her to the car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nGrace is asleep in her twin bed. Once again, Annie is wide awake. The clock reads: 4:55 AM. But Annie can not sleep. Camera moves away from Annie, past her side of the bed, to the other side of the room. \nWE SEE THE SHADOW OF A WOMAN coming towards the bed. She comes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed, which has now transformed into -- \nA BED FROM THE PAST, IN WHICH A TEN-YEAR-OLD ANNIE IS SLEEPING WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER GEORGE. \nWE ARE IN MEMORY. \nThe Woman gently shakes little Annie awaken. \nWOMAN Annie... Annie, sweetheart... wake up. \nThe little girl, with sleep in her eyes, turns and sees her. \nWOMAN Bad news I'm afraid. Your Daddy's gone. \nEND OF MEMORY. \nAnnie, in present time next to Grace, thinks of this as she stays awake. Putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown, she goes outside. \nEXT. IOWA MOTEL - NIGHT \nShe crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer. She looks in through the siding at Pilgrim, checking on him. She sees he is caught his halter on the side of the van. She crosses to the trailer door, hesitates, then opens it. Pilgrim looks at her. Gathering her courage, she climbs inside. He is still, looking at her. She carefully frees his halter. And suddenly he bares his teeth, biting at her. She stumbles back out of the trailer, slamming the door shut. She stands leaning against the trailer -- wondering if she's out of her mind for attempting this. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. IOWA MOTEL - LATER THAT SAME MORNING \nAnnie is returning from her jog, sweating. As she crosses to her motel room, she stops by the window, looking in to see: \nGrace, on the floor, straining to do her exercises. \nAnnie fills with compassion for her girl -- reminded of the struggle she faces everyday. \nEXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY \nIn the distance, the Suburban and horse trailer look like a dot on the horizon, moving across the Badlands. \nINT. THE SUBURBAN - ANOTHER TIME, DUSK \nGrace leans against the window in the back, in one of her darker moods. Annie switches radio stations, from Bible thumping to Farm reports. She shuts it off. Silence. \nShe sees a ROAD SIGH: \"LITTLE BIGHORN NATIONAL MONUMENT\". \nANNIE Grace, look! \nGrace reads the sign. \nANNIE Would you like to see that? \nGRACE I don't care. \nANNIE (overlapping) I don't care. \nAnnie's comic mimicking, throws Grace off center. \nAnnie turns off onto the exit. They drive by a massive casino -- it's neon sign flickering. They drive up a hill past a cafe, two Indians in high crowned Cowboy hats standing outside of the cafe. She drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the Monument... \nANNIE This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this. \nGRACE You were never thirteen, Mom. \nAnnie laughs, taking it as a joke. Grace almost smiles. \nBut, Annie drives up to sign only to find a CLOSED SIGN. The park was closed at six. Annie stops the car. She's hit a brick wall once more. Silence. Finally, Grace speaks with her usual sarcasm; \nGRACE Great idea. So now what? \nBeat. Annie's patience snaps; \nANNIE How long is this going to go on? \nGRACE What? \nANNIE You know what I mean? (turns to the back seat) Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on? \nIgnoring her, Grace edges to the passenger side and exits the car. Annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as she speaks: \nANNIE Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you? \nGRACE What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it! \nTom and Frank don't say anything. Just nod, knowingly. \nJOE He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on. \nFRANK That's what some folks say. \nJOE There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow. (to Tom) You hear 'bout that, Uncle T? \nTOM Yeah, I hear about that. \nJOE Well, what do you think about that stuff? \nTOM Well, Joe, I'll tell ya -- I don't know a whole lot about geese. Maybe it's okay for them to grow up thinking they're airplanes. But horses, as far as I can tell, can't fly. \nFrank laughs. Joe smirks as Tom messes his hat up. There's the sound of a car. They turn. \nThe Suburban is coming over the ridge, heading down the driveway in a cloud of dust. \nJOE We expecting company? \nFrank shakes his head. As the Suburban slows down, Tom recognizes the driver. \nTOM I don't believe it. \nFRANK You know her? \nAnnie, out of her element, hiding behind sunglasses, gets out as Tom approaches her by himself. Annie girds herself for the confrontation. \nANNIE Hello, Mr. Booker. Annie MacLean. From New York. We talked on the phone. \nShe extends her hand. TOM shakes it, nodding, staring at her curiously. \nANNIE It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs. \nTOM Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through! \nANNIE Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel... \nTOM Were you thinking of personally driving me back East? \nANNIE Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's... \nTOM You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that? \nANNIE (slightly taken aback) Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car. \nTOM All by yourself? \nShe nods. Tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and fortitude. \nCamera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house, through which DIANE -- Frank's fiery, loyal pioneer wife -- looks at the duo with suspicion. \nTOM I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to -- \nANNIE Look! Please! Don't do the \"shucks, ma'am\" thing again! (Tom, surprised, listens) I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the... (seeing no woods) -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal? \nTom tries to hide a smile of respect. Annie, thinking she may have him, starts backing away towards her car -- as one would a dangerous animal they think they might have tamed... \nANNIE We're at Peterson's. Whenever you're free. You don't even have to call. \nShe gets into the Suburban. Tom watches her drive off. \nEXT. ANNIE AND GRACE'S COTTAGE - DAY \nTom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks. He hears a TV on inside. And Grace's Voice: \nGRACE (O.S.) MOM! The door! \nHe hears Annie's muffled reply from O.S. He hears some banging as Grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door. She opens it only so far as to reveal her upper body: \nGRACE Yeah? \nTOM Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around? \nGrace hops to the side as Tom walks by her, into the room. Grace is closing the door as he turns to see, for the first time, that Grace is one leg. \nGRACE She'll be right out. She's on the phone. \nGrace hops back to the bed in front of the TV. Tom nods and puts his hat down -- noticing the prosthetic leaning against the window, near her bed. He hears Annie on the phone and looks to the other room, the door ajar -- seeing only her legs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks. Her foot taps impatiently. \nTOM First time in Montana? \nGrace, rudely nods, still looking at the TV. \nBeat. Tom doesn't like her manner, but can easily see through it. He sits. \nTOM She gonna be long? \nGRACE Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day. \nTOM What does she do? \nGRACE She's an editor. \nTOM Mmm. An editor. \nGRACE Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK? \nTom just sort of nods. A beat or two later, Annie enters. \nANNIE Sorry about that. Hi. Grace, this is Mr. Booker... Have you looked at Pilgrim? \nTom sees Grace turn away, just as Annie enters. He takes a moment. He could say no right there, but something stops him. \nTOM Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now. \nANNIE You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check. \nTOM Doesn't matter. \nANNIE Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim? \nGrace keeps looking at the TV. No reply. Tom is half way out the door when he says to Annie -- making sure Grace can hear -- \nANNIE ... the phone company's putting in extra lines. I'll call back with the numbers. Oh, and I want you to get in touch with this lady in town here -- they say she's sort of a physical therapist for the rodeo boys but keep the one at the hospital we already contacted on call... \nGrace sits alone in the living room. Watching TV, but anxious and disturbed about what she's committed herself to. \nINT. DOUBLE DIVIDE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nDiane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as she listens to a BOOK OF TAPE. Her hand on her forehead, her other hand writing. Tom enters to take his hat off the sideboard. He moves to the table and reaches over for a cookie from a plate of cookies. Without looking up, Diane slaps his hand. Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee... then swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie. Diane smiles. Tom exits. \nIt is only then that Diane looks up after him. \nINT. UPPER FLOOR OF RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT \nCamera follows Tom towards his bedroom --  passing the others. Perhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his underwear. We might see the Twins in their bunks. One of the Twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket. He casually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and continues to his room. \nINT. TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTom enters and closes the door. Turns on a stereo which plays a cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma. Books fills his room. He sits at his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork. Suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. A thought passes by. We don't know what. \nFADE OUT: \nEXT. THE RANCH, A CORRAL - DAYBREAK \nFirst light of day. Pilgrim stands stock still in the middle of the corral. Tom, motionless, is crouched on his haunches in the corral -- watching him. \nTOM'S POV: As Pilgrim moves, he can see that the horse is stove up. \nHe softly tosses a handful of dirt at Pilgrim's withered legs... Pilgrim, sensitive to the slightest provocation, bucks, wheeling away from him. Then stops. Tom sits on his haunches again... and watches him. \nFrank appears, exiting from the barn (perhaps). \nFRANK Tom? \nTOM Yeah. \nTom leaves Pilgrim, hooking up with Frank -- the two brothers go off, discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY \nAnnie and Grace arrive in the Suburban. They exit. As they head towards the ranch, they see in the distance: \nPilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen. Tom stands in the pen, holding a rope, looking at Pilgrim. \nEXT. THE ROUND PEN - DAY \nTom stands in the pen with Pilgrim. He looks to see Annie and Grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement. He turns his focus back to Pilgrim. \nAnnie and Grace appear. Grace takes a position (that is to become her regular spot) a distance away from the pen. Annie moves in closer, beside SMOKEY (a ranch hand) with one leg up on the pen fence. \nSMOKEY Howdy... (sees Grace) Howdy. \nHe and Annie watch as Tom stands before Pilgrim -- turning sideways... then standing... \nANNIE What's he doing? \nSMOKEY Trying to get his eye. \nANNIE How's it going? \nSmokey doesn't respond -- how it's going is exactly how it looks. Tom takes a few steps, stops and stands still again. We sense the process is long and requires great patience. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ROUND PEN - DAY \nTwo hours later. Grace is in the same spot. Smokey is gone, doing his work. Annie has taken a different position, looking over SEVERAL PAGES OF FAXES on her lap. \nTom is still standing in the pen trying to get Pilgrim's eyes. \nJoe has joined the proceedings, sitting on the pen rail. \nTom deftly throws a hoolihan, gently lassoing Pilgrim around the neck. And Pilgrim, at the touch of the rope, crazed, resists, pulling back, striking at the rope... The rope cutting into Tom's hands. Tom gives him some slack, giving his head, letting him relax... then gently heads him by the rope, walking him around the pen, getting his feet to moving. \nGrace's eyes never leave Tom. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nTom, off in the distance -- against a sky that seems to be touching the land -- is riding along a creek. Closer up, we see he's rustling the bushes with a stick. Some stray cows run out of the bushes. Tom races after them. His horse shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside. \nAt the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly before him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays. Tom whistles. Frank waves back. In the near distance, a pickup truck is parked on the range. \nJoe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back of the truck. Cattle come from across the range for the food. What begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then hundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them. \nTom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. Far off in the distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road to the ranch. He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out of the car with Grace. Annie instinctively turns and looks across the land. Even though there is such a distance, there's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other. \nTom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the range -- the Twins in the back, the cattle following. Tom sits on his horse atop the hill. \nEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - ANOTHER DAY \nPilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd sycopation, swimming. We discover he is in a pond, tethered to a pole... Except for the sound of his legs in the water, everything is quiet and focused on Pilgrim. \nSMOKEY, holds the pole, walking on the outside of the pond, leading Pilgrim back and forth as he swims. Tom, crouched by the pond, silently concentrating on Pilgrim... \nGrace watches, off by herself... Annie stands beside Joe. She can't help but be intrigued by the sight. She asks Joe; \nANNIE I though horses were afraid of water? \nJoe doesn't answer her. Grace likes that. Annie, frustrated, feels she has the right to simple shout out to Tom. \nANNIE Is that to get his strength back? \nTom pays her no mind -- concentrating on Pilgrim. \nSuddenly, Annie's CELL PHONE rings, jarring the proceedings. Tom turns to Annie. She hides her embarrassment by answering it, walking away. Tom gives her a look. Grace is loving this. Tom turns back to Pilgrim. After a few moments -- \nTom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. He starts to lead Pilgrim out of the water. Pilgrim, fearful, fights him. He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out of the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he is concerned too, though he stands quietly. \nAnnie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes her call to return to the pond. \nTom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab Pilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope again. Pilgrim rears again. Tom stumbles backwards from his hooves. Annie gasps. Grace turns to walk away from the pond. She can't watch -- it brings back too much. But as she does, she is stopped by the sight of -- \nDIANE Sure. (seeing Grace in car) Does your daughter want to come inside? \nANNIE Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture? \nDIANE Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah. \nShe's gone. Annie grimaces, then crosses the hillside to where Tom is squatting down. She appears to his side and, without speaking, tries to indicates she has his coffee by leaning it toward him. Tom sees her and accepts it with a grateful nod. Annie waits. Nothing happens. Feeling foolish, she begins to walk back. \nAt some point, she turns to see Pilgrim moving across the pasture toward Tom. He stops in front of him, just a few feet away. Tom says something to him. Annie is intrigued -- and she knows enough to stay quiet now. She watches Pilgrim walk over to him. She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrim's scarred head. In spite of herself, Annie is somewhat moved by this act. \nOnly we see Grace, peering out from the car, seeing this act of communion as well. Only we see her reaction to it. \nAs Tom turns and walks back to the ranch, Pilgrim follows him. As he passes Annie, all he says is... \nTOM From now on, leave your phone somewhere else... \nAs he moves past her, Annie responds; \nANNIE But I have business calls I have to -- \nTom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests, without turning back; \nTOM Then drop off Grace in the morning, go on back and do your business. Come pick her up around dinner. \nStanding there, Annie has the impulse to respond to this suggestion, but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldn't make much sense since Tom is already out of ear shot. \nDiane appears from the house and calls out: \nDIANE Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner? \nANNIE Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose. \nDIANE No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place. \nAnnie looks up to the alien sky and realizes she's right. She looks to Grace, who doesn't seem to oppose the idea. \nINT. RANCH HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nEveryone sits around the kitchen table. Joe, still wearing his hat, eyes Annie and Grace with acute curiosity. \nDIANE Joe, take off the hat -- I'm not going to say it again. \nJoe obeys. Diane puts the last of the serving plates on the table -- pork chops, potatoes, gravy, peas, bread... And a big bowl of mixed salad. The boy can't help eyeing how the \"vegetarians\" will act. \nAnnie and Grace eye the food. Annie reaches out for a serving ladle, picking up Grace's plate to serve her as Grace reaches for a piece of bread, when: \nFRANK Dear Lord, we are humbly thankful for... \nAnnie and Grace freeze as Frank continues his prayer -- they notice everyone's head bowed slightly. \nFRANK (continues) these gifts. For the blessings on our home, our family and our guests. Bless those that aren't as fortunate. Bless all God's creatures. \nEVERYONE Amen. \nEveryone begins eating. Annie and Grace breath a sigh of relief. Silence. Utensils hitting plates, the only sound. \nFRANK Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle. \nTOM We should be fine, then. \nBeat. Annie and Grace listen... \nJOE Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords. \nFRANK Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink. \nTOM They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother. \nFRANK Our daddy raised Pure Herefords. \nSilence... Eating... Annie tries her hand at conversation: \nANNIE You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... (silence) I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to... (uncomfortable) do their... work. \nFRANK Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow. (to Grace) Would you mind passing that salad young lady? \nDIANE How's Peterson's holding up for you? \nANNIE (lying) It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel. \nFRANK (innocently) You know, Tom, while you're working on that horse of theirs, Annie and Grace should move into the old Creek house. \nDiane and Tom react accordingly; Diane hiding her annoyance, Tom hiding his surprise and pleasure. \nFRANK Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well... \nANNIE Oh, I don't know... \nFRANK Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears. \nDIANE (overlapping) They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy. \nFRANK It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom? \nTOM I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie. \nANNIE Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim? \nTOM That's up to Pilgrim. \nEveryone waits on Annie's answer as she considers this. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nGrace is on the phone with Robert. Annie is packing things up. Grace is telling him about the day; \nGRACE (listens) I know. Me, too. Why don't you come one weekend? \nAnnie reacts to this. \nGRACE We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. (to Annie) Dad wants to talk to you. \nANNIE (takes the phone) Hi. \nANNIE (to Grace) You got everything you need? \nGRACE If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy. \nTom approaches as he overhears Grace respond; \nANNIE (trying to cheer her) Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight? \nGRACE Why? There's no food in the house? \nANNIE No. I just thought... forget it. \nHe's getting a clearer view of their relationship. \nTOM You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome. \nANNIE (laughs) Branding? (sarcastic) I haven't branded in years. \nTom chuckles. \nGRACE I'll come. \nANNIE Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way. \nTOM As long as you don't get in the way of the branding iron, it doesn't matter too much. \nAnnie smiles. She turns to Grace, questioningly. Grace says matter-of-factly, to prove her point. \nGRACE I watched Margo Neuberger get a tattoo. \nTom squints. Annie shrugs and nods. \nANNIE Okay. \nAs Grace and Annie walk to the car, Tom says: \nTOM Hey, Grace -- maybe we can get your mom to put me and you branding on the cover of her magazine. Start a whole new fashion craze. \nThey continue walking as Grace smiles, enjoying being singled out for his joke. Annie responds, almost flirtatiously. \nANNIE Try not to fall off your high horse, Mr. Booker. \nTom tips his hat and rides away... Annie smiles and nods... Grace doesn't like their sudden familiarity. Or her mother's coy manner. As they enter the Suburban, Grace asks point blank; \nGRACE Did you call Dad today? \nAnnie is caught off guard. \nTom, riding in the arena, catches himself looking after them... then goes riding after Pilgrim. \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nThe air smells of scorched flesh. There is nothing but NOISE. Calves, separated from their mothers, \"cry.\" They are moved out through a series of connected pens into a narrow chute, and then one by one into a holding pen. They're clamped and lowered sideways onto a table and given a shot, a yellow insect tag in one ear, branded, then sent back to their mother's. The bulls, in a pen by themselves, stand haughty, paying no attention. Frank helps \"doctor\" the calves. Joe brands. \nAnnie and Grace are standing by the railing, watching with a mixture of fascination and disgust. \nTom moves in the feeder pen, waist deep in calves, moving them through the chute. He looks to Annie. \nTOM Hey, over there, you want to make yourself useful? \nIt isn't a question. \nTOM Hank, I got you a volunteer! \nAnnie and Grace realize they have no choice. \n-- WHAT FOLLOWS IS A SEQUENCE OF SCENES SHOWING ANNIE AND GRACE PARTICIPATING IN THE BRANDING. AND HOW THEY GRADUALLY COME TO LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE EXPERIENCE. \nSEQUENCES WILL INCLUDE: \n-- HANK, A RANCH HEAD, HELPING ANNIE INTO THE CHUTE... ANNIE GETTING KICKED BY A CALF. \n-- GRACE BEING SHOWN HOW TO HOLD THE BRANDING IRON. \n-- HANK TEACHING ANNIE HOW TO SAY \"HYAH!!\"... \n-- TOM IN THE HOLDING PEN WITH HIS ARMS AROUND GRACE, SHOWING HER HOW TO APPLY THE BRAND... GRACE, A LITTLE FRIGHTENED OF THE BRAND, IS IN HEAVEN IN TOM'S ARMS... \n-- ANNIE IS STILL TRYING TO SAY \"HYAH\"!! WITH THE PROPER FORCE. SHE CLAPS HER HANDS, PUSHING THE CALVES ALONG, KNEE DEEP IN COW SHIT. \n-- GRACE CLOSES HER EYES AND THE IRON TOUCHES THE CALF'S HIDE. \nTOM That's good... firm but gentle... (Grace opens her eyes) It hurts but he'll get over it. \nGrace smiles proudly. \nTOM You handled that pretty well. Think it's time you earn your keep around here. So, when we're not working and when you don't have your therapy, I'd like you to help out with the horses... Rubbing them, cleaning up the stalls... You think you can handle that? \nGrace knows him well enough to know; \nGRACE That's not a question, is it? \nTOM You're catching on. \nGrace smiles. \n-- Annie turns and, not looking where she's doing, trips over a calf, falling down. And calves, coming down the chute, start to run towards her. Suddenly, Tom grabs her by the leg and pulls her to safety. He helps her up and dusts her off. \nTOM (not wanting to smile, but...) You okay? \nANNIE It is cocktail hour yet? \nTom laughs. She takes a big breath. \nEXT. THE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe ranch is colored in amber light. \nNear the house, two long tables pushed together to make one long one... A gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth. Everyone is seated for a meal. We hear laughter and conversation... We parachute into the middle of the moments; \n-- Hank helping with his wife get to their three children to sit still for dinner... \n-- Diane organizing the women and their various plates of side dishes... \nANNIE She calls him Tommy... \nDIANE Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same. \nShe studies the old faces of Tom's Parents -- although 20th Century people, there is still a pioneering strength in their visage... a stoicism and power. \nDIANE (putting away forks) Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise. \nANNIE I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one? \nDiane is sorting silverware throughout the following: \nDIANE No. See, Frank and Tom were raised near the Clark's Fork River, right between the Pryor and Beartooth Mountains. Beautiful piece of land. But they had this uncle Ned -- useless man, never interested in ranching. And when the grandparents died, he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it. Three years of legation broke their father. Frank took it all in stride, but Tom... Tom loved that land. I don't think he ever got over it -- His home being sold out from under him. Seeing his father like that. Once he and Frank got their folks set up in a new place, Tom left... went off. We didn't see him for years... \nAnnie is intrigued by what she's learning about Tom. Something outside the window catches her eyes. She watches: \nPOV; Tom and Frank, on either side to Ellen, are escorting her to a car that will drive her home. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnnie wanders out, passing Grace and Joe on her way out. The two are sitting in a glider. As Annie exits O.C., we hear them; \nGRACE Why do you always wear that hat? \nJOE Because it fits my head. You want to try it on? \nGrace doesn't know if she should. \nAnnie continues towards Tom who's sitting in a rocker playing with the twins. \nTWINS Show us again! Come on! One more time! It's my turn now! \nTOM All right, al right. Hold out your finger. \nAnnie takes a seat nearby and watches as Tom holds out the first finger of his right hand. The Twins holds out his. Tom splits his focus between Annie and the Twins as he takes a small piece of rope out of his back pocket. He ties the ends together making a loop. He puts the loop over the Twin's finger. And holding the other end of the loop taut with his left hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with the middle finger of his right hand. Then he rolls his hand over so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that his finger is tip to tip with the Twin's. The loop seemingly knotted around their touching fingertips, and can only be removed if their touch is broken. \nTOM The loop's knotted, right. (Twins nod) Looks like the only way to take it off, is if we break our touch... (they nod) Watch now... \nAnnie and the Twins look down at the touching fingers as Tom gently pulls the rope away, revealing they are still knotted, and without even breaking their touch... \nTWINS Again! Again. One more time! \nTOM Oh, no. No, no. I only fall for that once. Go inside now before your mother starts hunting you down. Go on. \nThe Twins exit. Annie and Tom make eye contact. \nTOM (smiles, relaxes back) So how was your first and last day of branding? \nANNIE Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron. \nTom looks at her with a sly expression, and notices she's shivering. \nTOM You got too much sun today... Here... \nHe takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders. \nANNIE Thank you. \nHe sits back down. Annie crosses her arms over her chest, looks around, unconsciously swinging her foot. Tom watches her leg. Annie notices him watching; \nANNIE What? \nTOM You ever just stand still for a minute? \nANNIE You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. (smiles wryly) You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that? \nTom shrugs. Annie waits a beat, then: \nANNIE That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me. \nTOM Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation? \nANNIE It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to. \nTOM Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little. \nANNIE (understanding) Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world? \nTOM What's that to miss? \nANNIE Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain. \nTOM (thinks, teasing a bit) Does Chicago count? \nANNIE (surprised) You lived in Chicago? \nTOM When I was first married. \nANNIE (stunned) You were married to a woman in Chicago? \nTom likes disturbing her picture of him as the predictable cowboy. He smiles; \nTOM I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time. (Annie is floored) You seem surprised? \nANNIE (not wanting to insult) Well, I, uh... you didn't... \nTOM Just who's been laughing at who here? \nTom says this with a wry smile. Annie returns with a smile -- as an understanding is reached between them: they've both stereotyped the other. They are both pleased -- and attracted -- by what they don't know. \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nGrace is fast asleep, exhausted. She does not stir when the phone rings. \nAnnie picks up from her own bed, awakened, still dressed in her branding clothes, having just passed out on the bed. \nANNIE Hello? \nINT. CENTRAL PARK WENT APARTMENT - NIGHT \nINTERCUT: Robert, alone, in the vast apartment. \nROBERT I thought you guys were going to call me. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALL (V.O.) If nothing goes wrong. If the faxes don't go down. If the phone lines are opened. I can't have this magazine hitting the streets by the skin of its ass, Annie. \nDuring David's lines, Diane has entered, carrying fresh towels -- she crosses into the bathroom. \nANNIE Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement. \nWithout Annie's awareness, Diane re-enters and takes her time leaving, so she can take in all of Annie's things; her business \"office,\" books, etc... \nANNIE What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me? \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana? \nDiane can't help but notice a slight vulnerability in Annie. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) Look, this is what we're going to do. Finish up this issue. I'll set up a conference call in a few weeks. Just you, me and your lawyer and we'll just work this out so that everyone will be taken care of. Fair enough? \nAnnie is now aware of Diane's presence and chooses to play it cool. It's not the moment. \nANNIE Uh, yes... Sure, David. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.) All right. Speak to you then. \nHe hangs up. Annie forces a smile to Diane. \nANNIE Thank you. You're all doing too much. \nDIANE Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway. \nAnnie doesn't know whether or not to accept. \nANNIE Oh... Well... thank you very much. I don't -- \nBefore she finishes her line, the Phone Rings again. \nANNIE Sorry. (to phone) Hello? Hi, yeah, I just spoke to him. Oh, you know David, Mr. Strong Arm... \nDiane feels out of place and exits. Annie doesn't notice until she hears the door close. She pushes back her hair and takes a deep breath. She looks out through the side window and sees: \nGrace and Joe doing chores. Grace looks involved and not at all self-conscious. A moment of gratitude and calm for Annie. \nEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nPilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena. He runs to the far end and abruptly stops. Tom is holding the orange flagstick, and coiled rope, coming through a gate into the arena, crossing to the middle of the ring. Something in his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over. \nPilgrim and Tom stand there, motionless, eyeing each other. Pilgrim snorts and takes a few, small steps backward. Tom takes a beat, then starts slowly towards Pilgrim, lifting the flag and \"cracking\" it. At the sound, Pilgrim whirls away from him and runs, around the arena. He starts to slow, looking at Tom. Again, Tom cracks the flag and Pilgrim runs, round and round the arena... like a ringmaster, Tom keeps Pilgrim moving, cracking the flag. \nSomething about Tom's demeanor tells us it isn't going well. \nEXT. THE RANCH - DAY \nTom, carrying a saddle, comes around the side of the barn. Through the slats, he sees Grace working in the barn, watering a horse. She has stopped and is looking through the cracks of Pilgrim's stall at him. She turns and sees Tom through the slats. She goes back to work as Tom comes to the barn door. \nTOM Come and take a ride with me. \nEXT. THE RANCH - DAY \nThey walk towards his pick-up truck. \nTOM Can you drive? \nGRACE Drive? I'm not old enough yet. \nTOM It's never too soon to start. \nHe enters the passenger side. \nGRACE I can't... \nTOM I don't have all day. \nShe hesitates and gets into the truck. \nINT. PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY \nGrace doesn't know what to do. \nTOM Put the key in and turn it. (Grace obeys) The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake. \nGRACE I don't know if I can with my leg. \nTOM Well, there's only one way to find out. (puts truck in gear) Give it a little gas. \nShe awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal. Too much. It lurches forward. She takes her foot off. \nTOM Well, we know you can. Now you just got to feel how much. Try it again. \nShe does. They slowly, very slowly, move along the dirt road. \nTOM Nice, real nice. There's a little road down at the end here, turn onto it. \nGrace badly oversteers, but makes the turn. She drives along the road, across a pasture, heading toward distant mountains. \nTOM Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road. \nGRACE (afraid) I don't know if I can. \nTOM Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself. \nFolding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, Tom relaxes back. Grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and her eyes straight ahead... \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nThe truck is parked at the foot of a mountain. Grace, very pleased with herself, sits beside Tom on the cab's roof, looking around them at the great Montana. After a beat; \nTOM Where did you get Pilgrim from? \nGRACE We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him. \nTOM That must have been pretty special. \nGrace nods. It is a pleasant memory. He motions for her to be quiet. An old ELK with a prodigious rack of antlers, has come down out of the mountains. Seeing them, he stops in his tracks, dead still. They watch each other. Then the elk turns and runs back up into the mountains. Tom smiles at Grace who smiles back -- partly because of the elk, partly because she's alone with Tom. \nANNIE How long did you live here with your wife? \nTOM Five years. My son was born here. \nANNIE (opens her eyes) Son? \nTOM Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom. \nANNIE How did you meet her? \nTOM College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was... \nTom can't find a beautiful enough word. But Annie understands. \nTOM She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. \nAnnie sees Tom as if with new eyes -- his love for this woman he lost. \nANNIE Why didn't it work out? \nTOM She was never really happy here. She did the best she could. \nAnnie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship -- an understanding they both have of being torn between two worlds... a desire for home... \nTOM Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place. \nANNIE It is. It's lovely. \nTOM Ever think of moving there full time? \nANNIE We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be. \nThere is an awkward silent beat for a moment. Annie is momentarily self-conscious. Tom helps by speaking of himself; \nTOM I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em... \nANNIE That's very important to you, isn't it? Home. \nTOM Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here. \nANNIE How did you find out all that? \nTom looks right into her eyes and confesses without a shred of self-consciousness. \nTOM I got lost. \nThey smiles. \nEXT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe world is in silhouette. Off in the distance, we see Tom standing by his horse, offering his hand to Annie, helping her off. There's an awkward moment, neither of them wanting the day, or the moment, to end. \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nGrace is standing by the window, looking out at them. Their movements indicate an intimacy that upsets her. \nEXT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nAfter a beat; \nTom gets back on his colt. He takes Rimrock's reins and leads him off. Annie stops for a moment, watching him ride away... \nShe watches her mother walk towards the house; \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - MOMENT'S LATER \nGrace watches her mother stand there a moment, then turn and walk towards the house. Grace moves away from the window, her emotions churning -- jealousy, anger -- and enters her bedroom, shutting the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE PASTURE - EARLY MORNING \nJoe, hat tipped low, is riding his horse, leading some young horses, exercising them in the morning pasture. He sees Grace, walking with her cane, coming across the pasture. \nJOE (shy) Hi... \nShe stops. After a beat; \nGRACE Would you let me ride your horse? \nJOE (hesitates) Have you talked to Tom about it? \nGRACE Of course I have. \nJOE (beat, then:) I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right? \nShe nods. He hesitates. \nGRACE Are you going to give me a hand or aren't you? \nHe gets off his horse and holds it. She puts down her cane, then puts her hand on the saddle horn. She puts her prosthetic leg into a stirrup. Frightened, she starts to shake; \nJOE You sure? \nAngry, determined, Grace tries to swing her leg onto the horse. She can't do it. Tears of frustration on her face. She tries again. She manages to pull herself halfway on, her prosthetic leg buckles and she falls. Frightened, Joe runs to her. \nJOE You okay? \nShe gasps to catch her breath. He reaches to help her up. She pulls her hand away. Embarrassed, she \"runs\" off. Joe remains still. He hears a little VOICES. He turns and sees the TWINS having been watching the whole thing from a small hill. As they run off, he yells, threateningly. \nJOE You better not say anything!!! \nEXT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe follow Joe running towards the creek house, fastening a good shirt. He's dressed and cleaned for dinner. He's late. \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnnie is in the midst of making a spaghetti dinner. She's a little frazzled but she's on top of it. Grace enters wearing a lovely dress -- it is the first time we have seen her in a dress. Annie hears her enter before she sees her, asking; \nANNIE Honey, would you see if anybody wants -- \nAnnie notices Grace standing there, in her dress. She stops. \nGRACE It's from a jar. \nThere's an odd silence as a deflated Annie serves Frank. \nFRANK Thank you. \nFinally, Diane saves it. \nDIANE Well, I tried jar sauce once -- wasn't this good. Ya gotta know which brand to buy. I'd like to get the name of this one. \nAnnie is grateful. Grace feels foolish. \nTWIN (SCOTT) Can we see the dead body on the screen? \nDIANE What? \nGRACE It's just my computer. \nDIANE Oh, I don't -- \nANNIE It's okay. Grace, show them. I'm going to put the coffee on. I made an apple tart for dessert. \nThe Twins excitedly move to the computer. Joe waits for Grace. \nDIANE I'll help you with the coffee. \nANNIE Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to. \nDIANE (jovial) No reason you should, no reason you should. \nThey exit into the kitchen. Frank continues eating. \nTom looks around -- Grace showing the boys the computer. Annie and Diane in the kitchen. For a second, we see Tom realize an image of the life he once thought he could. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAs Diane and Annie prepare coffee and dessert; \nDIANE I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt? \nANNIE I was there for that shot, actually. \nDIANE What was it like? \nANNIE Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was... \nShe laughs as she directs this last line to Diane, who just smiles. And Annie realizes that's not what she meant at all. This woman is starving for glimpses into this other life. \nANNIE But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time. (Diane listens) I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe. \nDIANE I'd love to go there one time... \nANNIE You and Frank ever take a vacation? \nDIANE Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there. \nAnnie can sense the disappointment in her voice, and at the same time, the comfortable resignation. \nSuddenly, from inside, they hear LOUD OVERLAPPING VOICES as the children fight. \nTWIN (SCOTT) IT WAS MY TURN! \nJOE YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT. \nTWIN (SCOTT) WAS SO! \nLIVING ROOM: \nDiane and Annie enter to find Joe and Scott fighting, as Tom tries to break them up... \nTOM Boys! Settle down! \nTWIN (SCOTT) You never let me have a turn! \nJOE Don't be such a baby! \nTWIN (SCOTT) You just showing off for her! \nJOE You shut up, stupid! \nTWIN (SCOTT) You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!! \nEveryone goes quiet, except for the computer screen. \nJOE You little shit! \nDIANE JOE! \nTWIN (SCOTT) I saw 'em. In the pasture. Her trying to get on Gonzo! I saw 'em. \nANNIE What does he mean? \nGRACE Nothing. \nANNIE Did you go riding? \nJOE Little shit! \nJoe lunges for Scott and the two start rolling in a fight. Frank and Tom work to pull them apart as Diane yells. \nDIANE Annie, I'm so sorry, but they're just tired. We'll have dessert another time. Frank, get them out of here. (to other Twin) Come on. Say good night and thank you... \nVoices everywhere. Yelling. \"Thank you's!!\" During which, Grace quickly turns and exits. Annie eyes follow her out of the room, but with her guests and the chaos, she doesn't know whether or not to leave. \nFRANK Dinner was delicious. Thank you. (to Twins) Say thank you!! \nDiane and Frank usher the kids out. Tom holds onto Joe until they're gone, then lets him go. \nJOE Sorry, ma'am, I thank you for dinner. It was very good. \nANNIE Did Grace try to ride, Joe? \nJOE (hesitates) I expect you should talk to Grace about that, ma'am. And if I did anything wrong, then I am sorry. \nTom sits alone, writing at his desk. His music is playing. He stops to look out the window overlooking the Creek House. \nAnnie and Grace fell asleep with the lights still on in the living room. \nTom is thinking of Grace and Annie -- wondering what happened after he left... conflicted by what he feels for Annie... And remembering why they're here in the first place... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NEXT MORNING \nThe phone rings, awakening Annie first, then Grace. \nANNIE Hello? \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Hello, this is ATT Conference Service. Is this Annie MacLean? \nANNIE Yes. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) I have a conference call scheduled for you with Mr. Gottschalk and Mr. Farlow. \nANNIE (remembering) Oh. Oh, yes. One moment, please. \nGRACE Who is it? \nANNIE Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me? \nGRACE Sure. \nAnnie moves to the other room, sits down at her office space, takes a breath, then picks up, yelling to Grace; \nANNIE Okay, Grace... (click) Operator?... I'm ready. \nEXT. RIDING ARENA - LATER THAT MORNING \nAnnie and Grace are standing by the arena fence. Frank, Joe and the Twins are sitting on the fence rail. Joe is holding a saddle and a bridle, standing in some shadows in an empty arena. Pilgrim comes running into the ring. Out of habit, he starts circling the ring. He sees Tom holding a saddle. Pilgrim walks towards him. Curious, he stops, looking at him. Tom puts the saddle down, sitting crossways on it. Pilgrim walks towards him again. He stops, looking at Tom again. Tom just sits there, playing with the bridle. Pilgrim walks around him. Tom doesn't show him any interest. Pilgrim comes closer. He looks at the saddle. He runs off. He stops, looking back. Tom just sits. Pilgrim walks back over. Tom stands and shows him the bridle. Pilgrim comes closer, sniffing it. He rubs his nose against the leather. Tom pats his head. Then, in one quick, but deft motion, he puts the bridle on him. Pilgrim tosses his head, but it doesn't seem to bother him. Grace and Annie watch intently. Tom takes the reins, walking Pilgrim around the ring. He walks him to the saddle. Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof. He turns and runs off. Tom lets him go. Pilgrim runs around the ring, slows down, looks over at Tom. Tom picks up the saddle. Pilgrim, cautiously, comes back over. Tom, with the saddle, walks away from him. Pilgrim, again curious, follows him. He nudges Tom. Tom stops. Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the saddle. Tom rubs his back. And gently, like laying down a sheet, puts the saddle on his back. Pilgrim shuffles slightly at the touch. Tom quickly cinches it. Taking up the reins, he walks Pilgrim around the ring again. He starts to jog. Pilgrim jogs with him. And in the middle of the jog, Tom grabs onto the saddle horn, and without breaking his stride, pulls himself back up onto his back. He lays across the saddle, letting Pilgrim feel his weight. He sits up, and without letting him break his stride, he urges Pilgrim with his thighs, keeping him in the jog, riding around the ring. \nGrace and Annie cheer. Tom tips his hat to them... \nINT. THE BARN - DAY \nGrace is cleaning stalls, etc... She exits one of the stalls with a pail and stops -- looking down the barn to where she knows Pilgrim is. She places the pail down and gathers her courage. She walks to Pilgrim's stall. She stands motionless for some moments before she opens the doors and enters... \nPilgrim steps back a bit. He looks at her. He pins his ears back. Stomps his feet. Grace is about to turn and leave, but she stops herself and remains still. \nSlowly, she reaches out to touch Pilgrim's head... and he lets her. We see in Grace a maturity of character, a willingness to face what she must face... the beginning of a compassion, not only for Pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as well. \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - NIGHT \nA full moon lights the ranch. Tom pulls up to the ranch house in his truck, parks and gets out. As he walks towards the house, he hears: \nGrace exits the Creek House and coming towards him, a coat over her nightgown. Tom waits until she reaches him. \nGRACE I was waiting for you to come back. \nTom instinctively knows what she wants. \nTOM You hungry? \nINT. RANCH HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGrace sits at the table. Tom is cooking at the stove. It feels as if they are the only two people on earth. Grace gets up her nerve... and begins: \nGRACE Judith was telling me about this boy she really liked. She never even had a chance to tell me his name... \nShe starts to quietly cry, but it doesn't stop her. \nGRACE We were going to go around by the railroad bridge... \nAnd we see the accident all over again... But this time, a movie -- as clear as reality -- but in deathly silence. Just the sound of Grace's voice, and her heartbeat... \nEXT. THE WOODS, CONNECTICUT - EARLY MORNING \nThe horses are going up the icy path... \nGRACE (V.O.) We were laughing about something, I don't remember what. Her horse fell... \nJudith's horse suddenly stumbles on the ice, going down, throwing Judith, her foot helplessly caught in the stirrup. Her horse sliding back down the hill. \nGrace tries to move Pilgrim to avoid the errant horse, but it's too late, the horse plows into them, the horses sliding back down the hillside onto the empty COUNTRY ROAD... \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD, CT. - EARLY MORNING \nPilgrim is first to find his legs. Judith's horse, its leg broken at the ankle, walks in a confused state. Judith's foot is helplessly caught in the stirrup... \nGRACE (V.O.) ... Judith's foot was caught in the stirrup... she couldn't get up, she was so scared... (cries) I saw this truck, coming around the turn... \nShe sees the glint of the steel. The Truck suddenly appears from around the bend. \nGRACE (V.O.) ...He was honking, trying to get us to move... I tried to grab the reins to get Judith's horse out of the way... \nGrace grabs the reins of Judith's horse. The horses are spooking... \nGRACE (V.O.) ...And the truck started skidding... \nThe truck skidded on the icy road, going out of control, jack- knifing, heading right for them... \nGRACE (V.O.) ...It was coming right at us... There wasn't any time to do anything... It ran right into Judith's horse... \nThe truck bed plows into Judith's horse... \nGRACE (V.O.) ...Judith just disappeared... And it came right at Pilgrim and me... \nWe see this... \nGRACE (V.O.) ...And Pilgrim reared up at the truck and I fell off... \nGrace falls onto the road, the truck running over her. \nINT. RANCH HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nGrace sobs uncontrollably now. \nGRACE Judith... Oh God, Judith. I'm sorry... \nANNIE Sounds like something Tom would say. \nDIANE Yes, it does. \nAnnie and Diane resume washing the dishes in silence. Annie deep in thought. Until Diane stops. After a beat, Annie notices. \nANNIE What? \nDIANE Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time. \nANNIE I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want. \nDIANE He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land. \nDiane's words ring in Annie's head. \nEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DEAD OF NIGHT \nDead in stillness. The cattle dark and motionless. Everyone asleep in bedrolls around the pasture. \nAnnie awakens, looks up at the moon, watching it go in and out of the clouds. She looks over to sleeping Grace... Then looks to where Tom is -- and sees his sleeping bag is empty. Quietly, she rises and looks for him. \nShe starts across the grass and sees him crossing on his haunches, wearing a slicker, sitting in the grass by the stream, drinking some water. She watches him. \nTom senses something and turns. For a moment, they just look at each other -- half disbelieving the inevitable is so close at hand. Annie approaches as Tom rises. \nThey meet. They kiss. Tentative at first, but more, just to make that very, precious first moment of discovery last as long as it can. The kiss grows more passionate. They begin to lose themselves in each other. \nUntil, suddenly, aware of their surroundings, they part. No words. Their expressions to each other tell all. Annie separates herself and goes back to her bedroll... Tom stands in the grass, by the stream... the moving water, the night's only sound. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nThe cattle drive returns. Tom, Annie, Grace, et al... are on their horses, heading back towards the ranch when Grace sees in the distance; \nGRACE Dad? \nAnnie looks up and sees: \nPOV -- ROBERT has come to the ranch. He is waiting for them with his luggage beside a rental car... standing out like an Like The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit in the middle of Wyeth's \"Christina's World.\" \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nEveryone is being introduced to Robert, as Grace hugs him from the side, never letting go of him. Frank, Diane -- who introduce their kids, then Tom and Robert shake hands... \nANNIE This is Mr. Booker, Robert. \nTOM (extends hand) Tom. \nROBERT Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere. \nTOM Oh yeah... \nLaugh. Awkward silence... \nROBERT Well I uh... I can already see a change. (hugging Grace) And I'm very grateful to you. \nRobert is so sincere -- in that openly, modern, \"express your feelings\" kind of way. Tom just nods. \nGRACE Did you notice -- no cane? \nROBERT I know. Amazing. \nGRACE Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom? \nTOM Oh, we're gonna show your dad plenty. Why don't you all get settled in and we'll do the tour. Excuse me. \nAs Tom walks away, a nervous Robert feels compelled to say: \nROBERT See you later! \nTom just nods and keeps walking. Annie and Robert face each other for a beat. \nANNIE Let's bring your bags inside. \nGRACE Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves... \nThe MacLean walk to the Creek House. \nEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY \nIn the distance, we see the pick-up truck parked out in the pasture. Tom is standing with Robert -- in jeans, now -- and Grace, telling Robert about the ranch. Robert has his arms around Grace, asking questions, interested in everything... Grace is loving being with her two favorite men... \nEXT. RANCH - DAY \nGrace waits in the truck as Tom leads Robert through the cows and cowshit, climbs up and hops over a wood fence. Robert follows suit -- not as gracefully -- and gets a splinter... \nINT. RANCH KITCHEN - DAY \nDiane is busy in the kitchen when Annie enters. \nANNIE Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping. \nDIANE Well, I am going to go after lunch. \nANNIE No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list. \nAnnie is determined. She needs to be by herself for a bit. \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RANCH - DAY \nTom continues his tour as the dogs run about them. Tom pays the dogs no attention, except to bark an order. Robert, however, engages with them -- picking up a stick and throws it. A dog returns and gives it back. Robert kneels and begins rubbing the dog's fur, talking to it, looking like an anachronism in his baggy jeans with designer cowboy belt and spanking new designer cowboy boots. \nTom waits patiently for Robert, who... and carries on with the dog a bit too long. When Robert gets up, he habitually brushes the dirt off his jeans, maybe even his boots, and makes sure his outfit is hanging properly. \nINT. BARN - DAY \nGrace is in the stall with Pilgrim. Once again, close enough to touch him, which he allows. \nOutside the stall, stand Robert and Tom. Robert squeezes his splinter... \nROBERT I can't believe it's the same horse. \nCars and pick-up trucks haphazardly parked along a dirt road... Smoking open grill barbecues. Ranchers and families move about the ranch, sit and eat at picnic tables with gingham tablecloths... Some teenagers hanging around the corral, talking. Diane and some other women, eating and talking... Frank with a group of men, drinking beer, telling stories. \nA BAND has been set up by the barn. People are dancing under the harvest moon. Grace is dancing with Joe... Tom is dancing with a local woman... Annie with a rancher... Everyone is having a good time... \nRobert is enjoying a smoke with some men. He looks over to the dance floor and smiles when he sees Grace and Joe. \nJoe and the Rancher trade place... Joe dances with Annie, the Rancher with Grace... But Tom sees his chance and switches with the Rancher so that he can dance with Grace... She is thrilled and he guides her effortlessly across the floor. \nJoe and Annie are interrupted by another couple. Joe switches partners, but Annie smiles and excuses herself -- she wants to rest. \nRobert continues talking with some of the men. He puts out his smoke and looks over to the dance floor. He sees Grace now dancing with Tom... His eyes search for Annie. He moves away from the men until he sees, from a distance; \nAnnie, sitting by herself, amidst the crowd... No one would notice her unless they were looking for her... But Robert does -- and what he sees is Annie looking at Grace and Tom... then, only looking at Tom... Smiling to herself gently... Watching his every move. Suddenly, she rises and exits out of the barn to get some air. \nEXT. HANK'S RANCH - NIGHT \nAnnie finds an isolated spot, behind the main house, to be by herself and catch her breath. \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nTom and Grace continue dancing. She's in heaven. Robert approaches and Tom quickly allows him to take over. Grace loves the attention from both men. As they dance off, Tom crosses the dance floor and is met by Hank's wife; \nHANK'S WIFE Oh Tom, would you check the shed and see if there's anymore chairs. \nTOM Sure. \nEXT. HANK'S RANCH - NIGHT \nTom is walking along when he turns the corner of Hank's house and finds; \nAnnie sitting alone, staring up at the night. They see each other. From behind the house, no one else can see them. \nIt is as if the fates brought them face to face and alone. Without any will to stop it, they embrace and kiss passionately. But when they look into each other's eyes, there is no joy in the kiss. Tom releases her and walks away, heading for the shed. Annie quickly pulls herself together and enters the main house through the back door. \nINT. DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH, KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDiane is once more sitting at the kitchen table, looking over some bills before bed. Her tape player is on softly. Tom enters and crosses to the sink to get a glass of water. \nDiane looks up, seeing Tom with his back to her -- standing at the sink, filling his glass -- staring out the window over the sink. She looks to the dish of brownies on the table. \nDIANE I have some brownies left over. Want one? \nTOM (w/o turning around) No thanks. \nDiane senses an uneasiness in Tom. She looks as he drinks his water. \nMEDIUM CLOSE-UP ON TOM'S BACK, as if from Diane's POV. \nBut when we pull back we find ourselves; \nINT. BARN - NIGHT \nTom is standing in front of Pilgrim's stall. He opens the door. They look at each other. He strokes him and begins to whisper; \nTOM There's something you have to do tomorrow, boy... \nCamera gently moves away... and Tom whispers to Pilgrim what must be done... \nEXT. THE RIDING ARENA - DAY \nThere's a stillness. A sense of import. Annie, Robert, Frank, Diane, Joe and Smokey, are all at various spots along the fence. \nGrace stands inside the ring. Tom is standing beside Pilgrim in the middle of the ring. Pilgrim is bridled and saddled. Tom adjusts he stirrup. He walks over to Grace... \nTOM All set? \nGrace swallows hard, nodding. She's worried... \nTOM Sure? \nGRACE (softly) Sure. \nTom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to Pilgrim. The horse pricks up his ears as they approach. Tom motions Grace to stop a short distance from Pilgrim so as not to crowd him. Tom walks over alone, reaching to gently take hold of him. Holding him by the bridle, he puts his head beside Pilgrim's, quietly speaking to him, soothing Pilgrim's neck with his other hand... \nAnnie and Robert are fascinated. Anxious. \nPilgrim never takes his eyes off Grace. Tom tries to ease him forward. Pilgrim resists, lifting his head and looking at Grace so you can see the white at the top of his eye. Tom turns him away, walking him in circles, trying to calm him. He leads him back to Grace. Pilgrim tosses his head and stomps his feet. \nRobert grows more anxious. Annie is calmer, more focused. \nTom climbs up on him, riding him around the arena in an easy lope. Grace watches them go round the ring. She looks at her parents and tries to smile. They try as well. \nTom dismounts and leads Pilgrim back to Grace. Pilgrim balks again, violently throwing his head, kicking... Grace's shoulders slump, she presses her hands in her pockets, fighting not to cry... \nTOM Smokey... \nSmokey climbs over the rail into the ring as Tom says something to him. Meanwhile Frank reassures Grace: \nFRANK He'll be okay, Grace. Just you hang on there a minute or two. Tom'll get him, okay, you'll see... \nSmokey jogs over to the gate, climbing it, and disappearing into the barn. Tom crosses to Grace. \nTOM There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay? \nGRACE What does that mean? \nTOM It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done. \nGRACE I want to watch. \nSmokey re-enters the ring, carrying some rope. He talks briefly to Tom. Pilgrim, sensing something, turns and runs to the far side of the ring. Tom, his arms spread, walks over to him, keeping him by the fence. Tom takes him by the bridle. Smokey comes beside him. Tom unhitches the bridle and in its place slips a rope halter Smokey passes to him. Smokey then hands him two long ropes, one at a time. Tom fastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle horn. Tom asks Smokey. \nTOM You got that soft rope? \nSmokey hands it to him. Tom quietly talks to Pilgrim, runs his hand down Pilgrim's left foreleg and lifts his hoof. Pilgrim slightly shifts. And when he's still, Tom slips the loop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure it's snug. And taking the other end of the rope, he hoists the weight of Pilgrim's raised hoof and ties the rope to the saddle horn. Pilgrim stands on three legs -- an explosion waiting to happen. Tom moves away from Pilgrim, taking the halter line from Smokey. Pilgrim, trying to move, finds he's crippled. Scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg. Seeing he can't walk, panicked, he tries to run. Tom and Smokey, brace themselves, lean back on their ropes and force him around them in a tight circle. He goes around and around like a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg. Tom looks over and sees Annie has left Robert outside the ring to stand by an anguished Grace -- her hands on her shoulders, gripping her. Robert watches, feeling too much a foreigner... \nGRACE What is he doing this? \nFRANK It'll be OK, Grace. \nBut even Frank isn't so sure. Pilgrim, covered in sweat, still circles. As he runs, his hobbled foot jabs at the air, trying to find peace. He runs and runs as Tom and Smokey lean on the ropes -- until he can't run any more and stops. Tom and Smokey let the lines go slack. Pilgrim, stands there, his wet sides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping sounds. Tom and Smokey speak. Smokey hands him his rope. Turning, he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand. He swings the rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over Pilgrim's saddle horn. He pulls it tight. And he takes the other end of the rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick release knot to the bottom rung. Coming back he takes the other two lines from Tom. Tom crosses to the rail. He starts putting pressure on the rope. Pilgrim feeing it, braces himself. The pressure tilts the saddle hold downward. \nFRANK (to Grace and Annie) He's trying to get him to go down on his knees... \nRobert takes an isolated hike up the mountain until he comes upon a ridge overlooking an inspiring vista. We can tell Robert is moved by the sight. Sweaty, tired, he find a place to sit... to be still... and to consider his life. \nEXT. THE RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nFrank's car is parked up for the trip to the airport that will take the Bookers to Branton, Missouri for Diane's cousin's wedding... \nGrace, Annie and Robert are outside saying goodbye to the Bookers; Diane, the Twins... and Joe... Joe awkwardly shakes her hand... then removes his hat and puts it on her head. Everyone laughs. They want to hug each other, but don't know if they would... \nFrank and Tom are packing the car... \nDIANE Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. (to Robert and Annie) I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter. \nFRANK Diane! \nDIANE (whispers) Frank's touchy about his cousins. (they laugh) Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean. \nROBERT Same here, Mrs. Booker. Thank you again for all your kindness. \nDIANE Ah... \nDiane turns to Annie. Robert instinctively steps away, saying goodbye to Joe and the boys... The two women look at each other with respect and concern. \nDIANE Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing. \nANNIE I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for. (Diane nods) Between you and me, I could use the time alone. \nDiane understands. \nDIANE And you'll be all right by yourself here, (referring to Robert and Grace) after they've gone? \nTom hears this bit of info as he passes by with the wedding present and puts it in the truck. Annie makes sure to avert her look. \nANNIE It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks. \nDIANE (double meaning) Promise? \nANNIE Promise. \nDiane just nods, knowingly. She extends her hand. The women shake. \nDIANE Good luck to you, Annie. \nANNIE You too, Diane. \nThey part. Diane starts giving order as she gets in the car: \nDIANE All right, everybody in. Frank, we all set... \nCamera wides as we hear the voices of departure... see the MacLeans waving... See Tom off by himself, waving... but thinking of something else... \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the midst of packing, Annie has made dinner for Grace and Robert. In the midst of eating, Robert asks: \nROBERT Shouldn't we have invited Tom over? \nGRACE I did. He said he had work to do until late. \nAnnie remains silent. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE -- NIGHT \nTom exits with a small, leather satchel. He crosses to his truck, tosses in the satchel, gets in and drives off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BARN - MORNING \nGrace enters the barn to say goodbye to Pilgrim. \nINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS \nShe moves to his stall and opens the doors. He stands there, without any fear of her. She smiles and enters. She wraps her arm around his neck, pets him and whispers. \nGRACE I'll see you home... OK? \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - DAY \nEverything is being packed up. Robert is dressed for travel. Annie is taping up the boxes containing her computer equipment. \nANNIE Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut? \nROBERT Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back? \nANNIE Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark. \nROBERT May I have a suggestion? \nANNIE Yeah, what? \nROBERT Take your time. \nANNIE (innocently) What do you mean? \nAnnie looks up from the box to see Robert is calmly staring at her. His demeanor is different. Something's going on. \nANNIE You look like something's wrong. \nThis is Robert's moment. He knows it. He takes a breath and hopes it comes out right: \nROBERT I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me. \nANNIE I don't understa- \nROBERT (continues) And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them. (Annie waits; he smiles) See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more. (smiles) But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore... (bravely) And I don't want you to come home until you do know... (the hard part) ... one way or the other. \nAnnie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband more than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to say this. She would not disrespect it with denials. Her throat is choked with tears, she swallows down. She nods. \nRobert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same moment. He picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nAnnie and Robert walk towards the car to find Grace, leaning against it -- looking depressed. \nTom rises slowly to his feet. Then stands stock still. He and the Stallion penetrate each other. \nSuddenly this beautiful, powerful Stallion rears -- violently. Tom remains still, but clearly the horse is treating him as an invader... \nIt's as if the Whisperer is now being guided by the Horse towards understanding. As Tom receives it, he remembers; \nTOM (V.O.) Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long. \nWE BEGIN TO FADE OUT ON TOM \nANNIE (V.O.) I don't care! We'd be together. \nTOM (V.O.) Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us... \nANNIE (V.O.) I can't do this. I can't leave you... \nVoice-Overs have carried over into a... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT \nTom and Annie make love... \nANNIE (V.O.) I won't. \nBut there is a difference in their lovemaking. There's a slowness, a reverence... a sense of two people so bounded, that they are outside of time... Their love is so strong it almost feels like despair -- their need to connect has gone beyond their bodies and into their spirits, for which there is no earthly satisfaction. \nEXT. CREEK HOUSE - MORNING \nThe sun has risen. \nINT. CREEK HOUSE - MORNING \nAnnie awakens in bed and discovers she is alone. She looks around for Tom. She rises and enters the other room to discover: \nAll her boxes and all her luggage have been removed. \nHer heart sinks. Tom re-enters, fully dressed, to get the last box. He sees on her face a look of confusion and hurt. \nTOM I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set. \nANNIE (curt) How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go? \nTom doesn't know how to respond. He looks away and bends down to reach for the box when Annie commands: \nANNIE Leave me alone! \nBeat. They stand awkwardly for a moment, until; \nTOM (pleadingly) Annie, please... \nTom reaches to embrace her, but Annie attacks him. Punching his chest... pulling at his shirt as Tom tries to put his arms around her... \nANNIE NO!... NO!... YOU DON'T DECIDE THIS!... NO!... \nTom's heart is breaking as he manages to get his arms around her and hold her... as she breaks down and softly, the rage passes... Annie speaks softly. \nTOM (struggling) I don't know any other way, Annie. \nANNIE (more adamant) Why? \nSuddenly; \nTOM You think this is easy for me!? \nAnnie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words; \nTOM It's just happened this way sometimes. I can't explain it. But I look at you and see Grace and I see Robert, and no matter what you decide about him, I just know this is right. Your life isn't here and you know it. \nAnnie looks into his eyes and asks, softly defiant; \nANNIE Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point? \nTOM (confused by her question) The point was to love each other. \nANNIE Why? \nAs if there has to be a result... Tom looks at her and says with an almost innocent conviction: \nTOM Because we had to... And I'll never stop loving you, Annie. Here. Where my life is. \nThe simplicity, and truth, of it hits Annie strongly. \nAnnie releases herself from him and turns away... despondent. Realizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says. She starts shaking her head. Tom can't hear it... He reaches for her; \nTOM Annie... \nShe turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately... holding each other... as if for the last time. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nTom is escorting Pilgrim into the trailer attached to the Suburban. He looks across the ranch to see the figure of Annie, standing alone, perfectly still, in the pasture, looking out to the horizon... (reminiscent of Tom earlier in the film) \nEXT. THE PASTURE - DAY \nTom approaches Annie from behind, stopping a few feet away. \nTOM Annie? \nShe doesn't answer... as if she has found her own private place within her, at last... A place of strength. She looks as if she knows what must be done... She hears him about to walk away when she asks: \nANNIE Can we go for one more ride? \nTom stops. Considers this. Then: \nTOM Sure. I'll saddle them up. \nHe exits. Not seeing the tears in Annie's eyes. \nINT. BARN - DAY \nTom enters the barn slowly. He crosses to Rimrock's stall... then stops. As if he is waiting. As if he knows... \n", "test1_input": "DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Who's there? \nANNIE Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Did you speak to Farlow? \nANNIE Yes. We're suing. \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story. \nANNIE David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you? \nSilence. Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. Everyone waits. Covert looks between characters suggest this is interesting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the magazine's owner? Annie waits without a shred of anxiety -- even though she might have some. Finally: \nDAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO) Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud... \nANNIE Exactly... \nEveryone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING \nIt's perfectly still. We are looking down an empty TWO-LANE ROAD covered with fresh snow. We see the girls slowly riding out of the woods, talking. They cross the road and start up into the woods on the other side... They are trying to sing a LIZ PHAIR song, \"CHOPSTICKS\" \nGRACE/JUDITH (singing) \"I met him at a party and he told me how he like to drive me home... He said he liked to do it backwards...\" \nGRACE (singing) \"... I said it--\" \nJUDITH (singing) \"... and I said that\"... \nGRACE (stops singing) No, wait, it just goes... \"he said he liked to do-\"... \nSuddenly there's the SOUND OF THE METAL OF JUDITH'S HORSE scraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow. Judith notices first... \nJUDITH What was -- \nThe horse staggers... Judith looks to Grace -- \nJUDITH Grace! \nThe horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet, kicking up sprays of snow and ice shards. The horse suddenly falls on the ice and goes down hard on its knees... \nGRACE JUDITH! \nThe horse stumbles to get back on its feet, slipping again. Frightened, it rears and Judith, caught off balance, is thrown, her foot catching in the stirrup... \nJUDITH GRAAACE! \nHer horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward down the incline. \nGRACE PILGRIM, COME ON! MOVE! \nGrace, directly behind Judith, tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid being hit by the errant horse. \nWhat follows, we see from Grace's perspective. The details that form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast, disembodies, almost surreal as -- \nJudith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy slope. Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck. Judith, her leg helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head bouncing on the frozen ground. \nThey slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD. Pilgrim is the first to find his legs and stand. Grace manages to sit up in the saddle. She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup. \nGRACE (frightened) Jude, you okay? \nJUDITH (softly, crying) I'm okay... I'm okay. \nShe tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup. \nGrace sees it before she hears it. A GLINT off of steel. We then hear the rumbling SOUND of a TRUCK coming around the bend... The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road... The Truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes around the turn... Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get Judith's horse out of the road... The driver, seeing them, lays on the air horn. The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle slipping out of Grace's hand... \nGRACE JUUDE!!! \n... The horses turn apart. The Driver starts furiously downshifting, trying to brake... He seems to get it under control when suddenly THE TRUCK SKIDS on some ice. It begins to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack- knifing. The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith and her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith disappearing under him. The truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim... Grace looks right into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly, Pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck. \nPilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his hooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some grotesque ornament. His head and chest slams into the window, shattering through the glass. \nAnd then it is still. \nThe truck has stopped halfway in the road. Judith's horse lies in the road, motionless. Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. He shrieks, struggling to get to his feet. He manages to free his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods... \nThe Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in shock. He sits on the ground. All we hear is the sound of the river and the wind in the trees. \nGrace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the beautiful morning sky. \nWE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER... \nINT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER MORNING \nANGLE ON GRACE'S NOTE on the refrigerator as Robert enters from the outside with two bags of groceries. He places them on the counter near the PHONE MACHINE. He sees ONE MESSAGE is there. He presses PLAY as he puts away the groceries. \nA BEAT LATER the PHONE RINGS and he picks up, with the machine still playing... \nROBERT (on phone) Hello? Paul, hi -- are you guys back? How was it? Oh that sounds great. Oh Paul.. hold on... \nLIZ (on machine) Robert! Are you there?... Robert! It's Liz!... Look, there's... there's been an accident... Uh... Jesus... uh... \nAs Robert listens, the voice of Liz's on the machine from inside, pulls his attention. On hearing \"accident,\" Robert lowers the receiver, frozen, as he listens to Liz... \nLIZ (on machine) Robert, just call me on my call phone... \nEXT. THE WOODS - LATE MORNING \nPilgrim is hiding in the shadows under an old railroad bridge, standing up to his knees in the river. His chest is cut open, bleeding. His face cut, contorted and swollen. LIZ HAMMOND, the local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her jacket, quietly walking into the water. \nA Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water. He watches Liz. She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts, running upstream. \nThe Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm. Frightened, Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo in his neck. He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of the river, the hypo still in his neck. He runs for the sanctuary of the woods. \nINT. TRAIN - LATE MORNING \nAnnie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her, her cellular phone, ever-ready. The train passes through beautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial she's writing. \nThe train pulls into a station and stops, causing Annie to take a break and stretch her arms and neck. She looks out the window for the first time and sees: \nA MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young children, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm around his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the father listens to every word. \n", "test1_true": "HER CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. She answers. \nANNIE Yeah?... Hi. I made the 1:00 so... \nThe expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic. \nINT. HOSPITAL, CONNECTICUT - DAY \nAnnie is running through the corridors, her bags in tow. She sees Robert standing in the corridor talking to a DOCTOR. She runs for them. \nWhen she appears, Robert and the Doctor stop their conversation. Robert looks to Annie, who is waiting for news. \nANNIE WHAT!? \nRobert is teary eyed, beaten down. \nROBERT Judith's dead. \nAnnie's horrified, waiting for news of Grace. \nANNIE What about Grace? \nROBERT She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging... \nDOCTOR But nothing we can't handle... \nANNIE (impatient) Where is she now? \nDOCTOR Surgery. \nANNIE Surgery! For what-? \nROBERT (interrupting) Annie, her leg was shattered -- what they call the distal epi.. epi.. \nDOCTOR Distal epicondyle of the femur... \nROBERT (quietly, crying) They have to take the leg off. \nAnnie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet shock. We can tell her mind is racing, trying to process the information, until finally she asks: \nANNIE Which leg? \nThe Doctor and Robert are surprised by the question. \nROBERT What difference does it make? \nAnnie stares for a beat, then nods apologetically. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nPilgrim is sedated, lying in his own blood in the snow, surrounded by Police and trackers. He is being attended to by LIZ HAMMOND, who is dictating to her assistant: \nLIZ ... His skull, cheek, and nose are severely fractured. He has a deep chest wound. I'm not even sure it can be closed. \nLOCAL TRACKER (deadpan, local accent) Animal should be put down -- anybody can see that. \nLiz looks up to him, resentfully, but knows he's right. \nINT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nCamera moves from Grace's face down her body to Robert's hand, which rubs her good leg. He looks at her lovingly, pushing the hair from her forehead. \nAnnie, needing to do something, tenderly straightens Grace's blankets. It is plain to see where her leg had once been. Robert can't look. Annie, one to face her fears, bravely looks at it head on. She notices the I.V. Bag and rises on: \nANNIE That bag's almost empty. \nROBERT (looking) No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it. \nANNIE (as she exits) Robert, you leave it up these people...! \nRobert is about to respond but Annie is already out the door. We hear the O.S. DIALOGUE as Robert listens. \nANNIE (O.S.) Excuse me, my daughter needs a new I.V. \nNURSE (O.S.) We have her down, we'll be right in. \nANNIE (O.S.) I'd like it taken care of now please. \nAnnie enters first. \nANNIE You have to keep on top of these people or else they just sit on their -- \nBut Robert is ignoring her. Facing Grace, smoothing away her hair. He's giving her the silent treatment. Annie knows this means Robert doesn't approve of her dictatorial behavior. Annoyed, she turns away as well. \nThe Nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old one as Robert backs away. \nROBERT I'm sorry. \nANNIE Tch. What are you -- \nAnnie, about to respond to his inappropriate politeness, is stopped by Robert, who finally looks at her. It's a powerful look that tells her to calm down and shut up. It's a look that, for all of Robert's sensitivity, affects Annie. She gets the message and stays calm. \nAs the nurse leaves, Annie is about to say thank you, but Robert beats her to it. \nROBERT Thank you. \nAnnie and Robert stand facing each other, when the PHONE RINGS. Annie picks up. \nINTERCUT \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nLIZ HAMMOND on a cellular, walking away from the crowd. \nLIZ Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace? \nANNIE (journalistic) Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control. \nLIZ Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim. \nAnnie hears the name as if it's some distant echo she can't quite identify; Liz speaks quickly as Annie watches Grace breathing in her sleep -- \nLIZ It's not good. I've never seen an animal with these injuries still breathing. I know this is difficult to hear right now I'd like your permission to put him down. It's the really best thing we can do for -- \n", "test1_id": 816, "test2_input": "TOM ... It's always kind of interesting to hear the horse's side of the story... \nThe crowd laughs warmly. He directs his comments to a WOMAN wearing an expensive Ralph Lauren western outfit, standing outside the corral... \nTOM Now if he was cranky or lazy, like you say he is, we'd be seeing his tail twitching there and his ears back, maybe. But this isn't a cranky horse, it's a scared horse. You see how braced he is up around the neck back there. He just doesn't know which way to turn... \nThe Woman nods. Tom turns the horse on a dime so that he always stays facing the circling thoroughbred... \nTOM You see how he keeps pointing his hindquarters in at me? Well, I'd guess the reason he seems reluctant to move out is because when he does, he gets in trouble for it. \nTHE WOMAN He's not good at transitions, you know? When I want him to move from a trot to a lope, say... \nTOM (smiles) Well, I'm sure that's what you think but that's not what I'm seeing. You may think you're asking for a lope, but your body may be saying something else altogether. You might be putting too many conditions on him. For instance, you might be saying \"GO, but, hey, don't go too fast.\" He can tell that from the way you feel. Your body can't lie. You ever give him a kick to make him move out? \nTHE WOMAN He won't go unless I do. \nTOM And then he goes and you feel like he's going too fast, so you yank him back? (she nods) And next thing you know, he's bucking. (she nods again) Well, if someone told you to go, stop, go, stop -- you'd buck too. \nThe people laugh. The Woman smiles self-consciously. \nTOM It's a dance, see... Somebody has to lead and somebody has to follow. \nTom gracefully moves his horse around the ring, \"dancing\". He then takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the coils slap against the black horse's flank, making it burst into a lope. And again... Making the animal go from a trot to a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again. \nTOM I want him to get so he can leave real soft. He's getting the idea now. He's not all braced up and tense like he was at the start. He's finding out it's okay. \nHe throws the rope again and this time the transition to the lope is a smooth one. \nTOM You see that? He's getting better already. Pretty soon, if you work at it, you'll be able to make all these transitions easy on a loose rein. (sotto voce, wry) Yeah, and pigs'll fly. (to Woman) He's going to be okay -- so long as you don't go yanking on him. \nShe nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish. He walks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and speaks sympathetically: \nTOM Look, the truth is it's all about self- preservation. These animals. (with great affection) ... well, they just have such big hearts, you know? There's nothing they want more than to do what you want them to do. But when the messages get all confused, the only thing they know to do is try and save themselves... Now, why don't you go saddle up and see what happens. \nFeeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfelt man's man, the Woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb over the rail. Her horse lets her come right up to him and stroke his neck. Tom comments; \nTOM They won't ever hold a thing against you. They're the most forgiving creatures God ever made. \nTurning on his mike and turning back to the crowd, he says: \nTOM Okay, who's next? \nA Young Boy leads a mule into the ring. Tom smiles: \nTOM Now God has another idea entirely with the mule. \nEXT. THE FAIRGROUNDS - LATER THAT DAY \nTom has finished his \"show.\" People are shaking his hand, thanking him, as he walks away from the corral, towards a trailer. \nThe Woman in the Ralph Lauren approaches: \nWOMAN Excuse me. \nHe faces the Woman: \nWOMAN Hi. I'm Dale. I just wanted to -- I can't get over the way he felt under me after you'd finish with him. Everything had just, I don't know, freed up or something. \nThe Woman is flirting. Tom shrugs, uncomfortably; \nTOM Well, that'll happen. \nWOMAN Where did you learn all this stuff? \nTOM What stuff is that? \nWOMAN About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders? \nTOM (getting the message) Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts. \nWOMAN What do you mean? \nTOM Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. (smiles) That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up. \nHe leaves her, entering the trailer. \nINT. RONA'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nA small, well-used trailer. Tom and Rona are finishing dinner like comfortable old friends. Rona rises, taking the plates into the kitchen and starts rinsing them: \nRONA Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up. \nTOM I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up. \nRONA The number's by the phone. \nHe nods but doesn't move. He just looks at Rona and smiles. She's a good woman. But Tom hopes she doesn't want anymore than what they have together. Rona notices him looking and smiles: \nRONA What are you looking at, young man? \nTOM How long were you married? \nRONA Long enough. \nTOM You ever miss it? \nRONA Does a horse miss a saddle? \nTOM Sometimes. \nShe chuckles, shuts the water off and crosses back to him, sitting beside him. \nRONA Well as a matter of fact, I don't... most of the time. \nShe starts unbuttoning his shirt. \nTOM You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together. \nRONA Honey... I was always good. \nTom smiles as Rona leans in. They kiss. \nINT. ANNIE'S OFFICE, N.Y.C. - MORNING \n", "test2_true": "ANNIE You know it's perfectly shot, it's perfectly cropped, it's perfectly laid out and I'm so bloody bored, I'd rather buy a Motor Racing magazine -- Start over. \nSome general whines and groans as her assistant hands her a note. \nANNIE Uh, would you all excuse me a moment? \nShe waits for them to leave as she sits before the phone. One of her lines is lit: \nEXT. A ROADSIDE SERVICE STATION SOMEWHERE IN UTAH - DAY \nAn endless sky. An empty ribbon of two-lane highway in Utah. A small roadside station. Tom's pick-up truck, his horse trailer hitched to it, getting gas. \nTom is on the pay phone. We hear Annie's voice: \nANNIE (O.S.) This is Annie MacLean. \nTOM Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called. \nINTERCUT ANNIE in her office: \nANNIE (efficient, expeditiously) Oh! Yes. Thank you for calling back. Uh, all right, let me try to explain my situation as briefly as possible... You see, my daughter had an accident with her horse... They were both injured and she, my daughter, she hasn't been able to... fully... uh... It was an extremely traumatic experience... and uh... \nTom, sensing her turmoil, listening compassionately. \nANNIE I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized -- \nTOM Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems. \nANNIE Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. (trying to be charming) I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly -- \nTOM Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing. \nANNIE Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner... \nTOM Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of... \nANNIE (interrupts, abruptly) I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class. \nTOM (getting impatient) Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City? \nAnnie is taken aback. Tom feels badly. \nTOM I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them. \nANNIE Mr. Booker, if I could just ex -- \nTOM I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now. \nHe hangs up before Annie can continue. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie reaches for Grace's bedroom door, then pauses. She realizes she should knock. She does and whispers: \nANNIE Grace? (knocks again) Grace, it's mom. \nAnnie slowly opens the door. She finds Grace's bed empty. She looks over to the window to find Grace sitting in a chair, in the dark, looking out the window. \nANNIE Grace. What are you doing? \nNot looking up, Grace speaks in a hollow voice. \nGRACE I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India. \nANNIE I brought it to you in the hospital. \nGRACE No, you didn't. \nANNIE Grace, I put it on the table near your -- \nGRACE (apathetic) Doesn't matter. \nBeat. \nANNIE Have you decided about Pilgrim? \nGRACE What about him? \nANNIE Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down... \nGRACE I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that. \nANNIE I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it. \nGRACE Mom? \nANNIE Yeah? \nGRACE Maybe they should put me down too. \nANNIE What? \nGRACE I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me? \nWhat frightens Annie most is the calm and apathy in Grace's voice. She's surrendering... Annie, for the first time in a long time, feels she's losing control. \nINT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAnnie sits alone at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of wine. \nRobert enters and sits opposite her, wearing a tuxedo -- his tie and collar undone. \nANNIE How was the dinner? \nROBERT (wry) All our \"favorite\" people were there saying all their \"favorite\" things about their \"favorite\" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with. \nANNIE Why did you go? \nROBERT (surprised) They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there. \nHe drinks Annie's wine as she looks at him. \nROBERT Did you get a hold of that horse guy? \n", "test2_id": 817, "test3_input": "ANNIE Yeah. \nROBERT What did he say? \nANNIE No. \nRobert nods. Accepting. Silence. Annie sips her wine. Then: \nROBERT I was thinking... Maybe we should think about the three of us going someplace warm... Remember that house we rented in Bermuda... The pink one with the -- \nHis arm accidentally spills the wine. \nROBERT Shit. \nAs he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, Annie watches Robert clean the spill. Something about his movements, his posture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having the inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing over the rough sports -- strikes her hard. Annie realizes the love she feels for Robert isn't fading. It's gone. \nHe finishes cleaning and sits. \nROBERT What was I saying? \nANNIE About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses... \nRobert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea. He nods, again, getting the message. Silence. In that silence, Annie looks at him... and makes a decision: \nANNIE Robert, I want to take Pilgrim out to Mr. Booker. Drive him out to Montana... With Grace. \nRobert is confused... and a little worried. \nROBERT I don't understand. You just said he said no. \nANNIE He did, but... I think I can change his mind. \nROBERT That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not. \nANNIE Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her. \nROBERT (at a loss) NO! What are you -- you're serious about this? \nANNIE I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way... \nROBERT (overlapping) You've already made arrangements!? \nANNIE No. I was just researching. Calm down. \nROBERT I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave... \nANNIE I'm not asking you to. I'll do it. \nROBERT You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the -- \nANNIE He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride. \nROBERT (overlapping) What... Bo-... What about the magazine? \nANNIE I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer... \nBeat. Robert fears this is about the marriage. Yet -- \nROBERT No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea \nANNIE Why?! \nROBERT (searching) Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability... \nANNIE I can't say he's been all that effective with her. \nROBERT Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time. \nANNIE I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will. \nROBERT I'm not pretending anything! \nBeat. Robert just stares at her. He looks concerned... almost worried. Annie gets uncomfortable. \nANNIE What? \nIt is very difficult for Robert to say; \nROBERT I thought... well, ever since the accident, I just thought we... \nHe stops. Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he doesn't continue. He doesn't. A thick silence hangs between them. \nROBERT I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary. \nANNIE (frustrated) Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. (he listens) I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it! \nRobert can feel the strength of her will. He can find no way around it. \nROBERT What if she doesn't want to go? \nANNIE She will if you think she should. \nROBERT And you think it's best if I don't come. \nANNIE (hesitates) No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right. \nAt some moment, they realize Grace is standing at the entrance to the kitchen. They are surprised. \nGRACE I'm not going! I don't care what she says! \nAnnie lowers her head. Robert stares at Grace as she walks to him. \nGRACE Daddy?... I don't want to go. \nGrace stands next to Robert. He holds her hands. Annie looks at him, without sympathy. Robert looks back. In his face is the total acceptance of what must be. As well as the sadness of it's inevitability. He looks back at his daughter, whose eyes have never left him. \nEXT. JOAN DYER STABLE - DAY \nPilgrim is being loaded into the trailer by four strong stable men, violently kicking and pulling all the way. \nAnnie watches with anxiety -- an almost giddy Liz by her side. \nANNIE Maybe we should give him another sedative. \n", "test3_true": "ANNIE Of course not. \nLIZ Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio. \nIn the back seat of ANNIE'S SUBURBAN sits Grace -- her back to the action. Hearing Pilgrim's struggle. Putting her walkman on her ears and raising the volume... We hear -- \nGRACE'S MUSIC, ON THE SOUNDTRACK, bringing us to: \nEXT. A HIGHWAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA - DAY \nAnnie's Suburban drives along Route 80, pulling the horse trailer behind. \nINT. SUBURBAN - DAY \nGrace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to her music (maybe LIZ PHAIR OR HOLLY COLE). Detached. Non- committal. As trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement, she reacts and turns to the other window. \nAnnie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road and her rear-view mirror -- checking on Grace. \nEXT. HIGHWAY IN - EARLY MORNING \nThe Suburban drives as the sun begins to set. \nEXT. MOTEL IN OHIO - NIGHT \nThe Suburban and Horse Trailer are parked in the lot. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM, OHIO - NIGHT \nA small furnished motel room with two twin beds. \nGrace sits up in bed watching TV, with no expression. A sitcom with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug. \nAnnie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her hair. Grace doesn't bother to look up. \nANNIE You want to take your bath? (Grace shakes her head) We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to -- \nGRACE Fine -- I'll take my bath. \nShe begins moving off the bed. \nANNIE No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough -- \nGRACE -- enough time tomorrow. I know. \nANNIE Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine. \nGRACE (interrupts on \"fine\") I don't care. \nAnnie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also realizes there's no talking to Grace now. So, she achieves her goal -- \nJANNIE Take it now. \nGrace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the door. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM IN OHIO - NIGHT \nThe lights are off. Annie lays in bed, wide awake. It is the middle of the night. \nGrace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering. She's having a bad dream. Annie rises -- considering whether or not to intercede... Finally, Grace begins to cry out... softly at first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in fear... Annie appears right by her side. \nANNIE What, sweetheart? What? \nShaken, Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at that moment. She wraps her arms around her, tightly, and tries to catch her breath. \nANNIE It's sleeping in a strange bed, that's all. Happens sometimes. It's Ok. It's OK. \nEXT. ANOTHER ROAD, MID-WEST - DAY \nThe Suburban continues its journey. \nOnce again -- Annie, in the front, and Grace, in the rear, drive without a word between them. \nINT. SUBURBAN - DAY \nGrace and Annie occupy their same positions. Annie is on the car phone with her office. \nANNIE Okay, listen -- let's do this. When I get to the next motel, I'll see if they have a fax. If not, I'll call you tomorrow to -- \nAnnie continues O.S. when we hear a shifting, a rocking in the trailer behind them. As if Pilgrim made a sudden move. Grace quickly turns her head. Annie looks in the rear view at Grace. \nANNIE Uh Lucy, look, I have to go. OK... Later. \nAnnie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror. Grace reaches for her walkman and headphones. Annie offers; \nANNIE Grace! GRACE! \nGrace lowers one side of her headphones; \nANNIE Would you like to put your music on up here? \nGrace shrugs. Annie shrugs it off as well. Grace replaces the headphone. Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or gospel or religious talk shows... She shuts it off. Frustrated, Annie looks up ahead and sees: \nA TRUCK STOP DINER \nAnnie yells to be heard through the headphones; \nANNIE IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!? \nGRACE (shrugs) Whatever you want. \nANNIE Fine! \nGRACE Fine. \nAnnoyed, Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to herself -- \nANNIE Fine! \nShe exits the car, banging the door. As she walks acrund the car to help Grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper: \nANNIE \"Whatever you want!\" Well, this is what I want. I want to eat lunch and I want to smoke a cigarette and I want to keep talking to myself for the next two thousand fucking miles...\"! \nShe opens Grace's door. Grace senses her mother's anger. \n", "test3_id": 818}

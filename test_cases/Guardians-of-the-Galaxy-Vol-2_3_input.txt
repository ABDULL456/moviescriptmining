INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
The hoard of Ravagers hear Taserface's voice. 
TASERFACE (O.S.) HE'S GOT IT! YONDU'S GOT THE DAMN FIN! 
RETCH GO! 
SERIES OF SHOTS - INT. ALL OVER THE SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
ALL OF THE RAVAGERS all over the ship, in a panic, LOAD THEIR WEAPONS and HEAD TOWARD THE CELL. 
INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE 
Yondu and Rocket and Groot COME AROUND THIS CORNER IN SLOW- MOTION, the three biggest badasses in the history of cinema. 
A HOARD OF RAVAGERS, led by Brahl, FILE IN at the end of the hallway. 
But Yondu WHISTLES and the ARROW TWISTS QUICKLY BACK AND FORTH, SLICING THROUGH EACH OF THEM. 
Yondu SLAMS through a door into - 
INT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY - OUTER SPACE 
Our heroes step onto a catwalk in this, the biggest space in the Eclector. There are catwalks throughout and dozens of docked M-ships. The SCURRILOUS RAVAGER sees them from above -- 
SCURRILOUS RAVAGER Down there! 
IN AN EXTREME WIDE ANGLE, we see the ARROW FLYING UP AND DOWN, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, CUTTING THROUGH ALL SORTS OF RAVAGERS, closer and further from CAMERA. 
We TRAVEL BEHIND YONDU AND ROCKET as BODIES FALL AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION LIKE FIREWORKS. 
Groot looks up and sees RETCH looking down at him. 
RETCH FLEES in terror as Groot GROWS branches to pull himself up behind him. 
Groot HOWLS FURIOUSLY, TAKING CHASE. 
Retch YOWLS like a child as he frantically runs. 
But Groot GROWS HIS BRANCHES around RETCH's legs, TRIPPING HIM. 
BAM! He FALLS, face first to the floor. 
And, with a WAR CRY, Baby Groot FLINGS the sadistic Ravager off the edge towards the abyss below. 
As RETCH FALLS past Yondu and Rocket, Baby Groot DROPS back down onto Rocket's shoulder, and they push their way through the doorway - 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
Yondu, Rocket, and Groot move into this area, where they look up at DOZENS OF SECURITY MONITORS encircling them showing Ravagers filing toward them from every part of the ship. 
Yondu WHISTLES as he watches the MONITORS - 
ON A MONITOR, the arrow FLIES out the wall. He whistles so that it strikes TWO RAVAGERS running towards them. 
It ZIPS out of that room and 
INT. DARK HALL - OUTER SPACE 
A HOARD of Ravagers come running down a hall. The ARROW ZIPS overhead, smashing out all the lights so that the hall is completely dark, except for the DIM RED LIGHT OF THE ARROW. 
And we can just make out the RED LIGHT smashing through the body of every Ravager there and then on into -- 
INT. SPACEPORT - OUTER SPACE 
A YELLING CROWD OF RAVAGERS come, hungry for war, when the arrow SHOOTS THROUGH THE CHAINS holding a giant spaceship in place over their heads. 
It FALLS, instantly CRUSHING them all, and then zips on -- 
INT. BAR - OUTER SPACE 
Gef the Ravager is drunkenly drinking a mug of beer, when the arrow zips past him and through the mug, SHATTERING it. 
As Gef looks at the shattered mug, confused, the arrow comes flying back, ripping through Gef himself, FLINGING him off the bar stool. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
Rocket also uses the MONITORS to pinpoint where their attackers are. He methodically SHOOTS THROUGH the walls, striking the Ravagers as they get closer. 
WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT, the CAMERA REVOLVES as hoards of Ravagers GET CLOSE to Yondu and Rocket but the arrow and gunshots ZIP THROUGH THE WALLS taking them all down, one by one, like Busby Berkely gone mad. 
Then Yondu stops, seeing something on one of the MONITORS. 
Taserface, clutching a big ass gun, is marching down the hall towards them. 
Yondu WHISTLES, loudly and angrily. 
INTERCUT - INT. ENGINE ROOM/SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
Taserface sees THE ARROW COMING AROUND A CORNER TOWARDS HIM. 
Yondu WHISTLES again. 
The ARROW BURSTS INTO FLAMES. 
Taserface DODGES it. 
He turns to watch it go, CACKLING pridefully over his agility. 
But his smile quickly dissipates. 
The arrow PLUNGES into a giant tank - which EXPLODES, ENGULFING HIM. 
EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE 
A huge portion of the giant spacecraft EXPLODES, leading to a domino effect of one part of the ship BURSTING after another. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
ROCKET is dumbfounded as he sees on the MONITORS the numerous EXPLOSIONS throughout the ship. 
ROCKET You maniac. The whole ship is gonna blow. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

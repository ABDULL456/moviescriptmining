JEAN-PIERRE Mon dieu! 
ALICE Emma! Jean-Pierre reacts to Alice's "Emma!" as she breaks away.

EMMA Alice, he doesn't understand. It's like a foreign language to him-- 
ALICE Actually, it's not. Let him bid.

CONTINUED: (2) The crowd gasps, stepping back to reveal Cordelia in the center of the ballroom, backed by all the police, just as Meg .and Bernard enter, skidding short when they see the crowd. 
MEG Oh, shhhh-- 
EMMA Merde. Richard, Jean-Pierre, Penelope, and Domenico all swing between the two "Cordelias," as Meg makes her way forward with Bernard. 
CORDELIA Arrest those women! They are imposters! A wave of comment sweeps the confused crowd. 
PENELOPE Wait! Penelope steps up onto the platform, shielding Emma and Alice as the police come forward and Meg climbs up. 
PENELOPE (CONT'D) These are not imposters! These are my friends! 
CORDELIA Penelope Pignose?! 
PENELOPE And, you were never anyone's friend. Alice takes in the escalating situation, steps bravely forward to the front of the stage. 
ALICE It's true! A ripple of exclamation sweeps the dumbfounded crowd. 
ALICE (CONT'D) We're not who we said we were. We're... We're only high school teachers. From Racine, Wisconsin.

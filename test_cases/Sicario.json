{"train": "SICARIO \nWritten by \nTaylor Sheridan \nA MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO. \nHe rises his face to the sun. \nALEJANDRO(V.O.) I think about the price. The price of appetite. The cost of forgetting who we are. Pretending we are... who we will never be... \nHe looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in sunshine. \nALEJANDRO (V.O.) So easy to pretend we are not to blame. That a demon enters us. No... The demon is inside. We just make potions that release it. \nThe muscles of his neck tense. \nALEJANDRO (V.O.) There's no revenge for all they have taken. No justice. It simply is... \nHis lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down. \nALEJANDRO (V.O.) And still. They must be forced to look at all they have destroyed. By having the same done to them. Or they will forget... Forget they are human. Believe they are as different as they feel... Then they are the lion, and everything we loved and lost, simply its meal. \nWe hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not to drown. \nOnly now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the water. \nHe lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him back under. Looks out. Lost in thought. \nWe watch from the beach as Alejandro stands in the ocean to his belly, the sun high overhead. \nCUT TO: \nYESTERDAY. \n-- FRAME IS FILLED WITH A BLUE EYE, AS BLUE AS THE OCEAN -- \nThe eye blinks, and we can almost feel a breeze -- we are that close. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (Whispered) Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come... \nA VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The eye disappears in it's wake. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. \nTWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up. CAMERA is so close to the woman's face, it almost touches her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting... \nWe are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of a crumbling house. \nThey all rise and leap from the vehicle. \nEXT. TRACT HOUSE -- PHOENIX -- DAY. \nWE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY. \nMACY Give us this day... our daily bread... \nThey reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls like a drawbridge. \nMACY (CONT'D) And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. \nShe speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she has to kill anyone, or be killed herself. \nMACY (CONT'D) And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil... \nSWAT officers rush in, screaming. \nMacy's turn: She runs through the busted door- \nINT. TRACT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS. \nIn the hallway now. The chaos is closer. She hurries the words. So close now... \nMACY (CONT'D) For Thine is the Kingdom the power and glory forever and ever amen DOWN MOTHER FUCKER!! DOWN DOWN DOWN!!! \nTwo LATINO MEN, 20'S, are slammed to the ground. Another LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward. \nMacy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house, running past a bedroom with an open door. \nMACY No. \nJennings and Phil reach her. \nJENNINGS You okay? \nMACY I'm fine. \nMACY (CONT'D) Wanna give me the tour? \nShe doesn't but she will. \nINT. TRACT HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS. \nNo dry wall anywhere now: the walls have been stripped to the frame, exposing another DOZEN BODIES. CORONERS in protective suits remove them as DETECTIVES photograph the scene. The smell is atrocious. \nPHIL Looks like Sinaloa... \nJennings nods and sighs. \nJENNINGS Yeah. (To a coroner) How many total? \nCORONER Between here and the hall we have thirty, but there's more in the back bedroom and we haven't looked in the attic or under the crawl space. \nJENNINGS (To Phil) Call DOJ in Washington, let em know what we have. \nPhil nods, pulls his cell and steps away. \nJENNINGS (CONT'D) This one of the houses owned by Manuel Diaz? \nMACY No way to connect him, but he owns it. \nThe smell is getting to Reggie. Doesn't look like he's going to make it... \nMACY (CONT'D) Go ahead and step out, it's okay. \nDon't have to tell him twice. \nJennings walks to the wall. Studies the faces -- one in particular, tinted an ashy green from lye and months of decay -- his mouth open wide and eyes shut so tight that his brow is a tangle of wrinkles, as though he is suffering his death for eternity. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRACT HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT. \nWe see a GARAGE, and to it's left A STORAGE SHED. AN OFFICER yanks boxes and garbage from it, tossing it on the driveway. He reaches the floor, which is covered with rubber matts. He pulls one up and discovers a 3' X 3' piece of plywood hinged to the floor and locked. \nOFFICER I NEED BOLT CUTTERS. \nThey are brought over and the lock is cut. The officer kneels down. Lifts the hatch a little. Looks under, flashlight in hand... \n-- WE ARE UNDERNEATH THE PLYWOOD, FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES -- \nAs the hatch is lifted -- TWO HOOKS with wires are visible to our left and right. As the hatch is lifted, the wires pull tighter... We see where they lead: TWO GRENADES. \nINT. TRACT HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- CONT. \nJennings and Macy walk down the hall. Jennings stops at the body of the man Macy killed, then notices -- \nThrough a screen door at the end of the hall -- officers rushing toward the shed. \nJENNINGS PD found something. \nMacy and Jennings walk outside. As the sunlight hits them, the officer open the hatch, the wires pull tight and we hear a `clink'. \n-- THE GRENADES EXPLODE. TWO OFFICERS BLOWN TO OBLIVION -- \nDust, debris, smoke, and pieces of them roll toward Jennings and Macy like a wave, swallowing them. \nOur entire world is filled with a brown cloud and screams... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE -- DAY. \nWe see children splashing and playing in a large pool through enormous windows in MANUEL DIAZ'S living room. As we pull back, we hear the sounds of a NEWS REPORT. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Phoenix police have released no details, but there HAS BEEN an explosion at a house in South Phoenix. \nCAMERA PIVOTS and we are looking at a TV across a flawlessly decorated living room. Aerial footage of the tract house and obliterated storage plays. \nMACY I'm sure we'll be great friends, Mother. Nothing like a divorce to bring people closer. \nBeat. \nMOM You look tired. \nMACY I am... (forces a smile) Happy birthday. How does it feel to be \nMOM It would feel a lot better with a grandchild, and I don't think it's UNREAS-- \nMacy slams the laptop closed. She rubs her eyes... So tired. Her cell phone rings. She flips it open, angry -- \nMACY I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN. (It isn't mom) Yeah, umm... I can, I can be there in, say thirty minutes? Yes sir. \nHangs up. Day's not over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOMELAND SECURITY COMMAND CENTER -- PHOENIX -- NIGHT. \nMacy and Reggie sit in chairs against a glass wall. NEWS FOOTAGE of the blast plays on monitors along the wall of a command center filled with activity. \nIn the glass office behind them, a dozen men in suits. Jennings, in the same shape as Macy, has deflated into a chair, Phil sitting beside him. \nMacy turns and looks through the wall at the men. \nREGGIE Know what's going on? \nMACY No idea. \nJennings makes eye contact with Macy through the glass. For the first time, he seems old to her. \nAll these men look important, except one: MATT GRAVES, 40, golf shirt, bit of a belly, red, shaggy hair -- looks like a tourist. His demeanor is easy, you almost get the sense he's having fun. Macy turns around and rests her head against the glass. \nMACY (CONT'D) I need coffee. \nREGGIE We did this by the book, right? \nMACY Come on ... Of course. \nMacy lets out a heavy breath, looks back through the glass to find: every man in the room is STARING RIGHT AT HER. \nMACY (CONT'D) Jesus. \nREGGIE What?(Turns around) Oh shit. \nPhil walks toward them, pushes open the door. \nPHIL Would you step in here, Kate? \nShe rises and shares a look with Reggie. The door closes behind her. \nINT. GLASS OFFICE -- CONT. \nMatt smiles, friendly. A man in his 40's, military haircut, BURNETT, looks her over. \nBURNETT Quite a find today ... The loss of two officers not withstanding. \nShe says nothing. \nBURNETT (CONT'D) How familiar are you with Manuel Diaz's operation? \nMACY His company, Sun Valley, owns eighty or so foreclosure properties, another -- \nMATT What do you know about his brother? \nShe looks at Matt. \nMACY Um ... Wasn't aware he had one. \nMATT Guillermo... Mexican police are holding him in Juarez. What do you know about his cousin? \nBeat. \nMACY Didn't know he had one of those either. \nBURNETT His cousin is Fausto Alarcon. \nBeat. \nMATT He's a little green. You've been kicking doors longer. \nShe looks back at Reggie. \nMATT (CONT'D) Makes you feel better to have him around, he can tag along after we get back from El Paso. \nHe smiles. She takes this in. \nJENNINGS Kate. You must volunteer for an interagency task force... Think very hard before you respond ... You want to be a part of this? \nJennings' eyes beg her to say no. But the hunter in her is awake. She looks back at Reggie -- his eyes are full of concern... \nMACY We get an opportunity at the men responsible for today? \nMATT The men who are REALLY responsible. \nMACY Then yeah, sure. I'll volunteer. \nJennings looks at her. Nods. She is theirs now... \nCUT TO: \nINT. TINY HOUSE -- NOGALES, MEXICO -- DAY. \nMorning sun hits closed eyes. Dark, fat face. Beads of sweat on his brow and cheeks. Thick mustache. His name is SILVIO. \nA SHADOW falls over him. He feels it. Eyes pop open, tense. \nBOY'S VOICE Papa? \nA smile crosses Silvio's face. \nBOY'S VOICE (CONT'D) Despirtate. \nSILVIO No. \nSilvio closes his eyes. The little boy taps him on the chest. \nBOY'S VOICE Si. \nSilvio's smile grows. It is a game. \nSILVIO No. \nWe see the boy now. He is eight. Bright brown eyes. His name is ELISEO. \nSILVIO (CONT'D) SI!! Tengo un juego de futbol! \nSilvio acts surprised. \nSILVIO (CONT'D) Nooooo... \nThe boy laughs and grabs his father's hand, tugging. \nELISEO Si Papa! Tenemos que ir! \nThe boy pulls with all his might. Silvio makes a show of resisting, then climbs out of bed. Eliseo keeps a tight hold of his hand, and walks him down a hall to a small kitchen with adobe walls and a dirt floor. An opening leads to a small patio that now serves mostly as a chicken coop. Two chickens are in the kitchen. \nA woman stands over a stove, cooking. \nELISEO (CONT'D) Papa necessita cafe y juevos! Tenemos priso mama! \nShe turns and smiles at her son, the bright star in her black life. Her eyes pass over Silvio. She stopped loving him years ago, but he adores their little boy... At least they have that. \nHe sits down. She scoops eggs onto a plate with tortillas, drops it in front of him. Hands him a coffee. He sniffs it, hands it back. Without a word she pours in two fingers of tequila. \nThe boy stares at his father with endless joy. No idea how unlucky he is. \nSilvio stares back, winks. The boy smiles. \nEXT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- DAY. \nSilvio and Eliseo exit the house. Silvio wears a State Police uniform, dressed to intimidate. The boy wears his uniform, dressed to play soccer. They walk past cinder-block houses, one after the other, cracked and faded from the sun. \nTejano music, car horns, and distant yelling penetrate the morning. \nTwo ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS drive past. \nSilvio and Eliseo wander away, Eliseo's tiny hand clinging to Silvio's police belt. Eliseo has his father for the whole day and he isn't letting go. \nALEJANDRO If you are very lucky you never will. \nThe man walks away, turning back occasionally to see if he is truly free. \nAlejandro turns in another direction, spots THREE US MARINE HUMVEES, EIGHT MARINES BESIDE THEM. Matt stands in front. They walk toward each other. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) It is the Colonel. \nMATT We'll get to that... \nAlejandro looks over the Marines. \nALEJANDRO Why so many? \nMATT Don't want anything to happen to you on the way to the airport. \nALEJANDRO Where are we going? \nMATT To keep my promise. \nAlejandro's kind, hollow eyes almost show emotion. \nALEJANDRO What did they do? \nMATT Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto. And I'm going to turn you loose. \nAlejandro stands for a moment. The tiniest hint of a smile curls his lips. \nALEJANDRO Thank you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHEVY TAHOE -- DAY. \nReggie drives, Macy riding shotgun. Through the windshield, we see the entrance to LUKE AIR FORCE BASE approaching. \nREGGIE You're back tonight? \nMACY Yeah. I'll call you, let you know what time. \nREGGIE I don't understand why they don't want me there... \nShe deflects. \nMACY It's El Paso... Don't think you're missing much. \nREGGIE Well... you keep your eye on that doughy prick in the golf shirt... \nShe smiles. \nMACY I'm supposed to worry about you. \nREGGIE This isn't what we do, Kate. \nMACY We do what we need to do. \nEXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX --   DAY. \nReggie pulls to the guard post, hands over their ID's. An AIR FORCE MP takes them, compares ID's to a list. \nAIRPORT MP (To Reggie) You're not on here. \nREGGIE I know. What's she supposed to do? \nAIRPORT MP Walk. \nMacy opens the door and steps out. \nMACY I'll call you when we're heading back. \nShe walks around the front of the Tahoe and disappears with the MP into the guard house. \nEXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX -- DAY. \nMacy walks toward the runways, looking around, unsure where to go. \nMATT (O.S.) Kate. \nShe turns, sees Matt. \nMACY JESUS!! \nAlejandro looks straight ahead. \nMACY (CONT'D) You okay? \nDoesn't look at her. Sweat rolls down his face. \nALEJANDRO Yes. \nShe keeps looking at him. He turns to her. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) I'm fine. \nWe hear the pilot announce their initial descent into El Paso's FORT BLISS. Alejandro leans back in his seat. \nMACY So... This is your specialty. \nALEJANDRO Hmm? \nMACY He said the cartels in Mexico are your specialty. \nALEJANDRO Yes. \nMACY Anything I should know? \nALEJANDRO You are asking how a watch works. For now, only focus on knowing the time. \nAlejandro lays his head back. Closes his eyes. Macy mumbles to herself. \nMACY Okay... Yoda. \nEXT. FORT BLISS AIR STRIP -- EL PASO -- DAY. \nAlejandro, Macy, and Matt walk off the plane, blinded by the desert sun. \nA man in his late 30's, mustache, DEA AGENT STEVE FERSING, waves from inside a BLACK CHEVY TAHOE. They walk over and climb in. \nINT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONTINUOUS. \nSTEVE How you been? \nMATT Good. Trying to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Figi. \nSteve chuckles. \nSTEVE It's the damn terrorists. They're sinking all the tropical islands. \nMATT I figure a month or two there, I could get it worked out. \nSTEVE Hear there's a real drug problem at the Four Seasons there. You need any help looking into it... \nMATT Yeah, I'll keep you posted... who's going over today? \nSTEVE Marshals, DEA. Pulled a team for you. \nMATT I get all warm and fuzzy when you say `team'. \nSTEVE It's a crack bunch too. Just rotated back from Afghanistan. \nMATT Where's everybody linking up? \nSTEVE Army Intelligence Center. \nMacy listens intently, trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about. Alejandro looks out across the border. Alejandro seems different. He is somewhere else. Somewhere bad. \nEXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- EL PASO -- DAY. \nTWENTY FOOT WALLS surround the center. A GUARD POST in front of an enormous closed gate. \nThe Tahoe pulls up... A guard, dressed like he is on mission in Afghanistan, steps forward. \nGUARD ID's all around. Hey Steve. \nEven Steve hands his ID. The guard returns to the guard house with the IDs. Matt turns around and faces Macy. \nMATT Thought you were in the big time in Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad. \nThe guard returns with their IDs. \nMACY You're not American? \nALEJANDRO No. \nShe tries to make sense of that. \nMACY Who do you work for now? \nAlejandro smiles. \nALEJANDRO I go where I'm sent. \nMACY Where were you sent FROM? \nALEJANDRO Cartagena. \nMACY ... Colombia? \nAlejandro nods. \nMatt emerges from the other room carrying two M4 carbines and a Kevlar vest. Macy sees him and marches to him. \nMATT (Handing her the vest) See if this fits. \nMACY (Pointing toward Alejandro) Is he CIA? Are you? \nMATT Try it on. \nMACY Well? \nMATT He's a DOD advisor, just like me. \nShe doesn't budge, holds his gaze. \nMATT (CONT'D) Pay attention to Alejandro -- he says do something, do it. \nShe takes that as a `yes'. \nMACY I'm not authorized to -- \nMATT Fine. Stay here. \nShe shifts her weight. Hesitates... \nMATT (CONT'D) But you don't want to, do you? \nMACY I just wanna know what I'm getting INTO -- \nMATT You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you're not stopping anything in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men responsible? This is where we start. \nHe walks off. \nAfter a moment, she follows. \nEXT. CESAR CHAVEZ BORDER HIGHWAY -- EL PASO -- DAY. \nFIVE CHEVY TAHOES, sirens on the dashboard move through El Paso. \nWe watch from above as they cut their way through traffic... \nINT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONT. \nMacy sits in the back beside Alejandro. He holds a rifle between his legs, barrel pointed down. Macy notices his right hand -- his finger rests on the button that rolls down the window. \nMACY So how nervous should I be? \nThe DEA Agent riding shotgun turns back to her. \nAGENT Are you kidding? \nHe points out the window. \nAGENT (CONT'D) Over there? That's the beast. \nHe turns back, facing front. \nShe looks out the window to Juarez. It is so close, you could throw a frisbee into it. \nEXT. BORDER HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS. \nMacy lets out an endless sigh of relief. We are driving very fast now. \nMacy looks out the windshield, the hills of El Paso loom in the distance. \nALEJANDRO On the left. \nTwo streets over, as buildings whip by, we see a STATE POLICE VEHICLE even with us. \nIt disappears as buildings fill our view, then at the next block we see it again. We hear over the radio -- \nVOICE We have a spotter on the left everyone. Keep your eyes out for a strike vehicle. \nThe driver speaks into his radio. \nDRIVER Mexico holding a lane for us at the border? \nVOICE That's my understanding. We're trying to confirm... \nAs we race to the border, the state police vehicle has DISAPPEARED. \nWe come to the loop, the last exit before being fed into the twelve lanes leading only to the border crossing... \nWITH NO WAY OUT. \nAt the loop, the Mexican Federal Police vehicles peel off, leaving the convoy alone. At the border, US HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICERS can be seen standing with rifles, making a very public show of force. \nThere is no lane cleared for them, and just like that -- they are trapped in traffic. \nVOICE (CONT'D) Everyone stay in this lane. Our agents at the border are going to wave everyone through and get us over as quick as they can. \nThe agents at the border aren't even checking passports, just moving cars through in the lane where the convoy is trapped, but there are fifty cars ahead of them... \nAlejandro looks out his window and sees, two lanes over: \nFOUR MEN in an old Buick LeSabre. They are staring straight ahead. All drenched in sweat. \nAlejandro taps Macy, she scoots closer. \nALEJANDRO You have a service weapon? \nMACY Yes. \nALEJANDRO Get it out. \nShe unholsters her pistol. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Silver LeSabre. Two lanes over my \nAGENT Yep. \nHe takes the radio. \nAGENT (CONT'D) Silver LeSabre, two lanes right, 3 o'clock. \nVOICE One lane over right, 5 o'clock. Burgundy Expedition. \nVOICE2 Three lanes over right, 1 o'clock, green honda civic. \nMacy grips her pistol. \nMACY Okay... okay... \nThen Alejandro spots it. \nALEJANDRO Gun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o'clock, gun. \nThe flash suppressor of an AK 47 is peeking out in the back seat. A sweaty, young gunman holds the rifle between his legs. \nVOICE2 What are the rules here? \nVOICE We must be engaged to engage. \nVOICE2 Can we get out of this vehicle and set a perimeter? \nVOICE Stay in your vehicle. You can do what they do. If they get out you can get out. \nALEJANDRO (To Macy) watch the door handles. \nThe cars are beginning to move in the convoy's lane. Another fifteen seconds and they can leave this hell behind. \nShe points at Alejandro. \nHe lets her vent. Burning the unused adrenaline. \nMATT Hey. I told you to stay here... \nMACY I'm not qualified for this. I'm good at what I do, but I'm not a soldier. \nMATT Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in... \nMACY Don't put me in a situation where I have to break the law to stay alive. Don't do that to me. \nSteve walks up to Matt. \nSTEVE You wanna get cracking? \nMATT On that note, I think you better stay out here. \nMatt winks and walks in the building, leaving Macy alone in the motor pool. \nINT INTERROGATION ROOM    DAY \nA door opens and we find GUILLERMO, 45, fat, three day stubble, and very unhappy to be here. His hands are cuffed behind his back. A DEA AGENT holds a bottle of water that Guillermo sucks like an infant. \nMatt walks in. \nMATT (CONT'D) Giving him a belly full of water... you devil. \nMatt smiles, the agent smiles back. \nMatt sits in the only other chair in the room. \nMATT (CONT'D) Didn't think we'd get you here, did you? \nGUILLERMO NO HABLO- \nMATT I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him. \nThe door opens and Alejandro walks in, carrying two five gallon jugs of water. It takes Guillermo a minute, then horror washes over his face. \nGUILLERMO El Medellin. \nMATT Alejandro, he remembers you. \nNo expression on Alejandro's face. \nThe DEA Agent moves to the door. \nDEA AGENT I'm gonna step out. \nHe closes the door behind him. The red `record' button on the camera mounted in the corner goes out. We notice a DRAIN IN THE FLOOR. \nAlejandro walks toward Guillermo, stands across from him. Places a foot on his chest. Pushes... Hard... Guillermo sways back, like a chopped tree. He moves through frame in slow motion, falling out of frame. \nEXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DUSK. \nMacy leans against a car. Spots a guy with a cigarette. \nMACY Hey. Got another one of those? \nHe gives her one. Lights it. She draws in, coughs. \nMACY (CONT'D) Been a while. Thanks. \nDELTA (O.S.) Like fireworks? \nShe turns and sees a Delta operator. Holding a pair of BINOLULARS. \nDELTA (CONT'D) Come here. \nShe follows him. They walk to the back of the motor pool to a stairway that leads to the roof of the building. He goes up. She hesitates. \nDELTA (CONT'D) Up to you. \nShe takes the bait. Climbs up. \nThey sit on the edge of the roof, facing Juarez. He begins glassing the area. \nMACY Fireworks is code for something, I assume. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Certainly, you understand the value of that. \nREGGIE Alright... We're good. Just don't keep us in the dark. \nALEJANDRO There is only dark, my friend. \nReggie studies this strange, sad man. Looks at him with something between fear and mistrust. Macy just looks tired and mad. Matt takes them both in. \nMACY What happens when you find him? \nBut Alejandro is already walking back to the warehouse. \nMATT It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We'll find a ride. See you tomorrow. \nMatt turns and walks back. \nREGGIE I just drove a hundred fucking miles... \nMACY This is a blessing, trust me. I want to stop and get some cigarettes. \nREGGIE Got you smoking again... it was that bad? \nShe moves to the car. \nMACY Worse. \nReggie watches Matt walk back in the warehouse, trying desperately to play catch up. Wondering why no one, his partner included, will tell him anything... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHEVY TAHOE -- NIGHT. \nReggie drives down an empty interstate 19. Up ahead, he spots a TRUCK STOP. \nREGGIE Not that I think you should, but if you want cigarettes -- \nHe looks over -- she is sound asleep. He drives past the truck stop, tail lights fading into the desert... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- DAY. \nMacy lays in bed watching the blades of her ceiling fan in their endless revolution. She rises -- dressed in pajamas at last -- and heads to the kitchen. \nShe pours a cup of coffee, heads to her computer. Pulls up the CNN website, scrolls the news, nothing about a shoot-out on the border. \nGoes to the El Paso newspaper website. Nothing there either. She googles SHOOT OUT, JUAREZ... is bombarded with images. \nHer screen is flooded with photos: women naked, tortured, beaten. Breasts cut off, pinkish flesh exposed. \nBodies of men in ditches, dead in chairs, dead in cars... dead everywhere. But nothing of yesterday. The images invade her. Can't look anymore... \nShe digs up a cigarette, goes to her screen door, opens it and steps out, lights her smoke. \nShe sees Reggie pull up and park. She yells down to him. \nMACY What's up? \nREGGIE You're phone's off. \nMACY Yep. \nREGGIE We gotta go. Those spooks been calling me all morning. \nMACY Want some coffee? \nREGGIE We gotta go. \nMACY I have to get dressed. Come up. \nINT MACY'S APARTMENT    DAY \nReggie leans against the dining room table, cup of coffee in hand. Macy moves from her bathroom, slacks on and only an old, off white bra. He notices. Doesn't hide it. \nREGGIE Gotta get you a new bra, woman. \nMACY List of things I need is almost infinite. \nREGGIE Just saying. You gotta... some nice lacy something. \nMACY Are you getting this? \nREGGIE Yeah. I don't believe it, but I understand what they're saying. \nALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Can you mark the tunnel on here? \nHands him a pen. \nMIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) Sure. It's been a while. Three years. They made me dig for a month to cross. I snuck out one night and ran... They hide the entrance behind an old car. \nMATT Guillermo was telling the truth. \nAlejandro looks at Matt. \nALEJANDRO This is our way across. Right here.(Back to the migrants) Where do you live? \nMIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) East of the airport. \nMatt spoons the last of his slurpee. Turns to Macy. \nMATT How good is your Spanish? \nMACY Not great. \nREGGIE Mine is. How did you get all this? \nMatt smiles, spooning himself slurpee. \nMATT Power of persuasion. \nALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Know a Wells Fargo on Baseline? \nMIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) No cabron. We drive to Cave Creek for the bank. There is a Wells Fargo on Baseline, but it is a narco bank. The narcos hit you as you walk to it... Only the Salvadorans use it, cuz they don't know... the soldiers deposit narco money there. They will rob you cabron, to make up for what they skimmed. No, you have to bank up by the white cowboys, that is safest. \nALEJANDRO (Looks at Matt) Guillermo told the truth about everything. \nMATT We're gonna have a good day.(Points to the migrants) Let's send these guys home. \nMACY Border patrol's not down there. \nMATT Think they'd tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night's sleep and forget everything? \nALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Thank you ... don't cross again. Not for a long time. \nThe migrant looks down at a small card in his hand. The others have them as well. \nMIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) These green cards are good? \nALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Better than good, my friend. \nThe men get up casually and walk out, sipping their soft drinks. Matt looks at Macy. \nMATT Have friends at Phoenix SWAT? \nMACY Yeah, we use them for breeches when HRT is busy. \nMATT They any good? \nMACY Yeah... they get a lot of practice. \nHe nods. \nMATT Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don't you. Let's give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we? \nMACY (To Alejandro) What did you find out? \nHe lays a hand on her shoulder. The intimacy of the gesture surprises her. \nALEJANDRO We are close. \nCUT TO: \nWE ARE LOOKING THROUGH A TELEPHOTO LENS. \nWe watch a MAN, 20'S, BAGGY JEANS, WHITE T-SHIRT, sitting on the curb, fiddling with an IPhone. \nVOICE We taking him when he makes the grab? \nMATT (O.S.) When he comes out of the bank. We need the deposit receipt to seize the account. Let him do the assault... we hit him when he comes out. \nMACY What? \nMAN IN SUIT Know what this is? \nHe shows her a printout. \nMACY No. \nMAN IN SUIT It's a bank line of credit. You make payments over what you owe and it doesn't show as cash it shows as a negative loan balance... See that? \nHe points to the loan amount. \nMACY Oh my god. \nMacy walks out of the bank and straight to the van, Reggie right behind. \nShe looks bewildered and scared. She climbs in next to them. \nMACY (CONT'D) They just seized seventeen million dollars... I need that explained to me. Guillermo Diaz told you all that in an HOUR? \nMATT We knew where his accounts were, we just didn't know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It's a bogus bust, though. Can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money back in a few months... but a lot of heads will roll before then... \nMACY We can arrest Manuel for now. At least get him off the street. \nHeads off. \nMATT Don't you dare. \nShe turns back to them. \nALEJANDRO We need him to get called back to Mexico. That's the objective, Kate. \nMACY That makes NO sense... We can get him off the street! RIGHT NOW. If I can tie any of these payments to-- \nMATT You can't arrest him. \nBeat. \nMACY Watch me. \nShe marches back toward the bank. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FEDERAL BUILDING -- DIRECTOR JENNING'S OFFICE -- DAY. \nMacy and Reggie sit across from Jennings and Phil. Bob Fiske is there as well. \nJENNINGS US Attorney won't issue the warrant. I can't override-- \nMACY This is ridiculous. His guys are robbing people IN FRONT OF THE BANK... So we find out where his boss lives in Mexico. Big deal. I've seen the Mexican police in action and believe me -- \nJENNINGS Kate... what do you want? What would you like done here? \nMACY I would like to follow some semblance of procedure, and build a prosecutable case against -- \nJENNINGS We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year than in the two previous years combined. Are you feeling that on the street? You getting the `vibe' that we\"re winning? \nBeat. \nMACY No. \nJENNINGS Do you? \nREGGIE No... I don't. \nPHIL Advisors like Matt come in, stir the pot, cause these criminals to react and make mistakes. That's how we build cases against the individuals that actually make a difference in this fight. When they're nervous, when they stop trusting their crews, when they move their money... these are all opportunities to strike... that's the purpose of contractors like Matt. \nJENNINGS This isn't something I dreamed up myself, Kate. I don't have the authority to hire advisors or authorize joint agency missions. Or fly agents from air force bases, are you understanding me? These decisions are made far from here. By officials elected to office, not appointed to them... so if your fear is operating out of bounds I am telling you, you're not. The boundary has been moved. Got it? \nShe does. But that doesn't mean she likes it... \nCUT TO: \nINT MACY'S VEHICLE   LATE AFTERNOON \nMacy and Reggie drive in silence. Nowhere in particular... Just driving. \nMACY Where'd that guy say the safe banks were, Cave Creek? \nTed turns to the sound. Seems surprised to see Reggie. Walks over. He carries what looks like a gym bag. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) What do you got there man? \nTED I rode tonight. \nREGGIE A bull? No shit? \nTED Yeah. Were you watching? \nREGGIE For a minute, how'd you do? \nTED Tossed right out of the chute. (Sees Macy) Hi. \nShe smiles a bit. Shy even... \nREGGIE Sit down, man. \nTED Let me grab you guys some beers, what is that? \nREGGIE Anything, man. \nHe walks off. \nMACY Married? \nREGGIE All yours. In my basketball league. \nMACY Good guy? \nREGGIE He's great. Sergeant in vice. Divorced, couple kids I think... \nMacy watches him as he orders. The girl beside him, much younger and pretty, is chatting him... He's chatting back. She retreats into her shell, feeling foolish for thinking it would be that easy to meet someone... She clouds. Reggie notices. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) I'ma cock block that little blonde for you... gonna be a sacrifice... \nMACY Yeah... Thanks. \nReggie walks up to Ted and the girl, charms his way between and gabs them both. We see Macy, letting herself be hopeful... \nINT. BUFFALO CHIP -- LATER. \nReggie, the blonde, Ted, and Macy all sit together. Ted sits beside Macy -- the battle lines are drawn for the night -- she is his. He is showing them the cinch that goes around the bull's belly. \nTED You wrap this around and then- (he grabs Macy's arm) I'll demonstrate. \nHe wraps the nylon belt around her hand once, twice, three times... \nREGGIE I know where this is going -- \nMACY Don't discourage him. Know how long it's been since someone tied me up? \nTed and Macy share a charged look. She smiles. \nTED Don't give me any ideas. \nMACY I'm trying very hard to give you ideas. \nThe tension of it, the flirt of it, she looks ten years younger... Alive. They hold each other's eyes, almost like a dare... He's captivated by her. \nTED (softly) I want to take you outside. \nThere it is... Macy surrenders with a smile... \nMACY Okay. \nThey stand like school kids. \nTED Scuse us. We're just gonna... \nREGGIE Mmhmm. \nMACY Take a look around back. \nREGGIE Yeah. \nTED Watch my bag. \nWe watch them walk off through the club. \nReggie goes to her and hugs her as CAVE CREEK POLICE VEHICLES pull into the parking lot, sirens blazing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- NIGHT. \nEVERYONE IS HERE NOW. FBI. All of them. Ted is loaded into a car. \nMacy rests against a SQUAD CAR, smoking a cigarette, too exhausted to care that she looks like she just got fucked outside a bar. \nDirector Jennings walks up, leans against the car beside her. \nJENNINGS See what I mean? They try to react and make mistakes... you want a LITTLE -- \nMACY No. \nJENNINGS Then keep shaking the tree. Let's see what else falls. \nJennings stands. \nJENNINGS (CONT'D) Finding that photo and luring him out. That was smart. \nHis knowing smile says: our little secret. \nShe nods in appreciation. \nMACY Thank you, Dave. \nJENNINGS Thank you. Unlike most of the perps we see, Phoenix PD officers facing thirty years in prison have plenty to lose. We'll know whatever he knows very soon. \nJennings walks off. Macy pulls a long drag from the cigarette. She looks at it, and must accept the fact that she is once again a smoker... \nReggie walks up to her. He hands her a new pack. They look at each other. Try not to, but can't help it. They laugh... But when Macy's laughter risks turning to tears, she stops. \nREGGIE Thought all you white girls shaved. \nShe starts laughing again. \nMACY You saved my life. \nREGGIE Nah. Think he was meant to scare you, or test you, maybe... \nMACY Are they following us? \nREGGIE Don't know. They're gonna take your vehicle, look for a transmitter. Which would mean there's someone in our house involved too. (MORE) \nREGGIE (CONT'D) Maybe someone tailed us from the bank... I don't know. \nThe not knowing scares her. \nMACY Thank you. I mean it. \nHe accepts it with a nod. \nMACY (CONT'D) Where is he now? \nREGGIE Backseat of your car. With our shadows. \nTakes that in. \nMACY I hope they kill him. \nREGGIE You don't mean that. \nMACY ... No. \nThey lean against the car in silence. \nINT. MACY'S VEHICLE -- CONT. \nTed sits in the backseat, face destroyed. The reality of his situation now fully in front of him. Matt sits in the front seat, Alejandro beside him. \nTED Okay. Okay. Okay... \nMATT You said that Ted. \nTED Look... I. I. I was asked what her CASE INVOLVED- \nAs quick as a cat, Alejandro stabs his thumb into Ted's eye. Ted pitches forward. \nHe steps away. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow they will call Manuel back, and we will cut a leg from them. \nHe walks back toward Matt, leaving Macy staring out across the desert. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY. \nSilvio sleeps. A shadow crosses his face. He opens an eye. Eliseo stands there holding coffee and a plate of eggs and tortillas. \nSILVIO Juevos? \nELISEO Si papa. \nSILVIO Con jalapenos? \nELISEO Si. \nSilvio sits up. Takes the coffee, drinks. No booze in it. Thinks about sending it back, but the look on Eliseo's face makes him reconsider. He'll get drunk soon enough. He takes the plate and feeds. \nEliseo sits on the bed. \nELISEO (CONT'D) Trabajando hoy? \nSILVIO En la noche. \nELISEO Quere jugar baseball? En el parque? \nThe man chews. Thinks. Exaggerates his expressions. \nSILVIO Hmmmm ... baseball. \nThe boy laughs. \nELISEO BASEBALL!!! Si. \nSILVIO Okay. \nThe boy shoots off like a rocket. Silvio laughs. As he eats, we see the AK 47 by the bed. A bag of coke and a thousand or so dollars on the night stand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEST WESTERN -- SCOTTSDALE -- DAY. \nMacy and Reggie pull in and park next to five US GOVERNMENT SUBURBANS. They get out and walk past them. \nThey get to the room and knock. \nINT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT. \nMatt lets them in. He wears desert camo fatigues, as do most of the people in the room. There are computers linked to monitors. One displays footage of MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE and OFFICE. Another is footage of the DESERT. But that footage is MOVING. \nMATT We may have the tunnel, right here. \nWe look at the footage. Cactus and desert grass in the foreground. In the background, a ravine. \nMATT (CONT'D) We'll know soon enough. \nEXT. DESERT -- CONTINUOUS. \nWe look at cactus and brush along a ridge. Slowly, caterpillar slow, the brush begins moving. We can just make out an enormous telephoto lens wrapped in camouflage tape. \nINT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT. \nMatt points to coolers filled with Gatorade and Red Bull. \nMATT (CONT'D) Tasty beverage? \nThis guy ... \nMACY What's the plan? \nMATT (Easy smile) Going hunting. \nThere is a DOD AGENT wearing headphones and sitting in front of what looks like a sound board linked to a computer. \nFrom the other room, DELTA and one of his team members walk through. Moving toward the TOPO MAP on the wall. \nThey hear more gunfire. Screw it. Silvio's not waiting around any longer. He gets in the driver's seat. \nBANDIT Traiga me contigo!!! \nSILVIO No cabron! \nThe man opens the passenger door as Silvio starts the squad car. A bullet penetrates the bandit's face, just under the eye. He drops as if he's been unplugged. \nSilvio ducks down, throwing the car in reverse, but a hand reaches in the window, and turns the car off. Silvio looks up and sees -- \nAlejandro. \nHE pulls Silvio from the car. Spins him around. Pulls the pistol from Silvio's belt. Tosses it on the ground. \nSilvio stares at Alejandro in absolute terror. \nSILVIO (CONT'D) El Medellin. \nAlejandro places his pistol to Silvio's face. \nSILVIO (CONT'D) No me mata!! \nAlejandro jams his thumb in Silvio's larynx. Silvio gasps for air. Alejandro grabs his hair, pistol to his head. \nALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) What you do now is for your family. Whether they see tomorrow rests with you. \nTears roll down Silvio's cheek. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) You will drive me. \nMACY (O.S.) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? \nAlejandro turns and sees Macy, her rifle trained on him. \nALEJANDRO Put that down. \nMACY STEP AWAY. I mean it. Move away from him. \nHe looks at her. \nThe automatic fire from different tunnel shafts rushes in and out like blasts of hot air. \nALEJANDRO We are in Mexico now. You have no jurisdiction. \nMACY We can't be here-- \nAlejandro raises his pistol and fires six rounds into Macy's chest. \nShe collapses to the ground, sucking for air. Alejandro walks over and grabs her rifle. Tosses it in the back of the Police car. \nALEJANDRO Don't ever point a weapon at me again. Get your breath and go back to the surface. \nShe gasps, clasping at the Kevlar vest that saved her life. She rolls onto her stomach and struggles to stand. Reaches for her pistol. Alejandro slams her face into his knee. Tosses her pistol across the room. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Stop it Kate. Just stop. This is what we were sent here to do. \nHe pulls her to her feet. Points his pistol at her. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) I don't have time. Go to the surface. Now. \nBlood pours from her shattered nose. She has lost and she knows it. \nMACY You lured Manuel to Mexico so you could kill him. This is your cab driver. \nALEJANDRO I am here to kill the man with the power to summon Manuel Diaz. I am here for Fausto. But I will kill Manuel too. It's what I do, Kate. Go. Or I will do it to you. \nShe stumbles back, turns around and runs. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) (Turning the gun on Sylvio) Get in. \nAlejandro gets in the back seat of the police car. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Drive back to Mexico. \nThe car backs up, spins and drives the tunnel road until we ARE: \nEXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- NIGHT. \nWe are in the backseat, looking through the windshield. \nMACY I'll manage. \nShe walks out of the tunnel toward Reggie. DELTA removes his boot and walks away. \nMACY (CONT'D) Let's go. \nHelicopters can be heard. In the distance, sirens are approaching. \nMacy and Reggie walk away from the scene. \nREGGIE What just happened? \nMACY They woke me up. Showed me the whole thing. \nREGGIE And? \nMACY And I quit. \nThey continue to walk, sirens racing toward them. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR NIGHT \nFar ahead, we see TAIL LIGHTS. Silvio's labored breathing gives rhythm to the racing vehicle. Alejandro stays low in the back seat. \nALEJANDRO (Into mouthpiece) This is the target ahead? Confirm. \nVOICE Copy. Black Range Rover, 60 meters ahead. \nALEJANDRO Put on your lights. Pull the car over. \nHe flips on his siren. \nINT. MANUEL'S RANGE ROVER -- CONT. \nHe sees the siren. \nMANUEL What the fuck. Want to bribe me, eh. \nHe reaches for his pistol, puts it in his lap. \nINT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR -- CONT. \nThe range Rover pulls over. Us right behind it. Silvio is breathing even heavier, if that's possible. So many ways this can go wrong... \nALEJANDRO Use the speaker. Tell him to get out of the car. \nSilvio grabs the radio handset, flips the switch, and his voice comes through the speaker on the roof of the car. \nSILVIO Afuera del carro!! \nINT. RANGE ROVER -- CONT. \nMANUEL This mother fucker... \nHe sticks the pistol in his waistband. Opens the car door. Steps out. \nINT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR -- CONT. \nWe watch Manuel through the windshield. He is standing in the road. \nALEJANDRO Tell him to raise his shirt and turn around. \nSILVIO Levanta su camisa. \nMANUEL You know who I am? HUH?? \nALEJANDRO Tell him to do it or you will shoot him where he stands. \nSILVIO Voy a matarse cabron. Levanta tu camisa. \nManuel does it. We see the pistol. \nSILVIO (CONT'D) Tira la pistola en la tierra. \nManuel throws his pistol in the dirt. \nALEJANDRO Look how good you are at pretending to be a police officer. Out of the car. Now. \n", "test1_input": "They climb in. Reggie looks over at Macy staring out the window, resting her heavy head on her fist. He looks back at Matt and Alejandro, both already asleep. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PROCESSING CENTER -- TUSCON -- NIGHT. \nThe team walks from their parked car toward an irate BOB FISKE, 40'S, walking toward them. \nBOB What's the deal, Matt? Why you holding up my transports? \nMATT We'll be quick. \nBOB I have to feed these bastards when we hold em. Know how an internal auditor responds to an eight thousand dollar check to fucking Domino's Pizza? \nMATT You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call. \nDoesn't introduce Alejandro and Bob doesn't ask- Kate notices. \nMACY I don't even know what we're doing here. (Pointing to his cigarette) Got another one of those? \nBOB Finish it before we get inside. \nHe gives her one, lights her as they walk. The giant, domed warehouse growing closer. The dull murmur of four hundred people talking and sitting and moving and complaining is wafting out like an odor. \nMacy tries to suck the entire cigarette in one drag. Reggie leans into her. \nREGGIE What happened in El Paso? Talk to me. \nMACY We weren't in El Paso. \nREGGIE ... Where were you? \nMACY We were in Mexico. \nReggie stops. Macy doesn't. She reaches the door and flicks the smoke on the ground. \nINT. IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS. \nThe illegals have been separated by sex and criminal record. \nWomen on the left... The worker bees -- the busboys and landscapers and construction workers -- are in the center, and in the back, lined up against the wall, the felons... \nThree dozen HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS   stand over them with M4s. \nBOB There you go. I'm starting the buses. When you're done with em, send em out. \nALEJANDRO All the women can go. \nBOB Coulda told me that on the phone, Matt. \nMATT First I've heard it. \nThey head toward the group of felons and the like as the women are moved out to the buses. \nALEJANDRO Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez. \nMacy looks at him. His kind, sad demeanor seems to settle her. She knows he is offering her something, just doesn't know why. She turns to the men against the wall. They have their hands behind their backs, zip tied. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Do you see? \nShe scans their faces. Many have tattoos, shaved heads. A boy, maybe 18, haircut like a pop star from the 90's. Diamond earrings, stares hard at her. \nMACY Him. \nAlejandro nods. \nALEJANDRO Yes. Keep looking. \nShe studies more faces. The ones that look like American gangsters- they look down, away, no eye contact. But the ones with mustaches no longer in style, hair parted down the middle, the lanky teens with Polo shirts, they stare defiantly. No fear of consequence from American officers. As subtle as the differences are- how they wear their pants, how they lean against the wall... she understands now. \nMACY Yeah. I see it. \nShe turns to Alejandro, but he is gone. She turns around and he stands thirty feet back beside Matt, looking over the migrants. \nMacy walks back to them. \nMACY (CONT'D) What are we looking for? \nMATT Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid. \n", "test1_true": "ALEJANDRO They see it all, and must avoid the traps set everywhere for them. We look for one who is older... one who has had enough. \nBob walks up. \nBOB You done with these behind you? \nMATT All yours. \nThe Agents begin yelling and marching the smuggler group out. Alejandro turns to Bob. \nALEJANDRO Break them into groups of four, Let them spread out, each group as far from the other as possible. \nBob huddles his agents and begins explaining as Matt and Alejandro walk off. \nWe see Reggie, observing from the entrance. He's had enough `not knowing', walks to Macy. \nREGGIE What are we doing here?(Looks her over) What were you doing in Mexico?? \nMACY I'm with you, alright. I don't have answers. \nREGGIE Well, let's get some then. \nShe looks at him. \nMACY You think I haven't asked these questions. Think you can do better? MATT. Can we talk to you for a minute? \nHe starts walking toward them. They head for the open warehouse door. \nEXT IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE     CONT. \nMacy and Reggie stop in the center of the parking lot. Matt catches up to them. \nMATT This feels very serious. \nREGGIE What are we looking for? There's in the dark and then there's the way you're treating us. I want to know the objective, or I walk. Period. \nMATT Then go. I didn't ask you to be a part of this. She did. \nMACY I walk too. \nReggie stares at Matt, who casually smiles, pacifying the children. \nMATT What would you like to know? \nREGGIE Everything. \nMATT Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So now, we're trying to find what areas near there migrants avoid. Because that's where the tunnel will be. Better? \nREGGIE Guillermo is...? \nMatt laughs. \nMATT I'm going back in. \nHe turns. \nMACY He TOLD you where a drug tunnel is... Just... Told you. \nMATT Guillermo didn't have any other options. We send him back across the border and he's a dead man. Had to give us something. \nHe just smiles... \nMACY Bullshit. \nREGGIE Look man, we have a boss, and you ain't him. Be straight. What are you doing? \nMATT We're going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss. \nREGGIE And then? \nMATT And then we know where his boss is. \nALEJANDRO (O.S.) Fausto Alarcon, Manuel's cousin... Manuel's boss... He is an executioner... \nAlejandro stands beside them, but looks out over the black desert. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) When people die in my country, it is with his hand or his blessing. To find him would be like... discovering a vaccine. Manuel will lead us to him. \nHis kind, hollow eyes meet Reggie's. Alejandro manufactures a smile. \n", "test1_id": 1623, "test2_input": "Silvio sits in his little courtyard, watching the chickens. He tosses a handful of feed and they scamper after it.

Matt turns toward us. \nMATT On foot from here. \nEXT. TRANSPORT VEHICLE -- CONT. \nMacy steps out and sees another vehicle parked. Another half dozen men in full camo. From the back of the Suburban, six duffel bags are opened. Operators reach in and grab weapons, magazines, grenades. Generation 4 night vision goggles are passed to everyone.

Stay in the back and don't shoot anyone on my fucking team, got it? \nDoesn't wait for a reply. \nREGGIE We HAVE done this before. \nMACY I don't think we've done THIS. \nThey move out.

Processes what was just said. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Yes ... Choose. \nFausto looks at Jacinta. Her eyes say, \"Goodbye my brave love\"... Never dawns on her what he's thinking. \nFAUSTO I take shame. \nShe's stunned. Tears run her heavy make up. She looks to Alejandro. No mercy there. Back to her husband. \nFAUSTO (CONT'D) I love me more. I'm sorry. \nHe isn't. It wasn't a hard decision. She turns to Alejandro. Holds her chin high in defiance. \nJACINTA Do it. You fuck. Chinga tu madre PUNTA CABRON ANDALE PUES!!! \nAlejandro looks at Fausto. \nALEJANDRO See why you married her. Spunk. \nAlejandro looks into Fausto's uncaring eyes. \nAlejandro fires into Fausto's belly. Touches the barrel to his arm, fires again. Fausto screams. Alejandro presses the barrel to Fausto's throat, fires again. Fausto falls to the floor, gargling. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Watch death come for you. Watch. The devil is near, Fausto. He is waiting for you. \nFausto's terrified eyes stare back at Alejandro as he gasps for air. Drowning in his own blood. There is no specific moment when death comes. He simply fades. Alejandro sits back down. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) This is what they think of you. You see? \nShe stares at him, shaking so profusely you might think she is freezing to death. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Maybe you have enough pride that you don't marry another one of these. Maybe you take his money and go hide and raise your children far from here. Maybe your son grows up to be a doctor. And I don't have to come back and kill him some day. \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY. \nA shadow falls over an empty bed. Eliseo stands there... this has never happened before. He walks down the hall to the kitchen. His mother is in the same place, cooking. But the look in her eyes is anger. She knows he is dead. And may God damn him for making her be the one to tell their son. \nHe stands there. Staring at his mother. \nELISEO Mama? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- DAY. \nDressed in jeans and a t-shirt, she sits on the balcony, takes a drag of her cigarette. Looks at it. \nMACY Three days ago I hadn't had you in ten years... fucker. \nShe leans back and looks out over Phoenix as the sun sets. She exhales ... looks at the cigarette. \nMACY (CONT'D) (Half joking) You're the only one who understands me. \nALEJANDRO (O.S.) I think maybe, it will be the thing that kills us all ... as a people, you know? \nMacy leaps up as if she's on fire, falls over her chair, comes up with her pistol. He moves so fast there is no time to react. \nIn an instant, he has the gun and removes the magazine, disassembles the slide, and tosses the pieces on the table. She screams and rushes him. He spins her and pushes her back. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Stop it. \nHe moves to her and gently touches her face, looking at the gash on her nose. She is frozen in fear. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) That will scar. I'm sorry. \nShe breathes heavy, trying to remain calm. \nHe begins lifting her shirt. She struggles and he grabs her throat. She looks into his eyes and it is a killer looking back. \nMACY Please. \nALEJANDRO Let me look ... Move your hand. \nShe surrenders, turns her head to the side. He lifts her shirt above her bare breasts. Six large, red welts... \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) These ribs are bruised, but not broken, yes? \nShe nods as her lip quivers. Clinging desperately to her dignity. She has never felt so powerless, and that is his point. \nHe drops her shirt and steps back. She crosses her arms, feeling very weak. \nAlejandro sits across from her. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) I would recommend not standing on balconies for a little while. \nShe doesn't move. \nMACY You're an assassin. \nBeat. \nALEJANDRO In Mexico, the killers are called Sicarios... The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland... They don't deserve the term. \nMACY You are a Sicario. \nALEJANDRO Policing them does nothing. They must be killed. Wherever they are found. They will make every place they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you understand how far we have fallen. \nHe studies her-- arms crossed, legs close together. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) You look like a girl when you're scared. Such beauty in you when you let yourself be frail. Like the daughter they took from me ... This is not the work for you. Look at yourself, Kate. What it has done to you in just three days ... Find a little town far from the border. A place where the rule of law still exists. You will spot predators there very easy now... Make a difference you can see everyday. Because you will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now. \nHe looks at her. Smiles sadly and leaves. \nShe waits. Starts to cry, fights it back. Begins frantically reassembling the pistol. Rams the magazine in and racks a round. Comes around the corner. Enters the house. Looks around. Checks every room, panting, shaking. He is gone. She stands there and sobs... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NOGALES STREET -- DAY. \nThe mother walks with Eliseo, dressed for soccer. Down the empty street. Sirens in the distance. \n", "test3_id": 1625}

How does it feel to be \nMOM It would feel a lot better with a grandchild, and I don't think it's UNREAS-- \nMacy slams the laptop closed. She rubs her eyes... So tired. Her cell phone rings. She flips it open, angry -- \nMACY I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN. (It isn't mom) Yeah, umm... I can, I can be there in, say thirty minutes? Yes sir. \nHangs up. Day's not over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOMELAND SECURITY COMMAND CENTER -- PHOENIX -- NIGHT. \nMacy and Reggie sit in chairs against a glass wall. NEWS FOOTAGE of the blast plays on monitors along the wall of a command center filled with activity. \nIn the glass office behind them, a dozen men in suits. Jennings, in the same shape as Macy, has deflated into a chair, Phil sitting beside him. \nMacy turns and looks through the wall at the men. \nREGGIE Know what's going on? \nMACY No idea. \nJennings makes eye contact with Macy through the glass. For the first time, he seems old to her. \nAll these men look important, except one: MATT GRAVES, 40, golf shirt, bit of a belly, red, shaggy hair -- looks like a tourist. His demeanor is easy, you almost get the sense he's having fun. Macy turns around and rests her head against the glass. \nMACY (CONT'D) I need coffee. \nREGGIE We did this by the book, right? \nMACY Come on ... Of course. \nMacy lets out a heavy breath, looks back through the glass to find: every man in the room is STARING RIGHT AT HER. \nMACY (CONT'D) Jesus. \nREGGIE What?(Turns around) Oh shit. \nPhil walks toward them, pushes open the door. \nPHIL Would you step in here, Kate? \nShe rises and shares a look with Reggie. The door closes behind her. \nINT. GLASS OFFICE -- CONT. \nMatt smiles, friendly. A man in his 40's, military haircut, BURNETT, looks her over. \nBURNETT Quite a find today ... The loss of two officers not withstanding. \nShe says nothing. \nBURNETT (CONT'D) How familiar are you with Manuel Diaz's operation? \nMACY His company, Sun Valley, owns eighty or so foreclosure properties, another -- \nMATT What do you know about his brother? \nShe looks at Matt. \nMACY Um ... Wasn't aware he had one. \nMATT Guillermo... Mexican police are holding him in Juarez. What do you know about his cousin? \nBeat. \nMACY Didn't know he had one of those either. \nBURNETT His cousin is Fausto Alarcon. \nBeat. \n", "test1_true": "MATT Number three in the Sinaloa Cartel. \nBURNETT Manuel Diaz is likely their most senior member in the United States. \nMacy feels woefully unprepared for an inquisition. \nMACY None of this is in his file. \nBURNETT With good reason. \nMATT Loose lips sink ships, Kate. \nMACY I'm not -- \nJENNINGS Agent Macy doesn't work narcotics, she runs a kidnapping response team. \nMATT You married? \nMACY I'm sorry? \nMATT Husband? \nWho the fuck is this clown in the golf shirt? \nMACY Divorced. \nMATT Kids? \nMACY No. He works for Border Patrol and got to keep the condo and my Bronco, anything else? \nMatt smiles. Phil stands up. \nPHIL Thank you Kate, if you could wait outside, please. \nShe stands there for a beat, utterly confused, then leaves. \nShe sits back down next to Reggie. \nREGGIE ... Well? \nMACY I have no clue. \nWe watch the men speaking through the glass, then they all file out of the office except Jennings and Matt. Phil stands at the door. \nPHIL Will you come in, Kate? \nShe walks in and stands across from Jennings. \nJENNINGS DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz. This is Matt Graves. He'll be LEADING -- \nMACY He'll be leading who? This is Phoenix Homicide now. \nMATT We're expanding the scope of the investigation. \nPHIL You'll act as a liaison. \nMACY What does that mean? \nPHIL State Department is pulling an agent from the field that specializes in responding to escalated cartel activity. You'll meet up with them...(To Matt) at Luke, Tomorrow? \nMATT Day after. Early. \nMACY Luke ... Air Force base? \nMATT Gonna go see Guillermo. \nMACY His brother. \nMATT That's the one. \nMatt smiles, like they're discussing renovating a kitchen. \nMACY Okay... If I, umm... What's our objective? \nMATT Our objective is to dramatically overreact. \nBeat. \nMACY Why isn't Reggie in here? \n", "test1_id": 1623, "test2_input": "Ted turns to the sound. Seems surprised to see Reggie. Walks over. He carries what looks like a gym bag. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) What do you got there man? \nTED I rode tonight. \nREGGIE A bull? No shit? \nTED Yeah. Were you watching? \nREGGIE For a minute, how'd you do? \nTED Tossed right out of the chute. (Sees Macy) Hi. \nShe smiles a bit. Shy even... \nREGGIE Sit down, man. \nTED Let me grab you guys some beers, what is that? \nREGGIE Anything, man. \nHe walks off. \nMACY Married? \nREGGIE All yours. In my basketball league. \nMACY Good guy? \nREGGIE He's great. Sergeant in vice. Divorced, couple kids I think... \nMacy watches him as he orders. The girl beside him, much younger and pretty, is chatting him... He's chatting back. She retreats into her shell, feeling foolish for thinking it would be that easy to meet someone... She clouds. Reggie notices. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) I'ma cock block that little blonde for you... gonna be a sacrifice... \nMACY Yeah... Thanks. \nReggie walks up to Ted and the girl, charms his way between and gabs them both. We see Macy, letting herself be hopeful... \nINT. BUFFALO CHIP -- LATER. \nReggie, the blonde, Ted, and Macy all sit together. Ted sits beside Macy -- the battle lines are drawn for the night -- she is his. He is showing them the cinch that goes around the bull's belly. \nTED You wrap this around and then- (he grabs Macy's arm) I'll demonstrate. \nHe wraps the nylon belt around her hand once, twice, three times... \nREGGIE I know where this is going -- \nMACY Don't discourage him. Know how long it's been since someone tied me up? \nTed and Macy share a charged look. She smiles. \nTED Don't give me any ideas. \nMACY I'm trying very hard to give you ideas. \nThe tension of it, the flirt of it, she looks ten years younger... Alive. They hold each other's eyes, almost like a dare... He's captivated by her. \nTED (softly) I want to take you outside. \nThere it is... Macy surrenders with a smile... \nMACY Okay. \nThey stand like school kids. \nTED Scuse us. We're just gonna... \nREGGIE Mmhmm. \nMACY Take a look around back. \nREGGIE Yeah. \nTED Watch my bag. \nWe watch them walk off through the club. \n", "test2_true": "We are looking at the sheet metal outer wall of the saloon. Macy's head comes hard into frame, Ted's right after. They devour each other. \nShe tears at the snaps of his shirt, runs her hand along his chest, grabbing a handful of chest hair and pulling. \nHe tears frantically at her pants. Gets them unbuttoned and slips his hand inside. Her head flies back in ecstacy. \nMACY What am I -- Uhh. \nWith one hand she attacks his belt and pulls at the zipper of his jeans. She reaches into his jeans. His turn to moan... \nINT. BUFFALO CHIP -- CONT. \nReggie has the cinch and is toying with the blonde girl. \nREGGIE See you can also... let me show you... \nShe laughs at his attempt to do the wrap Ted did. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) Fuck it.( He pulls out his handcuffs) We'll just use these. \nShe loses herself in laughter. \nGIRL Okay... (she motions to Ted's bag) Anything else fun in there? \nREGGIE Let's see... \nShows her Ted's hand cuffs. \nGIRL Did you two plan this?? \nHe laughs, then spots something else. At the bottom of the bag, he sees it -- \nA computer print out of a photo from the Wells Fargo security camera... A PHOTO OF MACY. \nEverything about Reggie changes. \nREGGIE Got a cell phone? \nGIRL Yeah... What? \nREGGIE Call 911. Right fucking now, call \nPuts his badge on the table. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) Tell them I said so. Read them the badge number. \nAnd Reggie is gone. The girl starts dialing. \nEXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- CONT. \nMACY'S back is against the Sheet metal, Ted pressed against her. Bare legs wrapped around him. He thrusts deep inside her. \nIt is rapid, almost angry. She needs this. Release is coming, she moans freely now, she's so close-- \nWe see something moving toward them in a blur. \nReggie's fist slams the side of Ted's face. It knocks him out of frame, exposing Macy completely naked below the waist, legs spread wide against the wall. \nShe panics, reaching down to pull up her pants and falls over as Reggie jumps on Ted, beating him senseless. \nREGGIE (CONT'D) MOTHER FUCKER!!! MOTHER FUUUCCCKKKERRRR!!! \nTed is helpless, curled into a fetal position, face broken and bleeding. \nMACY What are you doing??? \nSirens can be heard. Reggie has Ted cuffed now and is frisking him. Knife in his boot. Pistol in the other boot. \nREGGIE He was sent here. There's surveillance photos of you IN HIS BAG!!! He works for the fucking cartel. \nShe leans against the wall, still flushed and breathing heavy, so close to orgasm, now the farthest thing from it. \nTED Reggie... pull up my pants for me? \nREGGIE FUCK YOU. \nTED You got it wrong... nothing was gonna happen... wasn't... Didn't even know she-- \nReggie kicks him quiet. Macy starts to do something she hasn't done in a decade. She's fighting it, but sex brought so much emotion with it. And now -- no release.

A woman in her 60's cooks in the kitchen. \nJACINTA RAPIDO, MAMA!, tengo hambre! \nAlejandro walks into the room, presses his foot against Jacinta's side, and launches her out of frame, then sits next to Fausto, presses the gun to his shoulder and fires. The children scream. Mama turns, Alejandro points the gun at her. \nALEJANDRO SIENTATE! AQUI!! \nShe comes around and sits as ordered. \nJacinta stands up. \nFAUSTO (SUBTITLE) He'll kill you. Stay still. \nALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Your children speak English? \nFAUSTO No. \nALEJANDRO Then we will spare them. I interrupted dinner. Please... Continue. \nFausto stares at him. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Every night, you have families killed, and yet you dine. Tonight should be no different. \nPoints the pistol at him. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Eat. \nHe slowly fills a fork, puts it in his mouth. Tells his children to do the same. They chew their meal and cry. Alejandro turns to the old woman. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Take the children away from here. \nShe rises and hurries the children out of the dining area. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) (Points the gun at Jacinta) You. Whore. Sit over there. \nShe sits. Alejandro turns to Fausto, notices he has stopped eating. Picks up a fork and stabs it into Fausto's hand. Fausto screams. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) You're not finished. Eat... \nFausto forces down another bite, rests his trembling hand on the table. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) I will give you a choice, Fausto, one I was not given... You may choose to die tonight or live with the shame of having the mother of your children take your place... \nHe looks at Fausto. Fausto stops chewing. Processes what was just said. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Yes ... Choose. \nFausto looks at Jacinta. Her eyes say, \"Goodbye my brave love\"... Never dawns on her what he's thinking. \nFAUSTO I take shame. \nShe's stunned. Tears run her heavy make up. She looks to Alejandro. No mercy there. Back to her husband. \nFAUSTO (CONT'D) I love me more. I'm sorry. \nHe isn't. It wasn't a hard decision. She turns to Alejandro. Holds her chin high in defiance. \nJACINTA Do it. You fuck. Chinga tu madre PUNTA CABRON ANDALE PUES!!! \nAlejandro looks at Fausto. \nALEJANDRO See why you married her. Spunk. \nAlejandro looks into Fausto's uncaring eyes. \nAlejandro fires into Fausto's belly. Touches the barrel to his arm, fires again. Fausto screams. Alejandro presses the barrel to Fausto's throat, fires again. Fausto falls to the floor, gargling. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Watch death come for you. Watch. The devil is near, Fausto. He is waiting for you. \nFausto's terrified eyes stare back at Alejandro as he gasps for air. Drowning in his own blood. There is no specific moment when death comes. He simply fades. Alejandro sits back down. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) This is what they think of you. You see? \nShe stares at him, shaking so profusely you might think she is freezing to death. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Maybe you have enough pride that you don't marry another one of these.

He lifts her shirt above her bare breasts. Six large, red welts... \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) These ribs are bruised, but not broken, yes? \nShe nods as her lip quivers. Clinging desperately to her dignity. She has never felt so powerless, and that is his point. \nHe drops her shirt and steps back.

The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland...

Now you understand how far we have fallen. \nHe studies her-- arms crossed, legs close together. \nALEJANDRO (CONT'D) You look like a girl when you're scared. Such beauty in you when you let yourself be frail. Like the daughter they took from me ... This is not the work for you. Look at yourself, Kate. What it has done to you in just three days ... Find a little town far from the border. A place where the rule of law still exists. You will spot predators there very easy now... Make a difference you can see everyday. Because you will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now. \nHe looks at her. Smiles sadly and leaves. \nShe waits. Starts to cry, fights it back.

XANDER How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere? 
YORGI Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss. 
Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti. 
YORGI You hang with us, buddy, taste some freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy! 
Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander joins her, but she won't even look at him. 
XANDER This is great, dancing with the back of your head. 
She reluctantly turns around. 
XANDER If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing? 
PETRA Yorgi asked me to. 
XANDER You do everything Yorgi says? 
PETRA Go to hell. 
XANDER It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that? 
PETRA Mind your business. 
XANDER Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you. 
She glares at him and walks away. Xander follows. 
XANDER Where are you going? 
PETRA Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home. 
XANDER I was invited. What's your story? 
PETRA I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions. 
There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the "men's". Petra heads into the Men's Room. 
Some DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink. 
XANDER Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you. 
PETRA Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. 
XANDER That right? Why's that? 
The stall door flies open and Petra marches out. 
PETRA My chest is too small and my brain is too big. 
She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall. 
Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing. 
Across the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and puts on "ANARCHY BURGER" by the Vandals. The rave dance is interrupted by the pounding punk beat. 
YORGI Xander, check it out! The revolution begins! 
Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys. 
YORGI Let's get some air, man. 
Yorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries out another door. 
EXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT 
It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river. 
XANDER You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live. 
YORGI It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me. 
XANDER I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg. 
YORGI You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well? 
XANDER Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen. 
YORGI Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere. 
XANDER My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch. 
The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a window with his SNIPER RIFLE. 
P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs.

Waves of heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates ACROSS the SCREEN. \n2   INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT                          2 The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen- ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He looks to the rear. FOUCHET What's taking so long back there? CUT TO: \nREAR Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON, and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform. His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be- along grin on his face. ANDY How do I look? Like the real thing, yeah? FOUCHET Step back and lemme get a good look at you. \nCLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the front. FOUCHET Tell me again about your assignment, Andrew? ANDY I'm the decoy. FOUCHET Right you are. Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM! \n3    EXT. VAN IN MOTION                                            3 Andy's body is blown through the rear doors as the van turns a corner. \n4    INT.

COLONY HOTEL (SOUTH BEACH) - NIGHT                       6 Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with: POLICE RADIO (V.O.) Report of an officer down. Be advised, all units. Corner of Lennox and Taylor. Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors. \nA7   INT. COLONY HOTEL - NIGHT                                     A7 Where the buffed DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to greet the effeminate pair. LOWREY Good evening.

COLONY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                       7 Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster their guns. The posing is over. This is business. \nA8   INT. COLONY HOTEL - SUITE 202 - NIGHT                       A8 On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next to each. \nREVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx. Then -- BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through. Burnett on backup. LOWREY Police!   On the floor! But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs.   One goes left and the other, right.

Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered, Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to: \n8    LIVING ROOM                                                  8 Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand. But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs of a chair. BURNETT Lowrey! Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles. Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for him. \nA9   EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION                        A9 Burnett   and the other dealer come crashing out onto the balcony,   then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some occupied   cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops move in   to assist. \n9    LOWREY                                                       9 appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket. \nBURNETT (scraped, bruised, pissed) Nice backup. LOWREY What? We TILT UP as POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead. \n10   EXT. MIAMI BEACH SKYLINE - TITLE SEQUENCE - NIGHT            10 As OPENING TITLES RUN and MUSIC POUNDS -- we FLY OVER the causeways, waterways and hotels that line the beach.

MIAMI'S OLDEST POLICE STATION (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT       11 The HELICOPTER ROARS low over the rooftops toward the causeway bridge. \n12   EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - FOUCHET - NIGHT             12 As the helicopter passes over, he appears  from behind a large exhaust port. Casper, Ferguson, and   Noah behind him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets  with built-in radio headsets, and an array of high-tech  tools. FOUCHET It's time. The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning unit. They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal case and what looks like a black scuba tank. \n13   INT. AIR UNIT/SHAFTS                                        13 Though it's windy and cramped in here, at least it's cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts. Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who knows his way. \n14   INT. POLICE STATION - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT               14 Seemingly empty.   From squad rooms to locker rooms to booking. \n15   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - GUARD STATION                          15 OFFICER BILL O'FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks coffee. Video monitors in front of him show the different lockers inside the evidence room. We see one room with stacks upon stacks of heroin. \n", "test1_id": 1857, "test2_input": "BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            67. 137    CONTINUED:                                                  137 BURNETT Just that crazy Yvette, stalking me again.

Any other spontaneous naked women with keys, that we should know about? BURNETT We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that? JULIE I feel safer now. She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door- way and gets into his face.

LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                  139 Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with the keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and exits. \n140   INT. CLUB HELL - NIGHT                                       140 Hip. Hard rock. Crowded. Sexy. Burnett and Lowrey on cruise control, this club massed with people. \n141   INT. CLUB HELL - OFFICE - NIGHT                              141 High above the room, Fouchet looks out upon the dance floor with both Noah, Casper, and Ferguson behind him.

Hook back up at the bar in twenty minutes. BURNETT Sounds good to me. Lowrey moves off and Burnett turns to the female BARTENDER. BURNETT Gin and tonic... (smiling, with Lowrey's platinum card) ...

Before the valet can get to the door, she's opening Lowrey's glove box. In it there's a pistol. Julie mulls it over before removing it and stuffing it in her purse. \n144   INT.

He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious.

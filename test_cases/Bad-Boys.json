Bunea Vista St. Burbank, CA 91521                            June 20, 1994 \nBAD BOYS FADE IN: \n1   EXT. MIAMI LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   1 The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates ACROSS the SCREEN. \n2   INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT                          2 The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen- ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He looks to the rear. FOUCHET What's taking so long back there? CUT TO: \nREAR Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON, and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform. His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be- along grin on his face. ANDY How do I look? Like the real thing, yeah? FOUCHET Step back and lemme get a good look at you. \nCLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the front. FOUCHET Tell me again about your assignment, Andrew? ANDY I'm the decoy. FOUCHET Right you are. Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM! \n3    EXT. VAN IN MOTION                                            3 Andy's body is blown through the rear doors as the van turns a corner. \n4    INT. VAN - FOUCHET                                            4 He dials 911 on his cellular phone.     Fouchet sounds distressed. FOUCHET Please help! I just saw a policeman shot! Send help. Hurry! I'm at the corner of... \n5    EXT. NEAR DOWNTOWN - VAN - NIGHT                              5 A stream of PD CARS haul past, lights blazing and SIRENS on full. \n6    EXT. COLONY HOTEL (SOUTH BEACH) - NIGHT                       6 Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with: POLICE RADIO (V.O.) Report of an officer down. Be advised, all units. Corner of Lennox and Taylor. Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors. \nA7   INT. COLONY HOTEL - NIGHT                                     A7 Where the buffed DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to greet the effeminate pair. LOWREY Good evening.    I'm Mike -- BURNETT -- And I'm Marcus. LOWREY We're lookin' for a couple of our Latin friends who checked in a little while ago. You might remember them? (CONTINUED) \n16   IN AIR UNIT                                                 16 The team, attached to cables, slide into the building's guts and disappear. STATIC CRACKLES: FOUCHET We're in.     Start the video. \n17   EXT. POLICE STATION - ALLEY - NIGHT                           17 Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it, cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw, then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit. \n18   INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT                                    18 The MONITORS FLUTTER, then STABILIZE.    Turning the page, O'Fee sugars his coffee. \n19   INT. TRASH CHUTE ROOM - NIGHT                                 19 An air vent smashes to the floor.    Two guys pull the metal case inside the room. \n20   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - HEROIN LOCKER - NIGHT                    20 BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred million dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped with a distinctive octopus logo. FOUCHET (into mic) Where's Deputy Dog? FERGUSON (V.O.) (over radio mic) He made us. \nFOUCHET Then do him, now! \n21   GUARD STATION                                                 21 Sure enough.    As O'Fee stands from his desk -- CUT TO: \n22   VENT ABOVE                                                    22 Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil- izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold. \n23   INT. POLICE STATION - QUICK SHOTS - FERGUSON - NIGHT        23 One by one he moves backwards through the various levels of locks, torching each to look as if they'd entered the evidence room from inside the PD station. Meanwhile -- \n24   TRACH CHUTE ROOM                                            24 Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it inside the air shaft. Ferguson attaches the black \"scuba tank,\" labeled \"NITROUS OXIDE,\" to a valve. This is connected to a metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the floor. CUT BACK TO: \n25   HEROIN LOCKER                                               25 Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done, we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con- traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled at breakneck speed through the duct. \n26   EXT. POLICE STATION ALLEY - NIGHT                           26 Bag after bag drops down the trash chute and tumbles into an open-roofed van where the last of the gang, Eddie Dominguez, waits with the ENGINE RUNNING. \n27   IN AIR DUCT                                                 27 The sled rockets by again -- WHOOSH -- loaded with more bags. \n28   INT. HEROIN LOCKER                                          28 Casper and Fouchet throw the last of their gear down the chute and ride the sled out. \nTHERESA Not so fast. You were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview... Lowrey rolls his eyes. \n38   EXT. BURNETT'S HOUSE - MORNING                              38 Burnett's following Lowrey and the kids out his front door when his neighbor, DICK, accosts him from across the hedge. (CONTINUED) \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                          12. 38    CONTINUED:                                                38 DICK Hey, Marcus. Did you know we got busted into again last night? When are you gonna do something about this? BURNETT Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta tell you? I don't work robbery. I'm in Narcotics. Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids pile into the jump seat in the back. LOWREY Don't get your sticky fingers all over my windows... and keep your feet off the seats, I just had the leather conditioned. The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm around. Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa runs out. THERESA Marcus... I need you to stop at Save-More on the way home and pick up exactly what's on the list. She hands Burnett a long list. BURNETT Oh, baby.   Damn. Lowrey shakes his head. \nA39   EXT. MIAMI P.D. - DAY                                     A39 Lowrey and Burnett pull up in Porsche. \nB39   INT POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY                        B39 Lowrey and Burnett walking. BURNETT Twins? LOWREY If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. Her sister came down and posted the girl's bail. And later? Man, talk about special effects. BURNETT What special effects? \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                         A12A. 39   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION           39 LOWREY Tell you later -- Mornin', Francine. Where's the smile? (CONTINUED) \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/20/94                                12A. 39   CONTINUED:                                                39 FRANCINE, a civilian employee of the narcotics unit. She's got pictures of her children parked around her computer desktop. And though dowdy would be a compliment, she's usually got a pleasant smile for the boys. Except today... FRANCINE Evidence room. Howard's waiting for you. BURNETT Your kids are lookin' sharp, Francine. She smiles. \n40   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY                                  40 Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over the evidence room. (CONTINUED) \n40   CONTINUED:                                                 40 INTRO - SANCHEZ AND RUIZ SANCHEZ Let's see. There's Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy, Bashful... Now, who could we be missin'? RUIZ Could it be... Dopey? Both laugh hysterically, while: LOWREY If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice. Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties. BURNETT And the women really go for that. Really, they do. As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look passes between the two partners. \n41   INT. HEROIN LOCKER - DAY                                   41 Another torched lock noted as Burnett and Lowrey enter with Sanchez an Ruiz behind them. The room is emptied. Captain HOWARD appears. He's short, has a military haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in paranoia. HOWARD Nice of you to roll in. And nothing particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone. That's right. The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back. BURNETT This can't be happening. (CONTINUED) \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94                              14. 41   CONTINUED:                                                 41 HOWARD So here's what we're gonna do. Since it was originally your case, you two guys are on point. Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need. Groans all around. LOWREY So I guess we should start with the C.I.s and the perps from the original case. But hell if I know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off. They're either dead or in the lock-up pending trial. BURNETT How's O'Fee? SINCLAIR (O.S.) Oh, he'll be just fine. From the side appears a cigar-chewing Internal Affairs suit named SINCLAIR. He circles close to Burnett and Lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks. HOWARD Name's Sinclair. Internal Affairs. He's our new proctologist. SINCLAIR You see, what's got me confused is, why risk leaving a witness? Why not kill O'Fee instead? \nBURNETT Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast. SINCLAIR And who knows that better than anybody else? Cops. BURNETT You're not sayin' this was an inside job. Cops wouldn't pull this shit. (CONTINUED) \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94                              15. 41   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           41 SINCLAIR Not just cops. Narcotic cops. For example, the S.N.D. You've got access. You've got wherewithall. And most importantly, you've got the connections. Who else would know how to unload a hundred million dollars worth of heroin? LOWREY Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack suit. HOWARD Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's nothing we can do about it. If any of this leaks, the shit's gonna hit our biggest fan. Remember him? The mayor? He created us and you can bet your jobs, boys, he'll rip us into little cop pieces. I figure we got seventy-two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs. LOWREY Nothing like a little old-fashioned incentive. \nCLOSE ON BURNETT He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the paraffin filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate. \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                           19. 48   CONTINUED:                                                 48 BLACK WOMAN Who's Max's friend? BURNETT A cop. BLACK WOMAN Oooh.    I love cops. The other girls are suddenly interested, too.   Burnett swallows and... BURNETT You know? I'm a cop. I shot somebody just last week. Didn't kill him, just shot him in the ass. Stone cold looks from them all. They walk away with Burnett giving a \"what did I say\" look. Lowrey appears. LOWREY You know, that was really smooth. Think you could do that again? (as they start walking) Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the grass gets greener. BURNETT Green ain't the color I was thinkin' of. More of a coco puff. Just real shiny, thick... \n49   EXT. BOXING GYM                                            49 \nAs they head toward their car, Burnett's BEEPER SOUNDS. He switches it OFF. BURNETT Damn! The woman's got fuckin' radar on my ass. Sensed me lookin' at another woman. Bet she wants me to pick up Huggies 'stead of those baby Garanimals that they wear. LOWREY I don't think anybody could be that married. \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                            19A. 50   INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR - IN MOTION - DAY                 50 Burnett drives cautiously while both he and Lowrey bob to Ice-T's \"COP KILLER.\" They get a kick out of the song. LOWREY (complies) Miami's the perfect town for you, Burnett. You drive like a one- hundred-seven-year-old lady with her turn signal on. BURNETT And I plan on living to be old just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay on my joints and everythin'. \nAn old guy passes them even though his car is pulling an Airstream camper behind it. Lowrey can't believe it. LOWREY You gonna let every old motherfucker pass you? Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate. BURNETT I don't have a death wish like you. I  got a family that counts on me.  A mortgage to pay. And I'm not sayin' it's me, but most of the guys in the station think you're some rich kid playin' cop. LOWREY Who said that? \nBurnett mumbles an answer. LOWREY If somebody's talking about me, I wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of this. I don't apologize for nothing I do. I get up early and take it to the max every day. I'm always the first guy through the door. And the last guy to leave a crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I could give a shit what those boot lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin' motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey. What can Burnett say to all that, but... (CONTINUED) \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                          20. 50   CONTINUED:                                                50 BURNETT I love you, man. He lets loose a big grin. LOWREY Oh, fuck you, Marcus. The RADIO CRACKLES. DISPATCHER (V.O.) (over radio) Two-one? I got that address for you on the air conditioning company. Oh, and Theresa called, she added something to your grocer list: Muppets toothpaste. Bubble gum flavor. She says Quincy doesn't like mint. Lowrey rolls his eyes, glances at Burnett, who's embarrassed. LOWREY Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the address. DISPATCHER (V.O.) Orona's been working out of his house. He's at... \n51   EXT. KEY BISCAYNE ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY             51 Burnett and Lowrey step from their unmarked car and start up the steps to this stony, estate-sized house. \nLOWREY The air conditioning business has been good to Orona. Lowrey rings the bell.   They wait.   No answer. BURNETT Well, we can leave a note or we can break and enter -- LOWREY Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona beating his wife. \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                              21. 52   INT. ESTATE - REAR DOOR                                       52 Lowrey kicks the door in. LOWREY Uh oh.    No alarm. BURNETT Aw, man.    Did you cut one? LOWREY No, man.    Musta been you. BURNETT Not me. Lowrey and Burnett look at each other and draw guns. \nLOWREY AND BURNETT Dead guy. \n53   INT. ORONA'S DEN - DAY                                        53 The door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal Lowrey and Burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to Orona's body which sits upright in his office chair, the body grotesque and bloated. LOWREY Now what? A sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to Orona as if he were alive. BURNETT Where are the drugs? (no answer) Where... are... the... drugs? (shrugs) He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must be guilty of somethin'. Meanwhile, Lowrey's got   no problem with the dead body. He tries opening a desk   drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis- stiffened knee is in the   way. So Lowrey gives it a shove and the chair swivels.    Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp off the desk. BURNETT Whoa. Watch where you're swinging them dead arms, Orona. You're gonna fuck up your own crime scene. (CONTINUED) \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                             22. 53   CONTINUED:                                                   53 Lowrey braves the body and gingerly pokes around his pockets. BURNETT Watch what you touch.   That's evidence. BURNETT Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona. You've got the right to remain silent. Anything you say'll surprise the shit out of us. BURNETT Anything? \nLOWREY (finds small notepad) Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta bookies. Phone numbers. BURNETT Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning contract for the P.D. He'd have the plans. LOWREY He trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps. BURNETT Works for me. Now can we go? I'm gonna puke. \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/21/94                           25B. 59   CONTINUED:   (A1)                                      59 MAX So, Eddie. Looks like we're way too early. How's about we come back later? (CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                                 59 EDDIE No. Don't go yet. We can party. Just us three. Look at what Eddie's got to play with. From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just hit paydirt on the very first try. \n60   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                      60 Where she's silently cursing Max for getting her into this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the louvered shades. \n61   JULIE'S POV - THROUGH SHADES                               61 She sees Eddie opening the door to Fouchet.   Casper and Noah follow him inside. CUT BACK TO: \n62   INT. AL CAPONE SUITE                                       62 Eddie is instantly nervous in the presence of Fouchet. FOUCHET Who's the girl, Eddie? EDDIE Just a hooker -- \nMAX My name's Max. (outstretched hand) I'm just a friend. FOUCHET I could use a friend who looks like you. Turn around. Lemme get a good look. Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of the rear when -- Fouchet draws a PISTOL -- BAM BAM!! Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE. \n63   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                         63 Instant horror. Julie saw Max killed and retreats to the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright. CUT BACK TO: \n64   INT. CAPONE SUITE                                             64 Now, Fouchet swings the gun onto Eddie. FOUCHET You're a fucking idiot. Hookers talk. Now, is that my dope? EDDIE (freaked) Our dope... That was the deal, yeah? Right. Until we got the money -- BAM!   Fouchet SHOOTS Eddie in the knee.   Eddie screams! EDDIE You fucker... fucker fucker fucker!!! FOUCHET I have four more days until I make the deal. When it's done you get your money. Now, what part don't you understand? EDDIE Hey, man.   You need me. FOUCHET I don't need anybody. I got three little angels looking over my shoulder. \nREVERSE SHOT - EDDIE'S CHAIR Fouchet UNLOADS THREE MORE SHOTS.    BAM BAM BAM!!!   Blood spatters onto Casper. CASPER Aw, man. You got blood on my new suit. FOUCHET Ever hear of dry cleaning? Now, shut the fuck up, check for the rest of my dope. \n65   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                      65 Half-panicked, half-trying to keep her head. There's no way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he approaches. \nCLOSE ON DOORKNOB As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in, his face hitting the hard tile with a crunch. \n66   INT. CAPONE SUITE - JULIE                                  66 \nMaking her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the room. Aiming for that secret fireplace door. \nFOUCHET Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite. Julie dives right into the secret door. \nBURNETT He drops the sheet on Eddie's body, then moves over to Max's. He doesn't know it's her until -- BURNETT Jesus, no... LOWREY Whatcha got? (CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             75 Burnett drops the sheet, turns and puts a protective shoulder between Lowrey and the body. LOWREY What?     Who is it? Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order. Lowrey's eyes well up. LOWREY I shoulda told you to be careful. \n76   INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT                          76 The elevator doors open and out step Burnett and Lowrey into a lobby full of cops. Lowrey goes straight to the front desk. LOWREY Eddie Dominguez. I want his phone calls. He flashes a badge. HOTEL CLERK You pay the bill you can see his phone calls. LOWREY I'm sorry.     Maybe I wasn't polite enough. With a flashing right jab, Lowrey pops the snooty Clerk. After the Clerk finds his feet, eyes peering over the counter...

You can catch a ride with Howard. Lowrey jumps in the car. BURNETT Uh oh... Alright, you check out Lois, then check in -- \n78   INT. LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - MASTER SUITE - NIGHT               78 \nReplete with balcony and billowy curtains, the old-styled madame LOIS FIELDS sits up on her bed covered in pillows and exotic stuffed animals. She thumbs an old, leather- bound looseleaf binder full of modeling photos and resumes. LOIS FIELDS I'm sorry, Jimmy. But you can't have her. Shelly only models and that's all... That's right. Like I always say, some girls do, some girls don't, and the rest you can't afford -- (line cuts out) Hello? Jimmy... Jimmy? Suddenly, the power is cut. \n79   INT.

LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - NIGHT                              81 The door is open and the deadbolt looks smashed with something heavy like a sledgehammer.

I'm gonna need back-up at 614 Reach Road. Lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway. He checks the lights, but the power is off. Slipping the radio into his coat pocket, he returns with a mini- flashlight and begins to clear a path, doorway by doorway, then moving up a wide stairwell. \n82   INT. MIAMI PD - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT                          82 \nHoward is sitting at the edge of the desk while Burnett is on the phone with Theresa. HOWARD Did you check parole? How about F.B.I. or D.E.A.? They're supposed to be compliant with our requests? And where the hell's Lowrey? BURNETT (hand over phone) Following this Lois Fields lead. I just paged him. HOWARD The madame? What's it with this guy? It's always girls, girls, girls. BURNETT (as Theresa screams) No, Theresa... No, he wasn't talking about you. \n92   INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                     92 But as Burnett enters the house, all he notices are that two DOGS start YAPPING HYSTERICALLY. He can't see her. But she can see him. From behind the door, she comes out swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes the hat stand instead.

JULIE You're not Mike Lowrey! BURNETT What do you mean I'm not Mike Lowrey? You never even met him! Me. JULIE The way Max described you was different. \nBURNETT I'm undercover. She doesn't believe him and swings the bat. BURNETT Okay.    I'm way undercover. JULIE Prove it! BURNETT I knew her from way back. From time to time, you know... We'd get together. Mess around, you know? JULIE Wrong. Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off. \nBURNETT Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing. She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her. BURNETT You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone. Burnett heads toward the open door.     Julie's veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor.

Like she was nothing. (trying to hold it together) Please shut the door. BURNETT You don't got any more golf clubs or bats, do you? Nothin' that you can swing at me, do you? She shakes her head.     He carefully steps forward. BURNETT Then lemme introduce myself. I'm Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help you. JULIE You're not what I expected. BURNETT Yeah, well neither are you.      You swing like Barry Bonds. Burnett nods and crosses over to help Julie to her feet. BURNETT Alright. Look here, I need to know if you've called anybody. Or if you told anybody else where you are? JULIE No.   Nobody. \nBURNETT Good.     You got a back door? Julie nods, scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing another modeling bag off the table. JULIE Where are we going?

A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the front door open.       Clutching the bag, Julie races around the living room. \nBURNETT Let's go! JULIE Luke?!   Where's my other dog?! BURNETT Fuck the dog! Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner.       So he lunges over, scoops the dog up.

It's Casper, Noah and Kuni! \nBURNETT AND JULIE Racing through the apartment toward the back door, Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni rounds a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster spray and NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her through the back door, then spins and FIRES. Kuni tumbles and dies from multiple hits. \n95   EXT.

I'm not on the take. Satisfied? Good. So... why don't you make yourself at home? Here's the T.V. remote. Watch yourself some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or somethin'. Hits \"ON\" button. Instead of TV, the room immediately becomes a seduction den: lights dim, romantic music. BURNETT Heh -- all these damn things look alike. (switches it off) Well, gotta run... There's probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge for the dogs. Help yourself to whatever. (starts to go) I'll check on you in the morning. JULIE Where are you going? BURNETT Uh, back to the P.D. I got paperwork back on my desk to go through that's about this high. (to his armpits) And now there's you, so that makes it this high. To his neck. JULIE You mean, you're going to leave me alone? In your place. With all your stuff? BURNETT Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief or a vandal? JULIE Of course not. And I'm not a call girl, either. BURNETT I didn't ask. JULIE I know you didn't. I just thought you should know. (CONTINUED) \n102   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             102 BURNETT Okay. Important lesson. Julie's not a call girl. Can I go now? JULIE Just one more thing. Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett. It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back. JULIE Thank you.   For everything. BURNETT Don't mention it. Burnett tries to break toward the door when the PHONE RINGS. Burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what to do. JULIE Aren't you going to -- LOWREY'S MACHINE (V.O.) Hi. You're live with Lowrey. Leave it at the beep. The PHONE BEEPS. YVETTE (V.O.) Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I told you I don't date cops. And I know I told you I wouldn't sleep with a man I wasn't going to marry. But I've been thinking -- and I remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing -- so I started feeling... well, lonely. Remember when you gave me that key -- Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE. BURNETT It's uh... It's uh... JULIE You don't have to explain. Finally, they've reached consensus.

I'm gonna be gone for about an hour. Do me a favor. Keep your eye out, okay? CHET You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting off in just a few minutes, so... I could watch the door if you like. You know. In a chair. I could just sit in it. Outside the door like cops do when they're guarding shit. BURNETT Just keep an eye out. Heads for the door. CHET Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you know?

LOWREY Yeah.   Thanks for the get-well card. \n106   INT. POLICE BASKETBALL GYM                                 106 Howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as his morning workout. Parked on either side of the hoop, Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball and send it back to him. BURNETT Chief. I tried to set   the girl up with a sketch artist  but she won't. I tried to get   her to come in and look at the mug  books and she won't come in. HOWARD She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey. He tosses a brick. BURNETT That's right. So let her deal with the real Mike Lowrey! Who, I might add, shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin' off like a hot dog without any backup. Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball. LOWREY Hey. I'm not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment. You know, she's probably on the street sellin' all my shit as we speak. BURNETT I had to stash her somewhere! She's scared shitless... just like her dogs.

I'm going home... explain the whole thing, take her to the Motel Six, she'll understand... HOWARD Not a good idea. (brick) Until she I.D.s the shotters, he's Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla hours. Could take all day. You got a computer with a modem? BURNETT Big computer.    Expensive -- LOWREY Yeah, I got a computer and you shouldn't touch it. It took me weeks to get it set up the way I want it and I don't want amateurs messing with it. HOWARD (brick number four) Burnett. I'll have Francine give you the user code for the computer files and you can run pictures for the girl on Lowrey's super duper computer. BURNETT So what about me? I can't    tell my wife I'm shacked up with a   female witness! Besides, I think    they made my car last night... I   gotta stay close to home, just in   case. HOWARD Easy. Lowrey moves into your house. And you're on special assignment. Another brick. LOWREY No way!   I'm not living in that zoo. BURNETT My house ain't no zoo!

Until she makes the shooters and we get the dope back, I don't care what you have to do, just make it work! Lowrey and Burnett feel hammered by Howard. Upon retrieving his final brick, Lowrey passes to Burnett, who feeds back Lowrey with a heel kick to the rim. And Lowrey slams the ball home. They exit with Howard simply staring. \n107   INT.

THERESA You never had to go to Cleveland on police business before. BURNETT Cleveland's where they collared the dealer. And that's where I gotta go to testify. THERESA But what about us? The neighborhood's had all break-ins. I won't feel safe if you're -- BURNETT Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't have the most trustworthy man I know to look after my family... THERESA Oh, no,   Not Lowrey. Not in my house. BURNETT Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my life and, I most certainly trust him with yours. THERESA Why don't they send him to Cleveland? BURNETT Baby. It's a Federal subpoena. I'm the witness. I'm the one who has to testify. Case closed. I'm the one going to Cleveland. Lowrey's staying here. \n117   INT.

Who's the guy in all the pictures? Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of Lowrey. All ego. BURNETT That guy? Well, that's Marcus Burnett, my partner. Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty frame, too. BURNETT There's the two of us, see?     Me'n'... (gestures to photos) ... My partner. JULIE Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta guys. And I've seen a good number of their bedrooms, okay?

But you see... you see... It's uh... a cop thing. (then it comes) That's because I've put a picture up there for every time Marcus has saved my life. JULIE Saved your life? BURNETT I save his life. He saves mine. He's got the same thing in his house. Pictures of me. More, even. Good family man, that Marcus. JULIE Okay, but Mike. This is like a lot of pictures. I mean, this isn't something by the bedstand. This is a whole wall... And I know Max said you were just friends. That's why I was thinking, maybe... you could be... gay. Burnett reacts, then recovers with... BURNETT Me? Gay?   Are you outta your mind? JULIE I didn't mean to offend you. \nBURNETT It's a good thing that I'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. You know how many women I've had in that waterbed?

Sounded like three angels... He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. I didn't get the rest. (back to the mug shots) I'm getting tired of looking at ugly people. \nBURNETT Just a few more and we can take another break. JULIE I don't wanna take a break. Then we'd have to talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal. BURNETT A what? JULIE That was a living, breathing consciousness. It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name. BURNETT What had a name. \nJULIE That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth. BURNETT (stops chewing) It's just bologna. JULIE It was alive. Some farmer  fed it. Got it to trust him.

(challenges) Just look for 'Fresh Days.' Lowrey moves ahead.   There's too much to look at. LOWREY You're unbalanced. Listen, I read the parole jacket on this guy Noah. Armed robbery. Attempted murder. He's a violent offender somethin' like nine times. Sweet guy. Not a single drug bust on his sheet. BURNETT So? He's a new recruit. Keep looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.' \nLOWREY You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff. BURNETT Hey, this what husband's do. LOWREY Terrible fuckin' job. (examining shelves) It's like shaving cream.

Lowrey could kill. LOWREY Yvette!? You didn't just send away Yvette? BURNETT That woman's into some weird shit. Julie's confused, to say the least. \nJULIE (to Burnett) So, Mike. Any other spontaneous naked women with keys, that we should know about? BURNETT We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that? JULIE I feel safer now. She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door- way and gets into his face.

LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                  139 Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and sits back down at the computer. She plays with the keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death replaying itself in her mind. Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and exits. \n140   INT.

Hook back up at the bar in twenty minutes. BURNETT Sounds good to me. Lowrey moves off and Burnett turns to the female BARTENDER. BURNETT Gin and tonic... (smiling, with Lowrey's platinum card) ... And add twenty for yourself. \nBAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                          70. 143   EXT. CLUB HELL VALET - LATER                               143 Julie pulls up in Lowrey's Porsche.

Budweiser... CASPER Excuse me? BURNETT Musta drank about a million Budweisers tonight, waitin' for my ol' friend Noah to show. Wouldn't know him, would ya? Guy practically raised me up from nothin'.

But... \nLOWREY Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah. Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't find it. But -- \nFERGUSON'S \ngot a clear shot at Julie. He raises his gun, only to find Burnett's pistol at his ear. BURNETT Don't even think about it.

LOWREY No shit! \nMeanwhile, Noah's on his feet and hauling ass out of the club. \n159   BURNETT AND FERGUSON                                       159 Burnett sees that Noah's on the run.

Burnett behind the wheel. LOWREY Lemme drive! BURNETT I'm driving.     Buckle up. Burnett hits the gas, the CAR SCREAMS around in a tight circle just as -- SLAM! -- Noah's sedan backs wildly across the road and crunches them. Noah throws a SHOTGUN over the back seat of his car and FIRES through the rear window. BLAM! Everybody ducks. Safety glass flies before Noah shifts gears and drives on. \n163   EXT.

I just wanted something to wear for Marcus when he got home. But nothing looks right... (starts crying again) He's slipping away from me, Mike. I can feel it. LOWREY (sits next to her) Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's slipping away from you. Especially not Marcus. You can take my word on that... As for the clothes... Lowrey pulls a random item out of a box.   It's hideous. LOWREY Okay.

BURNETT What's that supposed to mean? JULIE You know, relieve his tension. A woman'll do anything to keep a man like that. You know what I mean? Tonight... made me a little bit horny, I guess. I think, maybe. It was the car chase. Or the guns and everything. I've never shot a gun before. Maybe it's the steel or something. I'm feeling a little... funny. BURNETT Funny? JULIE I don't know.

This high-speed chase was captured two nights ago by our Live Copter 9 news team. And while the driver was killed, both police officers involved in the incident seemed to escape without injury. THERESA Kids, you go over to the neighbors' house. I'll be right back.

THERESA Announce this! In a motherly flash, she's got Chet by the ear and she's dragging him over to the elevator. He yowls the whole way until he sticks his master pass-card in the elevator lock. Theresa lets  go. \n226   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - DAY                                  226 Julie is framed in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly watching Burnett and Lowrey scramble to get ready for the bust. \nJULIE So, I guess when you get back, it's gonna be over.

The tall one or the short one? THERESA Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em both. But it's the short one I'm gonna divorce. She pushes past. JULIE Thought so.

(seeing Theresa) Holy shit! Hi, Theresa... honey. THERESA Save your crap, Mike. \nLOWREY Mike what?     What'd he do? BURNETT Theresa.     It's not how it looks. THERESA It ain't Cleveland, neither.

Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear, he appears from the building, turns the corner out the door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot. \nA234   EXT./INT.

ALLEY - LOWREY                                      236 Turns the corner, running up over car roofs and hoods. He lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on Fouchet and the gang. They've got Julie and now they're running. \n237   EXT. ALLEY - BURNETT                                     237 Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another direction. Burnett hauls one way.

Picks the first car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before. He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again. \n241   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          241 But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets into gear. The WHEELS SPIN.

GUNSHOTS RING out sideways. \nLOWREY You know that once he sells the dope, he's gonna kill her just like he did Max. BURNETT Three little angels. Julie kept talking about his three little angels. A barkeeper appears with two beers.   Burnett automati- cally reaches for his wallet. \nCLOSE ON BURNETT'S WALLET Where out pops a picture of his three children. LOWREY If she dies, I'm done with it.

They all had boy friends or their husbands. LOWREY So you were alone? FRANCINE He was so nice to me. He said I was beautiful, too. I guess I wanted to believe him... (then ashamed, starting to shake) He took some horrible pictures of me. I don't remember any of it. I'd had too much to drink. I wondered if he'd drugged me. Later... he threatened to show them to my boys... my little angels. Said he'd pin the pictures up on the grade school bulletin boards for all their classmates to see if I didn't do what he wanted. BURNETT He wanted someone inside the P.D.? FRANCINE At first, it was about drug busts. Dealers under surveillance.

And then when the department gave the air conditioning to Mr. Orona... BURNETT Anything you can tell us about him? FRANCINE What do you say about someone who rips off drug dealers? A man like that ain't scared of nobody. Not the police. Not you guys. Nobody. (beat) He's the scariest man I ever met. LOWREY Yeah. But does he still trust what you tell him? \n253   EXT.

They wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and dumped into the truck. \nCLOSE ON DUMPSTER As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck in the air. \nRUIZ AND SANCHEZ Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this fiasco. Angry words.

MAX 
slips the postcard under the rubber bands on the visor. He can see it whenever he wants to. But not now. He flips the visor up, puts the car in gear and pulls out.

5   EXT. LA DOWNTOWN - MAX'S CAB - LATE DAY                             5 
northbound on the 405 or Harbor Freeway, an on-ramp to the east         * 105. It's all magical in the light. Max's cab, rocketing along circulinear ramps into complexity of five traffic streams...

...harsh reality intrudes. Max is driving a YOUNG PROFESSIONAL COUPLE with carry-on bags, having a heated argument about... 
MAN ...it's always you. Why is everything always directed at you...? 
WOMAN ...everything is not "always about me." He was being sarcastic and you goddamn well know it... 
MAN ...I'm sorry, I didn't hear it that way... 
WOMAN ...oh, bullshit! How about the dig about the makeover...? 
MAN ...what do you want me to do, punch the guy out? I work with him. And you're perfectly capable of taking care of your own......

WOMAN (interrupts) ...well, last I checked, you were sleeping with me, so unless you wanna start fucking him, I suggest... 
Max endures it silently, invisible as furniture.     He doesn't exist as far as his passengers are concerned...

...as Max drops an elderly Asian couple in Little Saigon...           * 
Up ahead, he sees a cluster of CHINESE GANGBANGERS in their early 20's wearing cheap suits, white shirts and no ties. Some guy gets pushed to the ground, punched and kicked while four or       * five watch, amused. 
Max's first instinct...                                               * 
MAX Hey, leave-up on him, man... 
One GANG MEMBER, eating take-out with chopsticks, hears, turns, sees Max. 
GANG MEMBER Say what? What you lookin' at, bitch? (stream of hot Cantonese) 
He throws his food container. Another throws a beer bottle. Max hits the accelerator as the bottle bounces off the rear windshield...

by the freeway. Mexican murals are coated with a patina of corrosion from the fumes. We find Max cleaning Chinese take-out off his cab with the water hose while the gas pump CLICKS OFF. The Attendant he's known for five years finishes a taco.              *

Max hangs the nozzle back, gets in the car...                      * 
Max slips his credit card into the briefcase. We glimpse the       * Mercedes S500 catalogue again. And Max flips the visor down,       * staring at the island. Soothed by the blue. 
We're seeing the most private of Max's rituals, the one he doesn't share with anybody. 
Now, he starts hustling for calls by posting himself in a nearby zone. See Max work the computer. He bids and gets a next load.     *

presumably, has dropped a load in front. He fills out his trip sheet. A pedestrian businessman asks directions to LAX. Max ad libs, directing him to the people-mover. 
Yellow cylindrical stairs...a pretty young WOMAN descends into the interior lobby. 
Max finishes his notation. 
The young WOMAN detours through media and the rush-hour crowd while talking rapid fire into a cell phone, starts toward Max's cab, waving at it... 
Max doesn't see her, starts to pull away. 
She gives up, turns toward a green City Cab behind her, but it just picked up a load. 
Then, Max catches sight of her and stops.   Red taillights. 
She turns and starts for the cab. 
We SEE Max regard her in his rearview mirror.   He ejects a CD and loads a different one.

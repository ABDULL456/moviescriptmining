PAT (CONT'D) Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes. 
JORDIE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER TOWARDS TIFFANY'S STUNNED 
PARENTS. 
JORDIE She just texted me! 
INT. MAXWELL HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY 
TIFFANY BEHIND DOOR TAKES IN HOW PAT STOOD UP FOR HER. 
THINKS. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
PAT RUNS. TIFFANY ENTERS. PAT REACTS. 
PAT Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on? 
THEY STOP, FACING EACH OTHER. 
TIFFANY I can't, I can't do it. 
PAT What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what? 
TIFFANY I can't give the letter to Nikki. 
PAT Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki? 
TIFFANY Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me? 
PAT You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki. 
TIFFANY I know. 
PAT That was the set-up. 
TIFFANY Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing! 
PAT What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own? 
TIFFANY I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. Pat takes this in. 
PAT Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you? 
TIFFANY I can't do it. 
PAT Tiffany, what do you want me to do? 
TIFFANY SIGHS. 
PAT (CONT'D) Think of something. 
TIFFANY There's this thing. 
PAT There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing? 
TIFFANY It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing. 
PAT It's a dance thing, all right. 
TIFFANY It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year. 
PAT Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it. 
TIFFANY Would you please! 
PAT I don't have a filter when I talk. 
TIFFANY Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God. 
PAT Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. 
TIFFANY But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year. 
PAT Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about? 
TIFFANY What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad? 
PAT Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you. 
TIFFANY All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter. 
TIFFANY WALKS AWAY. 
PAT Wait a second! But you promised you would do this. 
TIFFANY TURNS 
TIFFANY Think about it. 
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS. 
PAT Well, I already did do something for you, you know. 
TIFFANY TURNS. 
TIFFANY 
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR ME? 
PAT I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house. 
TIFFANY What? Jordie? 
PAT Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely? 
TIFFANY STOPS. 
PAT (CONT'D) That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it. 
TIFFANY Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki? 
PAT It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different. 
TIFFANY How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it. 
PAT We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with. 
TIFFANY Wow. 
PAT It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens. 
PAT (CONT'D) She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing. 
TIFFANY It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing. 
TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS. PRELAP OF EAGLES GAME FADES IN.

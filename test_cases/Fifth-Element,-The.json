{"train": "The Fifth Element \nAn original script by Luc Besson \nRevisions by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen \nAugust 1995 Draft \nGaumont and Les Films du Dauphin \nFADE IN: \n1\tEXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY \nSomewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert. \nCREDITS  ROLL \nWRITTEN:\tEGYPT 1913 \nOMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes. \n2\tEXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY \nThe mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light into the temple. Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside the temple. \n3\tINT.  TEMPLE - DAY \nOmar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last mirror which shines light into the expansive room. \nPROFESSOR (deciphering) \"..when the three planets are in eclipse..\" \nHis fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers. \nPROFESSOR \"..the black hole like a door is open... Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos...\" See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil ... make sure you get the snake! \nThe Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil, coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U. Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist. \nBILLY And when is this door opening snake act supposed to occur? \nThe Professor's fingers touch the signs. \nPROFESSOR ..if this is the five..and this the thousand.. \nHe calculates. \nPROFESSOR Every five thousand years.. \nBILLY (kidding) So I have some time.. \nHe reaches for the pad. \nANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock. \nPRIEST I will take it to them my son. \nStartled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest. \nPRIEST Go with God.. be safe from Evil.. \nThe Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing him. As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor. \nANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching. \nPROFESSOR \"..then arrange the elements of life against the Terror just so..\" \nHis fingers run on. \nPROFESSOR \"..Water..fire..earth..air..four elements around the fifth..\" \nHis fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by all the others. \nThe Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into the skin. \nANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails. \nPROFESSOR Aziz!  Light! \nThe boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up. \nPRIEST Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much.. \nPROFESSOR \"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil..\" \nPRIEST (V.O.) Amen.. \nThe Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup from the skin. \nPROFESSOR Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications. \nPRIEST Only too well... here you must be parched.. \nHe hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost to his lips when.. \nPROFESSOR I mean look.. it is like a battle plan.. \nIn his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin. \nPROFESSOR Here the Good.. Here the Evil.. \nAll of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases. A black crust immediately covers it. \n29\tINT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE \nSCIENTIST (consulting new data) Its structure has just solidified on the surface, as if the object felt something.  If that's the case, we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence. \nCORNELIUS The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr. President. \nThe President hesitates. \nCAPTAIN ...The ship is in combat formation. The missile is loaded, General. \nPRESIDENT (uneasy) Staedert?  Give me a minute... I have a doubt. \nSTAEDERT (cold) I don't, Mr. President. \n30\tEXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP \nThe missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water. Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger. \n31\tINT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE \nStaedert looks worried. \nSTAEDERT Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum shield protection. \nCAPTAIN Yes, Sir. \nThe President is growing ever more worried. \nPRESIDENT Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it? \nSTAEDERT I'm about to, Mr. President. \n32\tEXT.  SPACESHIP \nA series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all. And literally doubles in size. \nSCIENTIST The planet's diameter has greatly increased and it's moving toward the ship. \nPRESIDENT Staedert?  Get out of there immediately! I don't want an incident, do you hear me, Staedert? \nSTAEDERT (worried) ...What do we have that's bigger than 240? \nCAPTAIN Nothing, General. \nPRESIDENT Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order! \nA bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows Staedert's spaceship. \nSTAEDERT (eyes wide) ... Good God! \nThe flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that.... \n33\tINT.  APARTMENT \n... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built, unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there. The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone that is ringing. \nKORBEN (to the cat) I'm coming. \nHe grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the bed makes itself automatically. \nKORBEN (on the phone) Yeah? \nFINGER (V.O.) Hey bud! Finger here. \nHe opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection. \nKORBEN \n(to the cat) Hi sweetie! \n...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas \nFINGER (V.O.) I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training. \nKORBEN I was talking to the cat. \nFINGER (V.O.) Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing. \n...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day. \nKORBEN At least, the cat comes back. \nFINGER (V.O.) (ironical) You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there. \nKORBEN I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one. \nFINGER (V.O.) Don't exist bud. \n...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter. \nKORBEN I just found a picture of you. \nFINGER (V.O.) How do I look? \nKORBEN Like shit. \nKorben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of GEMINI croquettes. On the packet is an ad: WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE. \nThe huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course. Panic aboard the MONDOSHAWAN ship. \n46\tINT.  MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP \nCAPTAIN We've been hit! General alert!!! \nBlast after blast hits the defenseless ship. \nCAPTAIN We're losing control! We have to land fast! \nThe huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking hit after hit. \nCAPTAIN Send out a distress signal!!! Activate the emergency landing procedure! \nThe huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed. \nFIRST OFFICER Impact in less than ten seconds! \nThe red planet looms ever closer. \nCAPTAIN Time is of no importance... \nThe ship crashes in a gigantic explosion. \n46A\tINT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY \nA thermo nuclear explosion fills a T.V. screen..Which Korben's cat watches with interest. \nKorben is about to exit the apartment. \nKORBEN Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your mind. Bye sweetie.. \nIn response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face. \nMUGGER The cash man! \nKORBEN Been here long? \nMUGGER Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow! \nUnperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon. \nKORBEN Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model? \nMUGGER (off balance) Uh.. \nKORBEN You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded.. \nThe mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon. \nMUGGER It's not? \nKORBEN You gotta push the little yellow button... \nKorben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his advice. \nMUGGER Thanks.. \nKORBEN You're welcome.. \nAnd with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun. \nKORBEN ..you know these things are VERY illegal.. you could get in a shit load of trouble.. I better hang onto it for you.. \nAs the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers to his feet and runs off. \nKorben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted. \n46B\tINT.  KORBEN'S  GARAGE - DAY \nKorben enters his taxi.  A robotic voice greets him. \nVOICE Please enter your license.. \nKorben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash. \nVOICE Welcome on board Mr. Dallas.. \nKORBEN How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't. \nKorben hits a button.  The garage door starts to open. \nVOICE Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4... \nKORBEN I had the worst goddamn nightmare. \nVOICE You have nine points left on your license.. \nKORBEN Thanks for reminding me.. \nAs the garage door lifts, the Megalopolis that is New York City in the 23rd century comes into view.  Startling in it's height, and breath. \nVOICE Have a nice day.. \nKorben lets the propulsion build. \nKORBEN Right.. \nHe lets the gear slip.  The taxi rockets off into the City. \nMACTILBURGH (with a smile) I told you ... perfect! \nMunro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty. \nMUNRO ...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the archives before she wakes up. \nMactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes everywhere looking for the case she was holding. \nGIRL (very angry) Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla. Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa! Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno! \nMUNRO (worried) What's she saying? \nMACTILBURGH (to his ASSISTANT) Activate the phonic detector. \nThe girl kicks the window repeatedly. \nMACTILBURGH And give her a light sedative... and something to wear! \nThe ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly. Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with undisguised pleasure. \nMUNRO (to Mactilburgh) This thing solid? \nMACTILBURGH (smiling) An elephant couldn't crack it. \nThe Girl finishes dressing. \nGIRL (angrily) Teno akta chataman assin-omekta! \nMunro smiles safely behind his plate glass window. \nMUNRO (with a smile) You're gonna have to learn to communicate better than that angel if you want out. \nMunro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her. She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He sets off a general alarm. \n54\tINT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY \nThe girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it. \nCHIEF Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you go through the main ventilation! \n55\tINT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY \nThe girl moves along unable to see what's ahead of her. She comes to a dead-end, a grill that leads outside.  She pushes it out and exits onto the ledge. \n56\tEXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN \nShe has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height. The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void. \nCHIEF (to his men) Go on follow her! \nThe COPS stare into the gaping void. \nCOP ...No way. \nThe CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens blaring. \nVOICE (O.S.) This in the police.  Your status is illegal. Please put up your hands and follow our instructions! \nThe girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives off. \n57\tINT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT \nCOP (in the car.) Christ! She dove off! \nIn a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several seconds. She lands on the roof of a flying cab. \n58\tINT.  CAB - NIGHT \nKorben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact. \nVOICE (O.S.) You have just had an accident. Seven points have been temporarily removed... \nKorben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side. \nVOICE / KORBEN You have one point left on your license. Have a good day. \nKorben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up. There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown. \nGIRL Akina delutan, nou-shan. \nKORBEN (lost) ...'Scuse me? \nA police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben. \nCOP (over a loudspeaker) You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle.  We are going to arrest her. Please leave your hands on the wheel. Thank you for your cooperation. \nKORBEN (obeying) Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left on my license and I gotta get to the garage! \nThe police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in her eyes, she looks exhausted. Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around to find something to help her communicate with him. \nHer POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots to Korben a look of pure distress. \nGIRL (irresistible) Please... HELP... \nKorben can't resist her plea. \nKORBEN Don't put me in this position... I can't... I'm late as it is... \nBut he cannot say no to her eyes. \nKORBEN Perfect... \n63\tINT.  SMALL  ROOM \nDavid, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of breath. \nCORNELIUS It's a miracle!!! \nDAVID (worried) What is? \nCORNELIUS (babbling crazily) I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part! \nHe opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in, disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending. \n64\tINT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT \nKorben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open. When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his chin. \nGIRL (angry) Eto Akta Gamat! \nKORBEN (embarrassed) I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured... \nThe girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled. \nKORBEN You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't have kissed you... especially since we haven't been introduced and... (he pulls out a business card) Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is Korben, Korben Dallas. Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open the door this time!. \nThe girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal. \n65\tINT.  SMALL  ROOM \nCornelius is lost in the closet. \nDAVID Father, will you please explain what's going on? \nCORNELIUS The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!! \n66\tINT.  LIVING ROOM \nKORBEN ...What's your name? \nGIRL (after a moment) Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat. \nKORBEN (polite) Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? \nGIRL ...Leeloo. \nKorben is falling in love. \nKORBEN That's... really cute... \nCornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him. He bows before her. \nCORNELIUS Appipulai Leeloo Minai.. \nLEELOO Corn-i-Lius? \nCORNELIUS (bowing) At your service. \nLEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh. Korben smiles. \nDAVID Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being? \nCORNELIUS Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves! \nDavid bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out. \nKORBEN They all like this in your family, father? \nCORNELIUS She's an exception.. \nCORNELIUS Thank you so much for your help Mr...? \nKORBEN Dallas. Korben Dallas. \nCornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben leaving. \nCORNELIUS Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over! \nKORBEN I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better? \nCORNELIUS She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip. \nKORBEN I know. I was there when she arrived. \nCornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it. \nKORBEN Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat? \nCORNELIUS It means, \"Never without my permission\". \nKORBEN That's what I thought. \nCornelius slams the door in his face. \nKORBEN ...Thanks. \n66A\tINT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY \nKorben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR. \nCORNELIUS Perfect. \nLeeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted. \nLEELOO (to David) Domo danko! \nDavid smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over. \nCORNELIUS Leeloo?  The Stones... We must get them back. \nLeeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on. \nLEELOO Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat! \nCORNELIUS You know exactly where they are! \n71\tINT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY \nA group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second metal glove is still grasping the case. \nZORG (pretending to be worried) Aknot?  Is that you? \nThe LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features. \nZORG ...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all! Take it off... \nAKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE. \nZORG That's better! Never be ashamed of who you are... You're warriors... be proud... \nAKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk! \nZORG So what if the Federal Army crushed your entire race and scattered your people to the wind... Your time for revenge is at hand... Voila... the ZF1. \nHe takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch. \nZORG (very fast) ...It's light... the handle's adjustable for easy carrying... good for righties and lefties. \nMeanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse. \nZORG ... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. With the replay button, another Zorg innovation, it's even easier... one shot. \nHe fires at the mannequin. \nZORG ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location... \nZorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin. \nZORG (even faster) I recharge, but the enemy has launched a cowardly sneak attack from behind, the automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the time to turn around and finish the job. 300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies... \nHe fires off each item he names. \nZORG ...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient flame thrower... My favorite. Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very practical. And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube system! \nThe mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,. stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into AKNOT's hands. \nZORG ...Four full crates, delivered right on time! What about you, my dear Aknot, did you bring me what I asked you for? \nAKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case. \nZORG ...Magnificent. \nZorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty \n72\tINT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY \nLeeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again. \nCORNELIUS (astonished) What do you mean empty? \n73\tINT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY \nAKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense. \nZORG Alright..I've got an open mind here.. anyone care to explain? \n74\tINT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY \nLeeloo explains what happened in her language. \nCORNELIUS (translating) She says that the Guardians never really had much faith in humans. They were afraid of being attacked. The stones were given to someone they could trust who took another route. She's supposed to contact this person in a little less than twelve hours from now in a hotel. She's looking for the address! \nA map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points. \nLEELOO Dot! \nThe little group comes over to look. \nDAVID Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation \nCornelius plops down into his armchair. \nCORNELIUS ...We're saved! \n75\tINT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY \nZORG I'm fucked! \nZorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare. \nZorg turns to Cornelius. \nZORG Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again \nCORNELIUS I remember you now..the so called art dealer. \nZORG I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones? \nCORNELIUS ...Why on earth do the stones interest you? \nZORG Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me... \nCORNELIUS Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you. \nZORG Why?  What's wrong with me? \nCORNELIUS ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it. \nZORG Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain... \nZorg leads Cornelius into his inner office. \nZORG ...would you like a drink? \nCORNELIUS No thank you. \nZORG Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass. \nZorg pushes the glass with his finger. \nZORG Here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is... \nZorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor. \nZORG Destroyed... \nSmall individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping out to clean up the mess. \nZORG ...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life! \nCORNELIUS They are robots! \nA SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry into it. \nZORG Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. I gave work to at least fifty people today. The engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong.  Children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life! \nCornelius sits in silence. \nZORG Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business! \nCORNELIUS Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another. \nZORG Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years. \nZorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink. Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts to panic. \nCORNELIUS (mocking) Where's the robot to pat your back? \nZorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk. True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around the desk.  Zorg motions for help. \nCORNELIUS Can I give you a hand? \nCornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in. \nZORG You saved my life... So, I'm going to spare yours. (to the GUARDS) Throw him out! \nThe GUARDS throw Cornelius out. \nCORNELIUS You are a monster, Zorg! \nZORG (complimented) I know... \nThe GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office. \nZORG ...Torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but I want those Stones. You have an hour. \nRight Arm salutes and hurries out of the office. \n84\tEXT.  MANHATTAN  STREET - OMIT \n85\tINT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE - OMIT \n86\tINT./EXT.  STREET / TAXI - OMIT \n87\tINT.

This is gonna take a while! \nThe Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window. \nKORBEN Other than that... You all right? \nMOTHER (V.O.) ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! \nThe Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food. \nKORBEN (to the cat) I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? \nMOTHER (V.O.) I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it? \nKORBEN All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly.. \nA message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on. \nMOTHER (V.O.) You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! \nKORBEN Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. \nMOTHER (V.O.) They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead! \nHe eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.- \nKORBEN Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back. \nKorben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a Captain and a Major. MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache. Munro opens a file. \nMUNRO (clipped) Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance. \nKORBEN What mission? \nMUNRO To save the world. \nKORBEN Where have I heard this song before? \nMUNRO You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'? \nKORBEN (a little bewildered) Just one... why me? \nMUNRO Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission. \nMunro pulls out a long list of documents. \nMUNRO Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated. \nKORBEN And the third one? \nMUNRO You're the only one left alive... \nMunro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at. \nMUNRO Don't you open your messages? \nKORBEN I've had enough good news for today \nMUNRO (by rote) You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets. \nHe hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it. \nKORBEN You rigged the contest? \nMunro nods. \nMUNRO Major Iceborg will accompany you... as your wife... \nThe idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick. \nKORBEN (sarcastic) You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet? \nMUNRO Old tricks are the best tricks eh? \nKORBEN I'm not going. \nMUNRO Why not? \nKORBEN One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive. \n110A\tINT.  KORBEN'S  HALL \nLeeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the. number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell. \n110B\tINT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT \nThe doorbell rings. \nKORBEN ...Scuse me. \nKorben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo. Korben panics, overcome with happiness. \nThe neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He could pass for Korben. \nNEIGHBOR Fuck you!! \n113\tINT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT \nKorben still has his hands to the wall. \nKORBEN Wrong answer. \nSHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle. \n114\tINT.  HALL \nThe riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone. \nCOP OK, we got the guy under wraps. \n115\tINT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE \nRight Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg. \nCOP (O.S.) It was not easy, but we bagged him!. Thanks for the tip! \nRIGHT ARM (smiling) Glad to help. \nHe hangs up. \nRIGHT ARM They just arrested the guy for Uranium smuggling. Everything's going as planned. \nHe shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's name. \nRIGHT ARM All I have to do now is to go to the airport and take his place.  I should be in Fhloston in less than four hours. \nZorg sits there quietly for a moment. \nZORG Don't come back without the Stones. \n116\tINT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT \nKorben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth chattering from the cold. \nKORBEN I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time. \nHis eyes fall on an old blanket. \nKORBEN Here let me wrap you up. \nKorben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder. Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses. \nKORBEN ..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and you've ended up in my arms both times. \nLeeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far. She recovers, looking embarrassed too. \nLEELOO (nicely) Valo massa... Chacha hamas. \nKORBEN Uh..you're welcome. \nThe intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion. \nKORBEN Coffee!  That's what you need! A nice, hot cup of coffee! \nHe pushes a button on the coffee machine. \nKORBEN With some honey!  You'll see, honey's great!... \nKorben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to quite understand everything that is going on. \nKORBEN A hot cup of coffee... with honey... \nHe rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon.. \nKORBEN (nervously) I've got this great honey somewhere. You know about honey?  There used to be these little animals who made it with antenna... \n..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero. \nKORBEN ..and these other animals who ate it.. one were bees the other were bears.. \nShe looks back to the man fumbling for honey. \nKORBEN I forget which ate it and which made it but.. \nAnd she smiles. \nKORBEN Here it is! \nKorben holds up the jar of honey. \nKORBEN Taste this... \nLeeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth. \nKORBEN It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it? \nShe savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous. \nAn indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until it becomes quite a racket. \nKORBEN You hear that? \nDavid gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes. \nBack a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back. \nKORBEN (friendly) Hey! I really thought I was going to miss my flight! (to David) Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on the conveyor belt? \nDAVID (freaking) Uh... yeah. \nKORBEN (smiling) Great! Now beat it! \nParalyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant. \nKORBEN Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the flight that I sent the kid here to pick up my boarding card. \nHe looks at David's fake ID. \nKORBEN ...My cousin David... \nLeeloo is unable to hold back a smile. \nCHECK-IN ATTENDANT (looking at Leeloo's ID) Your wife? \nKorben grabs the ID and reads it. \nKORBEN Uh, yes... Newlyweds. (aside) You know how it is... Love at first sight. You meet, something goes tilt,. you get married, you hardly know each other. Right, darling? \nLeeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand. \nLEELOO (sharply) Dinoine chagantakat! \nKORBEN Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. (to Check-in Attendant) It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better. \nHe winks at the stewardess. \nANGLE ON: \nThe neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared. \nCOP (to pig) \nCome on, snyffer, go root! \nThe pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack. Cornelius sits at a bar. \nCORNELIUS (to the bartender) I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty work. I know she was made to be strong but she's also so fragile... So human. You know what I mean? \nThe bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink. \nANGLE ON: \nThe nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in attendant. \nCHECK-IN ATTENDANT (surprised) Dallas... Korben... \nNEIGHBOR (in a different voice) Yes, that's me. \nThe check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on their faces, revealing two other faces: \nMangalores. \nCHECK-IN ATTENDANT (smiling) Just a minute, please. \nShe hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong. \nNEIGHBOR We'll be right back ... we're gonna check out the duty free... \nThey spin around and hurry away. \nANGLE ON: \nCornelius at the bar, half in the bag. \nROBOT The same? \nCORNELIUS Yeah... \nDAVID (V.O.) Make that two... \nCornelius turns to David. \nCORNELIUS Where's Leeloo? \nDAVID On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. \nCORNELIUS It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here! \nHe hands David the Temple Key from around his neck. \nCORNELIUS Here's the key to the Temple.. Prepare for our arrival! \nCornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot, and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are very nervous. A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them. \nNEIGHBOR (to the tawdry girl) Tell Aknot plan A flopped. Tell him to go to plan B. \nThe tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears. \nCOP (into walkie-talkie) ...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7! \nANGLE ON: \nHe pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down. Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from the wall, all aimed at him. \nVOICE (O.S.) This is not an exercise.  This is a police control. Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles... \nRIGHT ARM (slowing down) Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited... that's all... I'm calm now. \n125\tINT.  SHUTTLE - DAY \nKorben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she is doing. \nLEELOO Apipoulai! \nKORBEN Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos... \nLeeloo smiles, as if complimented. \nKORBEN Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets... they're not mine... I mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks... I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble... I'd love to be on vacation with you... but now.... now I've got to work... And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace. \nLeeloo types in \"LOVE\" on the keyboard. \nLEELOO Love... \nKORBEN Yes! But \"love\" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is! \nLeeloo types in this new word. \nLEELOO (rather pleased) Peace... and love... \nShe brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign. Korben sighs and switches off the screen. \nKORBEN Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience.. \nLEELOO (quite happy) What is... Make Love? \nKorben just stares at her for a few minutes. \nKORBEN Know what? On that subject maybe you'd be better off asking the screen. \nHe turns the computer back on. \nANGLE ON: \nA STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on top of each individual box. \nVOICE (O.S.) ...to make your flight as short and agreeable as possible, our flight attendants are switching on the timing sleeper which will regulate your sleep during the trip... \nANGLE ON: \nLEELOO (switching off the screen) OK! Finished! \nKORBEN Finished what? \nLEELOO Learning language. \nKORBEN Which one? \nLEELOO All 900. \nKorben doesn't know if he should laugh or not. \nKORBEN You learned 900 languages in five minutes?! \nLEELOO (pleased) Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine! \nKORBEN I know how to say \"Hello\". Teach me how to say \"Good-bye\", that's all I need. \nLEELOO Apipoussan! \nKORBEN Apipoussan? \nLEELOO Good! Do you know how we say \"make love\"? \nKORBEN (fumbling) Uh... \nLEELOO ...Hoppi-hoppa. \nKorben literally melts. \nKORBEN (to himself) Help... \nLuckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window. \nSTEWARDESS Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas! \nThe stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately fall asleep. \nA STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem. \nSTEWARDESS 2 Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume your individual position. \nLOC RHOD (hugging her) I don't want an individual position, I want all positions! \nSTEWARDESS 2 (resisting somewhat) We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod! \nLOC RHOD Now you're talking! \n126\tINT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE \nThree CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff. \n- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to lift her of. \n- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number. \nZORG \n- The engines at full blast. \n- The stewardess in close to screaming. \nPILOT Liftoff. \n- The copilot pushes a button. \n- So does Zorg. \n- The engines release their full power. \n- The stewardess screams in ecstasy. \n- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and everything else   within 60 feet. \n140\tINT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE \nThe stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain. \n141\tINT.  COCKPIT \nIn the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up. \nCOPILOT (relaxing) Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up. \n142\tINT.  CABIN \nKorben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her face and her hand in Korben's. \n143\tEXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT \nThe spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed. Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence. \n144\tEXT.  SPACE \nThe nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops and it becomes gray and cold. \n145\tINT.  SPACESHIP \nIn the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of the devices suddenly starts working. \nTECHNICIAN All right! We're finally getting something! \n146\tINT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE \nThe Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired than ever. \nHEAD SCIENTIST The thing is sending out radio wavelengths! \nPRESIDENT What the hell does it want with radio waves? \nHEAD SCIENTIST ...Probably wants to make a call! \nThe President and his Generals look at him in astonishment. \n147\tINT.  ZORG'S OFFICE \nPicasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings. \nSECRETARY (O.S.) Mr. Shadow on the line. \nZorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to attention. \nZORG Yes... Zorg here. \nThe voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the bowels of the universe. \nSHADOW Am I disturbing you? \nZORG No... not at all.  Where are you? \nSHADOW'S breathing is awesome. \nSHADOW ...Not far, now. \nZORG Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last! \nZorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons. \nIn the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human, quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is. Zorg feels sick. \nSHADOW Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg? \nZORG Got it. \nSHADOW How's our deal coming along? \nZORG (ill at ease) Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled. \nShadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time. \nSHADOW Money is of no importance... I want the Stones! \nLeeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:\ta rest room for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her. Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles. \n160\tINT.

KORBEN'S  STATEROOM \nThe door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben follows her, gaping at all the luxury. \nThe BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases. \nKorben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in that evening.  Dress: Formal attire. \nKORBEN For the concert it says formal attire... I didn't bring... \nThe hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row. \nHOSTESS (looking him over) Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after the concert to open it. \nShe gives him a blinding smile and closes the door. \nKorben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity. Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of his reverie. \nKORBEN Hello? \nMOTHER (O.S.) You little sleaze bag! \nKORBEN ...Ma??? \nMOTHER (O.S.) Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands! \nKorben drops into an armchair and sighs.

Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged. They hold up a THIRD COP. \nCHIEF OF POLICE What happened? A bomb go off in your face? \nBEAT-UP COP Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb... with green eyes. \nCornelius perks up. \nCORNELIUS And the smile of an angel? \nThey all turn to look at him. \nCORNELIUS (to Chief) May I speak to you alone. \n167\tINT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY \nLeeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of PORTERS carrying trunks. \nNot wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy. The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her. \nDIVA'S ASSISTANT Please forgive this little incident. She wants you to know that she senses great powers in you... in the service of a noble cause... She will give you what you have come to get, but she wants to sing first... One last time... \nThe Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up. \nDIVA'S ASSISTANT (nodding) Miss. \nLeeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better. \n168\tEXT.

POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT \nA door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet. \nFighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden nearby, still on the air. \nLOC RHOD (voice low, panicked) They're hideous. They've got a crest on the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers all over their hands. Totally hideous! \n207\tINT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE. \nMUNRO (worried) ...Mangalores! \nPRESIDENT Send a battalion out immediately! \n208\tINT.

How was the concert? \nKorben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist. \nKORBEN I've never heard anything so beautiful in my life. \nA Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him and grabs his gun. \nDIVA (weak) You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you... \nKORBEN Who? \nDIVA The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife... \nKorben is floored. \nKORBEN Leeloo... is... she's... \nDIVA Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them. \nKORBEN (to himself, suddenly realizing) ...So Cornelius was telling the truth! \n209\tINT.  POLICE  STATION \nThe Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together. \nCORNELIUS (to the Chief of Police) Of course I was telling you the truth!...

She needs your help and your love. She's more fragile than she seems... \nKorben looks around, ready for another attack. \nKORBEN ...Yeah, so am I. \nThe Diva takes his hand. \nDIVA She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live! \nKORBEN (uncomfortable) I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are! \nDIVA Do you love her? \nKORBEN I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time! \nDIVA I don't have time... I need to know. \nKORBEN Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again. \nDIVA I would like to have died in peace... \nThe Diva's eyes close. \n211\tINT.  DIVA'S  SUITE \nThe timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to \"15 minutes\". \n212\tINT.

She comes around somewhat. \nKORBEN I'm sorry, but... the Stones... \nDIVA (very weak) They are... with me... \nThe Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.

He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1. Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card. \nZORG (smiling) Allow me... \nZorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down from 5 minutes. \nZORG Just for the fun of it. \nLoc Rhod faints. \nZORG Well, what do we have here? Is this Korben Dallas? The famous winner of the Gemini Croquette contest? Or is this Korben Dallas from Special Section sent by old Lindberg himself. \nKorben doesn't reply. \nZORG ...In any event, whoever you are, I was glad to meet you. \nZorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again. Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic. \nZORG ...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off 3000 rounds... did I? \nKORBEN Don't you know how to count. It's not all that hard. Watch! \nKorben punches him square in the face, shows him his index. \nKORBEN One! That's for trying to kill me! \nSecond Punch. \nKORBEN Two! That's for firing me! Three!

A yellow beam pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile. \nKORBEN Quickly, everyone on a Stone! Water for water!  Fire for fire! Earth for earth! \nThe two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears. \nLoc Rhod has a problem. \nLOC RHOD (shaking) I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking last week!

Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams. An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise. \nCORNELIUS Come on Leeloo! Come on! \nThe beam loses its intensity.

Korben quickly straightens Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams. \nKORBEN Leeloo! If you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die! And that's not on my agenda for today. \nLeeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck. \nLEELOO (weak) What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them! \nKORBEN You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things... \nLEELOO ...Like love... \nKORBEN Exactly. \nLEELOO But I don't know love...

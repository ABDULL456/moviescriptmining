Bender points at Brian. 
BENDER ...they are. (to Brian) What do you guys do in your club? 
BRIAN In physics, um, we ah, we talk about physics...about properties of physics. 
BENDER So it's sorta social...demented and sad, but social.  Right? 
BRIAN Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation.  I mean there are other children in my club and uh, at the end of the year we have, um, you know, a big banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton. 
BENDER You load up, you party... 
BRIAN Well, no, we get dressed up...I mean, but, we don't...we don't get high. 
CLAIRE (to Bender) Only burners like you get high... 
BRIAN And, uh, I didn't have any shoes. So I had to borrow my dad's.  It was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me to wear other people's shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana... He got high once and you know, he started eating like really weird foods.  And uh, and then he just felt like he didn't belong anywhere. You know, kinda like, you know "Twilight Zone" kinda. 
CLAIRE (laughs) (to Bender) Sounds like you... 
ANDREW Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here...I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads... 
BENDER (to Andrew) Oh and wouldn't that be a bite... 
Bender lets out a moan of fake agony. 
BENDER Missing a whole wrestling meet! 
ANDREW Well you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot!  You never competed in your whole life! 
BENDER (with mock hurt) Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside because of it.  I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys! 
ANDREW Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You don't have any goals. 
BENDER Oh, but I do! 
ANDREW Yeah? 
BENDER I wanna be just--like--you!  I figure all I need's a labotamy and some tights! 
Brian becomes interested. 
BRIAN You wear tights? 
ANDREW (to Brian) No I don't wear tights, I wear the required uniform... 
BRIAN Tights... 
ANDREW (defensive) Shut up! 
They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table. Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway. 
BRIAN You know there's not s'posed to be any monkey business! 
Bender turns and points at Brian. 
BENDER (in a stern voice) Young man...have you finished your paper? 
Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.

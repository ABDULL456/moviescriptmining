MA Maybe she's tired.

Jack, on the bed: he squirms, twists, bounces with intense boyish energy. 
Beside the bed now, he runs on the spot at maximum speed. In the background we see Ma cooking.

Later the same day. Ma is napping. Jack is playing on the floor. Counting things. Tracing the patterns of rug with his finger. 
What was that? He stares at the floor by the stove; glimpses something. 
Jack tiptoes over, but the moving thing is gone. He looks furtively at Ma then takes out the cake. He crumbles some and sets the plate on the floor. He squats and waits. 
A mouse puts its nose out, sniffs and takes a crumb. 
Something smashes into the stove: one of Ma's heavy books. 
Jack cries out in shock and distress. 
JACK You made him gone! 
Ma starts to sweep up the crumbs. 
JACK (CONT'D) He was an alive thing, he was real! 
MA They'd steal our food. 
She crawls under the counter, finds the hole. Tears aluminum foil from the roll. Scrunches it. JACK Mouse can have my food, I'm not hungry. 
MA They'd bring in germs, bite us in the night.

JACK Mouse is my friend and you splatted him dead. 
MA No I didn't, he's hunky-dory. 
She stops blocking up the hole to hug Jack. 
JACK Are you just tricking me? 
MA I swear, he's safe at home with his Ma in the backyard. 
JACK What backyard? 
Ma, realizing her slip, tidies up instead of answering. 
JACK (CONT'D) Mouse lives in a yard in TV? 
Ma holds up the aluminum foil to distract him. 
MA Hey, let's make a UFO with this. 
Jack brings out the other grudge he's been nursing. 
JACK Why you didn't tell Old Nick it was my birthday? 
MA Because he's not our friend. 
JACK He said he'd brung me a present. 
MA You shouldn't hear what he - You're meant to be asleep. 
JACK I never had a present. 
MA He didn't mean it. 
JACK It might be Lucky my dog. 
(CONTINUED) 16   CONTINUED: (2)                                           16 
MA Jack. We can't have a dog. We don't have room - (sees him misunderstand) - space, enough space - cooped up in here with the barking, the scratching... 
JACK Lucky won't scratch, he promises. 
MA There is no Lucky! 
JACK Yeah there is. 
MA He's just made-up, in your head, he's not real. 
Devastated, Jack bursts into tears. 
Ma sits down beside him and strokes him. 
17   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                            17 
That evening. Jack sits in Ma's lap, watching a TALK-SHOW hostess interview a one-armed war veteran. Ma is threading eggshells onto a string, hundreds of shells long. Jack gently supports the unraveled part. 
Ma lets out a big yawn and discreetly rubs her aching jaw.

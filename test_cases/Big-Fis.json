{"train": "\"BIG FISH\" \nWritten by \nJohn August \nBased on the novel by \nDaniel Wallace \nFinal Production Draft \nThis is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion. \nFADE IN: \nA RIVER. \nWe're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along. \nThis is The Beast. \nEDWARD (V.O.) There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish. They're just touched by something extra. Call it luck. Call it grace. One such fish was The Beast. \nThe Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried. \nEDWARD (V.O.) By the time I was born, he was already a legend. He'd taken more hundred- dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before. Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period. \nINT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973) \nWILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction. \nEDWARD I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition. All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you. (closer) And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him. \nEXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977) \nA few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe. \nEDWARD Now, I'd tried everything on it: worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese. But on that day I had a revelation: if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work. I would have to use something he truly desired. \nEdward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight. \nLITTLE BRAVE (confused) Your finger? \nEdward slips his ring off. \nEDWARD Gold. \nWhile the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored. He's heard this story before. \nEDWARD I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver. \nINT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987) \nEdward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing. \nEDWARD (CONT'D) The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water. And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line. \nWILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door. \nEDWARD You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish. \nON WILL AND SANDRA \nWILL (low but insistent) Make him stop. \nHis mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie. \nWILL'S DATE What did you do? \nEDWARD I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in. \nWill regards his father with exasperated contempt. \nEDWARD With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river. I looked him straight in the eye. And I made a remarkable discovery. \nINT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14\u00b0) - NIGHT (1998) \nWILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious. \nEdward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is cozy and drunk. \nEDWARD This fish, the Beast. The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her. It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day. \nOver near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding. \nEDWARD Now, I was in a situation. I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others. \nWill can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice. \nEDWARD Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be- born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own? This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny. \nWILL (V.O.) In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth. The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me. \nWe LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something changes. \nSure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him. \nWILL (V.O.) It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened. \nSuddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of \nTHE BEAST. \nHe brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring. \nWILL (V.O.) But that's what kind of story this is. \nSmiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash. \nTITLE OVER: \nBIG FISH \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nYoung Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner... \nYOUNG DR. BENNETT Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to give me one good push. On three. One... \nSuddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up into air. \nThe NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face. \nAs it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races after it. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY \nBursting through the doors -- \nYOUNG DR. BENNETT Grab that baby! \nA NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief. \nWILL (V.O.) My father's birth would set the pace for his unlikely life. No longer than most men's, but larger. And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all. \nINT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY \nOver the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound. \nAs it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in its carton. \nKEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone. \nJOSEPHINE Allo oui? \nWill begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine. \nJOSEPHINE (on phone) Yes, he's here. \nShe hands the phone to Will, concerned. \nJOSEPHINE It's your mother. \nHalf-stripped, Will takes the phone. This won't be good news. \nWILL (on phone) Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. \nAs Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is. \nWILL (CONT'D) What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait. \nHe covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine. \nJOSEPHINE It's bad. \nWILL It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo. \nJOSEPHINE You need to go. \nWILL Probably tonight. \nA beat. \nJOSEPHINE I'm going with you. \nWILL You don't have to. \nJOSEPHINE (a simple fact) I'm going with you. \nINT. AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT \nAs the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach. Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion. \nIn the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows what is lurking in the shadows? \nADULT EDWARD (V.O.) Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared. For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers. \nWe finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate. \nWILBUR FREELY I hear if you look right at it, you can see how you're gonna die. \nEDWARD That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's not even a real witch. \nDON PRICE You're so sure, why don't you go in and get that eye? I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable. \nEdward looks back at the spooky house. \nDON PRICE Or are you too scared? \nEDWARD I'll go in right now and get that eye. \nDON PRICE Then do it. \nEDWARD Fine, I will. \nDON PRICE Fine, you do it. \nEDWARD Fine, I'm doing it. \nHe hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate. \nRUTHIE Edward, don't! \nWILBUR FREELY She'll make soap out of you! (to Ruthie) That's what she does, she makes soap out of people. \nEdward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway. \nWilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar. \nEXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE \nEdward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door. Anything could jump out of them. \nHe steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. \nThe doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally \nRINGS THE DOORBELL. \nImpossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down. \nEDWARD (calm and straightforward) Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there's some folks'd like to see your eye. \nEXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT \nZacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the gate. \nDON PRICE You get the eye? \nEDWARD I brought it. \nDON PRICE (dubious) Let's see it. \nThe Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow. \nWe RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY \nAn OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. Dead. \nEXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT \nWe RUSH IN on Don Price. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY \nTwenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout. Very much dead. \nEXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT \nDon and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears in his eyes. \nZACKY I saw how I was gonna die. I was old, and I fell. \nDON PRICE I wasn't old at all. \nThe brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles. \nEXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT \nHe judges her belly. \nDR. BENNETT You're seven months. \nJOSEPHINE (impressed) To the day. \nHe leans close to her, whispering in her ear... \nDR. BENNETT It's a boy. \nShe smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- what did he say? Josephine shakes her head. \nBack to the main subject... \nSANDRA You don't think he looks any worse. \nDR. BENNETT No. I would say he's the same. \nAnd in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for. \nWILL Can I see him? \nDR. BENNETT Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him. \nA moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't spoken in years. \nSandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the counter. \nSANDRA Get him to drink one of these. He won't, but tell him he has to. \nINT. FOYER - DAY \nComing out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. They CREAK with every step. \nThe wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY \nA crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper. \nAlmost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. Then goes inside. \nINT. GUEST ROOM - DAY \nEdward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact. \nThere are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing. \nComing up to the bed -- \nWILL Dad? \nEdward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries to say something, but no words come out. \nHe looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips. \nFinished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence. \nFinally... \nEDWARD You -- (he points) -- are in for a surprise. \nWILL Am I? \nEDWARD Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings... \nWILL Did you do any of that? \nEDWARD No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine. \nWILL You think I'm up for it? \nEDWARD You learned from the best. \nWill doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils. \nWILL Just drink half the can. I'll tell her you drank the whole thing. Everyone wins. \nA beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open the can, finding a straw on the nightstand. \nEDWARD People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go. \nWILL Really. \nEDWARD Truly. I saw it in The Eye. \nWILL The Old Lady by the swamp. \nEDWARD She was a witch. \nWILL No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic. \nEDWARD (V.O.) Truth is, no one quite knew what was wrong. Most times, a person grows up gradually. I found myself in a hurry. \nINT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY \nYoung Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor. \nEDWARD (V.O.) My muscles couldn't keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn't keep up with my body's ambition. So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration. I had made it all the way to the \"G's,\" hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish. \nINSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings. \nYOUNG EDWARD (reading) \"Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish will remain small. With more space, the fish can grow double, triple, or quadruple its size.\" \nYoung Edward thinks this through. \nEDWARD (V.O.) It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was that I was intended for larger things. After all, a giant man can't have an ordinary-sized life. \nEXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY \nThe CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds the bases. \nAlthough we've seen him briefly before, this is our first real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from roughly the ages of 18 to 30. \nEDWARD (V.O.) As soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration, I set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in Ashton. \nEXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY \nSINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret love: \nGIRL Edward Bloom! \nThe other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, glowers. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nSINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of his teenage EMPLOYEES. \nEdward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, \"Bloom Landscaping.\" He has workers on every lawn. \nHe signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT. \nINT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY \nEdward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game. \nAs the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only teammate who doesn't mob him. \nEXT. TOWN - DAY \nEdward carries a dog out of a burning house. \nINT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY \nEdward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine labelled \"Perpetual Motion.\" He and the JUDGE pose for a photograph. A FLASH. \nPissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the trash. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY \nA dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don Price is the ass-end of a horse costume. \nEdward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious. \nEXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY \nEdward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight. \nEDWARD (V.O.) I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen. Until one day, a stranger arrived. \nEXT. FARM - DAY \nAs two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly the shape of man, but no human could be that large. \nEXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY \nTwo fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They BLEAT in panic as \nTWO OVERSIZED HANDS \nreach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the full stranger. \nEXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY \nA MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. Amid the crowd we see Don Price. \nSHARECROPPER He ate an entire cornfield! \nLITTLE GIRL He ate my dog! \nHOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor, we will! \nMAYOR I won't have mob violence in this town. Now, has someone tried talking to him? \nEdward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders. \nEDWARD I have to leave. Tonight. \nBEAMEN Why? \nEDWARD This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere. \nBEAMEN No one's ever left. \nJENNY How are you gonna make it without your shoes? \nEDWARD I suspect it will hurt a lot. \nAnd with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads. \nPoor Edward Bloom's gone crazy. \nBEAMEN (calling after him) You won't find a better place! \nEDWARD I don't expect to. \nJenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could. \nJENNY Promise me you'll come back. \nEDWARD I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to. \nIt's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps walking. \nEXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT \nVARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. It's horrible. Almost unendurable. \nAnd then it gets worse. \nThe trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him. \nSnake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING. \nEDWARD (V.O.) As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually. After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life. \nAs he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud. \nScrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. \nHe SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone. \nEDWARD And then I realized, this wasn't the end of my life. \nWith a sudden calm... \nEDWARD (aloud) This isn't how I die. \nAnother lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING. \nEXT. THE ROAD - DAY \nHis bare foot steps onto asphalt. \nA DEEP VOICE Friend! \nEdward turns to see \nKARL \nto his right, coming down the larger, paved road. \nKARL What happened to your shoes? \nEdward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet. \nEDWARD They got ahead of me. \nWith that, the men start walking down the larger road. \nCROSSFADE TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nEdward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual. \nThe other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence. \nWILL I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek. \nSANDRA Really! That's wonderful. \nJOSEPHINE I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible. \nSANDRA We'll have to pick up a copy. \nCASHIER Never seen her before. Pretty, though. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his back. \nAt the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence -- he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over him. \nEDWARD (playfully lecherous) Hello. \nShe smiles. \nJOSEPHINE Hi. How are you feeling? \nEDWARD I was dreaming. \nJOSEPHINE What were you dreaming about? \nHe tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods. \nEDWARD I don't usually remember unless they're especially portentous. You know what that word means, portentous? \nShe shakes her head. \nEDWARD Means when you dream about something that's going to happen. (beat, gathering) Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, \"Your Aunt is going to die.\" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead. \nJOSEPHINE That's terrible. \nEDWARD Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, \"Your Grampa is going to die.\" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead. \nHe sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning. \nEDWARD For the next couple weeks, I didn't have another dream. Until one night the crow came back and said, \"Your Daddy is going to die.\" (beat) Well, I didn't know what to do. But finally I told my father. And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled. That next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head. Because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words: your Daddy is going to die. Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time. And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day. He said to my mother, \"Good God. I just had the worst day of my life.\" (beat) \"You think you've had a bad day,\" she said. \"This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!\" Josephine smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him smiling too. \nA long beat. Then, deadpan... \nEDWARD Because see, my mother was banging the milkman. \nJOSEPHINE No, I understand. \nEDWARD He was slipping her a little extra cream. \nShe nods, a bit more of a laugh. \nEDWARD He was filling her basket. He was making deliveries around back. \nAs Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, especially as the metaphors get more vulgar. \nEDWARD He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box. \nJOSEPHINE Stop. \nEDWARD They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle. \nShe's starting to cry from laughing. \nEDWARD Cracking the eggs and making an omelet. \nWith that, he stops. She regains her composure. \nEDWARD Spooning the sherbet. \nJOSEPHINE (interrupting) Can I take your picture? \nEDWARD You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary. \nJOSEPHINE Please? \nHe rolls his eyes, why not. \nJosephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. We STAY WITH Edward in bed. \nJOSEPHINE (O.S.) I have photos from the wedding to show you. There's a great one of you and my father. I had an extra print made. \nEdward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is. \nHe controls his breathing, trying to push through it. \nJOSEPHINE I want to see pictures of your wedding. I've never seen any. \nShe returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain. \nEDWARD That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else. \nJOSEPHINE (loading film) I never knew. \nEDWARD Will never told you that? (she shakes her head) Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor. \nJOSEPHINE Oh, so this is a tall tale? \nEDWARD Well, it's not a short one. \nCROSSFADE TO: \nTHE EMPTY LOT \nColossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops and lets him climb in back. \nAs the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll never find that girl, the love of his life. \nINT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT \nAmos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He spots Edward walking back into the tent. \nAMOS Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star. \nEDWARD That's great. \nAmos hands off the contract to a CLOWN. \n(INTRODUCING) My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom. \nEDWARD Good to meet you. \nMr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off. \nAMOS What's the matter with you, kid? I haven't seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife. (beat) Get it? \"Depressed?\" \nKarl chuckles. \nAMOS See! The big guy likes it. \nEDWARD I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her. \nAMOS Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives. \nEDWARD (with absolute conviction) I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone. \nAMOS Jesus, kid. (realizing) Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat? \nEDWARD Yes! \nAMOS I know her uncle. Friends of the family. \nEDWARD Who is she? Where does she live? \nAMOS Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league. \nAs Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him. Karl follows as well. \nEDWARD What do you mean? You don't even know me. \nAMOS Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back. \nEDWARD I've got a whole backpack full of clothes! \nHe points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found. \nEDWARD (realizing) Someone stole my backpack. \nAMOS Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there. \nGetting in front of Amos, Edward stops him. \nEDWARD Wait. You said I don't have a plan. I do. I'm going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. \nAmos smiles, amused. \nEDWARD I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet. \nAMOS Sorry, kid. I don't do charity. \nEDWARD I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is. \nAmos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he can say no. He shrugs. What the hell. \nAMOS Every month you work for me, I'll tell you one thing about her. That's my final offer. \nEdward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. We move into a MONTAGE: \nINT. BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead. \nThe CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes Edward antsier. \nEDWARD (V.O.) From that moment on, I did everything Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of things he didn't. I'd go three days without stopping to eat, and four days without sleeping. \nEXT. THE HYDRA - DAY \nHis eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride. \nEDWARD (V.O.) The only thing that kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl who would be my wife. \nSeeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can. The dog bounds after it, \nSMASHING DOWN THREE CARS. \nIt returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth. \nEDWARD It was that night I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties. \nEdward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new direction. \nTRANSITION TO: \nEXT. FIELD - PRE-DAWN \nExhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned. \nHe follows it into the woods. \nINT. WOODS - DAWN \nAmos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches. \nAMOS Didn't kill anything, did I? \nEDWARD A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead. \nAMOS That would explain the indigestion. \nEdward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates. \nAMOS I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl. \nEDWARD There's only one I want. \nA beat. \nAMOS Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nAMOS Good luck, kid. \nEdward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there as soon as possible. \nAmos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot. \nEXT. BIG TOP - DAY \nEdward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug. \nEDWARD (V.O.) After saying my goodbyes, I hopped three trains to get to Auburn that afternoon. \nEXT. AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY \nWe DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain. \nHe changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era. \nEXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY \nEdward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half- open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. \nFinally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight. \nHe can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on. \nEDWARD You don't know me, but my name is Edward Bloom and I am in love with you. I've spent the last three years working to find out who you are. I've been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times, had my ribs broken twice, but it's all worth it to see you here, now, and to finally get to talk to you. Because I am destined to marry you. I knew that from the first moment I saw you at the circus. And I know it now more than ever. \nON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say is... \nSANDRA I'm sorry. \nEDWARD Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today... \nShe puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, we see a diamond. \nSANDRA No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be married. \nON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front. \nEDWARD Oh. \nSANDRA But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you. \nFLASHCUTS TO: \nEXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT \nYoung Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward. \nVARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS 93 \nBackstage, the two men are still fighting. \nPING (chorus) I've had twice the adventure, Cried double the tears. Two times the bad times in half the years. I need a strong man, because I've got Twice the love to give. \nFor the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was standing in profile. Ping is one-half of \nSIAMESE TWINS. \nHer identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them. \nEdward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It costs him a punch to the jaw. \nPING Say hello, Jing. \nJING Hello Jing. \nPING (to the crowd) I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good one. (closer) I'm the bad one. \nAs the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook. \nAs Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, their backs forming the curves. \nEdward slips behind curtains, trying to get away. \nThe soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. The curtain slowly lowers, revealing \nEDWARD'S PARACHUTE. \nThe APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee yells for the Guards to search. \nON STAGE \nPing has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nAs ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish. \nIn Chinese, subtitled... \nPING How could you miss your cue? You make me look like a fool, out there alone. \nJING You weren't alone. \nPing HUFFS, turning her back on her sister. \nJing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to look. \nPING Who the hell are you? \nEDWARD (in Chinese) I'm not going to hurt you. \nPING Damn right you're not. (yelling) GUARD! \nJing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A rifle-toting GUARD looks in. \nPretending to be her bitchy sister -- \nJING Tell your men not to bother us! And lock that door! \nThe guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Desperately flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds... \nEDWARD Please, I need your help. \nPING What makes you think we'll help you? \nEdward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. It's Sandra. \nCROSSFADE TO: \nVARIOUS SHOTS \nEDWARD (V.O.) Over the next hour, I described my love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and the ordeal that brought me before them. As it had always been, this love was my salvation. It was destined to be. \nHearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear. Even Ping is a little affected. \nEDWARD (V.O.) We put together an elaborate plan for escape, involving a whaling ship to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all knew it would be dangerous. \nStill subtitled: \nPING And what are we supposed to do when we get to America? \nEDWARD I can get you bookings. I know the biggest man in show business. \nJING Bob Hope? \nEDWARD Bigger. \nTRANSITION TO: \nEXT. TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY \nThe family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better. Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry. \nHe watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup. \nEDWARD Did I ever tell you about how... \nWILL (interrupting) Yes. \nEdward is startled. \nWILL The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it. \nEDWARD (re: Josephine) I think someone hasn't. \nJOSEPHINE The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car. \nA beat. \nEDWARD (undeterred) But the real story is how I got the car. You see... \nWILL (interrupting) Dad? \nEDWARD Son? \nWILL Can we talk? \nSandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup. \nSANDRA I'm going to get started on dishes. \nJOSEPHINE I'll help you. \nBoth women quickly gather plates. \nWill and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to happen. It settles for a beat after they leave. \nWILL Do you know much about icebergs, Dad? \nEDWARD Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth. \nWILL (interrupting) Dad! \nEDWARD What? \nWILL I'm trying to make a metaphor here. \nEDWARD Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, \"The thing about icebergs is...\" \nWILL (frustrated) The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water. \nEDWARD (joking) What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin? \nWILL I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact. \nEDWARD I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories. \nWILL You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake. \nEDWARD You think I'm fake. \nWILL Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen. \nEdward looks away, angry and disbelieving. \nWILL Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me. \nEDWARD It would kill you, huh? \nFinally -- \nEDWARD What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be? \nWILL Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. \nEDWARD I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nWith a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks. \nSuddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water. \nA beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He casually walks away. \nINT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY \nThe doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell. \nClearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it. \nSANDRA Your father decided he needed to have an office, and it wouldn't do to have it in the house. You'll know better than me what's important. \nEDWARD (V.O.) I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas. \nThe men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence. \nEDWARD I don't believe it! \nNORTHER WINSLOW I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto. \nEDWARD That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped. \nHe's genuinely proud. \nEDWARD So what are you up to now? \nNORTHER WINSLOW I'm robbing this place. \nReaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling. \nSCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. The guard takes out his gun and slides it over. \nNORTHER WINSLOW (to Edward) Would you mind grabbing that? \nThere's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun. \nNORTHER WINSLOW (to the crowd) Now, I want all of you to lie down. I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault. (pointing to a Teller Woman) You help my friend, okay? \nThe TELLER WOMAN nods. \nANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is already waving him to the back. \nHe decides he better go. \nINT. AT THE VAULT - DAY \nThe Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. Edward feels horrible. \nEDWARD Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't want anybody to get hurt. \nTELLER WOMAN It's not that, it's just... \nShe pulls open the vault door. \nINT. THE VAULT - DAY \nThe inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair. Nothing else. \nTELLER WOMAN ...there's no money. We're completely bankrupt. \nEDWARD (V.O.) It turned out the savings and loan had already been robbed -- not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas real estate. \nTELLER WOMAN (dead serious) You gotta promise you won't tell anybody. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EDWARD'S CAR - DAY \nEdward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following them. It's an empty country road for miles. \nNorther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money. \nNORTHER WINSLOW Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars! Not bad for just the drawers. Let's see what you got from the vault. \nEdward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies. \nNORTHER WINSLOW This is it? The whole vault. \nEDWARD 'Fraid so. \nNORTHER WINSLOW Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it. \nCaught, Edward has to confess... \nEDWARD Look, I just didn't want you to go empty-handed. There's something you should know, Norther. You see, the reason why... \nEdward continues his narration... \nEDWARD (V.O.) I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable. \nHearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion: \nEXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY \nNorther leans in the driver's side window. \nNORTHER WINSLOW I should go to Wall Street. That's where all the money is. \nEdward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in. \nEDWARD (V.O.) I knew then that while my days as a criminal were over, Norther's were just beginning. \nThe two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the last moment, Norther calls out: \nWill's rental car drives past a sign reading, \"Ashton, 10 miles.\" \nINT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING \nWill checks the address on one of his father's files. \nEXT. ASHTON GAS - DAY \nWill talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nWill drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And then we realize why: a roadsign reads \"Welcome to Spectre!\" \nEXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY \nSitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches. \nAs Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. Will notices this. \nReaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly. \nRe-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS. The piano stops. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Go back to the start. Right hand only. \nThe piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS. \nThe door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill. \nShe and Will are startled to see each other. \nJENNY Oh. Oh. \nWILL Hello. \nJENNY I wasn't expecting you. \nConfused, Will checks the name on the form. \nWILL Are you Jenny Hill? \nJENNY I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward. (a beat) Like this. \nThe PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward... \nJENNY (to the student) Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the lesson today? We can go again next week. \nShe hands him five dollars out of her pocket. \nSTUDENT Do I have to give it back to my Mom? \nJENNY I won't tell her if you won't. \nYou don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a flash. \nINT. JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY \nWhile Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will. \nWILL How did you know my father? \nJENNY This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him. \nA beat. Not flinching... \nWILL Were you and my father having an affair? \nJENNY (taken aback) Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour. \nWILL I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof. \nShe moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her into. Once she's finally free... \nJENNY Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie? \nWILL Because he's dying. \nA long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. She's a tangle of conflicting emotions. \nJENNY Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game. \nWILL My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two. \nFair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table. \nJENNY The first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here. And yet he did, twice. The first time, he was early. The second time, he was late. \nINT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT \nIt's late, and Edward is pensive. \nFinishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands. \nJENNY (V.O.) Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything. They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing. In that way, he could make sure the town would never die. \nEXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY \nEdward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy. \nJENNY (V.O.) Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town. With one exception. \nIn the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers. \nWe hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself. \nINT. SHACK - DAY \nThe inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows. \nWith her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him. Without turning, she says... \nJENNY You must be Edward Bloom. \nEDWARD How did you know? \nShe keeps PLAYING. \nJENNY No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town. \nEDWARD Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety. \nJENNY So I've heard. \nEDWARD I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word. \nJenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her. \nJENNY Now let me get this straight. You'll buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay in it. You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine. I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another. Do I have that right? \nStrange to hear it put that way, but -- \nEDWARD In so many words, yes. \nJENNY Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time. \nEDWARD It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone. \nA long beat. \nJENNY Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land? Some sort of midlife crisis? Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town? \nHe looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really asked before. \nEDWARD Helping people makes me happy. \nJENNY I'm not convinced you should be happy. \nEDWARD I'm sorry. Have I offended you? \nShe finally turns to face him. \nJENNY No, you did exactly what you promised. You came back. I was just expecting you sooner. \nFLASHBACK TO: \nEXT. SPECTRE - NIGHT \nYoung Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for the first time. \nBACK TO: \nINT. SHACK - DAY \nFinally realizing who this woman is... \nEDWARD You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different. (realizing) You married. \nJENNY I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference. \nBefore he can say anything more... \nJENNY I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom. \nEDWARD I see. I thank you for your time. \nA bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves. \nEXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY \nEdward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping for. \nInside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed. \nEdward takes a final look at this perfect little town. \nJENNY (V.O.) One day, Edward Bloom left, and never returned to the town he'd saved. \nHe climbs in his car and starts the engine. \nEXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT \nAs we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches. \nShoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes slither through the marsh. \nDay becomes night. \nJENNY (V.O.) As for the girl, the common belief was that she'd become a witch, and crazy at that. She became something of a legend herself. \nWe REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away. \nJENNY (V.O.) And the story ended where it began. \nINT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY \nWill and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them. \nWILL Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young. \nJENNY No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else. \nWILL You didn't become crazy. \nJENNY Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale. \nWill smiles to hear it called that. \nJENNY People aren't like they are in stories. They hurt each other without meaning to. They are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment. Like me, now. I'm not sure I should have told you any of this. \nHer composure is starting to break. \nWILL No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I know. \nA long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking. \nJENNY I wanted to meet you for the longest time. I did. (a smile) I envied you so much. The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won. Congratulations, incidentally. And when you got the job at the A.P., everything, he was so proud of you. I mean, that's the thing. Every moment he loved you. \nShe's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over this. \nJENNY And as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared. I wanted to be as important to him as you were, and I was never going to be. I was make-believe and his other life, you, were real. \nANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts. \nJENNY You knew that, didn't you? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING \nWill skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately turns it off. He's trying to think. \nEXT. BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK \nWill walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door. \nINT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK \nIt's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV. Will sets his keys on the table. \nINT. KITCHEN - DUSK \nWill looks in. Empty. \nWILL (calling out) Hello? Mom? Dad? \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK \nWe follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He aims for the guest room at the end of the hall. \nINT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK \nLooking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. The sheets are in a tangle on the floor. \nA beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down the stairs. \nINT. FOYER - DUSK \nHeaded out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, where the \"MESSAGE\" light blinks on the answering machine. \nINT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nThe hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the information desk, so Will forges ahead. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWILL How long have you known my father? \nDR. BENNETT Thirty years. Maybe more. \nWILL How would you describe him? \nDR. BENNETT (re: chart) Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension. (beat) How would his son describe him? \nTables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have one. \nDr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed. \nDR. BENNETT Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born? \nWILL A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish. \nDR. BENNETT Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that? \nWILL (suddenly interested) No. \nDR. BENNETT Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born. \nA long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged. \nDR. BENNETT Not very exciting, is it? And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version. But that's just me. \nWill half-smiles. \nPatting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and starts making a list. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS \nWill flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer. \nHe smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly \nCROSSFADE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN \nIt's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand. \nHe cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What woke him up? \nHe looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath. \nWILL Dad? \nHis father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes are open, scared and confused. \nWILL Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse? \nEdward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his finger on the orange \"nurse call\" button, but doesn't push it. \nWILL What can I do? Can I help? Can I get you something? Water? \nEdward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else. \nEDWARD (whispering) The river. \nWILL The river? \nIt takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world. \nEDWARD Tell me how it happens. \nWILL How what happens? \nEDWARD How I go. \nON WILL, realizing... \nWILL You mean what you saw in The Eye? \nEdward nods. Yes, that's what he was trying to say. \nA long beat. \nWILL I don't know that story, Dad. You never told me that one. \nWill pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and holds it. There's nothing else to do. \nEdward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's coming. Without the story, he's lost. \nFighting the urge to panic -- \nWILL I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts. \nEDWARD Like this. \nWILL Okay. Okay. \nWILL I ask... \nBACK TO: \nEXT. GLENVILLE BLVD. - DAY [STORY VERSION] \nThe Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic. \nWILL (O.S.) Where are we headed? \nWILL (V.O.) You say... \nINT. CHEVY - DAY \nEDWARD The River! \nWill stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to get around the jam. But it's no use. \nThen, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force. \nEdward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back. \nEXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY \nThe same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of more than 100 waiting. \nWILL (V.O.) As we get closer to the river, we see everybody's already there. And I mean everybody. \nAmos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a day since we saw them last. \nWhile Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet. \nPING He's here! \nThe crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill smiles. So does the Old Woman. \nWe PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see... \nYOUNG EDWARD \nreflected. This is what he saw. \nINT. THE CHEVROLET - DAY \nAmazed, Will turns to his father. \nWILL It's unbelievable. \nEDWARD Story of my life. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY \nWill gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl comes just after that. \nCrossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily. \nEdward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS. \nThe crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs. \nWILL (V.O.) And the strange thing is, there's not a sad face to be found. Everyone's just so glad to see you, and send you off right. \nWill walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so his father can face the crowd. Edward waves. \nEDWARD Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu! \nTHE CROWD (VARIOUS) Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll miss you! \nBut one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns to see she's already standing in the river beside them. \nThe reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than we've ever seen her. \nEDWARD My girl in the river. \nShe kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only Will is there to witness. \nAs the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free with his teeth. \nA look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the ring out of his mouth. \nEdward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For he's no longer a man, but rather \nA FAT CATFISH \nswimming at his feet. \nWe watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, disappearing. \nWill and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back on the shore, along with the entire crowd. \nMUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then... \n", "test1_input": "KARL You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here. \nEDWARD What's your name, Giant? \nKARL Karl. \nEDWARD Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. (closer) You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer. \nKARL You don't like it? \nEDWARD I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this. (beat) So what do you say? Join me? \nKarl thinks a moment. Then -- \nKARL Okay. \nEDWARD Okay. \nThey shake on it. \nEDWARD Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nIN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt. \nEXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY \nSpirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl. \nThere's a few tears amid the familiar faces. \nMAYOR (loudly, for the crowd) Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it's with a heavy heart we see you go. But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you. \nEdward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go. \nOnly DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he could crush Edward. \nMany of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand. \nEDWARD (V.O.) That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice. \nVARIOUS TOWNFOLK Find yourself a nice girl! Don't trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your pride, Edward Bloom! \nEDWARD (V.O.) But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others. \nAs the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with \nTHE OLD WOMAN. \nThe ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice. \nEDWARD (V.O.) She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught. \nThe advice only succeeds in confusing Edward. \nEDWARD (to the Old Woman) Okay. Thanks. \nEdward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded. \nKARL What did she say? \nEDWARD Beats me. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nWe TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions. \nEDWARD (V.O.) There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't. People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted. \nEdward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger. \nEDWARD (V.O.) Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road. \nKarl looks at the dirt road, wary. \nKARL You know anyone's who's taken it? \nEDWARD That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again. (beat) Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side. \nA little paranoid... \nKARL You're not trying to run away? \nEDWARD Just to be sure, you can take my pack. \nKarl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY \nThe road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH \nThe road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. Still, Edward WHISTLES. \nComing around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is dead quiet. \nHe looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on. \nHe carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR. \nFURTHER ALONG \nA scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them. \nJust then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands. \nEDWARD You stupid sonofa... \nHe stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm roars out. \nEdward high-tails it, each step still precarious. \nEXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER] \nEdward is bruised, battered and bee-stung. \nA half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. Reads it: \nWARNING! \nJUMPING SPIDERS! \nSure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain. \nEDWARD (V.O.) There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake. The truth is, I was never a reasonable man. \nEdward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs. \nEDWARD And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end. \nEXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY \nEdward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind. \nAt his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting. \nAhead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together. \nHe passes a sign that reads \"Welcome To Spectre!\" \nEXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY \nIt's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy. \nWhat's more, all of these people are barefoot. \nMAN'S VOICE Friend! \nA forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard. \nBEAMEN Welcome to ya. What's your name? \nEDWARD Edward Bloom. \nBeamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages. Still looking... \nBEAMEN Bloom like a flower? \nEDWARD Yes. \nBEAMEN Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet. \nStill confused... \nEDWARD You were expecting me? \nBEAMEN Not yet. \nA helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in: \nMILDRED You must have taken a shortcut. \nEDWARD I did. It nearly killed me. \nBEAMEN Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And truthfully, the long way is easier, but it's longer. \nMILDRED Much longer. \nBEAMEN And you're here now, and that's what matters. \nBeamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger. \n", "test1_id": 2481, "test2_input": "EDWARD What is this place? \nBEAMEN The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow. \nEDWARD The poet? What ever happened to him? \nBEAMEN He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you. \nEDWARD No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late. \nHe didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing. \nBEAMEN Son, I already told you. You're early. \nINT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nSitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state. \nBEAMEN Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. \nEDWARD It truly is. \nUNDER THE TABLE \nYoung Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes. \nNORTHER WINSLOW Everything here tastes better. Even the water is sweet. Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid. At night the wind goes through the trees and you'd swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you. \nSuddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the door. \nEDWARD Hey! \nHe chases after her. \nEXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY \nAs she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever getting them down. \nThe gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his hand. \nStill focused on his shoes... \nEDWARD Wait! I need those! \nNORTHER WINSLOW There is no softer ground than town. \nMILDRED That rhymes! \nBEAMEN He is our poet laureate. \nThe townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... \nEDWARD (V.O.) Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you've never met. \nEXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK \nEdward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. Thousands of them. \nEDWARD (V.O.) A man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting. My journey had scarcely begun, and I had arrived. \nNorther hands him his noteboook. \nNORTHER WINSLOW I've been working on this poem for 12 years. \nEDWARD Really. \nNORTHER WINSLOW There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans. \nA beat. \nEDWARD It's only three lines long. \nNorther grabs his notebook back. \nNORTHER WINSLOW This is why you don't show work in progress. \nEDWARD Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris? \nNORTHER WINSLOW I can't imagine any place better than here. \nEDWARD You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could. \nNorther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook. \nEXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT \nBy the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City dangles around his neck. \nHe stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles. \nIt's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river. \n", "test2_true": "She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away. \nThen he sees the snake. \nIt's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh. \nThere's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward dives in. He swims as hard as can, \nGRABBING THE SNAKE \njust as it's about to strike. \nThe woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her. \nEDWARD No, it's okay! I got it. I got the snake. \nAs the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common stick. And a non-threatening one at that. \nWhile Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her face. \nEDWARD Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?! \nEdward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him. \nEXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nA GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) There's leeches in there! \nEdward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him. \nEDWARD Did you see that woman? \nJENNY What did she look like? \nEDWARD Well, she... uh... \nJENNY Was she nekkid? \nEmbarrassed to admit it... \nEDWARD Yeah. \nJENNY (matter-of-fact) It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her. \nGiven the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank. \nJENNY (CONT'D) Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent people. My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead. \nEdward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin. \nEDWARD Shoot. \nHe starts to work pulling them off. \nEXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT \nEdward and Jenny walk back. \nJENNY How old are you? \nEDWARD Eighteen. \nJENNY I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38. \nEDWARD (a little wary) You're pretty good at arithmetic. \nJENNY And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all. \nEager to get off this subject... \nEDWARD Sure is a lot now, though, huh? \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nAs Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find \"downtown\" has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS. \nThe whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. \nThe resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast. \nJenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly. \nBeamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her. \nThen Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear over the MUSIC. \nMILDRED Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. We all do. \nEDWARD (not hearing) What? \nMILDRED I said you're quite a catch! \n", "test2_id": 2482, "test3_input": "DON PRICE What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine! \nEDWARD I didn't know she belonged to anybody. \nDon Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right back up, but makes no move to defend himself. \nUnfazed, Don slugs him again. \nSANDRA Stop it! \nDON PRICE (ignoring) What the matter, Bloom? Too scared to fight back? \nEDWARD I promised I wouldn't. \nA beat. Don shrugs, fine. Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass nine ways to Sunday. \nEDWARD (V.O.) While I took the beating of a lifetime, it was Don Price who was ultimately defeated. \nAs the ass-whupping continues, we \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [FLASHFORWARD] \nSitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading the new Playboy. \nEDWARD (V.O.) All the physical activity had worsened a congenital valve defect. Put simply, his heart wasn't strong enough. \nDon Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on the tile. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. WITCH'S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK] \nThe same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected in The Eye. \nRETURNING BACK TO: \nEXT. THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY \nThe thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again. \nSANDRA Don! \nDon is about to slug Edward again when he turns. \nSandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers. \nSANDRA I will never marry you. \nA beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling. \nEdward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on? \nDON PRICE What. You love this guy? \nSANDRA He's almost a stranger and I prefer him to you. \nShe hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. But not before decking Edward one last time. \nSandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the daffodils. \nSANDRA How can I convince you to stop? \nEDWARD Go out with me. \nHe smiles, his teeth bloody. \nSANDRA Okay. \nAs the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP above the flowered battlefield. \nEDWARD (V.O.) As it turned out, Sandra was able to keep her same date at the chapel. Only the groom had changed. \nAs the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly... \nCUT TO: \nINT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT] \nJOSEPHINE I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding. \nEDWARD Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication. \nHe reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him. She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS] \nWill, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom. \n", "test3_true": "EDWARD (O.S.) Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why. \nWill quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife. \nINTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM \nEDWARD There was one time when I was eleven... \nJOSEPHINE (gently) You were talking about your wedding. \nEDWARD I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either. \nJOSEPHINE I like your stories. \nEDWARD And I like you. \nHe doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. There's a story to be told. \nEDWARD Now. The thing about working for a circus is you don't have a regular address, and after three years I had a lot of undelivered mail. \nIn the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time. \nEDWARD During the four weeks I was in the hospital, the postmaster finally caught up with me. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nBruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking letter. Reading it, his face drops. \nFLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence. \nEDWARD (V.O.) It turned out that while my heart belonged to Sandra, the rest of my body belonged to the U.S. Government. \nINT. ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nWith a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook. \nEDWARD (V.O.) A hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, I knew I couldn't survive being away from her that long. So I took every hazardous assignment I could find, with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year. \nThe JUMP LEADER yells... \nJUMP LEADER GO! GO! GO! \nOne by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line. When his time comes, Edward leaps... \n...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly. \nHe twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness. They're already long gone. \nDigging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the plane. \nEXT. OUTSIDE STAGE - NIGHT \nA THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show. \nA CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same. \nThe EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. The Emcee makes a \"shoot him in the neck\" motion to one of the ARMED GUARDS off-stage. \nEXT. HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT \nWe LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. He can't steer. He's helpless. \nBut then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough cover for Edward to remain unseen. \nHe lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless cricket left on the anthill. \nEXT. ON STAGE \nThe curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see. \nShe stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING. \nUP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. The two men begin to SCUFFLE. \nMUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony. \nPING Sometimes a girl can feel so alone Without a lover to call her own. Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to explode. Wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes. \nA ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want. \nStill fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of the catwalk, sliding down it to end up \nBACKSTAGE. \nHis determined opponent follows him down. \nPING (CONT'D) But she won't. No, she can't. She needs a special special different unusual man. Because that girl, Who looks like me, She has wants, but she has needs. \nPING (speaking) Any of you got needs? \nThe soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers. \n", "test3_id": 2483}

{"test1_input": "In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows what is lurking in the shadows? \nADULT EDWARD (V.O.) Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared. For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers. \nWe finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate. \nWILBUR FREELY I hear if you look right at it, you can see how you're gonna die. \nEDWARD That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's not even a real witch. \nDON PRICE You're so sure, why don't you go in and get that eye? I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable. \nEdward looks back at the spooky house. \nDON PRICE Or are you too scared? \nEDWARD I'll go in right now and get that eye. \nDON PRICE Then do it. \nEDWARD Fine, I will. \nDON PRICE Fine, you do it. \nEDWARD Fine, I'm doing it. \nHe hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate. \nRUTHIE Edward, don't! \nWILBUR FREELY She'll make soap out of you! (to Ruthie) That's what she does, she makes soap out of people. \nEdward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway. \nWilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar. \nEXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE \nEdward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door. Anything could jump out of them. \nHe steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. \nThe doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally \nRINGS THE DOORBELL. \nImpossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down. \nEDWARD (calm and straightforward) Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there's some folks'd like to see your eye. \nEXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT \nZacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the gate. \nDON PRICE You get the eye? \nEDWARD I brought it. \nDON PRICE (dubious) Let's see it. \nThe Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow. \nWe RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY \nAn OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. Dead. \nEXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT \nWe RUSH IN on Don Price. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY \nTwenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout. Very much dead. \nEXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT \nDon and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears in his eyes. \nZACKY I saw how I was gonna die. I was old, and I fell. \nDON PRICE I wasn't old at all. \nThe brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles. \nEXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "EDWARD I was thinking about death and all. About seeing how you're gonna die. \nThe Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him. \nEDWARD I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up. But it could kind of help you, couldn't it? Because you'd know that everything else you can survive. \nThe Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth. \nEDWARD I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know. \nThe Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye. \nThis time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. His future has something strange in store. \nEDWARD Huh. That's how I go? \nThe Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns and leaves. \nADULT EDWARD (V.O.) From that moment on, I no longer feared death. And for that, I was as good as immortal. \nAs Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY \nThe front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), surprised and a little annoyed. \nSANDRA How did you get here? \nWILL We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really. \nSANDRA Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport. \nWILL We rented a car. \nSANDRA (simply) You didn't need to do that. You just didn't. \nA beat. Starting over... \nWILL Hi, Mom. \nHe leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- strong-willed but practical. They've always been close. \nSANDRA I'm so glad you're here. \nThat hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter- in-law. Seeing the size of her belly -- \nSANDRA You shouldn't have flown. But... \nThey hug. \nJOSEPHINE It's good to see you. You look beautiful. \nIt's not flattery. It's the truth. \nSANDRA Thank you. I'll bet you need to -- \nJOSEPHINE Yes. \nSANDRA Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it. \nJosephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra follows him. \nComing down the driveway, we get to see the house for the first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are playing on the street. \nWILL Is that Dr. Bennett's car? \nSANDRA He's up with your father. \nHeading back to the house... \nWILL How is he? \nSANDRA He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat. \nWILL How much time does he have left? \nSANDRA You don't talk about those things. Not yet. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine. \nDR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black physician. He's still the town's best physician. \nDR. BENNETT Will. \nWILL Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you. (they shake) My wife, Josephine. \nDR. BENNETT A pleasure. \n", "test1_id": 2481, "test2_input": "EDWARD What is this place? \nBEAMEN The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow. \nEDWARD The poet? What ever happened to him? \nBEAMEN He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you. \nEDWARD No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late. \nHe didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing. \nBEAMEN Son, I already told you. You're early. \nINT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nSitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state. \nBEAMEN Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. \nEDWARD It truly is. \nUNDER THE TABLE \nYoung Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes. \nNORTHER WINSLOW Everything here tastes better. Even the water is sweet. Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid. At night the wind goes through the trees and you'd swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you. \nSuddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the door. \nEDWARD Hey! \nHe chases after her. \nEXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY \nAs she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever getting them down. \nThe gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his hand. \nStill focused on his shoes... \nEDWARD Wait! I need those! \nNORTHER WINSLOW There is no softer ground than town. \nMILDRED That rhymes! \nBEAMEN He is our poet laureate. \nThe townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... \nEDWARD (V.O.) Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you've never met. \nEXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK \nEdward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. Thousands of them. \nEDWARD (V.O.) A man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting. My journey had scarcely begun, and I had arrived. \nNorther hands him his noteboook. \nNORTHER WINSLOW I've been working on this poem for 12 years. \nEDWARD Really. \nNORTHER WINSLOW There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans. \nA beat. \nEDWARD It's only three lines long. \nNorther grabs his notebook back. \nNORTHER WINSLOW This is why you don't show work in progress. \nEDWARD Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris? \nNORTHER WINSLOW I can't imagine any place better than here. \nEDWARD You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could. \nNorther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook. \nEXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT \nBy the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City dangles around his neck. \nHe stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles. \nIt's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river. \n", "test2_true": "She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away. \nThen he sees the snake. \nIt's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh. \nThere's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward dives in. He swims as hard as can, \nGRABBING THE SNAKE \njust as it's about to strike. \nThe woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her. \nEDWARD No, it's okay! I got it. I got the snake. \nAs the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common stick. And a non-threatening one at that. \nWhile Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her face. \nEDWARD Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?! \nEdward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him. \nEXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nA GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) There's leeches in there! \nEdward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him. \nEDWARD Did you see that woman? \nJENNY What did she look like? \nEDWARD Well, she... uh... \nJENNY Was she nekkid? \nEmbarrassed to admit it... \nEDWARD Yeah. \nJENNY (matter-of-fact) It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her. \nGiven the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank. \nJENNY (CONT'D) Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent people. My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead. \nEdward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin. \nEDWARD Shoot. \nHe starts to work pulling them off. \nEXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT \nEdward and Jenny walk back. \nJENNY How old are you? \nEDWARD Eighteen. \nJENNY I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38. \nEDWARD (a little wary) You're pretty good at arithmetic. \nJENNY And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all. \nEager to get off this subject... \nEDWARD Sure is a lot now, though, huh? \nEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT \nAs Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find \"downtown\" has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS. \nThe whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. \nThe resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast. \nJenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly. \nBeamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her. \nThen Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear over the MUSIC. \nMILDRED Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. We all do. \nEDWARD (not hearing) What? \nMILDRED I said you're quite a catch! \n", "test2_id": 2482, "test3_input": "The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better. Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry. \nHe watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup. \nEDWARD Did I ever tell you about how... \nWILL (interrupting) Yes. \nEdward is startled. \nWILL The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it. \nEDWARD (re: Josephine) I think someone hasn't. \nJOSEPHINE The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car. \nA beat. \nEDWARD (undeterred) But the real story is how I got the car. You see... \nWILL (interrupting) Dad? \nEDWARD Son? \nWILL Can we talk? \nSandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup. \nSANDRA I'm going to get started on dishes. \nJOSEPHINE I'll help you. \nBoth women quickly gather plates. \nWill and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to happen. It settles for a beat after they leave. \nWILL Do you know much about icebergs, Dad? \nEDWARD Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth. \nWILL (interrupting) Dad! \nEDWARD What? \nWILL I'm trying to make a metaphor here. \nEDWARD Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, \"The thing about icebergs is...\" \nWILL (frustrated) The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water. \nEDWARD (joking) What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin? \nWILL I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact. \nEDWARD I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories. \nWILL You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake. \nEDWARD You think I'm fake. \nWILL Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen. \nEdward looks away, angry and disbelieving. \nWILL Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me. \nEDWARD It would kill you, huh? \nFinally -- \nEDWARD What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be? \nWILL Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. \nEDWARD I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nWith a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks. \nSuddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water. \nA beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He casually walks away. \nINT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY \nThe doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell. \nClearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it. \nSANDRA Your father decided he needed to have an office, and it wouldn't do to have it in the house. You'll know better than me what's important. \n", "test3_true": "INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER] \nWill, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound. A memory. \nWILL What is it? \nSandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with Josephine. \nSANDRA It was during the war. Your father went missing. They thought he was dead. \nWill can't believe what he's reading. \nWILL That really happened? \nSANDRA Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication. \nA beat, then Sandra stands. \nSANDRA I'm going to check on him. \nJOSEPHINE I need to lie down for a bit. \nWILL Go. \nJosephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered. \nLooking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically. \nWill smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the hand. \nEdward's VOICE begins as a memory... \nEDWARD (V.O.) After the war, the sons of Alabama returned home, looking for work. Each had an advantage over me. They were alive, while I was -- officially -- deceased. \nINT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE - DAY [STORY] \nEdward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN. The company is called \"Confederated Products.\" The OFFICE LADIES all love Edward. \nEDWARD (V.O.) With my prospects few, I took a job as a travelling salesman. It suited me. If there's one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a social person. \nEXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY [STORY] \nOn a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd. \nEDWARD I've travelled from Tennessee to Timbuktu, and if there's one thing people have in common, is we could all use a hand around the house. \nEdward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM) \nEDWARD Why, with this product you can... \nQUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates: \nEDWARD Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch yourself while wearing mittens. Hold a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog away from kittens. It's strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at all. \nIndeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS. \nEDWARD You can use it to point out important information. Or dangers. Or beautiful women. \nThe hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS. \nEDWARD We're still working on that one. \nThe crowd LAUGHS. \nEXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nEdward drives, his hand out in the wind. \nEDWARD (V.O.) Soon I added other products, and other cities, until my territory stretched from the coast to western Texas. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY \nEdward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as ever. \nEDWARD (V.O.) I could be gone for weeks at a time. But every other Friday, I'd put all the money I'd made into an account set aside for a proper house with a white picket fence. \nEXT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY \nEstablishing this Texas institution, we come... \nINT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY \nThe bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd. Taking his place in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip. \nAs the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front of him gets a look at Edward. \nTHE MAN Edward? Edward Bloom? \nThe man is none other than... \nNORTHER WINSLOW It's me. Norther Winslow. \n", "test3_id": 2483}

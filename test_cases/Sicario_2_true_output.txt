MATT (CONT'D) I'm the guy who will decide if your daughters get Federal protection or whether we post your ex wife's address on the internet. I decide whether you go to prison at a work camp in Missouri or a kill house like Corcoran. This is where you negotiate how to survive... 
TED I'm in really fucking deep here. 
ALEJANDRO How many officers do they have on the force? 
TED I don't know... How do I guarantee my family's safe? 
ALEJANDRO You want the truth? 
TED Please. 
ALEJANDRO Give the names, give the houses, phone numbers ... Give me all of you. 
We watch from a distance as Matt and Alejandro listen. Matt stands and waves over the Director and other agents. They lean over and listen to Ted spilling. 
Ted is then removed and marched toward another vehicle. Alejandro and Matt walk toward Macy. 
MATT Good job. 
She laughs at the conviction this lie is given by everyone. 
MACY I love how we're all going to pretend I planned this. 
MATT You write it that way in the report. (Looking at Reggie) Yes? 
REGGIE Well ... she found the picture and led him outside. 
MATT Real quick thinking, Kate. 
MACY Yeah ... So, can I go home tonight or ... 
MATT Sure ... This is good news. They're going to call Manuel back. Soon. 
MACY Whoopee. Then we can call the Mexican police to go arrest their employer. Why do I think that won't happen? 
MATT (Matt really likes this girl) Gotta have a little faith. 
Matt walks off. 
REGGIE You can come stay with me. 
MACY I'll be fine... They have your picture too, you know. 
REGGIE Yeah. Thought crossed my mind. 
Phil waves Reggie over. Macy is alone. She looks left, and Alejandro is beside her. 
MACY (Dry) I understand now, okay? They're everywhere and I'll never know who to trust, as evidenced by me fucking my hit man behind a bar. 
ALEJANDRO He wasn't an assassin. He was just supposed to be your friend and hopefully find out who is showing you how to hurt them. They are looking for us, not you. 
MACY That doesn't scare you? 
ALEJANDRO I've been doing this for a long time. 
He looks out over the cactus. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) In Mexico, police do not investigate crimes for the government. Attorneys do. That's what I did. I was very close to arresting someone who ... someone I shouldn't have tried to arrest. 
His mind wanders back. He remembers... 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) The brilliance of what they do when they mutilate a body is make people think -- Oh, that person must have done something to receive such a death. They must have been involved. 
He looks at her. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) They must have deserved it ... And for the family ... It soils every memory you have of that person. They make it impossible to imagine the face you loved without seeing the initials carved into her forehead. Imagine her body without seeing her chest with -- remember her before... 
He draws in a deep breath. Swallows the emotion. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Her breasts were cut off ... Remember your child without ... 
He looks off. Can't even say it ... Won't say it. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) They kill the body, the memory, everything. 
She shivers as she digests his words. Alejandro looks up to the stars. Studies them. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) You remind me of my wife. I find it very difficult to look at you.

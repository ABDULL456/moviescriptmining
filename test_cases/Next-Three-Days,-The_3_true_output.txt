SGT. HARRIS At a community college. 
340    INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- DAWN                             340 
Sitting in his pajamas, George flips open an ancient atlas and runs his finger down across the Gulf of Mexico to Caracas, Venezuela. And he thinks of his grandson and smiles. 
341    EXT. VENEZUELAN COUNTRYSIDE (HELICOPTER SHOT) -- DAY                341 
A taxi snakes along a mountain road, through the dense forests of Venezuela. 
342    INT. TAXI - DRIVING - MOUNTAIN ROAD -- DAY                          342 
Exhausted but awake, John stares out the window at the coastline below. Lara and Luke sleep beside him. 
343    EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY                    343 
More rain. Detective Quinn squats in the covered parking lot, staring at the spot where the crime took place. Flash to: 
344    EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                             344 
Elizabeth turns at her car, is slammed in the head with the extinguisher and she falls dead. 
The extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls. 
A YOUNG FEMALE JUNKIE yanks at Elizabeth's purse, getting blood on her hands before she frees it. She looks like a junkie. She runs off toward the sidewalk. 
344A   QUINN - IN THE PRESENT                                              344A 
Turns and sees... 
344B   LARA - IN THE PAST                                                  344B 
She hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain. Turning the corner into the garage she COLLIDES with the JUNKIE. Lara's purse catches the woman's coat. 
The JUNKIE puts her hand on Lara's shoulder, leaving a SMUDGE OF ELIZABETH'S BLOOD on Lara's raincoat. She tugs free. A BUTTON from the woman's coat POPS OFF and hits the sidewalk. 
Lara turns and yells "Hey," then keeps going. 
She is about to get in the car when she sees the fire extinguisher in front of her left wheel. She picks it up, turns, annoyed. She places it down by the wall.

344B   CONTINUED:                                                          344B 
Lara gets in her car and drives off, oblivious to Elizabeth's body lying on the concrete floor on the passenger's side. 
Her co-worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage. He spots the body and turns and looks after Lara's car. 
345    EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY                    345 
Quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper. COLLERO watches from the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building. QUINN steps up to where the two women collided and looks down at the sidewalk. 
DETECTIVE QUINN Was it raining when we searched the crime scene? 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Three years ago?? What are we doing here? 
Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows. 
The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and travels to the storm drain a half a block away. 
Quinn gets there, kneels. 
DETECTIVE QUINN Act like a cop. Grab the other side. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO You're out of your mind. 
Quinn jerks the grate up.    Collero grabs the other side and helps him lift. 
They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D) You really thought you were going to find it? 
Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.

CLOSE ON INSIDE LIP OF STORM DRAIN 
Just before the grate clangs we see JUNKIE'S JACKET BUTTON, squeezed between the grate and the wall. 
346   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - SOUTH AMERICA -- EVENING                       346 
The taxi crosses the ancient square of a small town. 
347   INT. COLONIAL HOTEL -- EVENING                                    347 
The room has two single beds. John waits at the bathroom door. Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them. 
She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face to face with her sleeping son. 
Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness. 
348   INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                 348 
John washes, trying not to look in the mirror, not wanting to glimpse the man he has become. 
349   INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                                          349

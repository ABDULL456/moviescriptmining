Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly. 
LUKE I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. 
BEN	 (OS) Yoda will always be with you. 
Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI. 
LUKE Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? 
The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp. 
LUKE You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. 
BEN You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. 
LUKE	 (turning away, derisive) A certain point of view! 
BEN Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. 
Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment. 
BEN I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. 
Ben pauses sadly. 
BEN Anakin was a good friend. 
Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence. 
BEN When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy. 
Luke is entranced. 
LUKE There's still good in him. 
BEN I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. 
LUKE I can't do it, Ben. 
BEN You cannot escape your destiny. 
LUKE I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. 
BEN Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. 
LUKE But I had to help my friends. 
BEN	 (grinning at Luke's indignation) And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear. 
LUKE	 (with sadness) I found out Darth Vader was my father. 
BEN To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again! 
LUKE I can't kill my own father. 
BEN Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. 
LUKE Yoda spoke of another. 
BEN The other he spoke of is your twin sister. 
LUKE But I have no sister. 
BEN Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. 
LUKE Leia! Leia's my sister.

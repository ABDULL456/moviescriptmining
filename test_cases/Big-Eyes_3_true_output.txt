WALTER Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend. 
MARGARET "Hawaii"? M-marriage? 
(EMOTIONAL) Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. Why would we go to Hawaii?! 
WALTER 
(BEGUILING) Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise. 
CLOSEUP - MARGARET Margaret shudders, tears in her eyes. Hawaiian MUSIC begins... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
STOCK FOOTAGE - DAY A propeller-driven PAN AM airplane soars through the sky. 
EXT. HAWAII - DAY 
Hawaii, 1958. Heaven on earth. Blossoming flowers, rare birds, lush greenery. Margaret is experiencing total bliss. We widen. She and Walter stand in front of a waterfall, getting married. Jane is Maid-of-Honor. A PRIEST smiles, and Walter places a ring on Margaret's finger. They kiss. 
EXT. BEACH - SUNSET 
Margaret and Walter lie on the sand, making out. Cuddling, running their fingers along each other's bodies. She stares up, endlessly happy. 
MARGARET You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors. 
WALTER I knew you'd love it. 
MARGARET Oh, can't we stay here forever?? 
WALTER Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week. 
EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY 
Thatched umbrellas, Polynesian fun. Margaret is set-up, drawing PORTRAITS of the GUESTS. Walter regales them as they wait. Joking, gregariously handing out Mai-Tais. Margaret finishes a picture. She beams at Walter... then signs the picture "KEANE." Walter gapes, astonished at this gesture. Margaret lock eyes with him. She smiles girlishly, radiating happiness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY 
Old school Cantonese: Dragons and red lacquer. Margaret eats lunch with Dee-Ann, showing off SNAPSHOTS from the trip. 
MARGARET This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow. 
DEE-ANN This is all happening mighty quick. In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. You're already married. 
MARGARET 
(SHE GIGGLES) I thought there was a void in my life. Well... Walter's filled it. 
DEE-ANN Walter's filled a lot of things. He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. 
MARGARET You're talking about my husband! 
DEE-ANN I know! That's why I brought it up. Margaret frowns, insulted. 
MARGARET I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane. 
(CLEAR-EYED) Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. I'm a divorcee with a child. Walter is a blessing. Dee-Ann bites her tongue. The WAITER brings over the check. Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES. Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. She reaches for one... then impulsively grabs the other. She cracks the cookie. Dee- Ann waits, curious. Margaret reads... then slowly smiles. 
MARGARET "You are on the threshold of untold success." 
INT. ART GALLERY - DAY 
A Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from wood and wire. In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting. 
RUBEN What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention. 
FANCY LADY It's quite gestural.

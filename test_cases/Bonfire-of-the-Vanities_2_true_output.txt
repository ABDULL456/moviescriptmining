A ten story glass atrium. A black tie party. A sixty- foot banner with Fallow's name on it. Wild applause. But before Fallow can get his bearings... WALL OF FLASHING CAMERAS obliterate the view.

He stands up, pulls on a rubberized British riding mac. Judy flicks a tiny plastic bag out of a cleverly-concealed container and hands it to Sherman. JUDY Have a nice time. 14    OMITTED                                                      14

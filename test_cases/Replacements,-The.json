{"test1_input": "The defense rushing onto the field led by Bateman. \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) Washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession. \nON PATRIOTS \nThey break their huddle and come to the line of scrimmage. Bateman is snorting fire. \nEarl Wilkinson (with SMITH on the back of his jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out the formation. \nEARL Wide right! You got wide right! Check on the wing! \nThe PATRIOT QUARTERBACK sets up over center. \nPATRIOT QB Blue fourteen! \nBam! Bateman runs offside and flattens the quarterback. Penalty flags fly everywhere. \nON SIDELINE \nDefensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes. \nThe Ref moves the ball five yards and gives the offside sign. \nON PATRIOTS \nThey come out of the huddle again. \nPATRIOT QB Green eighty-seven! \nPow! Bateman dives offside again and forearms the Quarterback, knocking him on his back. Flags fly again. \nOne Patriot lineman makes the mistake of pushing Bateman. Bateman literally jumps on his head. More flags fly. \nON SIDELINE \nBanes is screaming something unintelligible at Bateman. \nON BALL \nIt's marched downfield by the Ref, this time fifteen yards. \nOVER this we hear: \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) I think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes. We're waiting for the stats on that... \nHere come the Patriots again. \nCUT TO: \nFIRST HALF MONTAGE \nA)    SHANE \nrolls to his right but the blitz    is on and he reverses and rolls left.     He's finally cornered and has to dump    the ball off. The pass is incomplete and     he's knocked on his ass. \nB)    SHANE \nfakes to Lamont and rolls again.     He fires a bullet to Franklin on a    down and out. Clifford actually catches     the ball, then bobbles it and in trying to    get possession again, hands the ball    to the defender. \nThe defender can't believe it for a beat and then he streaks down the sideline and scores. \nC)    McGINTY \njust shakes his head. \nD)    TODD, ROB AND BOB \nscream in pain. Rod pours his own beer over his own head. \nE)    O'NEIL \nlooks disgusted as he watches with Augustine. \nF)    BATEMAN \ngrabs the opposing running backs' face mask and spins him around and around. Flags fly everywhere. \nG)   SHANE \nis on the run again looking for a receiver. He finally throws the ball... right into the hands of the opposing safety. \nShane dives for the guy and misses.   The safety scores. \nH)   ANNABELLE \nis trying desperately to get the crowd into the game by jumping up and down and waving her pom poms. \nFive guys right in front of her get up from their seats, take all their stuff and leave. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GAME - ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD - SECOND QUARTER \nshows the Patriots up 17 to 0. \nON SHANE \nHe's rolling in the back field again looking for a receiver. \nSHANE'S POV \nNothing but meat coming at him. \nBACK TO SCENE \nShane panics and tosses the ball out of bounds. Shane looks at McGinty on the sidelines. We hear McGinty's voice. \n", "test1_true": "Shane puts his head down like he knows it. \nMcGINTY (V.O.) Come on, now, son. Pick up your pace on the roll. See the big picture. Pump and fake, pump and fake. \nIN HUDDLE \nEveryone is dirty, sweating bullets and breathing very hard. \nShane leans into the huddle. \nLee is raising his hand. \nSHANE What? \nLEE I don't feel good. \nAnd with that he promptly vomits sixteen eggs. \nANDRE Oh, God! \nCOCHRAN Oooooh... \nJAMAL Man, that's ripe! \nEveryone is reacting.       Some players gag. \nEVANS Shane, we got to move! \nSHANE Okay. On the count of three. Everyone more left. Hut! Hut! Hut! \nON HUDDLE \nEleven bentover guys move in unison with tiny steps to their left. \nON PATRIOTS' LINEBACKER \nThe guy watches the huddle moving. \nPATRIOT LB What the fuck is this? \nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL \nSummerall has his binoculars on the moving huddle. \nSUMMERALL John, how many years have we been calling games together? \nMADDEN Seventeen, I think. \nPat just hands John the binoculars. \nIN HUDDLE \nShane calls the play as they continue to move as one. \nSHANE U brown right, west 19 A lead. That's you, Mickey. Puke on him if you have to. \nON HUDDLE \nThe huddle stops and they break for the line of scrimmage. \nON LEE \nHe lines up face to face with the Patriots' defensive end. \nLee breathes in the guy's face and the Patriot gags. \nSHANE (O.S.) Hut! \nLee runs right over the guy.       He's quickly \nfollowed by Lamont with the ball. \nLamont runs for eighteen yards and a first down. \nON PATRIOT DEFENSIVE END \nHe's waving for a substitute as he weaves off the field. \nMADDEN (V.O.) Very nice off tackle run by Lamont. Execution was letter perfect. \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) That puts the Redskins in field goal range. And here comes Pacifico to see if he can get them on the board before the half ends. \nON PACIFICO \nHe flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto the field. \nINT. BAR (QUEENS, NEW YORK) \nA guy sitting at the bar turns his head quickly to the televised game when he hears Pacifico's name. \nThis is the same mafioso type who saw Lou kick the ball that knocked the godfather's hat off. Remember? \nEXT. BIG O - ON SHANE - DAY \nHe crouches down and waits for the snap from Evans. \nPacifico lines himself up. \nMADDEN (V.O.) This will be a forty- five yarder. That's a \ntough distance for your first N.F.L. field goal try. \nSHANE Hut! \nIt's a perfect snap.   Shane spots it, Pacifico belts it. \nAnd it goes through for three. \n", "test1_id": 2295, "test2_input": "They stop at a door. \nSHANE Here's home. \nShane fumbles for a key. \nAnother stunning-looking woman suddenly appears from down the hall. This is the WOMAN IN BLUE. \nWOMAN IN RED A friend of mine is going to join us, okay? \nWOMAN IN BLUE Hi.   Ready to party? \nShe checks the hallway, takes the key from Shane and sticks it in the lock. \nSHANE (looking at both women) Oooooh. Bookends. \nWOMAN IN BLUE \nAnd you're the book, baby. \nSuddenly, Annabelle Farrell appears in the hallway. \nANNABELLE (to the girls) Go away. Both of you. \nWOMAN IN RED Fuck off! \nCrack! Annabelle punches her in the nose with a straight right hand. The girl bounces off the wall. \nSHANE (to Annabelle) These are my guests. \nWOMAN IN RED (now bleeding) You crazy bitch! \nBoth girls take off. \nSHANE Why did you do that? \nAnnabelle opens the door. \nANNABELLE You were about to be rolled. \nSHANE (as he enters) That's what I was hoping. \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT \nAnnabelle is pulling the bed down as Shane falls into a chair. \nANNABELLE They work the bar downstairs looking for drunk Redskins. \nShane looks embarrassed. \nSHANE I guess they found one. \nANNABELLE Don't feel so bad. It's a rookie mistake. \nShe turns and sees that he's already passed out. \nShe looks at him not unkindly. Then she unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his pants off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ROOM - CLOSE ON SHANE'S BEAT UP FACE - DAWN \nas he opens his eyes. \nHe rolls over and screams in pain. \nON ANNABELLE \nShe's wearing nothing but a Redskins' T- shirt. She quickly bends over him. \nANNABELLE Here.   Take this. \nSHANE (groaning) What is it? \nANNABELLE It's for the pain. Take it. It's only a little bit illegal. \nShane takes it and swigs a glass of water. \nSHANE Oh, God. I've got to go to the bathroom. It's far away, isn't it? \nANNABELLE I'll help. We'll just take our time. \nShe helps him get out of bed.   When he \nstands, he screams again. \nANNABELLE Kidneys. \nSHANE Oh, man. My hair hurts. \nANNABELLE You took a hell of a beating. The martinis didn't help, either. \nShe walks him to the bathroom like an old man. He shuffles in and closes the door. \nANNABELLE Don't be afraid if you've got blood in your urine. That's normal. \nSHANE (O.S.) Did you undress me? \nANNABELLE Yes. \nSHANE (O.S.) And you... slept here with me? \nANNABELLE Yes. \nSHANE (O.S.) Did we... ? \nANNABELLE Are you kidding? You were catatonic. \n", "test2_true": "SHANE No blood. \nANNABELLE Good.   Back to bed. \nHe leans on her as she walks him back. \nHe gets into bed with a moan. \nSHANE May I ask you a personal question? \nShe nods. \nSHANE Do you do this for all Redskin quarterbacks? \nANNABELLE Of course not. \nSHANE Then why me? \nAnnabelle takes her time answering. \nANNABELLE I don't know. I guess I can't resist a man who can take a hit. \nSHANE I can't take a hit! \nAnnabelle cradles his head. \nANNABELLE Shhh. It's all in your head. Now, get some sleep. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY \nAnnabelle walks up to Shane's door with a stack of newspapers. She enters. \nINT. ROOM - DAY \nThe bathroom door is closed.      Annabelle talks to him anyway. \nANNABELLE You're the golden boy in the press this morning. \nShe reads a headline. \nANNABELLE 'Falco scores big.' (to herself) Well... not really. (still reading) Hey, a lot of the regular players are starting to cross the picket line. \nSHANE (O.S.) Redskins? \nANNABELLE It doesn't say. \nShane comes out of the bathroom dressed and ready to go. He's still moving slowly and in great pain. \nANNABELLE Where are you going? \nSHANE McGinty called a dinner meeting with the whole team. \nShane tries to put on his coat, but he's so sore he can't. Annabelle helps him. \nSHANE Thank you. Thanks for... everything.     You saved my life. \nANNABELLE No. Probably just your wallet and your watch. \nSHANE And that pill, that sure worked. \nANNABELLE You're basic double D Vicodin. But be careful: It's habit- forming. The best stuff always is. \nThere's another awkward silence. \nSHANE Well... \nANNABELLE Ice both knees and that shoulder before bed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CLIFFORD FRANKLIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nClifford, still carrying his football, comes out of his apartment in a third floor walk- up. He's wearing his Redskins jacket. \nAs he turns around from locking his door, he stops dead in his tracks. \nAll of Clifford's neighbors, all the way down both halls, are standing in front of their doors. \nThey all start applauding. \nClifford smiles from ear to ear. \nMONTAGE \nA)    ANDRE AND JAMAL \nare trying to hail a cab on Wisconsin Avenue. Suddenly, one cab, then two, then four SLAM on their BRAKES. \nCabbies hop out to open their doors for the brothers. \nB)    ROLAND LAMONT \nwalks down G Street with Brian Murray. Brian spots something in a store window and stops Roland. \nRoland gasps as he sees himself duplicated on ten TV screens in an appliance store. He's on tape being interviewed at a Redskins' practice. \nC)    EARL WILKINSON \ndressed in casual chic, is moving quickly through Lord and Taylor's Department \nStore    with two sales clerks in tow. He stops,    grabs four cashmere sweaters, smells    them, hands them to one clerk and moves    on. \nD)    LOU PACIFICO \nis standing in front of the White House. He has a line of ten people who are paying five bucks for an autographed picture of himself that he hands out from a huge stack. \n", "test2_id": 2296, "test3_input": "On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of bounds. \nAL (V.O.) Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal to tie it up. That's almost a chip shot for Pacifico. \nON SHANE \nHe shakily follows Pacifico out onto the field. \nReese Evans catches up with him. \nEVANS (to Shane) Are you okay? \nSHANE Just make it a good snap. (to Pacifico) And you'll do the rest, right? \nPacifico doesn't answer. \nON BALL \nEvans leans over it. \nON SHANE \nHe's kneeling in the middle of the field waiting for the snap. But something is bothering him. \nSHANE (to Pacifico) Lou, are you alright? \nPacifico looks up from where he is set up for the kick. There are tears in his eyes. \nPACIFICO I'm sorry. They know where my family lives. \nShane tries to digest what he just heard. \nSHANE What?! \nEVANS (through his legs) Come on, Shane! \nShane looks back at Pacifico and makes a decision. \nSHANE Hut! \nThe ball is snapped perfectly.      Shane catches it and spots it perfectly. \nPacifico moves to kick it. \nAnd Shane pulls the ball away. \nPacifico flies through the air like Snoopy as he kicks nothing but air. He lands hard. \nShane jumps to his feet and starts running. \nAL (V.O.) It's a fake! Falco has it! \nON McGINTY \nHe's in shock. \nON SHANE \nHe has totally caught the Cowboys by surprise. He sweeps around the right side. \nThe Dallas middle linebacker has recovered and is moving quickly to cut Shane off. \nBut Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and crushes the guy with a flying block. \nShane cuts downfield and heads for the end zone with nobody near him, except: \nFor the same safety from the first half who waits for him at the ten. \nThe safety smiles as he takes a bead on Shane. \nShane heads right for the guy. He puts his head down and smacks helmets with the safety. The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and into the end zone. \nAL (V.O.) Falco scores! \nON McGINTY \nHe jumps into the air. \nON O'NEIL \nHe jumps out of bed. \nON TODD, ROD AND BOB \nThey jump on each other. \nON ANNABELLE \nShe's jumping for joy. \nON SHANE \nHe spikes the shit out of the ball.   And then sees something up field. \nAL (V.O.) \nWait a minute. Wait a minute. We've got a flag down. \nShane stands stock-still in the end zone watching the REF call the penalty. \nREF Clipping.

His arm is being immobilized by a team trainer. \nPACIFICO I broke my arm. (big smile) Thank you. You saved my ass. \nShane nods.     In his earpiece, he hears McGinty. \nMcGINTY (V.O.) Someday, you can explain what that was all about. We got no \nkicker, so you gotta take it in. Your pick. You're the leader. \nSHANE (to himself) What would Unitas do in this situation? (pause) I have no idea. \nShane leans into the huddle. \nLEE I'm so sorry, Shane. I'm sorry, everybody. \nSHANE No problem, Mickey. (to Evans) Hell of a hit, Reese. \nEVANS That's the one I was looking for. I can retire in peace now. \nSHANE Right after this play. So besides me, who really wants the ball? \nHe looks around the huddle. He studies each face. And then he comes to rest on Brian Murray. \nBrian's eyes are shining.   He doesn't need words here. \nSHANE (to Murray) Yeah. You want it, Brian. Let's hook up. (signs as he says it) Blue left slot open 'A' right. Two Jet 'X' drive. On three.

Reese Evans joins him. \nWilkinson hugs Jamal. \nClifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws himself into the stands where fans mob him. \nON EDDIE MARTEL \nThe Washington Redskins first-string quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps and out of the stadium. \nBut he slips awkwardly and falls.

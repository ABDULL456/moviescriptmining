{"train": "THE REPLACEMENTS \nby \nVince McKewin \nSECOND DRAFT \nFebruary 19, \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY \nIt's raining lightly in the harbor and the water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold. \nWe PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in an end slip. \nIt's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to the top of the cabin. It's partially covered with a blue plastic tarp. \nSUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA - FALL \nThe tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked torso emerges from under it. Shane is late twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly going to seed. He looks hung over. \nShane glances up at the sky and rain. He pulls on the top part of an old patched wet suit and zips it up. He shivers. \nEXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY \nWe're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY. \nShane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty oblong of his face is visible. \nIt's still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts. \nHe pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS the ENGINE. \nWith practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboat's stern line. \nHe slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a air-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out of the dinghy and into the    water. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY \nIt's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long spatula. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nHe attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat. \nThe spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat. \nCLOSE ON SHANE \nAs he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats past him. This doesn't look like fun. \nAs he works, he happens to look down and notices something on the bottom. \nSHANE'S POV \nAmidst the beer cans and other trash, something golden is sitting on the bottom. \nBACK TO SCENE \nShane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it go and drifts down. \nA shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks it up. \nThe trophy is almost a full-size football rendered in bronze attached to a broken base. \nShane turns \"the ball\" over in his hands. He grips the seams like he's done this before. \nThen he holds the football out in front of him. \nSuddenly, he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense. He turns to his running back as he yells something like \"Blue 31!\" It comes out in bubbles \nHe cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion. \nThen on the \"snap\" he turns and starts a five step drop. \nHe moves in slow motion because hey... he's underwater! He executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks \"down field\" for his receivers. \nBut there's a blitz! He steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet. \nHe rolls left and keeps looking for the open man. \nSuddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm. \nThe \"ball\" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release. \nThe trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal. \nWe STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del Rey. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY \nBam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a Washington Redskin running back and lands on his throat, elbow first. \nIt's a beautiful fall day in November and Miami is beating the Skins in front of seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans. The Redskins are at their home stadium better known as \"The Big O.\" \nINT. CONTROL BOOTH - DAY \nJOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the game in shirtsleeves. \nSUMMERALL That play, my friends, sums up the Redskins' running game all day long. Now Washington calls their last time out. \nMadden leans over to do his diagram that shows up on your TV screen. We STAY ON him as he draws and explains. \nO'NEIL If you keep talking to me like I'm a five- year-old, I'm going to hurt you. \nAUGUSTINE Sounds exciting. \nHe reaches for the phone and hits the speed dial. \nAUGUSTINE We'll want to talk to coach now, won't we? \nHe hands the phone to O'Neil. \nO'NEIL (on the phone) What the fuck was that?! \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. TILDON'S OFFICE \nCoach Tildon sitting in his office. We can hear players getting dressed, listening to MUSIC and getting SHOWERS outside his open door. \nTILDON (on the phone) I think he slipped. \nO'NEIL Bullshit he slipped! He could have scored! \nAnybody could have scored! I got one foot in the god damn grave and I could have scored! \nTILDON Mister O'Neil, let's face facts: The players are going out. It's gonna happen. And nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season. \nO'NEIL You god damn wimp! You're fired! Get out! Get out! Get out! \nO'Neil throws the phone down. Augustine picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a notch. \nO'Neil takes big gulps of the rich air. \nAUGUSTINE Better? It always makes you feel better when you fire someone, we know it does, don't we? Yes... \nO'NEIL Get me Jimmy McGinty. Get him here. Tonight. \nO'Neil sucks hard on the oxygen. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REDSKINS LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nA REPORTER is interviewing WILSON JONES, the huge defensive end for the Redskins. Wilson wears an enormous diamond earring. \nWilson is dressing at his locker. \nWILSON Hey, man, I do what my \nunion says. \nREPORTER But you're already one of the highest paid players in the game. The fans just don't see the point of a player like you striking. \nWILSON Let me tell you something: I'm a big man, you see? \nWilson holds his arms out.   Yes, he's gigantic. \nWILSON There are some days when I am so beat up, that I cannot dress my own big ass. I asked management for a valet or some shit to help me dress and they said no way. So, fuck 'em! \nPLAYER (O.S.) Shut up everybody, here it is... \nSomebody turns UP a TV in the locker room. \nON TV \nA handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell steps up to a podium at a press conference. He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit. \nOn the TV he is identified with a super: \n\"JEROME LINDELL -- President -- National Football League Players' Association.\" \nLINDELL (V.O.) I have just left a meeting with representatives of the owners and I am sad to say that they have refused the players' final demands which \ncenter around a rise in the current salary cap. (MORE) \nLINDELL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Therefore, I am recommending that all N.F.L. players walk out and not play until our demands are met. I want the players to walk out tall, to walk out righteous, to walk out in the knowledge that we do this as a team. We shall overcome the fat cats. I send peace to my union brothers. \nThe entire locker room is silent for a beat. And then everyone starts getting dressed again, maybe a little slower than before. \nON WILSON JONES \nWILSON Shit, I'm goin' to Vegas. \nCUT TO: \nINT. O'NEIL'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON O'NEIL - NIGHT \nAs he sleeps peacefully.    The only sound is the HISS of his OXYGEN. \nThen we hear ICE CUBES SLOSHING in a glass. \nO'Neil opens his eyes and sees: \nJIMMY McGINTY, a handsome devil in his late sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the last dregs of a Scotch rocks. \nMcGINTY You look like shit. \nO'NEIL I'm dying, Jimmy. \nMcGINTY \nYou been dying for twenty years. \nO'Neil motions to the glass. Jimmy pours three fingers from a Glenlivet bottle and hands it to him. \nMcGINTY That poof of a nurse of yours is gonna kick my ass if he catches you drinking. \nO'Neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey. He smiles as it goes down. \nBIKER Did you hear something? \nThe other biker shakes his head, no. \nThe one who asked the question walks over to the door and listens for a beat. Nothing. \nHe turns to go back and suddenly the door disintegrates in front of a charging man wearing a \"police\" windbreaker. \nThis is DANIEL    BATEMAN, a big,    young, psychotic cop,    who immediately    runs over the poor Biker who    was listening at    the door, kicking the guy    in the head as    he goes by. \nBateman dives on two more Bikers, and \nviciously head-butts one of them. \nHe stuffs the other's head into the meth mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a big police blackjack, three quick times: Rap! Rap! Rap! \nThe guy goes down like lead. \nBateman looks around and spots a big BIKER cowering in a corner. The Biker is terrified. \nBateman takes two stops toward the guy when suddenly three more COPS wearing windbreakers run in, out of breath. \nThey look around at the unconscious Bikers. \nCOP #1 Jesus, Bateman! Why don't you ever wait for us?! \nBEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Someone's BEEPER is going off. The three cops look at theirs. Nothing. \nThe cowering Biker looks at his. \nBIKER #2 Not me. \nBateman pulls his beeper, studies it and looks puzzled. \nBATEMAN What area code is 703? \nCOP #1 Washington, D.C. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY \nA loaf of Wonder Bread is spinning through the air in SLOW MOTION. It comes AT us, twisting and turning. \nON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN \nHe's tall, maybe 22, and positioned behind the cash register. He's wearing a Washington Redskins sweatshirt. \nClifford's hands are up as he waits to catch the bread which was tossed by his MANAGER at the back of the store. \nThe loaf hits Clifford's hands and then bounces out. It lands on the counter in front of a TEN-YEAR-OLD smart-ass KID. \nKID Nice hands. \nCLIFFORD (not amused) What else? \nKID A pack of Marlboro Reds, a pint of Martel Cognac and a box of Trojans, extra long. \nClifford grabs the Kid's two one-dollar bills, and makes change for the bread. \nCLIFFORD Get out of here. I'm telling your mother you were talking like that. \nThe Kid leaves. \nThe Manager yells from the back of the store as he holds up a portable phone. \nMANAGER Hey, Clifford, somebody on the phone wants you to play football next weekend. \nCLIFFORD Tell 'em I gotta work Saturday. And I'm watching the Redskins on Sunday. Ain't nothing stopping me from watching the Redskins on Sunday. (mumbling) No way that's gonna be \nhappening, me not watching the Redskins on Sunday. \nMANAGER (into phone) He's gotta work. (pause) They said they'll pay you. \nCLIFFORD Pay me?    How much? \nMANAGER (on phone) How much? (pause) Ten thousand five hundred dollars! \nCLIFFORD (stunned) Ray, who the fuck is on the phone?! \nMANAGER (pause) It's the Washington Redskins! \nClifford collapses. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nWe hear deafening APPLAUSE as we hold on ANDRE and JAMAL WILLIAMS, two huge bodyguards, dressed in identical black suits. \nSuddenly,   the artist formerly known as Prince comes off   stage, grabs a towel from an assistant   and starts walking with Jamal in front and   Andre in the rear. \nAs they walk, a CELL PHONE RINGS. Andre pulls it from his pocket and answers it, quietly. \nJamal runs interference with the techies and groupies backstage. \nJAMAL (to someone) Get out of the way! (to someone else) Don't look at him! He don't like being looked at, god damn it! No eye contact! \nAs they walk, Andre is still talking on the phone. \nFinally, they get to the backstage door and stop. The rock star prepares to run the gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty bodyguards. \nBut his bodyguards are conversing quietly but urgently with each other. \nOne of the assistants throws open the door. A big mob waits outside. \nThe anointed one turns to his bodyguards to lead the way, but... they're gone! \nPeople in the street are now starting to look up at this old woman screaming \"Foreskins!\" \nLouis quickly crosses the street to his apartment house. \nBut at that moment, a soccer ball bounces toward him from where a group of kids are playing in an alley. \nOut of pure instinct, Lou gives it a mighty boot. \nWe FOLLOW the arc of the ball as it sails DOWN the block. Everyone stops to admire the kick. \nStill airborne, the ball crosses Queens Boulevard. \nAt that moment, a very old mafioso type is being helped from his limo by several lieutenants. \nPow! The ball hits the old guy right in the back of the head, knocking off his porkpie hat and dropping him to the pavement like a bullet. \nThe lieutenants pull pistols and surround their fallen leader. \nON LOU \nHe sees what happens and quickly ducks into his apartment house. \nON ONE MAFIA LIEUTENANT \nHe spots Lou before he disappears inside. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nCoach ROLAND LAMONT, a good-looking ex- running back in his late twenties, is \ncoaching a high school player. \nWe can see that Roland is wearing a pretty substantial knee brace. \nHe holds up a football. \nROLAND Cut right on me, now. Right on me. \nHe pitches the ball out to one kid, who runs right at him, steps on Roland's foot with his cleats and then cuts around him. \nRoland screams and falls to the ground. \nROLAND Not right on me, goddamn it! \nHe writhes there a beat until he hears: \nVOICE (O.S.) Coach Lamont! Phone call! Long distance. Washington, D.C. It's the Washington Redskins! \nRoland holds his foot and manages a smile because he seems to know what the phone call means. \nROLAND (to the sky) Thank you, Lord! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BIG O (WASHINGTON D.C.) - MAGIC HOUR \nThe stadium appears empty. \nSuddenly, a football thrown with a perfect spiral comes AT us. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nWe see the ball sail cleanly through a rubber ring attached to the crossbar on the goalpost. \nON SHANE FALCO \nHe's in shorts and a sweatshirt taking snaps from center Reese Evans. \nEVANS Nice. Try a roll to the right. \nEvans bends over another ball.    Shane sets up in the shotgun. \nO'NEIL (V.O.) Shane 'Footsteps' Falco? This is what you're going to build an offense around? \nEXT. STANDS - MAGIC HOUR \nMcGinty is sitting with O'Neil on the fifty yard line twenty rows back. \nAugustine holds O'Neil's oxygen tank as the old man sits huddled in a coat that's way too big for him. \nO'NEIL Christ, Jimmy, I ask you to build me a team based on balls and the first player I see is Footsteps Falco?! \nMcGINTY He's got as much natural talent as any quarterback in the league. \nO'NEIL And he's got the happiest feet I've ever seen! \nMcGINTY All he needs is a shot of self-confidence. He's our quarterback. That's the way it is. \nO'NEIL What about a safety? We got two a days starting tomorrow and a game in five days! And we still don't have a safety?! \nO'Neil motions to Augustine for more oxygen. \nAUGUSTINE Here we go. Nice fat little hits. \nHe turns the valve up.   O'Neil breathes deeply. \nO'NEIL I called a friend of mine who just happens to be the Governor of Maryland. \nMcGINTY Terrific, the Governor is going to play safety? \nO'NEIL Don't worry about it. \nON SHANE \nHe drills a perfect spiral through the circle. \nMcGinty holds up three fingers. \nMcGINTY How many fingers? \nSHANE Two.   No, wait.    Three. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nAndre and Jamal are hitting the blocking sled simultaneously. They drive it OUT OF FRAME. \nON SHANE \nHe's now wearing a helmet with a twobar quarterback face guard. He takes a snap and pitches out to running back Roland Lamont. \nRoland, now wearing a big knee brace, looks sharp as he cuts to the outside. \nON PILACHOWSKI \nThe offensive coordinator is standing with McGinty who is concentrating on the scrimmage. Suddenly, Pilachowski spots someone. His mouth drops open. \nON MICKEY LEE \nHe's a fourhundred-fifty-pound ex-Sumo wrestler crammed into a Redskin uniform.     Fat rolls are visible everywhere. \nPILACHOWSKI Oh my God. That's disgusting! \nLee walks up. McGinty bows and says something in Japanese. Lee bows and answers back in Japanese. Then they shake hands. \nMcGINTY How you doin', Mickey? \nLEE Not bad, Coach. \nMcGINTY You look great. Why don't you work out at left tackle? \nLEE You got it. \nLee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytail out the back and rumbles away. \nPilachowski is looking at McGinty like he's crazy. \nPILACHOWSKI You're not serious. \nMcGINTY I met Mickey in Hawaii. When he was even bigger. He's a Sumo wrestler. That means he's an expert at pushing people around. \nThat's what pass blocking is, Leo. \nDefensive coordinator Christopher Banes comes running up in a lather. \nBANES (to McGinty) I got a defensive end who's deaf!! \nPILACHOWSKI (watching Lee walk away) I'll trade you for a tackle who's gonna play in a diaper. \nBANES How can I coach a deaf man?! \nMcGINTY You don't have to... \nHe looks across the field at a big, good- looking kid named BRIAN MURRAY who is in the middle of a pass rushing drill. \nMurray looks really fast, especially for his size. \nMcGINTY Brian Murray would have gone in the first round five years back if he hadn't been born deaf. I first saw him play right here in D.C. for Galludet College. He's a hell of an athlete. You won't have to tell him anything. \nBANES I can't believe it! I got to be able to communicate with him. \nMcGINTY Then learn to sign. Hey, look at it this way: He'll never get \npulled off sides on an audible. \nMcGinty thinks this is funny as shit. \nON SHANE \nHe's just done a fivestop drop on a pass play. He's looking down field when he sees something scary. \nSHANE Oh shit! No! \nHe throws the ball away and then is nailed and taken down on his back by Bateman (psychotic cop). \nShane groans and lies there with Bateman on top of him. \nBATEMAN Hi, I'm Danny. \nSHANE (groaning) Shane. \nMcGinty pulls Bateman up. \nMcGINTY Nice pop, Danny. \nBATEMAN Thank's, Coach! \nDanny runs off. \nSHANE What was that? \nMcGINTY Danny Bateman. Ex-cop, ex-Marine, ex-rugby. He's absolutely harmless, if you just play dead. \nMcGinty helps Shane up. \nMcGINTY San Diego used you all wrong. You're not a \ndrop back passer. You're a scrambler. Like you were in college. So, we're gonna roll out. A lot. Get used to setting up on the run. You'll live a lot longer. \nSHANE I'm very interested in that. \nCUT TO: \nON SHANE \nHe's stripped down sitting on a bench. Reporters are trying to interview him. Microphones are in his face and video cameras jockey for position. \nSHANE ... just glad to be back playing. That's all I've really got to say. \nREPORTER But where have you been? What have you been doing to make a living? \nSHANE Well... I've been involved lately in the... aquatic business... \nON MICKEY LEE AND ROLAND LAMONT \nMickey is watching Roland unbuckle his big complicated knee brace. (NOTE: There should be something slightly medieval about this brace.) \nMICKEY You only played one game?! \nROLAND Actually, less than two minutes. I was a rookie third round pick in '93. We were playing Atlanta in the home opener. Near the end of the first quarter, they sent me in, I took a screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers. Simultaneously. One a \nside. My knee turned into wet toilet paper. End of career. \nMICKEY Can you play on it now? \nRoland takes out a wrench and starts unscrewing a bolt on his brace. \nROLAND I've been teaching high school football for five years. It's not a bad life. I'm good at it. There are some days when I actually love it. But for one more shot at this? Shit. I'd give it all up. This time, they're gonna have to take me out in a box. \nON EARL WILKINSON (CRIMINAL) \nHe's standing naked in front of his locker staring with anticipation at a garment bag. \nSlowly, he unzips the bag revealing a beautiful new suit. He touches the lapels reverently. \nON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN \nHe's sitting in front of a locker, holding his football, with a shit-assed-eating grin. \nSomeone walks by. \nCLIFFORD I got Wilson Boone's locker, man. Do you believe that shit? \nHe drops his ball and quickly picks it up again. He looks around to make sure Coach didn't see him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BIG O PARKING LOT - MORNING \nThe regular Redskins are out in force, holding signs as they lean on their Beamers and Porsches. \nShane pulls up in a battered '89 Honda. \nWhen he gets out, he's immediately surrounded by six striking regulars, led by quarterback Eddie Martel and defensive end Wilson Jones. \nMARTEL Hey, you can't park there. \nSHANE Look, I don't want any trouble. \nMARTEL You don't want any trouble?! You're taking my job away, but you don't want any trouble? (to Wilson) He doesn't want any trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone. \nShane looks but it's obvious he's parked legally. \nSHANE Okay.   I'll move it. \nMARTEL No, we'll do that for you. Go ahead, Wilson. Move it for him. \nWilson motions to another big guy. The two of them proceed to roll the Honda over on its roof. It lands with a crunch. \nJAMAL (O.S.) You all put that car back. \nEverybody turns to see Andre and Jamal walking towards them. \nWILSON Who the fuck are you? \nANDRE We're the people who take care of the quarterback. We're the guards. \nAll the regulars laugh at this. \nJAMAL Put the car back. Gently. \nWILSON Kiss my ass. \nSHANE (to Jamal) It's okay. \nJAMAL No, it's not. \nJamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue Porsche. \nJAMAL (to Wilson) That's your ride, ain't it? \nBefore Wilson can even answer, Jamal pulls his NINE MILLIMETER. BOOM! BOOM! No more Porsche windshield. \nAll the regular Redskins dive for cover. \nWILSON My windshield! You crazy motherfucker! \nJAMAL Move his car back. \nWILSON My car! \nJamal raises his GUN again.    POW!   No Porsche driver's side window. \nWILSON No!   Stop! \nHe turns to his cowering teammates. \nWILSON Come on, help me, god damn it! \nThe guys quickly pick up the Honda and put it right side up. \nIN STANDS \nEven the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can hardly look at the carnage. \nOUTSIDE STANDS \nA contingent of strike players like Eddie \nMartel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking lot. They are laughing their asses off as they watch on a personal TV. \nON FIELD \nCheerleaders are down and screaming in pain. Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing triage. \nON BATEMAN \nHe's sheepishly standing to one side as trainers come out to assist. \nINT. BLOWUP HELMET \nJamal and Shane are examining the trip wire. Obviously, they were sabotaged. \nJAMAL Bastards. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now... uh, the rest of the Washington Redskins. \nThe rest of the team walks unceremoniously out of the helmet and onto the field. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nBOOM! The Patriot kicker puts one in the end zone for a touchback. \nThe ball is placed on the twenty as Shane and the offense walk out onto the field. \nShane walks slowly toward the huddle that's forming. \nIN HUDDLE \nAndre and Mickey Lee are arguing. \nANDRE That's where I stand. \nLEE No it's not. \nANDRE Come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle. \nON SHANE \nAs he walks, we hear McGinty's voice in Shane's helmet. Yes, they do it by one-way helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear is McGinty, speaking into his headset mike. \nMcGINTY (V.O.) All right, son, nice and easy now. Let's run our ten planned plays, get a feel for the land... \nShane walks into the huddle and chaos. \nANDRE ... Fat fucking nip! You don't know shit! \nLEE What did you call me?! \nANDRE You heard me, you tub a rice shit! \nSHANE Hold on, what's the problem here? \nAndre and Lee ignore Shane and start pushing each other. \nLEE I'm gonna kick your black ass... \nANDRE You ain't kickin' jack shit... \nNow Jamal gets involved as Shane tries to get \nbetween them. \nJAMAL (to Lee) Don't be messing with my brother... \nSHANE Hey, hold on... \nON REF \nHe's watching the play clock and when it gets to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws it. \nREF Delay of game!    Five yards! \nIN HUDDLE \nLee suddenly punches Andre through his face guard. Andre knocks into Shane and spins him around. Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he misses and nails Shane in the back of the helmet. \nShane goes down hard. \nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL \nThey look confused. \nSUMMERALL ... I don't know. Something seems to be going on in the huddle. It looks like... yes, Shane Falco is on his back. They haven't run a play yet but Falco is down. \nMADDEN This is not a good sign. \nON FIELD \nTrainers race out to Shane, who is lying face up with the huddle standing over him. \nSHANE (clearing the cobwebs) What happened? Am I hurt already? \nShane sits up.   Suddenly, he remembers what happened. \nSHANE God damn it! I am the quarterback! I am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle! \nThe defense rushing onto the field led by Bateman. \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) Washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession. \nON PATRIOTS \nThey break their huddle and come to the line of scrimmage. Bateman is snorting fire. \nEarl Wilkinson (with SMITH on the back of his jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out the formation. \nEARL Wide right! You got wide right! Check on the wing! \nThe PATRIOT QUARTERBACK sets up over center. \nPATRIOT QB Blue fourteen! \nBam! Bateman runs offside and flattens the quarterback. Penalty flags fly everywhere. \nON SIDELINE \nDefensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes. \nThe Ref moves the ball five yards and gives the offside sign. \nON PATRIOTS \nThey come out of the huddle again. \nPATRIOT QB Green eighty-seven! \nPow! Bateman dives offside again and forearms the Quarterback, knocking him on his back. Flags fly again. \nOne Patriot lineman makes the mistake of pushing Bateman. Bateman literally jumps on his head. More flags fly. \nON SIDELINE \nBanes is screaming something unintelligible at Bateman. \nON BALL \nIt's marched downfield by the Ref, this time fifteen yards. \nOVER this we hear: \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) I think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes. We're waiting for the stats on that... \nHere come the Patriots again. \nCUT TO: \nFIRST HALF MONTAGE \nA)    SHANE \nrolls to his right but the blitz    is on and he reverses and rolls left.     He's finally cornered and has to dump    the ball off. The pass is incomplete and     he's knocked on his ass. \nB)    SHANE \nfakes to Lamont and rolls again.     He fires a bullet to Franklin on a    down and out. Clifford actually catches     the ball, then bobbles it and in trying to    get possession again, hands the ball    to the defender. \nThe defender can't believe it for a beat and then he streaks down the sideline and scores. \nC)    McGINTY \njust shakes his head. \nD)    TODD, ROB AND BOB \nscream in pain. Rod pours his own beer over his own head. \nE)    O'NEIL \nlooks disgusted as he watches with Augustine. \nF)    BATEMAN \ngrabs the opposing running backs' face mask and spins him around and around. Flags fly everywhere. \nG)   SHANE \nis on the run again looking for a receiver. He finally throws the ball... right into the hands of the opposing safety. \nShane dives for the guy and misses.   The safety scores. \nH)   ANNABELLE \nis trying desperately to get the crowd into the game by jumping up and down and waving her pom poms. \nFive guys right in front of her get up from their seats, take all their stuff and leave. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GAME - ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD - SECOND QUARTER \nshows the Patriots up 17 to 0. \nON SHANE \nHe's rolling in the back field again looking for a receiver. \nSHANE'S POV \nNothing but meat coming at him. \nBACK TO SCENE \nShane panics and tosses the ball out of bounds. Shane looks at McGinty on the sidelines. We hear McGinty's voice. \nON TODD, ROD AND BOB \nThey begin immediately singing \"Hail to the Redskins,\" a march always sung after a score. They and the sparse crowd in the stadium know and sing every word. \nON PACIFICO \nHe gets high fives all around. Then Bateman runs up and in his ecstasy, slaps Pacifico in the head. \nPacifico goes down, knocked out cold. \nON CHEERLEADERS \nLed by Annabelle, the girls are doing a stirring finale to \"Hail to the Redskins.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY (HALF-TIME) \nEveryone is lying on the floor. \nShane has ice bags on his head, shoulder, elbow and both knees. \nPacifico is getting smelling salts from a trainer as Bateman hovers nearby waiting to apologize. \nMickey Lee is chewing ice. \nCochran is reading his Bible. \nMcGinty walks in and bends down to Shane. \nMcGINTY (quietly) You got to look for Murray over the middle. You got to trust me on this: he's a big, tough kid with good hands. \nSHANE We can't put three plays together without a penalty, a fumble of a fight. \nMcGINTY You still got a whole half left. You're a thoroughbred out there running against a bunch a nags. You can pick these fuckers apart. \nShane smiles through his pain. \nSHANE You're good. You're really good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nThe Patriots have the ball. Their Quarterback drops back for a pass and throws it. \nON WILKINSON \nEarl is covering the intended receiver. He deftly steps in front of the guy, and makes a diving catch. \nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL \nSUMMERALL Another terrific interception by Smith. That's his second. \nMadden starts shuffling through pages. \nMADDEN Yeah, this guy is a player. \nHe finds the paper he's looking for. \nMADDEN According to the Redskins, Ray Smith... is... that's weird. No college given, no high school given. It just says he's been a resident of the state of Maryland for the last four years and five months. Likes to embroider. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nShane is walking toward the huddle.     In his ear, he hears: \nMcGINTY (V.O) Half your job is getting that huddle in the right mindset. Use your imagination, Shane. \nShane stops short of the huddle.     Everyone is looking at him. \nThere is a beat and then Shane steps in. \nSHANE Okay, let's all take a few seconds to think about what we were doing for a living... just last week. \nShane looks around the huddle.     Everybody looks pained and/or depressed. \nSHANE Good. Let's kick ass. Red right pass 15 x \nhook. \nThey break the huddle and Shane sets up over Evans. He glances over at Brian Murray. \nMurray is lined up in a three point stance at tight end. But his head is turned and he's looking directly at Shane. \nSHANE Red fifteen! Red fifteen! Hut! \nShane nods on the snap. \nThe front five, in the persons of Andre, Jamal, Reese, Mickey Lee and Cochran, hit out and simultaneously knock their men on their backs. \nShane, with plenty of time, hits Murray over the middle for twelve yards. \nShane looks over at the sidelines.   McGinty is smiling. \nMONTAGE \nA)   SHANE \nis under pressure but he rolls smoothly and rockets the ball downfield. \nMurray pulls it in for fifteen yards. \nB)   SHANE \nrolls left off the shotgun, fights off a cornerback and throws back across field, complete to Lamont coming out of the backfield. \nThe quarterback hands off to the running back right up the middle in a typical \"run out the clock\" play. \nBAM! Bateman comes out of nowhere, decks the runner and literally rips the ball out of his hands as he goes down. \nON CROWD \nThey go wild! \nON ANNABELLE \nShe does a cartwheel. \nON McGINTY \nHe's leaning over a groggy Shane on the bench. \nMcGINTY Don't shake your head at me. You are going back in there. You are gonna run the same god damn play, you are gonna throw the ball to Franklin again and this time, he's gonna score. \nSHANE I can't... \nMcGinty grabs some smelling salts from a hovering trainer. \nHe shoves them under Shane's nose.    Shane is suddenly very awake. \nMcGINTY You are the only one in this entire stadium who can do it. Do you understand me? You can do something no one else can do. So, start right here. Start living your destiny. Or give it up for good. Right here. Right now. \nShane stares at him. \nThen he stands up, wobbles and puts on his helmet. \nON HUDDLE \nThey're all turned and watching as Shane makes his way slowly out onto the field. \nAnnabelle watches him closely. \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) Here comes Falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock. \nMADDEN (V.O.) I'm surprised to see him again after that shot he took from Bellinski. \nON HUDDLE \nIt breaks and Shane stands over Evans and looks out at the defense. \nNasty-looking linebackers and cornerbacks stare at him. \nSHANE 22 green! \nHis voice cracks and several defensive players openly laugh at him. \nShane gets an idea. \nSHANE Check! Black 43! Black 43! \nON ANDRE \nHe's down in a three-point stance facing a defender. He whispers to Reese: \nANDRE What's that mean? \nREESE (whispering back) He's changing the play. Listen! \nSHANE Black 43! \nMADDEN (V.O.) It's a long count. Falco could be calling an audible. \nON LAMONT \nHe shifts position in the backfield. \nLAMONT (to Shane) Is this right? \nSHANE (shaking his head) Black 43 left! \nLamont shifts again. Clifford goes in motion from his flanker position but then changes his mind and goes back the other way. \nLamont and Clifford then bump into each other. \nON PATRIOT DEFENSE \nThey are totally confused now as they try to adjust to the equally confused Redskins. \nON McGINTY \nHe looks extremely pissed. \nON SHANE \nSHANE Hut!   Hut! \nHe turns to hand the ball off to Lamont but Lamont is not there. \nShane turns the other way and sees Lamont just standing there looking at him. Shane runs over to him and hands him the ball. \nMeanwhile, the Patriot defense is going the other direction. \nLamont takes off. \nOne cornerback is not taken in. The guy dives for Lamont's legs. We hear a CLANK as the cornerback's HELMET hits Lamont's industrial KNEE BRACE. The guy bounces off and Lamont trots into the end zone. \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) Lamont scores! \nMADDEN (V.O.) Whoa! Falco calls an audible at the line of scrimmage and Lamont takes it in! \nShane, meanwhile, is looking at McGinty on the sidelines. \nMcGINTY (V.O.) (in Shane's helmet) I guess you saw something I didn't. \nThey stop at a door. \nSHANE Here's home. \nShane fumbles for a key. \nAnother stunning-looking woman suddenly appears from down the hall. This is the WOMAN IN BLUE. \nWOMAN IN RED A friend of mine is going to join us, okay? \nWOMAN IN BLUE Hi.   Ready to party? \nShe checks the hallway, takes the key from Shane and sticks it in the lock. \nSHANE (looking at both women) Oooooh. Bookends. \nWOMAN IN BLUE \nAnd you're the book, baby. \nSuddenly, Annabelle Farrell appears in the hallway. \nANNABELLE (to the girls) Go away. Both of you. \nWOMAN IN RED Fuck off! \nCrack! Annabelle punches her in the nose with a straight right hand. The girl bounces off the wall. \nSHANE (to Annabelle) These are my guests. \nWOMAN IN RED (now bleeding) You crazy bitch! \nBoth girls take off. \nSHANE Why did you do that? \nAnnabelle opens the door. \nANNABELLE You were about to be rolled. \nSHANE (as he enters) That's what I was hoping. \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT \nAnnabelle is pulling the bed down as Shane falls into a chair. \nANNABELLE They work the bar downstairs looking for drunk Redskins. \nShane looks embarrassed. \nSHANE I guess they found one. \nANNABELLE Don't feel so bad. It's a rookie mistake. \nShe turns and sees that he's already passed out. \nShe looks at him not unkindly. Then she unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his pants off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ROOM - CLOSE ON SHANE'S BEAT UP FACE - DAWN \nas he opens his eyes. \nHe rolls over and screams in pain. \nON ANNABELLE \nShe's wearing nothing but a Redskins' T- shirt. She quickly bends over him. \nANNABELLE Here.   Take this. \nSHANE (groaning) What is it? \nANNABELLE It's for the pain. Take it. It's only a little bit illegal. \nShane takes it and swigs a glass of water. \nSHANE Oh, God. I've got to go to the bathroom. It's far away, isn't it? \nANNABELLE I'll help. We'll just take our time. \nShe helps him get out of bed.   When he \nstands, he screams again. \nANNABELLE Kidneys. \nSHANE Oh, man. My hair hurts. \nANNABELLE You took a hell of a beating. The martinis didn't help, either. \nShe walks him to the bathroom like an old man. He shuffles in and closes the door. \nANNABELLE Don't be afraid if you've got blood in your urine. That's normal. \nSHANE (O.S.) Did you undress me? \nANNABELLE Yes. \nSHANE (O.S.) And you... slept here with me? \nANNABELLE Yes. \nSHANE (O.S.) Did we... ? \nANNABELLE Are you kidding? You were catatonic. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT \nShane knocks. After a beat, the door opens and Annabelle is standing there rubbing her eyes. She's wearing a cut-off Redskin jersey. \nANNABELLE Are you hurt? \nSHANE No.     Not really. \nANNABELLE You're getting used to being slapped around. That's a good sign. \nSHANE I... \nNothing comes out. \nANNABELLE Would you like to come in and make love? \nSHANE Yes. No. I'm here because ... I don't want to be alone. \nANNABELLE Most    of the world feels that    way. You don't have    to be embarrassed about    it. \nSHANE But to tell you the truth... I'm kind of scared of you. \nAnnabelle takes that in and thinks about it. \nANNABELLE I won't hurt you. \nShe takes his hand and leads him inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAnnabelle is giving Shane a slow, sensuous, full-body massage. It's lucky for us he's on his stomach. \nShane does a lot of moaning as Annabelle's fingers work their magic. \nShe gets to a place on his shoulder that's especially tender. He moans even louder. \nANNABELLE That shoulder is going to need special handling. \nAnnabelle pulls her jersey off and gently presses her breasts into Shane's back. \nShane puts a pillow over his head to drown out the ecstasy. \nAfter a beat, he pulls the pillow away. \nSHANE You know what hurts \nworse than my shoulder? \nANNABELLE I can't imagine. \nSHANE Their defensive end punched me in the mouth. \nAnnabelle starts laughing. \nSHANE Seriously. It's killing me. \nAnnabelle is laughing hard now as Shane rolls over. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShane and Annabelle are in a close, after-sex kind of cuddle thing. \nShane is unburdening himself. \nSHANE ... after that game, after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team, my school, my family, I mean -- did you know that I set two Sugar Bowl records?! I was sacked eleven times! I threw six interceptions! \nANNABELLE Okay.   Calm down. \nSHANE Anyway, after that, I could never seem to adjust in the pros. I was too scared. I lost my balls. \nWe see Annabelle's hand move slightly under \nthe covers. \nANNABELLE Well, they're back. \nSHANE You know what I mean. My nerve. I lost the edge you need to play this game. \nANNABELLE I don't believe that. I don't think it just goes away. It was only one bad day, Shane. Everybody has those. \nSHANE No. Somehow, I convinced myself that I couldn't ever win the big game. I got so down, that I was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line. I was afraid to screw up. That's the sure sign of a loser. From there, it wasn't very far to thinking that I'll never win, that I didn't deserve to win at anything. Including love. \nANNABELLE You're wrong. You're winning now. You're winning me. \nThey kiss real good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. O'NEIL MANSION - MORNING \nIt's a huge town house in Foggy Bottom.    Its entrance is now lined with REPORTERS. \nOne is speaking ON CAMERA to his anchor. \nREPORTER \nBob, I'm standing in front of Redskins owner, Edward Frances O'Neil's home and all we know right now is that the Washington player previously known as Ray Smith is in fact Earl Samuel Wilkinson... \nINSERT \nWe see two photographs of Earl: One with his current beard and the other, his clean-shaven mug shot of five years ago. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HILTON - NIGHT \nShane walks down the hall to his room.        He enters. \nINT. SHANE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHe walks in and closes the door. \nWhen he turns around, Eddie Martel, ex- Washington Redskin quarterback, is sitting on Shane's bed. \nTwo defensive linemen-types stand by the window. \nSHANE What's this? \nMARTEL This is a visit. \nSHANE A visit. Who let you in? \nMARTEL I used to nail one of the housekeepers. \nSHANE Lucky girl. \nMARTEL (pointing to the linemen) You know who these guys are, don't you? \nSHANE Dallas Cowboys.     Howdy. \nMARTEL You'll be seeing a lot of these guys tomorrow. \nSHANE What do you want? \nMARTEL Who, me? Not much. But these boys wanted a little head start on you. \nThere's a beat and then Shane suddenly bolts for the door. But the two linemen grab and hold him. \nSHANE I'm flattered that you actually think we have a chance to win. \nMARTEL It can be a game of luck. And under no circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and O. Especially against the Dallas Cowboys. It's just not good for the \ngame. \nSHANE Is the union behind this 'visit'? \nMARTEL I can't really say, Shane. By the way, have you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs? \nHe kicks Shane viciously in the side.     Shane screams. \nMARTEL The pain makes it damn near impossible. \nThe linemen drops Shane on the floor. \nMARTEL And one other thing: I want you to stay away from Annabelle. \nShane is gasping on the floor. \nMARTEL The sad fact is she won't give me the time of day. But you can't have everything I want. I can't let that happen. So, you gotta stop seeing her. Just on principle. \nMartel viciously kicks Shane again.     Shane screams. \nMARTEL Let me hear you say it. \nShane is trying to get his breath. \nMARTEL Come on. You can do it. \nSHANE (barely visible) I won't go out with her \nanymore. \nMARTEL Good. (to the linemen) Gentlemen? (to Shane) Hey, have a great game! \nThey move toward the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BIG O - MAGIC HOUR \nOnce again, fans stream into the parking lots. \nIn a corner of a lot, Jerome Lindell is once again holding forth ON CAMERA. \nBut this time, he's standing with a hard- looking guy in a suit, named MATHESON. \nLINDELL I think that Mister Matheson here, and myself, are very close to an agreement that will put the 'pro' back in pro-football. \nREPORTER Mister Matheson, what are the sticking points in the negotiations as far as the owners are concerned? \nMATHESON Only one: that the players immediately go back to work with no change in the existing contract. \nLindell looks uncomfortable.   But he smiles anyway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL BOOTH - NIGHT \nThe familiar \"MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THEME SONG\" is just ending. AL MICHAELS does his on camera intro. \nAL Good evening from the Big O here in Washington D.C. where the mighty Dallas Cowboys take on the Cinderella Washington 'Scabskins' as they have come to be known. Hi, I'm Al Michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team? And what about the strike itself? It has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends. Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball, D.C. style. \nEXT. STADIUM - MAGIC HOUR \nEddie Martel, Wilson Jones and other regular Redskins take their seats on the fifty yard line. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REDSKIN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nButler leans on Shane's side as he gets up. Shane gasps with pain. \nON McGINTY \nHe's watching Shane closely.   Then he talks into his mike. \nMcGINTY What's the matter with your arm? Are you alright? \nON AL, DAN AND BOOMER \nThey're watching the replay on their monitor. Dan is very happy. \nDAN What pursuit! Butler never gave up on him. That's a 270-pound guy who moves like a halfback. \nBOOMER Dan, I think Butler's hit on Falco was late, to tell you the truth. \nDAN Well, of course you do. You were a wimp quarterback. \nAL Easy, guys. \nSome laughter. \nCUT TO: \nFIRST-HALF MONTAGE \nA)    DALLAS KICKER \nBoom! The Dallas kicker puts away the extra point after a score. \nON SCOREBOARD \nDallas 7, Washington 0. \nB)   SHANE \nis under pressure as he rolls out. When a defensive lineman gets close, he throws the ball away like we've seen him do before. A defensive back intercepts. Dallas's ball. \nC)   BALL \nBoom! The ball goes through the uprights for a Dallas field goal. \nON SCOREBOARD \nDallas 10, Washington 0. \nD)   AUGUSTINE \nmassages O'Neil's feet as the old man watches the game. He looks worried. \nE)   PACIFICO \nsmokes and stalks the sidelines. He looks up into the stands and sees the mafioso type looking down at him. \nF)   SHANE \nsteps up in the pocket. He looks downfield but in the face of the pass rush, he throws the ball weakly out of bounds. \nG)   LEE \nis pass-blocking but the first guy spins him around and the second guy runs right around him. \nH)   BATEMAN \nis double-teamed on a pass rush. He spins but he can get no leverage against his opponents. When the play ends, he \npushes one of them. \nA penalty flag flies by. \nI)   ROLAND LAMONT \ntakes a    pitch out, is immediately hit hard and    loses the ball. A cornerback picks it    up and takes it all the way for a Dallas    score. \nJ)   WILKINSON \nsteps up and bats a ball away from a Dallas receiver. A flag flies. Wilkinson argues the call. \nK)   COCHRAN \nis lined up across    from Butler. On the snap, Butler slaps    Cochran in the face mask with his big,    fat club of a hand. Cochran disappears    OUT OF FRAME. \nL)   DALLAS KICKER \nBoom! The Dallas kicker puts away the extra point after a Dallas touchdown. \nSCOREBOARD \nDallas 24, Washington 0. \nM)   EDDIE MARTEL, WILSON JONES AND OTHER REDSKINS \nsitting in the stands look satisfied. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nThe Redskins huddle. Shane is in pain.       He looks up at the clock. \nON CLOCK \nThere's thirty-two seconds left in the half. \nSHANE Okay.    Red right 15 X hook. \nThe break the huddle and come to the line of scrimmage. \nSID Hey, Shane, I just heard. Congratulations! \nHe smacks Shane on his bad side and Shane grimaces. \nWILKINSON Congratulations on what? \nSID Shane is staying on. He's gonna be Martel's backup. \nEveryone stares at Shane for a beat. \nANDRE Is that true? \nSHANE Yes, Andre. It's true. \nNobody says anything for a beat. \nFRANKLIN I got to tell you, Shane, you played the first half like you were staying. Like you already had a contract. \nShane looks around the room at this beaten bunch. No one makes eye contact with him. \nSHANE You're right, Clifford. And I'm sorry. But now I want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying. I never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life. \nEverybody lets this sink in. \nEarl Wilkinson finally speaks up. \nEARL I don't know what yawl are doin' tomorrow, but my ass is goin' back to jail. But if I gotta go, I want to go back a winner. \nEVANS Hell, I'm retiring. I have thirty minutes of football left in my whole career. I'm homicidal! \nBATEMAN Me, too, Reese! \nEARL Let's get it on! \nEverybody turns to Shane. \nSHANE Gentlemen, our problem is the Cowboys aren't afraid of us. But they should be! \nLAMONT Damn straight! \nEverybody whoops! \nSHANE We've got one chance on offense to make our stand -- the first play of the half. \nJAMAL One touchdown ain't gonna help, Shane. \nSHANE No.     But one nasty-ass play    might. We just gotta    be brave. And trust    each other. \nShane happens to glance at Pacifico. Pacifico won't meet his eye. \nShane turns to Sid. \nSHANE Help me with this. \nSid helps Shane strip his jersey off. \nEveryone reacts to the bruises on Shane's side. \nSHANE Somebody has to tape me up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nThe Cowboys are already back on the field as the Redskins come out of their locker room. \nAL (V.O.) ... at nine-forty Eastern time, the agreement was reached, and except for this upcoming second half, the strike is history. \nON AL, DAN AND BOOMER \nBoomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn. Dan looks guilty, but still angry. \nDAN It's about time. I say let the professionals back on the field. The fans deserve nothing less. \nBOOMER Yeah, you would say that. \nON BALL \nThe Dallas kicker puts the ball in the end zone for a touchback. \nON SHANE \nHe starts to follow the offense out on the field. Then he turns and sees Annabelle engrossed in a cheer. \nHe runs over to her. \nANNABELLE Are you okay? Is it your side? \nSHANE I'm okay. I owe you an apology. \nANNABELLE What?     You do? \nSHANE Yes. I'll explain later. But thank you for believing in me. You give me strength just looking at you. \nAnd with that, Shane takes her in his arms and kisses her deeply. \nThe crowd on that side of the field reacts to the kiss with a \"Wooooooo!\" \nAL (V.O.) Well, this is a first. Shane Falco seems to be... \nBOOMER (V.O.) Hell,    Al, he's necking with    a cheerleader! I've    done a little of that    in my time. \nDAN (V.O.) The players are not supposed to fraternize with the cheerleaders. \nBOOMER (V.O.) Hey, Dan, what are they \ngonna do?   Fire him?! \nREF Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards... (to himself) ... times three... that's forty-five yards. Illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense, fifteen yards. That makes it sixty yards. Unnecessary roughness number 65 and number 32, fifteen yards... that's, wait... forty-five... no, thirty... (turns to another ref) ... how many yards so far? \nON BALL \nA ref is taking a very long walk with it. He stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts it down. \nIN HUDDLE \nShane leans in. \nSHANE Okay, everybody, stick \ntogether and don't take any shit. Let's make 'em hurt! \nThey break the huddle and line up with their backs to their goal. \nON COCHRAN AND BUTLER \nButler is still whining. \nBUTLER I can't believe you went for my eyes! \nCOCHRAN Shut up! I'm gonna do it again 'cause it was fun! \nON SHANE \nSHANE Black 98! Black 98! Hut! \nON COCHRAN \nHe drops Butler with a vicious forearm. \nShane flicks the ball over the middle to Murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and a first down. \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE - FOURTH QUARTER STUFF \nA)    BATEMAN \n(now at running back) sweeps outside with Jamal and Reese Evans leading the way. Both linemen growl as they throw themselves into the defense. \nB)    SHANE \nis rolling right with Butler on his heels. Just when it looks like Butler has him, Cochran comes out of nowhere and \ncuts Butler at the knees. Shane fakes a throw and keeps the ball for a fifteen- yard gain. \nC)   SHANE \nhits Franklin with a short flick pass. \nD)   BATEMAN \nruns off tackle and scores. \nE)   PACIFICO \nkicks the extra point.     Scoreboard: Dallas 24, Redskins 7. \nF)   WILKINSON \nblitzes from his safety position and decks the Dallas quarterback. \nG)   BATEMAN \nstops a runner at the line of scrimmage and throws him for a loss. \nH)   WILKINSON \ntakes a punt at his own thirty. With Bateman blocking, Wilkinson springs to the outside and goes all the way for a touchdown. \nPacifico kicks the extra point. Scoreboard: Dallas 24, Redskins 14. \nI)   DALLAS FIELD GOAL KICKER \nis set to boot one. The ball is snapped, the kicker moves forward and suddenly Brian Murray breaks through the offense and blocks the kick. \nJ)   SHANE \nhits Franklin on a little down and out. He's hit by the defender, the ball goes flying but so does a flag. \nPass interference.   Redskin first down. \nK)   ON CLOCK \nFour minutes six seconds remain. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HUDDLE - DAY \nThe Redskin huddle breaks.   The guys come to the line of scrimmage. \nAL (V.O.) First and ten at the Cowboy twenty and I'm telling you, we are looking at a totally different team here in the second half. \nBOOMER (V.O.) Absolutely, Al. The Redskins are playing like there's no tomorrow, because, hey, there isn't! \nDAN (V.O.) I gotta agree with you on this one. The surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the Cowboys have been in this half. I mean, they look totally intimidated. \nAL (V.O.) I love when you guys agree. \nON SHANE \nHe's in the shotgun calling signals. \nSHANE Hut!   Hut! \nOn the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of bounds. \nAL (V.O.) Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal to tie it up. That's almost a chip shot for Pacifico. \nON SHANE \nHe shakily follows Pacifico out onto the field. \nReese Evans catches up with him. \nEVANS (to Shane) Are you okay? \nSHANE Just make it a good snap. (to Pacifico) And you'll do the rest, right? \nPacifico doesn't answer. \nON BALL \nEvans leans over it. \nON SHANE \nHe's kneeling in the middle of the field waiting for the snap. But something is bothering him. \nSHANE (to Pacifico) Lou, are you alright? \nPacifico looks up from where he is set up for the kick. There are tears in his eyes. \nPACIFICO I'm sorry. They know where my family lives. \nShane tries to digest what he just heard. \nSHANE What?! \nEVANS (through his legs) Come on, Shane! \nShane looks back at Pacifico and makes a decision. \nSHANE Hut! \nThe ball is snapped perfectly.      Shane catches it and spots it perfectly. \nPacifico moves to kick it. \nAnd Shane pulls the ball away. \nPacifico flies through the air like Snoopy as he kicks nothing but air. He lands hard. \nShane jumps to his feet and starts running. \nAL (V.O.) It's a fake! Falco has it! \nON McGINTY \nHe's in shock. \nON SHANE \nHe has totally caught the Cowboys by surprise. He sweeps around the right side. \nThe Dallas middle linebacker has recovered and is moving quickly to cut Shane off. \nBut Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and crushes the guy with a flying block. \nShane cuts downfield and heads for the end zone with nobody near him, except: \nFor the same safety from the first half who waits for him at the ten. \nThe safety smiles as he takes a bead on Shane. \nShane heads right for the guy. He puts his head down and smacks helmets with the safety. The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and into the end zone. \nAL (V.O.) Falco scores! \nON McGINTY \nHe jumps into the air. \nON O'NEIL \nHe jumps out of bed. \nON TODD, ROD AND BOB \nThey jump on each other. \nON ANNABELLE \nShe's jumping for joy. \nON SHANE \nHe spikes the shit out of the ball.   And then sees something up field. \nAL (V.O.) \nWait a minute. Wait a minute. We've got a flag down. \nShane stands stock-still in the end zone watching the REF call the penalty. \nREF Clipping. Number 77 offense. \nON MICKEY LEE \nHe's wearing number 77 and he collapses in tears. \nON TODD, ROD AND BOB \n", "test1_input": "Shane turns and sees her.    She's as fetching as ever. \nANNABELLE McGinty, I mean. \nSHANE I was kind of thinking the same thing. \nANNABELLE My theory is he came out of retirement to see if he could win with losers. (pause) Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... \nSHANE (interrupting) Hey, it's okay. I've been called worse. \nANNABELLE Like    after that Sugar Bowl    game? I guess you could    survive anything after    that. \nShane has to actually smile at this. \nSHANE Sometimes I feel like everybody in the world saw that game. Like I could go to India and some little guy would run up to me and say, 'Boy, did you suck in \nthe '92 Sugar Bowl.' \nAnnabelle laughs. \nSHANE So, how come you're such a fan? \nANNABELLE My dad. He's a huge Redskin fan. For years. He's in his twenty-ninth year at the Senate Office Building. As a guard, not a senator. The only thing that keeps him going he says, is me and the Redskins. That's where I get it. My fan-ness. (suddenly) Are you scared? \nShane is totally taken off guard by this woman. \nSHANE Scared? Well... yes. Absolutely. \nANNABELLE It's okay. Anybody would be. But you're good. And you'll do good. \nSHANE Well, thank you. Look, I gotta study the play book tonight. So... I'll see you. \nANNABELLE Break a leg tomorrow. \nSHANE What?! \nANNABELLE It's    from the theater. For    opening night. You say    the worst thing that    can happen. And \nit won't.   Break a leg. \nShane waves uncertainly and walks away. \nEXT. McGINTY'S BACK YARD - DAY \nThe Judge (now with his jacket off) and Wilkinson are lined up across from each other in a three-point stance in something called a man maker drill. \nThe entire team forms two lanes on either side of them, as they face off. \nThe idea is to knock the other guy down and get by him. \nJUDGE Alright, this is how we used to stop a running back. \nWILKINSON I can't wait. \nSomeone says hut! And Wilkinson slams into the Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge and knocks him head over heels. \nThe Judge lands on his back, wham!   He's out cold. \nWilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal. \nWILKINSON Oooh... got me a judge! Man, that felt good! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BIG O STADIUM - DAY \nIt's another beautiful fall afternoon and cars are entering the stadium parking lot. \nAt one of the entrances, the striking Redskins are picketing. Jerome Lindell (NFL Players President) is still marching with them. \nA little boy stops one of the Redskins and asks for an autograph on a program. The \nplayer gives it to him and the kid walks away. \nLindell runs after the kid, grabs the program and rips off the page the player signed. \nLINDELL (to kid) Don't be asking    for no autographs from    the real players and    then go in and watch    the scabs! \nThe kid retreats quickly.    Lindell rips up the page. \nLINDELL (to the player) That is not the message we want to send our children! \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nIt's very quiet. Shane sits in pads and no jersey, methodically squeezing a football. \nReese Evans, his center, stops by. \nEVANS You okay? \nShane nods and gives a nauseous-looking smile. \nEVANS Remember to nod your head on the snap. \nSHANE (out of it) Nod my head? \nEVANS For    when Murray's in. The    deaf kid. Hello? He    needs to look at you on    the snap. \nShane nods that he understands but he goes \nback to staring at a wall. \nAndre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andre throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but Jamal catches it. They both nod in approval. \nLou Pacifico smokes and stares. \n", "test1_true": "Earl Wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing a beautiful pair of new alligator shoes. \nClifford Franklin looks at himself in the mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his helmet. \nWalter Cochran is reading his Bible in front of his locker, which features a picture of Jesus and a cross. \nMickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of a bowl of hard boiled eggs. He's methodically popping them into his mouth. He eats four as we watch. \nCoach Pilachowski comes up to Lee and watches him eat. \nPILACHOWSKI What are you, crazy? Nobody eats right before a game. \nLEE I always ate before a big match. I need the bulk. \nLike a hole in the head he needs the bulk. \nCoach McGinty comes strolling through the locker room, the picture of calm. \nHe walks by defensive end/tight end Brian Murray and signs to him to have a good game. Murray signs back, \"Thanks, Coach.\" \nCochran spots McGinty and puts down his Bible. \nCOCHRAN \nCoach McGinty, I'd like to lead the team in the pregame prayer. \nMcGINTY No. No praying. That's the problem with professional sports today: too much god damn praying. Five hundred dollar fine to the first man I hear praying. \nMcGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and walks to the middle of the locker room. \nHe eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes in his players. \nMcGINTY A lot of people are waiting for you to fall on your asses today. And guess what? You're going to. But I don't give a shit if you look funny out there. Or if you miss a block, or drop a pass, or trip over your own dick. This is professional. And the difference between professional and amateur, between playing for the Washington Redskins and Michigan State is simply... money. You are being paid to win. Not just to play. Not just to learn how to be good sports. Not for the alumni. You are being paid to win. I don't care how the fuck you do it. But I'm demanding it. Because those guys whose place you're taking have forgotten that simple fact. So, go win it. \nHe walks away.   The players get up and start \nmoving. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BIG O - DAY \nWe're FOCUSED ON an enormous,    plastic blow-up Washington Redskin helmet that    bobs on the ground in front of the exit to    the field. The idea is, the players will    run into and then out of the helmet as they    are introduced. \nAnnabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleaders are lined up on either side of the bobbing helmet, waiting for the players. \nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL \nThey are in their booth, vamping ON CAMERA. \nMADDEN ... Pretty bold move by New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam, who went out and bought an entire semi-pro team once the strike happened. (MORE) \nMADDEN (CONT'D) Redskin management, on the other hand, is going with a bunch of unknowns. Their public relations people don't even have bios yet on most of their players, although we'll see one or two familiar faces out there today. \nSUMMERALL Like Shane Falco, the enormously talented college quarterback from Ohio State, who never fulfilled his potential in the pro's. (to Madden) Wow, remember that \nSugar Bowl Falco quarterbacked when Florida State creamed them? \nMADDEN Oh, yeah, they were absolutely decimated! \nSUMMERALL Dusted. And if I'm not mistaken, Falco set a record in that game for Bowl interceptions. Anyway, for some of these players this is another shot; a last shot, probably, for a guy like Falco... \nCUT TO: \nINT. TUNNEL - DAY \nShane is looking out at the field through the blow-up helmet. He looks scared. \nSuddenly, a CANNON goes off with a stomach- resounding BOOM! Shane jumps. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, your Washington Redskins! \nIN STANDS \nA sparse crowd is in attendance, mostly diehard fans like Todd, Rod and Bob, who are decked out in burgundy and gold. They look drunk already as they cheer like mad. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Here's the starting defense today... \nINT. TUNNEL \nBateman is first in line.    He looks like a \nracehorse on cocaine. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) At middle linebacker, number 56, Daniel Bateman! \nBateman takes off at a dead run out of the tunnel and into the helmet. \nON HIS FOOT \nIt hits a wire stretched across the ground inside the helmet. \nON BATEMAN \nHe trips big-time into the side of the helmet. He bounces (it's inflated, remember?) to the other side, bounces again and is shot out of the front of it like a cannon ball. \nON CHEERLEADERS \nBateman bounces out of the helmet and takes out the first six cheerleaders. \nGirls fly left and right.       One girl is knocked out of her shoes. \nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL \nMadden covers his face.     Summerall looks pained. \nSUMMERALL Oh, my... \n", "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nEXT. PALM RESTAURANT - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nWe see Shane walk in the door. \nINT. PALM - NIGHT \nThe Scabskins are all being served dinner in a private room. \nMickey Lee is served a steak the size of a briefcase. Andre and Jamal get lobsters big enough to be pets. \nEd O'Neil is being fed pureed asparagus by Augustine. When Augustine drops the napkin and bends over, O'Neil whispers urgently to Cochran who is enjoying a steak: \nO'NEIL I'll give you 50 thousand dollars for a bite of that steak! \nMcGinty taps his glass at the head of the table and stands. \nMcGINTY Alright, listen up: There have been a lot of rumors about the regular players crossing the picket lines. They are not rumors. Many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in \ndroves. Apparently, they have been struck with the realization that it is a blessing to be playing professional football. \nThere is dead silence in the room.   Everybody thinks it's over. \nMcGINTY But they had their chance. Now it's your turn. Mister O'Neil and I have agreed to ban all striking players and to continue to go with you guys. \nThere's a beat and then everyone breaks into cheers. \nSuddenly, the door flies open and a REPORTER and a cameraman step in and start filming. The Reporter shoves a microphone at McGinty. \nREPORTER Coach, what will be your strategy against New York this Sunday? \nOut in the restaurant, patrons see the players and a few break into \"Hail to the Redskins.\" \nSuddenly, the whole restaurant starts singing. \nShane looks embarrassed. \nPacifico stands up on his seat, and conducts the singing. \nAndre and Jamal hold their lobsters in the air and make them dance to the song. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EDDIE MARTEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe're ON a TELEVISION showing Pacifico conducting and the entire restaurant singing. \nEddie Martel (Redskin quarterback) is watching the scene at home on the late local news. \nNEWSPERSON (V.O.) ... The Palm patrons showed an impromptu appreciation tonight for the new Washington Redskins. They may be unknowns and far from superstars, but it sure looks like they have charmed the fans. \nMartel looks very angry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHANE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nShane answers his door.     Annabelle is standing there. \nSHANE Hi.    Come in. \nANNABELLE No. \nShe gives him a bottle of pills. \nANNABELLE We don't travel with the team. So, here's Tylenol with codeine, regular Vicodins, the magic bullet one that I gave you before, and a couple of Darvons if you actually break something. Pop 'em in the ambulance. \nSHANE Wow.    Thanks. \nANNABELLE I'll be watching on TV. The Giants got back three of their four defensive linemen. \nPlus their middle linebacker. \nSHANE Yeah.   I know. \nANNABELLE What can I say? Go from the shotgun and scramble your ass off. \nShane smiles at her. \nShe suddenly grabs him and they kiss big- time. \nThen she breaks and walks quickly away. \nShane doesn't know what to make of this. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MEADOWLANDS (NEW JERSEY) - DAY \nWe're DOWN ON the field in the middle of a play. \nShane is running away from three New York Giant defensive linemen. \nShane is not even looking for a receiver. He's looking to save his life. \nFinally, he's caught by a six-foot-five, two hundred and seventy pound defensive end named HANK MORRIS, who throws him down and lands on top of him. Oooof! \nMORRIS (in Shane's ear) Hello, again! \nINT. CONTROL BOOTH - ON SUMMERALL AND MADDEN - DAY \nThey're back in their booth calling the game. \nMADDEN That's all-pro Hank Morris's third sack, his second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for \nthe Giants. Falco is gonna be sore tonight. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. STADIUM - DAY \nJerome Lindell is once again outside the stadium, picketing with a smaller group of players. \nHe does his interview on camera, standing in front of a huge semi-truck. \nAnd a big, overweight truck driver stands next to him. \nLINDELL ... because it's about brothers, and brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors. That's why I am so grateful to our Teamster brothers who have joined us here today in New York to protest the greed squad known as the N.F.L. owners. \nThe truck driver suddenly pumps his arm and a CACOPHONY OF TRUCK AIR HORNS GO OFF. \nIt's deafening but Lindell smiles through it all. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nShane is rolling out with Morris on his heels again. He can't find anyone open and runs out of bounds. \nIN HUDDLE \nEverybody is breathing hard, beat-up and exhausted. Shane leans in. \nSHANE (to Reese Evans) You got to double up on Morris. \nEVANS He's too far outside for me to get to him. (to Cochran) Bring him down and sit on him. \nCOCHRAN He's huge! He's been beating the crap out of me all day! I feel like a rag doll out here. \nLEE I'll help this time. \nSHANE Okay. Spread left 'A' Right, roll right Half Back Sail. On two. \nThey break.   Shane sets up in the shotgun. \nSHANE Red, fifteen.   Hut, hut! \nOn the snap, Lee and Cochran double-team Morris. \nMorris slaps Cochran away like, well, a rag doll, and then confronts the Sumo master. \nHe bumps stomachs with Lee. Lee flies through the air and lands on his ass. \nON SHANE \nHe spots his receiver, he cocks his arm and wham! Morris decks him. And, of course, lands on him. Oooof! \nMORRIS \n(to Shane) It's just me, fuck- face! \nIn order to get up, Morris puts one huge hand on Shane's helmet and pushes himself up. Shane moans as his face guard digs a four- inch hole in the turf. \nON McGINTY \nHe's talking into his mike. \nMcGINTY You want a time-out? That looks like it hurt. \nShane gets up. He's got a huge piece of turf stuck in his face guard so that for a beat, we can't even see him. \nThen he pulls out the dirt and grass, and we see Shane really pissed off for the first time. \nSHANE Huddle up! \nEveryone gathers around. \nSHANE Same thing... Except... (to Lee and Cochran) Let him in. Don't touch him. \nLEE What? \nEVANS Shane... \nSHANE Shut up! Let him through. On two. \nThey break the huddle.     Shane goes into a shotgun. \nSHANE Red fifteen. Hut! \nHut! \nShane does a three-step drop from the shotgun. \nCochran and Lee hit out on either side of Morris, giving him a clear shot at Shane. \nMorris comes hard and fast. \nShane looks downfield, winds up, turns and fires the ball at Morris's head. \nThe ball goes like a bullet for five feet and then sticks like a dart in Morris's face guard. \nFor a moment, Morris is blinded. \nAnd Shane is dumbfounded. \nThen Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of his mask. \nSHANE Get him! \nAndre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts stumbling down field with the ball still stuck in his helmet. \nMADDEN (V.O.) Morris intercepts! Wait! The ball is stuck in his face! \nBut Morris won't go down. He's still trying to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal. \nThen he shakes off Andre. \nON BRIAN MURRAY \n", "test3_input": "He's in SLOW MOTION in midair, diving towards Morris. \nMURRAY'S POV \nIt's absolutely QUIET (he's deaf, remember?) as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and ball. \nWham! Murray's full body weight hits Morris in the helmet, which flies off and rolls across the field with the ball still stuck in it. \nOUT OF THE SILENCE, we suddenly hear the hit and the crowd roar. \nMorris goes down like a building with Murray buried in his throat. \nON ROOM (D.C.) \nTodd, Rod and Bob are destroying Todd's den in reaction to the hit. \nON ANOTHER LIVING ROOM \nAnnabelle is screaming \"Whoa!\" to that hit. \nON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE \nThey're watching ON TV. \nO'NEIL Now that's a hit! \nON BALL AND HELMET \nIt's in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee, who is rumbling downfield with the fumble/helmet recovery. \nNew York players have been slow to pick this up because they, too, have been admiring the lick that Murray put on Morris. \nSuddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee. \nThey catch him pretty easily at the twenty, but Lee represents a lot of weight. \nLee staggers across the ten, shaking players off left and right. \nOne defensive halfback sacrifices himself and throws himself at Lee's feet. \nLee trips over the guy, gains his footing again, walks on the guy (who screams in \nagony) and falls into the end zone carrying three players with him. \nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL \nJohn is beside himself. \nMADDEN Lee scores! Lee scores! Lee scores! I love to see a fat guy score! \nON LEE \nHe gets up in jubilation, spikes the ball/helmet combination, and runs through the back of the end zone. \nBut he doesn't stop. He's aiming for a low wall that separates the first row of fans from the field. \nON FOUR FANS \nThey see Mickey rumbling at them and they all get the picture at the same time. They scream! \nON MICKEY \nHe launches himself into the stands in ecstasy. \nON FOUR FANS \nCrunch!     Lee lands on all four of them. \nON FOOTBALL \nIt's hiked into Shane's hands and Pacifico boots the extra point. \nON SCOREBOARD \n\"Giants 10 -- Redskins 10 TIME REMAINING: 58 seconds.\" \nON SIDELINE \nMurray and Lee are getting congratulations from everyone. \nPACIFICO (to Murray) What a hit! (slower) What a hit! \nMurray nods that he understands. \nEVANS (to Murray) I'm proud of you, kid. \nJamal and Andre are hugging Lee. In the b.g., we can see paramedics lifting one of Lee's four fans onto a stretcher. \nANDRE You're the one, you're the one, you're the one... \nLEE You think that's worth a shoe deal? \nMcGinty walks into the middle of it. \nMcGINTY Stop with the lovefest! Let's get the goddamn ball back and win this thing! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nWe're CLOSE ON Bateman as he lines up for the kick-off. Everybody in the stadium knows that an on-side kick is coming. \nBateman is standing in the hot spot for recovering the ball. \nShane and everyone with decent hands is on the field. \nPacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards. \n", "test3_true": "Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball on the bounce. He's got it. \nBut Bateman doesn't go down. He turns and starts running across the field. \nShane runs after him. \nSHANE No! Danny, go down! You're using up the clock! \nBut Bateman likes this new job: kick-off returner! Especially after he runs over a Giant and stiff-arms another. \nBateman is finally trapped on the far sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards. \nSo, he turns and starts running back the other way. \nShane has been chasing him and now sees Bateman running back at him. \nShane has no choice but to throw himself in front of Bateman's legs. \nBateman goes down. \nShane jumps up: \nSHANE (to ref) Time out! \nBateman looks up at Shane. \nBATEMAN Beautiful tackle, Shane! \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) Now that's something you don't see everyday! \nON CLOCK \nBateman has burned up most of the clock. Eighteen seconds remain. \nON SIDELINE \nMcGinty, Shane and Pacifico confer. \nSHANE We got time for one play, but if we don't get it out of bounds, the game is over. \nMcGINTY Yeah, but you're looking at a sixty-five yard kick from here. \nPACIFICO (smoking a butt) No problem. \nSHANE Seriously? \nPACIFICO (to Shane) You hold it. I'll kick it. \nMcGinty looks at Shane and they both shrug. \nMcGINTY What the fuck. \nON SUMMERALL AND MADDEN \nMadden can't believe it. \nMADDEN I can't believe it! McGinty is gonna let Pacifico try the field goal from sixty-five yards out! \nSUMMERALL Hey, John, this kid has got a heck of a foot. \nSTRAM But sixty-five yards? Come on! \nON SHANE \nHe's set up to receive the snap. \nPacifico lines himself up the way soccer- style kickers do. \nThen he takes a drag on his smoke, and flicks it away. \nMADDEN    (V.O.) Pat... did he    just? I think that guy    is smoking on the    field! \nSUMMERALL (V.O.) No, I think you imagined that one, John. \nShane looks at Pacifico and his clean uniform. \nThen Shane looks at his own uniform which is covered with blood, dirt, and grass stains. \nPacifico looks clean. \nSHANE You look great, Lou, you know that? \nPacifico is really touched. \nLOU Really? Thanks, Shane. That means a lot to me. \nShane turns to Evans who smiles at him between his own legs. \nSHANE Hut! \nThe snap is perfect.    Pacifico boots the shit out of it. \nON BALL \nEnd over end, yard after yard, it flies straight and true. \nMADDEN (V.O.) It's straight enough! If it's got the distance, it's... \nThe ball hits the crossbar and goes over. \nMADDEN (V.O.) Good!     Redskins win! \nEverybody goes crazy. Players are pounding on Pacifico. But Pacifico is desperately looking around for someone. \nHe spots him: It's Bateman running flat-out across the field to congratulate him. \nPacifico runs for his life. \n"}

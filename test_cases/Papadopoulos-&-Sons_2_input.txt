THEO Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros again? 
MRS PARRINGTON Yes, of course we will. 
SPIROS Who's going to help me to run the store? I'm going to need you little man. 
MRS PARRINGTON I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here. (CONTINUED)

The mobile phone rings. HARRY answers. 
HARRY Hello. Lars. Yeah. I'm just... 
HARRY steps away from the table and exits the restaurant area. We watch the family. They do not talk. HARRY comes back. 
MRS PARRINGTON What is it? 
THEO Did you get the loan? 
HARRY Bad news I'm afraid. 
KATIE Really? 
HARRY Yeah. We're going home! We got it! We're going home. 
The family's response is muted. 
SPIROS Congratulations. 
HARRY What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out of here. We got the loan. We should be celebrating. 
The family are still unmoved. SPIROS He's right. It's a good day. You, you made it. You're a survivor. Sorry. 
SPIROS shows some discomfort and starts to get up. 
HARRY What is it with you Spiro? Why can't you be happy for me? Whenever I have any kind success you always have to stamp on it. (Spiros gets up) Where are you going? 
SPIROS I am happy for you. I am. 
HARRY What is it? What's wrong? 
Spiros staggers off.

SPIROS collapses onto the floor.

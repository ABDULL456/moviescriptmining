SIDNEY Listen, you know how things work around here. How am I going to get something in the magazine? Alison stares at him. 
ALISON I thought all this "fluff" was beneath you? 
SIDNEY It is but...things have changed. 
ALISON What's changed? 
SIDNEY Look, I know people think I'm a bit of an idiot and maybe I haven't started off too well here, but I want...I want... He seems so awkward that Alison begins to soften a little. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) ...I want to have sex with Sophie Maes. (Beat) Before Maddox does. Alison's expression turns to disgust. 
ALISON You're loathsome, you know that? 
SIDNEY 
(OBLIVIOUS) I know he's got a head start on me but I'm going to win her back. Once I get my hooks into a girl, they never get free. 
ALISON Like ring-worm. She gets up and stalks out. Sidney glances through the glass partition and sees MADDOX walking past. 
SIDNEY 
(TO HIMSELF) The gloves are coming off. We hear the opening of Brigitte Bardot's Moi Je Joue as we... 
55 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 55 
Sidney is pitching to Clayton in the elevator. 
SIDNEY Okay. Celebrity Trash Cans. The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to... Five bottles of Jack Daniels, a court order, and a copy of Mein Kampf? Mel Gibson! 
CLAYTON HARDING (getting out the lift) First Room, Sidney. First room. 
56 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 56 
A small group of GLITTERATI pass the immense line of hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by the DOORMAN at the entrance. Sidney walks confidently up, pretending to talk into his cell. The Doorman stands in his way, impassive. Still talking Sidney turns and walks away as if nothing has happened. 
57 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 57 
Sidney standing with a MODEL-TYPE in the elevator. He takes a LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH from his wallet and shows it to her. 
SIDNEY (pointing at the snap) Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood? 
MODEL Morgan Freeman? 
SIDNEY No, not...why's everyone say...? There! In the head-lock! 
58 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 58 
Sidney pitches to a closed door in the office. He is holding a LARGE PIECE OF CARD on which is drawn a TREE decorated with the heads of various CELEBRITIES. 
SIDNEY It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates all of the sexual pairings of Hollywood's top stars and how they interconnect... From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written First Room. We hear a TOILET FLUSH. 
59 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 59 
Sidney approaches the Doorman , takes a ten dollar bill from his pocket and hands it to the Doorman. The Doorman crumples the bill up and throws it away. Without a word Sidney begins to walk away. He comes back and picks up the crumpled note and then heads off again. 
60 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 60 
Harding is eating lunch at his desk. He looks up and finds Sidney staring down at him with puppy-dog eyes. Beat. Harding sighs. 
CLAYTON HARDING If I give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone? Sidney smiles. The song ends. 
61 INT. STUDIO - DAY 61 
Nathan Lane shakes hands with Sidney as he sits down. 
NATHAN LANE Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you. 
SIDNEY Great to meet you Nathan. I'm a big fan. I love that rat thing you played in The Lion King. 
NATHAN LANE 
(PLEASANTLY) Actually he's a meer cat.

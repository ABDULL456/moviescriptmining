Roque takes a pull on his straw. 
ROQUE You're not drinking? 
EXT. FLORIDA -- MCDONALD'S PARKING LOT -- AFTERNOON 
Clay and Roque wolf Big Macs in a 1988 Chevy Crew Cab. FAMILIES eat outside. KIDS play like hamsters in tubes. 
CLAY We'll stay two more days, try to get some of the cash back. 
ROQUE Then what? 
CLAY Miami. Jai-Alai. 
Various PEOPLE walk to and from their cars. Clay and Roque shield their faces from them instinctually. 
ROQUE I can't take much more of this. CLAY We're on the run. It occasionally INVOLVES RUNNING- 
ROQUE I'm serious. Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds- (DELICATELY) I'm at the point where I'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the Company... 
CLAY All we did was say the word "Max" and they blew up a building. CIA even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike. (shakes his head) Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low. 
A Metro Dade POLICE CRUISER rolls into the McDonald's. Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot... 
ROQUE Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel anymore. 
CLAY Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead- 
ROQUE Like the others? Least I still talk to them. You pushed them away. "Max this, Max that" - we never even saw the guy, Clay- 
CLAY We heard his voice. Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat. And if he's got a throat... 
ROQUE (IN DISBELIEF) We're hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You actually think we're in any position to take on some shadowy CIA super- spook? 
CLAY ROQUE- 
ROQUE No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops! (gestures to the PLAYGROUND) Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide! 
Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other... 
CLAY Go. Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street... 
EXT. MOTEL SIX -- AFTERNOON 
Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend: 
ROQUE I was there too. I remember. But he won. We lost. (PAUSE) Maybe it's time for a new game. 
With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food... 
INT. BUSTER'S BOOZE & BURGERS 
Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky- tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor. 
A YOUNG WOMAN enters - she's hot, feels familiar. Clay eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several GUYS. 
PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE GUY Yabba Dabba Doo... 
She catches Clay's eye. Rolls her eyes. Clay's paying more attention to his T-Bone than the girl. She slides up next to him. Her name's AISHA. 
AISHA Men. 
Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats. 
AISHA (CONT'D) How's the steak? 
CLAY Meaty. 
She's still watching him. It's getting annoying. 
CLAY (CONT'D) Want a bite? AISHA I don't eat red meat. 
CLAY Why not? 
AISHA Slows me down. 
CLAY Okay. 
Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention, we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're not sure if Clay does. 
AISHA You got nice arms.

The clock reads 10:12. 
ANGLE 
Galvin downs his drink, picks his briefcase off of the bar and starts for the door. 
INT. JUDGE SWEENEY'S CHAMBERS-DAY 
JUDGE SWEENEY, a florid man in his sixties, sitting in shirtsleeves eating bacon and eggs off of a hotel service on a tray, talking conspiratorially with Ed Concannon, who is drinking coffee, seated across the desk. They are obviously old friends. The sound of a door opening. They turn their heads to the door. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
Galvin standing in the door. 
JUDGE (V.O.) You're late, Mr. Galvin. 
He enters the room. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he sits next to Concannon. 
GALVIN Yessir. I'm sorry. 
JUDGE Why is that? 
GALVIN I was held up. 
Concannon smiles and extends his hand. 
CONCANNON Ed Concannon. 
GALVIN (shaking his head) Frank Galvin. We've met before. 
As the Judge starts to speak Galvin cannot help looking at Concannon out of the corner of his eye. 
JUDGE Let's do some business. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. GALVIN 
Concannon, brisk, expensive-looking, tanned, huge gold watch, custom-made suit. 
JUDGE (V.O.) They tell me that no bargain ever was completed other than quickly when both parties really cared to make a deal. 
Concannon feels Galvin's eye on him, half-turns, smiles. 
ANGLE - THE JUDGE, CONCANNON, GALVIN 
JUDGE Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. 
GALVIN This is a complicated case, your Honor... 
JUDGE I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? (smiles at Galvin) See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? 
GALVIN My client can't walk, your Honor. 
JUDGE I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you. 
CONCANNON Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. 
JUDGE Huh! 
CONCANNON My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. (beat) When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. (turns to Galvin) As long as you understand that. (beat) It's got to be that way. 
GALVIN We are going to try the case. 
A beat. Galvin fumbles for a cigarette. The three sit in silence. 
JUDGE (incredulous) That's it...? (beat) Come on, guys... life is too short... (beat) You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. (beat; turns to Galvin) Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. 
GALVIN ...things change. 
JUDGE ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... 
GALVIN I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... 
JUDGE And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. (beat) I myself would take it and run like a thief. 
GALVIN I'm sure you would. 
The Judge turns, unbelieving that Galvin has patronized and insulted him. He controls himself. 
JUDGE Hm. (beat; checking book) We have the date set? Next Thursday. Good. (smiles) See you boys in court.

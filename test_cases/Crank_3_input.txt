CHEV S hit! 
He clicks off the cell.       His eyes try to focus on the road. 
OTE: Through it all, the low beating of the heart - from slow to fast - sometimes barely audible, sometimes mixed way out front - clues us into the state of his adrenaline. 
He grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial. 
CHEV (CONT'D) Come on ... 
ANSWERING SERVICE (O.S.) Doctor Miles' office, may I help you? 
CHEV Let me talk to him. 
SPLIT SCREEN WITH: 
INT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS CHOCOLATE, a too-skinny, cracked-out BLACK CHICK, sits in front of a multi-line phone in a broken down apartment. She's wearing a headset. She takes a long drag off her cigarette. 
HOCOLATE (a generic imitation of politeness) I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office at this time, may I take - 
CHEV Where is he? 
CHOCOLATE I beg your pardon sir? 
CHEV Where - thefuck - is - he? 
In more SCREENS WITHIN SCREENS we see a 'WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS' sign, then DOCTOR MILES reclining on a massage table with a bunch of HOOKERS.) 
CHOCOLATE I don't know sir, this is his answering service, would you like me to have him paged?

CONTINUED: 
CHEV (exasperated) Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour... got that?     C HOCOLATE Can you spell that for me sir? 
She searches the food and carton strewn tabletop for something to write with. 
CHEV D-E-A-D.   Chelios... got it? 
CHOCOLATE Yes sir... 
CHEV Thank you. 
HEV hangs up. 
CHEV finds himself nodding off in the car ... 
The CAMERA ZOOMS back into his chest. This time it becomes COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - we see his HEART BEAT SLOW DOWN: 
SOUND - BOOMING: ... LUB DUB, LUB DUB... 
The CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE GAS... then back up to the HEART as the ADRENALINE CRANKS HIM UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP - 
SOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..! 
... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems to come to his senses. 
CHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the cigarette adapter. Four rings. Finally someone picks up. 
KAYLO (O.S.) Hello? 
CHEV Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night?

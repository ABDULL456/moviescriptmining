Shelly sits alone in his office, nursing a glass of Scotch, listening to some scratchy Chet Baker on the turntable. He looks pre-occupied. Almost melancholic. Bernie's assessment of his life having hit home. 
Suddenly the door is thrown open. It's Tony... 
TONY Shelly, take a look at number 4. 
INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - MOMENTS LATER 
Shelly wanders up slowly to find Bernie at the center of the crowd. He steps behind the table into the casino pit to get a closer look. 
SHELLY (to the boxman) How much is he up? 
The boxman looks up nervously. 
BOXMAN Around three hundred thousand. 
Shelly mouths the words under his breath. 
SHELLY Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses call me? 
BOXMAN We tried. You weren't picking up. Besides, it was Bernie. 
The game resumes. 
STICKMAN Alright. We're coming out folks, hands high... 
Bernie stops. 
BERNIE Wait! 
Everybody quiets down to listen. 
BERNIE Color me up a hundred fifty thousand. (beat) And give it to him. 
Bernie points to Shelly standing in the pit. The crowd watches the drama play out. 
BERNIE That's what I owe you, Shelly. There it is. We're square. (to the table) Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives up to his obligations. 
The boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips, lays them out on the table. He counts it and claps his hands together for the cameras. 
BOXMAN One hundred fifty thousand, coming in. 
Shelly stands motionless. Staring into Bernie's eyes. The whole crowd watches. After what seems like an eternity, Shelly nods. Then the Boxman feeds the chips in with the others. A moment later, we can nary tell they were ever gone. 
Larry appears next to Shelly. Nicky and Marty watching from the sidelines -- dour expressions. 
LARRY What's the matter with you? He's one of ours and he's taking us to the fucking cleaners. 
SHELLY Lootz's off the clock. As long as he's off the clock, he's free to play. Just like every other schmuck in this joint. 
LARRY It smells wrong. I'm shutting him down. He's not leaving here with a dime -- 
Shelly suddenly jabs Larry in the throat with the tips of his fingers. Larry gasps, starts to cave. Shelly keeps him upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room. Nicky and Marty looking on in amazement. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The door flies open, Larry catapults into frame. OOF! 
Bounces off the wall. Shelly's right behind him. He drags Larry to his feet. Slams him into the wall again -- gets right up in his face. 
SHELLY Now you listen real good, you Harvard turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He leaves here tonight with whatever he comes out with. You so much as touch a hair on his head and I'll fucking wallpaper this joint with your ass. Muted tones, right? (slams him hard) What's that? I don't hear nothing. Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear it. 
Blended in at a subsonic level. 
Some kinda mantra: pain, pain, pain.

JOEY What ... What's going on?  What's happening? 
ANGLE ON TV 
The image disappears in a burst of STATIC which in turn is replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy; A head- and-shoulders of Elliott, staring directly out of the screen. 
ELLIOTT You have to help me, Joey. 
A burst of STATIC and the image disappears completely. The TV is obviously not turned on.  The room is silent. 
Joey stares at her dead TV in numbed silence. 
She falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around her, staring at the ceiling. 
INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT 
BLACKNESS 
A CLICK is heard OFF and the room is lit, REVEALING JP by the door, his finger by the light-switch.  He smiles into the room and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door. 
JP Come on in. 
Terri moves past him. 
JP locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket. 
Terri registers this.  JP calms her. 
JP Not a good neighborhood.  People disappear.  (a beat)  Feel like home? It's just like you left it. 
Terri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously. She registers the pillar. 
ANGLE ON PILLAR 
It's plainly different from the last time Terri saw it but - despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless. 
TERRI Not quite.  This wasn't here. 
JP No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am. 
TERRI Yeah ... yeah, it looks different. 
JP Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it. 
TERRI A girl?  Anyone I should know? 
JP Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean? 
JP has been cruising the room as they speak.  Now he's standing close to the pillar.  Terri is still some distance from him. 
TERRI Yeah right.  Look ... 
JP Terri, listen.    (a beat)   Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know. 
A pause - a tense one for the audience who know that JP has obviously decided who Pinhead's next meal is.  Terri looks at JP, half suspicious, half attracted. 
TERRI I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet. 
JP Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night. 
JP smiles winningly and warmly.  A nice guy.  A nice smile.  A smile a girl can trust. 
The pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and silent, waiting for the sacrifice. 
INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT 
Series of shots (maybe all CROSS-FADED) of kids dancing and drinking in the club to establish the passing of time - and to highlight the tension of the scene in JP's room by its proximity to this (relative) normality. 
INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT    (MINUTES LATER) 
JP lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar. 
Terri is sitting on the bed.  She's upset.  She's been telling JP about Joey and the phone message. 
JP That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.

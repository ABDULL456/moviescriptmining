BISHOP (CONT'D) My father was very good, better than I'll ever be. But no one controls 100%. The nature of the work is that some people know who you are and what you do. 
(BEAT) A man told his girlfriend, to impress her. The girlfriend told some people she owned money to... Bishop finishes his glass of water. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) I was young. It took me four months to find the people, another to find the girl, and she gave me the Man. That's how I... "got into it." 
STEVE You ever wish you just... walked away? Let it go? 
BISHOP Sure. Every day. But I wasn't wired that way. 
(BEAT) What about you? Beat. Steve and Bishop, oddly locked... BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three SMALL EXPLOSIONS in the kitchen. FLAMES shoot out of the galley. A cook stumbles out, on fire. A waiter douses him with water. People SCREAM! Alarms BLARE! Steve and Bishop. They haven't moved a muscle. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) Here we go... And they're MOVING. 
INT. SECURITY STATION, EMBASSY - EVENING 
SECURITY takes a call as another man studies his monitor: People fleeing the building across the street, smoke. 
SECURITY Fire in the restaurant. (into radio, Turkish) Patrols two and five, we're closing down the front entrance. 
INT. SUITE, EMBASSY - EVENING 
The MARK stands at her closet, starting to unbutton her shirt to change for her swim. She pulls it closed as one of her security knocks and pushes into the room from a balcony. 
SECURITY PRO Excuse me, 'mam. There's a fire next door, nothing to worry about. The Mark nods. The man locks the door behind him, crosses the room, leaves through the main door, professional. 
INT. STAIRWELL - EVENING 
Steve and Bishop push UPWARDS through a stream of people flooding DOWN the emergency stairs. They reach a heavy door, locked and alarmed. Beat. Three people burst out from the inside. Steve catches the door and they're through... 
INT. LAW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
A few LAWYERS and a SECRETARY still collecting their things look up as Bishop and Steve push in, holding up badges. 
STEVE Hey! You need to get out! Whole building is going up! Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave. They move down five doors, push into... 
INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
A private office. Desk, computer, a handwritten note reads "Leave mail here, will be back Wednesday." A box from UPS which Bishop TEARS open. Inside, what looks like a large WEAPON. Steve goes to the windows, pushes them open. P.O.V. - THE EMBASSY ACROSS: Changing its security pattern. Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors. Below, the excess manpower is channeled to the front. Bishop turns, FIRES OUT THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across, SINKS into the wall of the embassy 30 feet away. Bishop HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the box. Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it. He crosses the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he returns, Bishop's already secured the cable outside. 
BISHOP Ready? 
Steve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under their clothing. He steps out onto the ledge with Bishop, closes the window behind him. Bishop lets himself fall backwards. 
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
Flashing light of the fire trucks. No one sees the two figures sliding silently from building to building above, disappearing over a 4th story railing. 
EXT. BALCONY, EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Steve lands next to Bishop who unfastens the cord they used to cross, spools it back to them. A look. No way back now, and no trace left behind. Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy Security. A quick lock pick, and they slip inside. 
INT. ROOF LEVEL, EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Elevator doors open and the Mark gets out. She nods to the guard on duty, heads into a changing room. 
INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Two guards monitor screens: Corridors, rooms, entrances and exits. Pairs of guards make their rounds. CLOSING IN ON ONE PAIR. Something about them... The guard squints just as the image CHANGES, showing another part of the embassy. The guard hits a toggle, returns the previous image... But Bishop and Steve are gone.

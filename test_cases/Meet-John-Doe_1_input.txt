ANN is deeply concerned. She watches him, helplessly. 
JOHN 
(continuing) 
You know, I never thought much about people before. They were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers. The only time I worried about them was if theyis when they didn't come in to see me pitch. You know, lately I've been watching them while I talked to them. I could see something in their faces. I could feel that they were hungry for something. Do you know what I mean? 
ANN nods. 
JOHN 
Maybe that's why they came. Maybe they were just lonely and wanted somebody to say hello to. I know how they feel. I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life. 
ANN forces a smile. The moment threatens to become awkwarduntil they are saved by the pilot's voice. 
PILOT 
All aboard, folks! 
They suddenly snap out of their moodand as they rise: 
Fade out. 
Fade in: Int. D. B.'s dining room. Full shot: As D. B., ANN and TED SHELDON enter and cross to table. ANN starts to sit and notices a fur coat flung over the back of the chair. 
ANN 
Oh, somebody else sitting there? 
D. B. 
No, no, nothat's your seat. 
TED 
And this is your coat. 
ANN 
Mine? 
D. B. 
A little token of appreciation. 
Ann pauses a moment, glances toward D. B.while TED throws the coat over her shoulders. 
ANN 
(glances into a mirror) 
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . . 
D. B. 
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She sits down, picks up her servietteand something she sees suddenly makes her look with surprise at D. B. 
Camera pans down to a jewel box which had been under the serviette. 
Camera pans back to ANN. She glances up at D. B. somewhat bewildered. 
ANN 
Oh! 
D. B. 
Go ahead, open it, open it. 
ANN opens the box and holds up a lovely diamond bracelet. Her eyes dance. 
ANN 
Oh! Oh, it's lovely! 
TED 
And a new contract goes with it. 
Wider shot: D. B. and TED exchange satisfied glances. ANN admires the bracelet on her wristand then turns to D. B., looks directly at him. 
ANN 
(shrewdly) 
Well, come on, spring it! You've got something on your mind. 
D. B. laughs. 
ANN 
Must be stupendous. 
Wider shot: As D. B. roars with laughter. 
D. B. 
You know, that's what I like about her. Right to the point, like that! All right, practical Annie, here it is. 
He leans forward. ANN waits. TED watches her face. 
Two shot: ANN and D. B. 
D. B. 
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party. 
ANN 
(eyes widening) 
A third party? 
D. B. 
Yes. The John Doe Party. 
Wider shot: TED watches ANN, expectantly. 
D. B. 
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have. 
ANN 
(in an awed whisper) 
Mr. D. B. Norton! 
D. B. verifies her guess by leaning back, a pleased grin on his face, his huge chest expanded. 
D. B. 
Yes. 
Ann looks from one to the other, a little awed by the size of the project. 
ANN 
(on her breath) 
Wow! 
Dissolve to: Int. broadcasting boothball parknight. Med. shot: The place is a bee-hive of activity. Announcers walk about with "mikes" in their handsall speaking at onceas they describe the scene below. 
Close shot: Of N.B.C. ANNOUNCER 
N.B.C. ANNOUNCER 
And although the opening of the convention is hours off, the delegates are already pouring into the ball park by the droves, with lunch baskets, banners and petitions, asking John Doe not to jump off any roof . . . 
Camera pans over to KNOX MANNING. 
KNOX MANNING 
It is still a phenomenal movement. The John Does, or the hoi polloi as you've heard people call them, have been laughed at and ridiculed but here they are, gay and happy, having traveled thousands of miles, their expenses paid by their neighbors, to come here to pay homage to their hero, John Doe. 
Camera pans over to JOHN B. HUGHES. 
JOHN B. HUGHES 
And in these days of wars and bombings, it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the country, an idea based on friendliness, on giving and not taking, on helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return. And if a thing like this can happen, don't let any of our grumbling friends tell you that humanity is falling apart. This is John B. Hughes, signing off now and returning you to our main studio until nine o'clock when the convention will officially open. 
Dissolve to: Int. ANN's living room. Med. shot: At Door. ANN's MOTHER opens it and JOHN stands on the threshold. He has a small box of flowers in his hand. Water drips from his hat. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
Oh, John. Come in. 
JOHN 
Say, I'm kindait's raining out a little

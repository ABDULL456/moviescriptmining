55 INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - OUTSIDE THE THEATER OFFICE. DAY. 55 
PAUL, a droll handsome senior, is holding court, feet up on a desk, an unlit cigarette in his hand. 
PAUL Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I would be doing exactly what I'm doing right now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd just be acting, except I wouldn't do anything differently from how I'm doing it right now. Nearby, BECKY and LISA are looking at a poster for "Guys and Dolls." It says "ONLY 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS EARTH-SHATTERING 
MUSICAL EXTRAVAGANZA HITS THE EMERSONIAN STAGE! 
BECKY I still don't get why you didn't even audition. You're such a good singer. 
55 CONTINUED: 55 
LISA I still might do lights or something. But I'm not gonna make a fuckin' ass out of myself parading around in a play so I can ask everyone how great I was for three years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother. 
56 EXT. ALLEY. DAY. 56 
Everyone is smoking. Lisa is holding forth to some girls.

GIRLS What? Really? Are you kidding? 
LISA Check out my boots.

58 INT. BECKY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 58 
Becky and Lisa are smoking pot. They are dolled up. 
58 CONTINUED: 58 
BECKY Are you aware that things have gotten to the point where I now have to hear things about you from other people and I can't even correct them because I no longer have any first-hand information about you myself? 
LISA What are you talking about? 
BECKY Nothing. I just feel like we used to be really close -- like, up until a few days ago. And I'm not really getting that from you anymore. 
LISA Becky. Give me a break. Pause. 
BECKY I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response? 
LISA Can we just go please? 
BECKY 
(SARCASTIC) Fine. Would you like to smoke any more of my pot before we leave or have you had as much as you want now? 
LISA 
(SARCASTIC BACK) Oh, I'd like to have a little bit more please. 
BECKY Fine. Get fuckin' out of my house! 
LISA Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party. 
59 INT. PARTY HOUSE -- BATHROOM. NIGHT. 59 
The door opens and we catch a glimpse of a big party in a brownstone full of circulating kids. LISA and PAUL cram into 
the bathroom and shut the door again. A MOMENT LATER - She is sitting on the toilet. He is on the hamper unscrewing a small vial of coke-. 
59 CONTINUED: 59 
LISA It's very hard to be cool under these circumstances. 
PAUL You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose. 
LISA I'll try...! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it. 
PAUL And then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical. Very important. She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and closes the vial. _ 
PAUL (CONT'D) Symmetry. 
LISA You are so funny...! (Pause) So what do we do now? 
PAUL Now we make out. 
LISA Paul...! What about your girlfriend? 
PAUL I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend.

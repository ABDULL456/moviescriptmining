Christy still shows no signs of fear as Joey and Willy take out their guns. 
JOEY Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three we both shoot.  Got it? 
Page 106. 
WILLY Got it. 
Joey points his gun at Christy's left temple, and Willy points his gun at her right temple. 
JOEY One... two... 
Christy closes her eyes. 
JOEY Three! 
Neither man shoots.  They look at each other with anger. Christy opens her eyes. 
JOEY You didn't shoot! 
WILLY Neither did you! 
JOEY I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to. 
WILLY That's what I figured, too. 
EXT. LAS VEGAS HELIPORT 
The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out front. 
MARY ROBERT Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR But where? 
MARY PATRICK Look!  There she is! 
Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos.  The center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles.  The bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the Moonlight Casino and Lounge. 
MARY ROBERT The Little Sisters of the Moonlight! 
MARY PATRICK But how do we get there?

MOTHER SUPERIOR Stand back. (she strides into the road) Taxi! 
INT. CASINO 
Once again, Joey and Willy find Vince. 
VINCE Well? 
JOEY It didn't work, Vince. 
VINCE You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot. 
WILLY We both missed. 
VINCE Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right? 
JOEY Right. 
VINCE So, take it off. 
WILLY (shocked) Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry? 
JOEY For like, twelve zillion eternities? 
VINCE I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes. 
JOEY Maybe pants. 
WILLY A sweater. 
JOEY And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye. 
Joey and Willy are very confident about this solution. They strut off, pleased with themselves.

EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight than the nuns.  A squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons him. 
CLARKSON Lieutenant! 
Eddie jumps in the car.  Clarkson turns on the red bubble light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 
Joey and Willy return to the storage room, looking confident of their mission this time.  Christy glances up at them as they enter, and Willy begins to untie her. 
WILLY We got it all worked out. 
He works the ropes free, and Christy rubs her wrists to get circulation back again. 
JOEY Okay, Christy -- strip.

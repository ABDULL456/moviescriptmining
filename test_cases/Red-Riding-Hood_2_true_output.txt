ISABELLE I've been worried about you. When you didn't come back yesterday, I was afraid... 
(BEAT) You were wrong about Henri. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
THE FIGURE Was I now? 
ISABELLE Yes. He saved my life. Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She puts the bowl down and loosens her collar... 
ISABELLE I feel hot all of a sudden. 
THE FIGURE It's just the stew warming you. Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw. That's what it has been licking this whole time. Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks of white meat... 
ISABELLE What is this...? 
THE FIGURE If you don't like it, there's wine on the table to wash it down. Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes. It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup, spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away. She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs. 
THE FIGURE Oh, what pretty red lips. Come and give your Granny a kiss, my dear. 
ISABELLE I don't think I want to. 
THE FIGURE Then I will come to you. And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles into the firelight, revealing its face... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled. 
ISABELLE What is this? Where's Grandmother? 
CESAIRE I'm afraid I ate most of her. 
(BEAT) You ate the rest. Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified look. For a moment, she looks like she may pass out. 
CESAIRE I didn't want to kill her. But she finally realized what I was. 
EXT. CREEK - DAWN (FLASHBACK) 
Cesaire bathes in a cold stream... 
CESAIRE (V.O.) The hardest thing to hide has always been the smell. The werewolf musk is strong, especially close to the full moon. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
The night of the wolf hunt. Henri crouches in the woods, clutching his hammer... then freezes with terror. He sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along by his throat. It happened just as Henri said it did. 
CESAIRE (V.O.) Henri smelled it the night he saw me. And he recognized the smell later. 
EXT. STABLE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) 
Grandmother's confrontation with Henri. She stumbles outside and practically runs right into Cesaire... 
CESAIRE (V.O.) He thought it was your Grandmother. He didn't know he was smelling me. But she did. She'd lived with the smell her whole life, she just had no way of knowing what it was. 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets. 
CESAIRE (V.O.) Once she realized what it was, of course, she knew the truth. She tried to sneak a message to Father Auguste last night. 
EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Cesaire carries the blankets back to the cart. He quickly looks inside them and finds a note: 'MEUS FILIUS EST LUPUS.' Subtitle: 'My son is the wolf.' 
CESAIRE (V.O.) Luckily, she'd taught me how to read. 
BACK TO SCENE Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face.

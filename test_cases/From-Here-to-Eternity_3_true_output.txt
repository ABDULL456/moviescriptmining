LORENE I think it' a a weakness. 
MAGGIO (ANOTHER GULP) I grant you that. 
LORENE And I don't like weakness. (TO PREW) ) Do you? 
PREW No. I don't like weakness. (rises, takes a drink) But I like to drink. 
He comes back to the divan. 
LORENE With you it's not a weakness. With you it's more like a virtue. 
MAGGIO That sounds like a very profound remark. Maybe that's why I don't get it. 
LORENE (snuggles to Prew) Well, it's so. 
MAGGIO Hey! What you gonna do, marry this guy? Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife! 
PREW Get outa here! 
MAGGIO (picks up bottle) Okay. Back to old long-legged Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and acres. 
He goes out, closing door behind him. Suddenly the door opens again and Maggio pops back in. He puts the whisky bottle on a table next to the door. 
MAGGIO Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it more than me. You be back with The Treatment tomorrow. 
He pops out again, the door closing after him. Prew's gaiety dims with the reference to The Treatment. Lorene sees this. Prew rises, goes to whisky bottle. 
PREW That was nice before. The way you snuggled up. In front of him. 
LORENE What's he mean, The Treatment? 
Prew doesn't answer. He pours a drink, gulps it. 
LORENE What did he mean? 
PREW Some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because I won't fight. 
LORENE Fight? 
PREW On the boxing team. I don't want to fight! I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to think about it. And they make me think about it. Every day. 
He drops down on the divan beside her. 
PREW It's a personal thing... 
His dread of telling the tale crumbles before his overwhelming need to tell it, to have someone understand. 
PREW Over at Port Shafter... I used to fight... Middleweight. I was pretty good. I used to work out with Dixie Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he was fast... And good. He loved boxing. He was gonna come out of the Army and go right into the upper brackets... People on the Outside had their eye on him. (rises, paces) Dixie didn't want, to use the six ounce gloves this time. And we neither of us wore headgear, anyway. I was set flat on my feet when I caught Dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross. Dixie just happened to be standing solid, too. (MORE) PREW(CONT'D) (sits on chair) From the way he fell I knew. Dead weight, square on his face. He dint roll over. He was in a coma a week. Then he finally came out of it. The only thing was that he was blind... (rises, paces) I went up to the hospital to see him. Twice. Then I couldn't go back. We got to talking about fighting the second time. And Dixie cried... Seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldn't see... 
There are tears on Prew's face. He turns away from Lorene. 
ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING FROM BEHIND PREW Lorene, very moved, goes to him, stands behind him, puts her hand on his shoulder. Prew does not turn but his hand grasps hers. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT of the hands. 
EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT NEAR SHORE A wave sweeps by camera, Karen and Warden riding it into shore. CAMERA PANS with them as they walk out of the water, hand in hand. They stop at edge, as if by a mutual impulse. He swings her to him and kisses her. 
CLOSEUP as they kiss. The embrace is impassioned. When their lips separate, their arms remain around each other, holding tight to something they find is more than sex alone. 
EXTREME CLOSEUP as Karen and Warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen before and which he normally takes great pains to hide. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT as their lips separate again. 
KAREN Nobody ever kissed me that way... not really... 
They are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to the kisses. The jump to banter is a quick defense. 
WARDEN Nobody? 
CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they walk to the fire. Karen smiles at him. 
KAREN No. Nobody. 
WARDEN Not even one? Out of all the many men you've been kissed by? 
KAREN Well, that will take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been? 
CAMERA HOLDS as they sit, beside the fire. Karen wraps one of the blankets around her. 
WARDEN I wouldn't know. Can't you even make me a rough estimate? 
KAREN Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you? 
WARDEN No, I forgot to bring it. 
KAREN Then I guess you won't find out, will you? 
WARDEN Maybe I already know. 
The defense has given way and there is no mirth in the questions and answers now. 
KAREN What's the matter? What are you hinting at? 
WARDEN Why? Is there something to hint at?

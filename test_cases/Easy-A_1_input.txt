OLIVE (CONT'D) It was... Normal. Nothing freaky. It was sweet. HE was sweet. 
RHIANNON Was he big? Did it hurt? 
OLIVE No. It was great. Like I said. Okay, that's enough. 
The toilet flushes and MARIANNE BRYANT (16), an Aryanesque, cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks to the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands - while staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust. 
RHIANNON What the fuck are you looking at, Marianne? 
MARIANNE Nothing. Just a couple of admitted whores. 
Marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom. Olive's stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission. 
OLIVE So, how was your weekend? 
(I promise it's the last time...) 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
The Abernathys smile at the campfire, roasting WEINERS. Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there. 
MR. ABERNATHY Wienie, Rhi? 
Rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Into the webcam -- 
OLIVE Marianne Bryant, as we all know, is the President of the Christian Student Coalition and is that rare breed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball bat implanted up her anus. God's honest. I'm sure it's in some medical dictionary somewhere. 
INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR 
Marianne and her lackey, NINA HOWELL (16), who's just as awful as she is, pass out flyers. 
OLIVE (V.O.) Last year's cause celebre was the changing of the school mascot, which she spearheaded. 
Marianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing students faces. 
INT. GYM - LAST YEAR 
The school's MASCOT (17), a SHIRTLESS MUSCULAR KID painted BLUE and costumed as a DEVIL, bursts into the auditorium and begins to rile students up by thrusting his PITCHFORK in the air. 
MASCOT Blue Devils! Blue Devils! Blue Devils! 
The crowd goes wild. 
INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR - CONTINUOUS 
Marianne, melodramatically, grabs a PASSING STUDENT by the arm. 
MARIANNE How can we exhibit school pride when we're conveyed to others as satan worshippers? 
The scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away. 
OLIVE (V.O.) Now, thankfully, we're the much less intimidating -- 
INT. GYM - LAST YEAR - MONTHS LATER 
The mascot, unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous, walks into the gym dressed as a -- 
OLIVE (V.O.) Meerkat. 
MASCOT Go meerkats! Go meerkats! 
He can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited - with the exception of Marianne and Nina, in the stands applauding proudly. 
The school band is playing `GOLDFINGER.' 
Across the gym, Olive sits with Rhiannon. 
RHIANNON What the fuck is a meerkat anyway?

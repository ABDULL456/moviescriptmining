INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
Hector's having trouble righting his chopper. 
HECTOR Motherfucker. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping off the cable. 
JACK Shit!! 
And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it.  It crashes into the lake. 
KELLY Hector!! 
JACK (to Keough) Take him. 
KEOUGH I can't.  I'll get Hector!! 
JACK Where is he?! 
KELLY We gotta get to Hector!! 
JACK (to the driver) Back us in a little, we need to get a shot! 
Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.  He looks around. 
HECTOR Where is he? 
JACK (to the Deputies) Tranq guns down, rifles up! 
The men switch guns, under-- 
JACK (CONT'D) (yelling to Hector) Do not go in that water! (to the driver) Back us in!! 
As the pick-up backs closer to the shore-- 
JACK (CONT'D) (to Keough) If you get a safe shot... 
KEOUGH I'll take it! 
JACK Hector.  Do not move. 
The water is calm again.  A beat. 
JACK (CONT'D) (to Gare) You see anything? 
GARE (looking through binocs) Nothing.  Maybe he swam out. 
Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging the truck.  Screams. 
JACK Go!!  Drive!! 
The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off balance.  The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains his balance. 
JACK (CONT'D) Take him!! 
And Keough blasts.  It detonates the ground near the croc causing him to surge airborne into the water.  And he goes under.  Silence.  A beat. 
KELLY Did you get him? 
KEOUGH I don't know. (to the Driver) Back the truck-- 
ALL No!!!

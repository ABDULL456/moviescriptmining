TIME TRAVELLER (picks up dry branches) As a matter of fact, I'm from right here. (gesturing) There's where my house stood many thousands of years ago.  Here - to that monument, was my laboratory. About there was my library where I once sat talking with friends about my Time Machine. 
Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the bushes in the f.g.

She watches every move he makes. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (continuing) I hoped to learn a great deal.  I hoped to take back the knowledge, the advancement, mankind made... instead what do I find?  Vegetables! 
Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly from behind her.

With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks. 
TIME TRAVELLER (continuing) The human race reduced to living vegetables! 
BACK TO WEENA                                          220 
The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream. 
BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221 
He is about to light a match, but finds he needs more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena. 
TIME TRAVELLER Get me a few more twigs. 
When there is no answer he turns and looks. 
AT THE BUSHES                                          222 
Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena slowly disappearing under the brush. 
TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223 
We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws her to the pile of dry branches. 
TIME TRAVELLER (after calming her) What was it? 
WEENA (low) Morlocks. 
TIME TRAVELLER (strikes match and holds it to twigs) This seems to keep them away.

She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the flame. 
TWO SHOT                                               225 
The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more amazement than pain. 
TIME TRAVELLER (while examining her hand) What ever made you put your hand in the fire? 
WEENA I never saw it before. 
Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits down beside her. 
TIME TRAVELLER (after a long silence) Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire? (he looks at her) No, I suppose you don't. (pokes at fire) The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel. (turns to her) Do you know what that is? (she shakes her head) I'm sorry I was angry with your people.  I had no right to be. No more than if I had visited the Island of Bali in my own time. You were safe inside your great house, yet you came out into the night to warn me.  The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice.  You have that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all of your people have it.  All it requires is someone to reawaken it. I shall try if you'll let me.  Will you? 
WEENA I do not understand you, but I believe you. 
TIME TRAVELLER That's a good start. - Now try to tell me...who or what are the Morlocks? (Weena looks at him blankly) Are they people or animals? (her expression remains unchanged) What do you know about yourself?  The past?  Don't your people ever speak of the past? 
WEENA There is no past. 
TIME TRAVELLER Don't you ever wonder about the future? 
WEENA There is no future.

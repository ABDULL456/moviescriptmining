Let us never be parted. 
FESTER 
Let us always be as one. 
Fester flips Gomez in a JUDO FLIP. Gomez LANDS - At the foot of a glass display case. The camera pans up the case. It contains ABIGAIL AND TULLY, EXPERTLY 
MOUNTED AND STUFFED. 
Fester rises, dusting himself off. 
FESTER 
(joyfully, to Gomez and Morticia) Come on! 
MORTICIA 
We'll catch up. Fester runs out.

Everyone is gone. Morticia and Gomez have drifted into the front hall; they are moving toward the front door. 
MORTICIA 
(deeply satisfied) Our family... what are they? 
GOMEZ 
Oh, Tish - what a night. Everyone -- together at last. What more could we ask? 
MORTICIA 
Gomez? Morticia holds up the garment she's been knitting - it's a BABY JUMPER WITH THREE LEGS. 
GOMEZ 
(ecstatic) Cara mia... is it true? 
MORTICIA

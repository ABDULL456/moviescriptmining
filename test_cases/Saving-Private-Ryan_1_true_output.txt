Upham runs. 
A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER. 
He doesn't budge. 
UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast. 
REIBEN watches Upham run. 
REIBEN Hey, that guy can move. 
A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to the far side. 
MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed. He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent. 
SARGE (under his breath so only Miller can hear) Damn fool. (beat) Sir. 
REIBEN Captain, he's fast! 
MILLER (glances at Sarge, speaks to Reiben) Glad of it. 
UPHAM On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him. 
MILLER DASHES across the street. 
GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches behind him. 
HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge. 
MILLER Bring 'em over. 
UPHAM, tries to thank Miller. 
UPHAM Captain, I... 
Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade. 
MILLER One at a time. 
MILLER Ducks out of the doorway and crouch- runs down the block.  He passes a: 
BOMBED OUT BUILDING Out of the line of fire.  A dozen dead American soldiers lined up on the ground.  The battered, bloody bodies, only partially covered by ponchos. 
Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead. Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk. 
MILLER Sees the dead and wounded, shows no reaction.  Runs to: 
AN ALLEY Captain Hamill and his men are bunched there, out of the line of fire. He's sending off a squad to continue their door-to-door. 
Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go. 
The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak familiarly. 
Captain hamill How was the road in? 
MILLER We had a jeep until a few hours ago, a nice one, it had a cute little flag with a couple of stars on it. 
Captain hamill Oh, what a shame. 
One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley. 
MILLER We called in a strike on the eighty- eights that took it out, but it's the Kraut spotter that counts, wherever the hell that bastard is. 
Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple. 
Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant steeple. 
MILLER Jackson. 
Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to his back. 
He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very unusual, long-barrel, rifle. 
Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men, along with Upham, watch curiously. 
Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist, sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham is fascinated. 
UPHAM What is that? 
Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized shell.

The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to an iPod. 
LEROY (CONT'D) (SARCASTIC) Good of you to join us. 
The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her earphones to talk. 
NEW GIRL Sorry. 
LEROY Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. 
LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Go on, get warmed up. 
LILY I'm good. 
Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES. 
NINA Should I go again? 
LEROY (distracted by Lily) I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina. 
She looks down, getting his meaning. 
LEROY (CONT'D) Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation... 
Furious, Nina marches out of the room. 
A13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13 
Nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and exits the stall. 
13 OMITTED 13 11A. 
14 OMITTED 14 
15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15 
Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her jacket, for warmth and comfort. 
Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away. 
Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the scaffolding. 
Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on. 
The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and flickering. 
She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side. 
She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop. 
She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN standing there, almost ghostlike. 
Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the other woman continues as well. 
As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and discovers... 
The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER. 
But the moment passes as the woman continues walking. 
Nina stares after her, perturbed. 
Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence. Nina continues out, ignoring the phone. 
16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16 
Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her. 
She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there. 
ERICA How did it go? 
Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat. 
ERICA (CONT'D) You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition?! Can't believe he just sprung that on you. 
Nina nods. 
ERICA (CONT'D) So? 
NINA It went okay. 
ERICA Just okay? 
Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Darling?

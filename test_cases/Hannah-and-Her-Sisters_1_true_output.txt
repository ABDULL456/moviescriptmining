LEE (laughing) Really?  Well... 
Elliot opens the rear door for Lee.  She laughs as she gets in. 
ELLIOT (leaning down to talk to Lee in the cab) Page a hundred and twelve. 
LEE Bye. 
ELLIOT (closing the taxi door for Lee) Bye. 
He watches the taxi pull away.

INT. FREDERICK'S LOFT BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Lee, in slacks and shirt, is curled up on the bed, her back to the camera, as she reads the e.e. cummings poem in the glow of a night-table lamp.  The piano music is still heard. 
LEE (V.O.) (reading) "your slightest look easily will unclose me though I have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself... 
As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway.  Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark. 
LEE (V.O.) (continuing reading) "...as Spring opens [touching skillfully, mysteriously] her first rose [i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens; only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses]... 
Elliot turns on a light.  The camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry Lee next reads. 
LEE (V.O.) (continuing reading) "nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands." 
The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts. 
CUT TO: 
The anxiety of the man in the booth. 
Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to: 
The fa√ßade of Mount Sinai Hospital.  It is day.  A few cars whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam. 
First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room.  A light goes on, revealing a slouched- over Mickey sitting in a glass booth.  He is wearing a set of headphones.  The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth.  Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. The jazz continues. 
Next is an electronystagmography (ENG).  Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. 
The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography.  Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine.  It makes a whooshing noise as it turns.  The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it.

INT. DR. GREY'S OFFICE - DAY 
A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk. 
DR. GREY I wasn't too happy with the results of your ENG or your BSER either. 
The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey sitting on the other side of his desk. 
DR. GREY Uh, which is why I sent you to Tomography, which was all that stuff you saw rolling around. (pointing to a spot on one of the X-rays) You see this little gray area here? 
Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified. 
DR. GREY That gray area's what I had hoped that we wouldn't run into.  I'd like you to come in Monday morning for, uh, a CAT scan. 
MICKEY (reacting) A brain scan? 
DR. GREY (gesturing) Mr. Sachs, let's take one step at a time.  We won't make any decisions until we have all the information in front of us, all right? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY 
Mickey is seen leaving the hospital.  He strides slowly, his shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets. His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side. Occasional traffic goes by. 
MICKEY (V.O.) Okay...take it easy.  He didn't say you had anything.  He just doesn't like the spot on your X-ray, that's all.  It doesn't mean you have anything.  Don't jump to conclusions. (sighing) Nothing's gonna happen to you. You're in the middle of New York City.  This is your town.  You're surrounded by people and traffic and restaurants. 
Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look.  Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice. 
MICKEY (V.O.) I mean, God, how can you, how can you just one day...vanish?  Keep calm.  You're gonna be okay.  Don't panic. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM LOFT - NIGHT 
The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp. 
MICKEY (V.O.) I'm dying!  I'm dying!  I know it! There's a spot on my lungs! (sitting up, putting on his glasses) All right now, take it easy, will you?  It's not on your lungs.  It's on your ear.  No, it's the same thing, isn't it? (pulling the sheets off and sitting on the edge of his bed) Oh, jeez, I can't sleep!  Oh, God, there's a tumor in my head the size of a basketball! (putting on his slippers) N-now I keep thinking I can feel it every time I blink!  Oh, Jesus! He-he-he wants me to do a brain scan to confirm what he already suspects. 
Mickey, still ruminating, stands up.  Fixing his pants, he walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway. 
MICKEY (V.O.) (running his hand along a banister) Look...I'll make a deal with God. Let it just be my ear, okay?  I'll go deaf.  I'll go deaf and blind in one eye maybe.  But I don't want a brain operation!  Once they go into my skull, I'll-I'll wind up like the guy with the, with the wool cap who delivers for the florist! 
He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room. 
MICKEY (V.O.) Oh, relax, will ya?  Your whole life you run to doctors.  The news is always fine. (pausing at the bottom of the stairs) That's not true.  What about years ago? 
The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past.  Dr. Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera.  Rows of periodicals line the wall behind him. 
DR. SMITH (gesturing with one hand) I'm sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that you cannot have children. 
The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk.  They look stunned. 
MICKEY (reacting, putting his hands across his chest) Gee. 
HANNAH (reacting) Is there no chance? 
DR. SMITH (getting up from his desk) Well, naturally, this doesn't mean that you can't have a normal sex life. (walking over to the opened office door and closing it) But Mr. Sachs's tests indicate that he is infertile.  Small sperm volume and infertile. 
The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr. Smith with their eyes. 
MICKEY (gesturing, looking up at an offscreen Dr. Smith) Isn't there anything I can do? Push-ups or hormones?

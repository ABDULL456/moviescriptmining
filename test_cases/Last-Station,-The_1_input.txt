Valentin goes to Tolstoy. He's in a kind of panic. Chertkov comes into the room. 
TOLSTOY She's come, hasn't she? She`s here. 
He points to the corner.   But it is nothing, a gray shape thrown by a coat rack. 
CHERTKOV You're imagining things. 
DUSHAN It's true, Leo Nikolayevich. 
TOLSTOY Sasha...where's your mother? 
Tolstoy's eyes fill with tears. Valentin looks to Sasha. She looks from him to Chertkov. 
CHERTKOV She's at home. 
TOLSTOY If she wanted to see me I couldn't refuse her. (beat) Is she going to come here? 
All eyes are on Sasha. 
SASHA I don't think so...I don't know, Papa. There's no way to... 
TOLSTOY To what? 
Will she waiver?    A long, agonizing beat. 
SASHA She's at home. I'm sure of it. 
Valentin looks at the floor. 
TOLSTOY At home. 
SASHA Yes, Papa. 
Tolstoy nods, pats Sasha's hand. 
TOLSTOY Very beautiful isn't it? 
SASHA Our home? 
TOLSTOY Yes. 
He leans back against the pillow and drifts again. Sasha gets up and goes outside. After a moment, Valentin follows. 
135   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. DAY                   135 
Valentin sees her leaning against the wall.   She's in pain. 
SASHA He said to me once..."you're like your mother. You're so full of anger." 
She turns to him. 
SASHA I know it's terrible...but who will protect him? I don't want him to die. 
Valentin touches her face, goes back inside and into 
136   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 136 
Where Chertkov has made a makeshift office. He pores through the cables, letters and telegrams that litter the station master's dining table. He holds one up for Valentin. 
CHERTKOV Kind thoughts from George Bernard Shaw. 
Valentin walks to the table. 
VALENTIN You lied to him. 
CHERTKOV Keep your voice down. 
VALENTIN He wants to see her.    You heard him say it. 
CHERTKOV What exactly do you think she will bring him? 
VALENTIN I don´t know, they´ve been married for 48 years. 
CHERTKOV I´ll tell you what she´ll bring...Vanity, fuss and noise. 
VALENTIN She promised me-

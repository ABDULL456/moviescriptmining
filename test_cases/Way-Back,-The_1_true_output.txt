SMITH Be easier if I had religion, or a home to go back to, like you. 
JANUSZ For us, the old life is gone. They sit in silence for a while. 
SMITH Irena told me they tortured your wife and she informed on you. 
JANUSZ Yes. 
SMITH They did that to my boy. 
JANUSZ 
(NODS) My wife was released, that much I know. She lived, but like you she won't be able to forgive herself. Only I can do that. He leans closer to SMITH, speaks just above a whisper, his voice intense, his eyes burning. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) She'll torture herself for what she did. Just like you. That's why I have to get back! 
(CONTTNTTFT) 1 
199 CONTINUED: ( 3) 199 This last, has impressed SMITH, and despite his death- wish a flicker of life surges through his bones. 
200 EXT. CAMPSITE, MUD-FLAT - DAWN 200 
Next morning, and the figures of the four men are seen in wide-shot sleeping by the embers of their fire. One figure gets up, picks up his staff, and begins to walk slowly South, toward the distant mountains. It's SMITH. The others stir, their attention caught by the sight of SMITH staggering onward. JANUSZ knows what the effort to walk is costing him, and he knows this is SMITH's gift to him. They hurriedly pack up, VOSS cramming the back-pack with roasted snake-meat, ZORAN collecting a last bowl of water, which he pours carefully into their goatskin water- bag. 
201 EXT. DESERT - DAY 201 
JANUSZ catches up with SMITH, giving him his arm in support, and together they slowly continue their journey Southward. 
202 EXT. CHANGING TERRAIN - DAY 202 
They leave the desert behind as they climb gently rising ground. 
203 RIVER, MONGOLIA - DAY 203 The survivors each seen alone as they experience the life- giving water: one simply lets water run though his fingers; another submerges himself entirely; one drinks, savoring every mouthful as if it were the finest vintage wine. SMITH fishes. Beside him several of his catch gleam silver in the light. 
204 - OMIT 
205 EXT. HILLSIDE - DUSK/NIGHT 205 
Walking abreast they head toward a pass between two massive mountains - in the distance gleaming snow-capped peaks rise even higher. 
206 EXT. CAMPSITE, MOUNTAINS - DAWN 206 
They sleep, huddled together amongst the stony rubble. It is snowing. VOSS is the first to rise. He looks about him in disbelief, shakes the others awake, pointing. Just beyond where they've slept a high wall towers above them. In this extreme Western section it's in poor shape - not built of stone, but of ancient mud bricks, tumbled down in many places, but to the East the outline is distinct as it straggles over ridges to the horizon - the Great Wall of China. 
207 EXT. THE GREAT WALL, CHINA - DAY 207 
They enter through a keyhole-like opening formed by collapsed masonry, now dressed in their cold weather clothing. 
208 EXT. SKY - DAY 208 
From high above a series of aerial shots take us over a massive snow covered mountain range. 
209 EXT. SNOWY LANDSCAPE, TIBET - DAY 209 
The men climb steadily up snow-covered hills, pausing at a cairn of stones covered with tiny flags. 
SMITH Tibetan? They move on with renewed energy. 
210 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, TIBET - DAY 210 
CLOSE on the deeply lined face of a SHEPHERD. He wears Tibetan costume and squints his eyes as he stares into the distance. From his P.O.V., four distant figures walking across the snowy plain toward him. The sound of dogs barking. 
211 EXT. A RIDGE NEAR THE SHEPHERD'S HUT - DUSK 211 
Far below in a valley lies the legendary Lhasa - the stepped palace and surrounding town burnished by the last of the golden light. A sprinkling of lights come on as the shadows lengthen. 
(CONTINUED) 
211 CONTINUED: 211 Above and beyond, like a massive wall, rise the snow- capped peaks of the Himalayas. This has been theview stretching out before the four fugitives andtheirtour- guide, the old shepherd. As if pointing outthechoice confronting them, he labels each of these spectacular features.

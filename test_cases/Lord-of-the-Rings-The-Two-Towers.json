Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud\u00fbn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrog\u0092s sword.] YOU\u0085 SHALL NOT... PASS!!! \n[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalf\u0092s ankle, dragging him over the edge. He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip.] \nGANDALF Argh! \n[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains him.] \nBOROMIR No! No! \nFRODO Gandalf! \nGANDALF Fly, you fools! \n[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm] \nFRODO Noooooooooooooooo!!!! \n[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm] \nFRODO [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!! \n[Gandalf falls after the Balrog and grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on his way down. As they continue to plunge into the depths, Gandalf hacks away at the Balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. They continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with Gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. The battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. Just then Frodo awakens as if from a nightmare.] \nFRODO Gandalf! \nSAM What is it, Mr. Frodo? \nFRODO Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.] \n[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the distance at the Mountain of Fire.] \nSAM Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don\u0092t want to see any closer, and the one place we\u0092re trying to get to. It\u0092s just where we can\u0092t get. Let\u0092s face it, Mr. Frodo, we\u0092re lost. I don\u0092t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way. \nFRODO There\u0092s no promise you can make that I can trust. \nGOLLUM We swears to serve the master of the preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. *Gollum. Gollum.* \nFRODO The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word. \nGOLLUM Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss. \nSAM I don\u0092t believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down! \n[Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum tries to get away from him. He crashes onto the ground, choking.] \nFRODO Sam! \nSAM He\u0092s trying to trick us! We let him go he\u0092ll throttle us in our sleep! \n[Gollum lies panting and holding his throat. He backs away, frightened, as Frodo approaches him.] \nFRODO You know the way to Mordor? \nGOLLUM [nods warily] Yes... \nFRODO You\u0092ve been there before? \nGOLLUM [nods again] Yes... \n[Frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off Gollum\u0092s neck. Gollum seems surprised and relieved.] \nFRODO You will lead us to the Black Gate. \n[Gollum scrambles off in the direction of Morannon and the hobbits follow in his wake.] \n[A band of Uruk-hai marches across the plain, with two hobbits bound to the backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries to call to Merry, who is unconscious with a gash on his right brow.] \nPIPPIN Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.] \n[Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand and signals a stop.] \nUGL\u00daK What is it? What do you smell? \nMAN-FLESH URUK [sniffs the air] Man-flesh. \nPIPPIN [quietly to himself] Aragorn! \nUGL\u00daK They've picked up our trail! Let's move! \n[The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippin struggles to reach his Elven brooch with his teeth. He then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground. A foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass.] \n[Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground, listening for the sound of footsteps.] \nARAGORN Their pace has quickened. [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent. Hurry! [He runs off.] \nLEGOLAS Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli and then runs after Aragorn] \nGIMLI [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three days\u0092 and nights\u0092 pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell. [Runs after his companions.] \n[The Three Hunters run across rocks and plains, with Aragorn in the lead, followed by Legolas and Gimli. From time to time, Legolas looks back to make sure that Gimli is keeping up. Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick up an Elven brooch from the ground.] \n\u00c9OTHAIN Yes, Ma! \nFREDA [starts to cry] I don\u0092t wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama! \nMORWEN Freda, I will find you there. \n[A woman screams] \nMORWEN Quickly! \n[The children ride off.] \nMORWEN [Looks after them] Go child! \n[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the Rohirrim scream and run in all directions. \u00c9othain and Freda weep as they look back from a distance.] \nSARUMAN (V.O.) Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall. \n[A group of horsemen ride to Edoras. \u00c9omer is in the lead, carrying a gravely wounded Th\u00e9odred.] \n[\u00c9owyn runs hastily up the stairs to the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber. She runs to the bed.] \n\u00c9OWYN Th\u00e9odred! \n[Th\u00e9odred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. He has a bloody gash on the side of his head. \u00c9omer nods to \u00c9owyn in the direction of Th\u00e9odred\u0092s torso. \u00c9owyn draws back the covers and upon seeing Th\u00e9odred\u0092s fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. She looks up to catch \u00c9omer\u0092s eye.] \n[\u00c9omer and \u00c9owyn are speaking to Th\u00e9oden-king who sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his years.] \n\u00c9OWYN Your son is badly wounded, my lord. \n\u00c9OMER He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don\u0092t defend our country, Saruman will take it by force. \nGR\u00cdMA That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally. \nTH\u00c9ODEN [mumbles feebly] Gr\u00edma\u0085 Gr\u00edma\u0085 [Gr\u00edma leans down close to the King.]My son...? Gr\u00edma...? \n\u00c9OMER Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.] \nGR\u00cdMA Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering. \n\u00c9OMER War-mongering? \n[\u00c9omer grabs Gr\u00edma and pins him against a pillar.] \n\u00c9OMER How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Gr\u00edma? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure? \n[Gr\u00edma\u0092s eyes flicks to right, watching \u00c9owyn as she walks by. \u00c9owyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall. \u00c9omer jerks Gr\u00edma again and clutches his hand around Gr\u00edma\u0092s jaw.] \n\u00c9OMER Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps. \n[Gr\u00edma's eyes look to the left and relax as \u00c9omer is suddenly pulled off Gr\u00edma by his thugs.] \nGR\u00cdMA You see much \u00c9omer, Son of \u00c9omund. Too much. [The thugs punch \u00c9omer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death! \n\u00c9OMER [Being dragged away] Argh!! \n[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli hot on their pursuits.] \nGRISHN\u00c1KH [Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin\u0092s face] Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one\u0092s gonna save you now! \n[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc's back. Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the Orcs.] \nMERRY Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their escape.] \n[The hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him.] \nPIPPIN ARGH!!! \n[The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.] \nLEGOLAS [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night. \n[Camera pans over the rock and plains, alternating between the band of Uruk-hai and the Three Hunters giving chase. The trackers hear the sound of horses. Aragorn and company hide behind some boulders. A large group of horse-men appears, galloping quickly with their banners flying. Aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas and Gimli.] \nARAGORN Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark? \n[At a signal from \u00c9omer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles. As they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them.] \n\u00c9OMER What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly! \nGIMLI Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine. \n[\u00c9omer hands his staff to another rider, and gets off his horse. Aragorn puts a hand on Gimli\u0092s shoulder.] \n\u00c9OMER I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground. \n[Legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at \u00c9omer.] \nLEGOLAS You would die before your stroke fell! \n[The riders all point their spears closer at the travellers. After a tense moment, Aragorn pushes down Legolas\u0092 arm.] \nARAGORN I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gl\u00f3in and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Th\u00e9oden, your king. \n\u00c9OMER Th\u00e9oden no longer recognizes friend from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin. \n[The spears are withdrawn.] \n\u00c9OMER Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets. \nARAGORN We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They\u0092ve taken two of our friends captive. \n\u00c9OMER The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night. \nGIMLI But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them? \nARAGORN They would be small \u0096 only children to your eyes. \n\u00c9OMER We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.] \nGIMLI Dead? \n\u00c9OMER [nods] I am sorry. \n[Legolas puts a hand on Gimli\u0092s shoulder in grief. \u00c9omer turns and whistles.] \nPIPPIN Merry! \n[Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree he\u0092s clinging to. The tree starts to move and groan.] \nTREEBEARD Hooooo... \nPIPPIN Argh!! \n[Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. The tree catches him before he hits the ground.] \nGRISHN\u00c1KH Let\u0092s put a maggot-hole in your belly. [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.] \nPIPPIN Run, Merry! \n[Merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree.] \nTREEBEARD [Looks at the creatures in his hands] Little Orcs! Bur\u00e1rum... \nPIPPIN It\u0092s talking, Merry. The tree is talking! \nTREEBEARD Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps slowly through the forest.] \nMERRY A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest. \nPIPPIN Don\u0092t talk to it, Merry. Don\u0092t encourage it. \nTREEBEARD Treebeard, some call me. \nPIPPIN And whose side are you on? \nTREEBEARD Side? I am on nobody\u0092s side because nobody\u0092s on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore. \nMERRY We\u0092re not Orcs. We\u0092re Hobbits! \nTREEBEARD Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them! \nMERRY No, you don\u0092t understand. We\u0092re Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk! \nTREEBEARD Maybe you are and maybe you aren\u0092t. The White Wizard will know. \nPIPPIN The White Wizard? \nMERRY Saruman. \n[Treebeard drops them on the ground and the hobbits look up at the White Wizard.] \n[Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor is now closer.] \nGOLLUM See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you. \n[Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.] \nGOLLUM Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.] \n[Sam\u0092s foot slipped into muck.] \nSAM Whoa, it\u0092s a bog! He\u0092s led us into a swamp! \nGOLLUM My name... My name... S... S...Sm\u00e9agol \n[Suddenly, the piercing cries of the Nazg\u00fbl are heard overhead] \nGOLLUM Argh!! \nSAM Black Riders! \nGOLLUM Hide! Hide! \nFRODO Argh! \n[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the Nazg\u00fbl's sword piercing him and the call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths come to him in flashes.] \nFRODO Argh!! \nSAM C\u0092mon Frodo! C'mon! \n[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. The Nazg\u00fbl appears, tightening his hold on the reins. Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. Chilling screams of the Nazg\u00fbl fill the air.] \nGOLLUM Quick! They will see us! They will see us! \nSAM I thought they were dead! \nGOLLUM Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No. \n[A loud screech from the Nazg\u00fbl flying high above the marshes.] \nGOLLUM [cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss. \n[Frodo feels the call of the Ring and gropes for his necklace. Sam sees this and grabs hold of Frodo\u0092s hand.] \nSAM Mr. Frodo! It\u0092s alright. I\u0092m here. \n[The Nazg\u00fbl continues to circle overhead and then flies off towards Mordor.] \nGOLLUM Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close. \n[Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimli fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings it to his mouth.] \nGIMLI [Spits] Ptui! Orc blood. \nARAGORN These are strange tracks. \nGIMLI The air is so close in here. \nLEGOLAS This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger. \n[Groans reverberate through the forest and Gimli raises his axe.] \nLEGOLAS The trees are speaking to each other. \nARAGORN [Whispers] Gimli! \nGIMLI Huh? \nARAGORN [Gestures] Lower your axe. \nLEGOLAS That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. \n[The horse comes round to stop in front of Gandalf.] \nGANDALF Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers. \n[The Three Hunters and Gandalf ride across the plains to Edoras.] \n[Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking through the forest with Merry and Pippin sitting on his shoulders.] \nTREEBEARD My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I\u0092ll keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them. \n[Frodo and Sam are climbing a high rock overlooking Morannon.] \nGOLLUM The Black Gate of Mordor. \n[The enormous Black Gate comes into view with Orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls. From the right, an army of Easterling soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.] \nSAM Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. \nGOLLUM Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Sm\u00e9agol does. Master says so. \nFRODO I did. \n[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.] \nSAM That\u0092s it then. We cannot get past that. \n[A command is heard and an Orc sounds a horn, signalling for the Gate to be opened. Two enormous cave trolls stretch and growl and then pull the mighty Gate open.] \nSAM Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down. \n[He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly, the rock underneath him gives way and he falls.] \nFRODO Sam, no! \nSAM Argh!! \n[Frodo goes after Sam.] \nGOLLUM Master! \n[Two Easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by Sam and Frodo. They move away from the troop to investigate. Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the Easterlings move closer and closer, Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself and Sam. The soldiers are now directly in front of Sam, but their eyes see nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer from underneath the cloak. The soldiers soon leave and after a moment, Frodo throws back the cloak and pulls Sam out.] \nFRODO I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. \nSAM I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there. \n[They prepare to make a run for the Gate.] \nFRODO Now! \n[Gollum pulls them back.] \nGOLLUM No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Don\u0092t take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always he\u0092s looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn\u0092t let him have it. \n[Frodo tries to make a run for it.] \nSM\u00c9AGOL No! Not Master. \nGOLLUM Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie. \nSM\u00c9AGOL Master\u0092s my friend. \nGOLLUM [Tauntingly] You don\u0092t have any friends. Nobody likes YOU... \nSM\u00c9AGOL [Covers his ears] Not listening. I\u0092m not listening. \nGOLLUM You\u0092re a liar and a thief. \nSM\u00c9AGOL [Shaking his head] Nope. \nGOLLUM Mur\u0085derer\u0085! \nSM\u00c9AGOL [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away. \nGOLLUM Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!! \nSM\u00c9AGOL [Weeping and in a small voice] I hate you. I hate you! \nGOLLUM [Fiercely] Where would you be without me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me! \nSM\u00c9AGOL [Resolute] Not anymore. \nGOLLUM [Startled] What did you say? \nSM\u00c9AGOL Master looks after us now. We don\u0092t need you. \nGOLLUM What? \nSM\u00c9AGOL Leave now and never come back. \nGOLLUM No!! \nSM\u00c9AGOL [Louder] Leave now and never come back! \nGOLLUM [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!! \nSM\u00c9AGOL LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK! \n[Sm\u00e9agol pants and then looks around.] \nSM\u00c9AGOL We... we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss. [He hops around in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, gone, gone! Sm\u00e9agol is free! \n[The next day, while the hobbits were resting, Sm\u00e9agol comes back with two rabbits and drops them onto Frodo\u0092s lap.] \nSM\u00c9AGOL Look! Look! See what Sm\u00e9agol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha! \n[Frodo looks at up him with bloodshot eyes. He smiles at Sm\u00e9agol and looks at Sam. Sm\u00e9agol raises a fist in self-congratulation and dances around. He then picks up one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's back in front of Frodo.] \nSM\u00c9AGOL They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them! \n[He bites and tears into the raw meat. Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit out of Gollum\u0092s hands] \nSAM You\u0092ll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] There\u0092s only one way to eat a brace of coneys. \nFARAMIR Bind their hands. \n[Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are heading towards Helm\u0092s Deep. Gimli is on a horse, chatting with \u00c9owyn who is leading it by the reins.] \nGIMLI It\u0092s true you don\u0092t see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that they\u0092re often mistaken for Dwarf men. \n[\u00c9owyn smiles and looks back at Aragorn.] \nARAGORN [Gestures and whispers] It\u0092s the beards.... \nGIMLI And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground! \n\u00c9OWYN [Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!! \nGIMLI Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous Whoa!! \n[The horse suddenly rears up and gallops away as \u00c9owyn loses her hold on the reins. Gimli falls off after a short distance and lands with a loud thump.] \n\u00c9OWYN Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli] \nGIMLI [Struggling to get up] It\u0092s alright, it\u0092s alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate. \n[\u00c9owyn helps Gimli up. She laughs as she brushes him off and looks back at Aragorn with the sun behind her and the wind in her hair. At that particular moment, Aragorn seems enchanted by \u00c9owyn\u0092s light-hearted image. That night. Aragorn could not sleep and smokes his pipe as he thinks of Arwen.] \nARWEN (V.O.) The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane\u0085 It is mine to give to whom I will... Like my heart\u0085 Go to sleep... \n[FLASHBACK Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell. He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before him, smiling down at him.] \nARAGORN I am asleep. This is a dream. \nARWEN [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is a good dream. Sleep \n[She kisses him lightly on the lips and then steps away to look out upon Rivendell. Aragorn closes his eyes but for a while. He looks over at Arwen.] \nARAGORN Min l\u00fb pennich nin i aur hen telitha. (You told me once that this day would come.) \nARWEN [Turns to look at Aragorn] \u00da i vethed... n\u00e2 i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han b\u00e2d l\u00een. (This is not the end... it is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path.) \nARAGORN [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i v\u00e2d o nin. (My path is hidden from me.) \nARWEN Si peliannen i v\u00e2d na dail l\u00een. Si boe \u00fa-dhannathach. (It is already laid before your feet. You cannot falter now.) \nARAGORN Arwen \n[Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers on his lips. As her hands moves down to rest on the Evenstar pendant around Aragorn\u0092s neck, he clasps her hand in his and they gaze into each other\u0092s eyes.] \nARWEN Ae \u00fa-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen. (If you trust nothing else... trust this. Trust us.) \n[They kiss.] \n[The next day, on the journey to Helm\u0092s Deep. \u00c9owyn is walking alongside Aragorn.] \n\u00c9OWYN Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel. \n[ARAGORN SMILES AND SAYS NOTHING. FLASHBACK Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell, before he sets out with the Fellowship.] \nELROND Our time here is ending. Arwen\u0092s time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen. \nTH\u00c9ODEN [To \u00c9owyn] You must lead the people to Helm\u0092s Deep. And make haste! \n\u00c9OWYN I can fight! \nTH\u00c9ODEN No! You must do this... for me. \n[\u00c9owyn holds Th\u00e9oden\u0092s gaze for a moment and then turn to attend to the villagers.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN [To his men] Follow me! Yah! \nGIMLI [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward! [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather unsteadily.] That\u0092s it! Go on! \n\u00c9OWYN [To the villagers] Make for the lower ground! Stick together! \n[She looks back at the Rohirrim and sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each other\u0092s gaze for a moment before Aragorn turns to join Th\u00e9oden. \u00c9owyn departs with the villagers in the opposite direction.] \n[Legolas takes aim at the distant target and fells a warg rider. He draws another arrow and kills another. Just as he reaches for a third arrow, he sees Th\u00e9oden and company approaching. He quickly runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap and joins in the fray with Gimli behind him on horseback.] \nWARG-RIDERS Argh!! \nTH\u00c9ODEN CHARGE!! \n[The Rohirrim and warg riders crash head on and the battle begins. Th\u00e9oden and company hack away at the warg riders. In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling at him.] \nGIMLI Bring your pretty face to my axe! \n[Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas kills it with one shot.] \nGIMLI [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged] Argh! That one counts as mine! \n[As Gimli swings his axe at another warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, pinning him under.] \nGIMLI Argh! Stinking creature. Argh! \n[As he tries to lift the warg off him, an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills him quickly, twisting his neck, and it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at the Orc and makes a face. He tries to lift both the warg and Orc off him. Just then, another warg comes upon him and bares its teeth, ready to strike. \nGIMLI [Eyes widening] Ooh..! \n[Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes on horseback and throws it at the warg. It dies, landing on Gimli and adding to the pile on top of him.] \nGIMLI [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!! \n[Th\u00e9oden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn is knocked off Hasufel and attacked by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while the latter is half-dragged by the warg. In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off and he rips the Evenstar pendant from Aragorn\u0092s neck as he falls. Aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed. The warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge. The battle is winding down as the Rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.] \nLEGOLAS [Looking around] Aragorn! \nGIMLI Aragorn? \n[They come near to the cliff and hear Sharku wheezing and laughing] \nGIMLI [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing. \nSHARKU He\u0092s [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took a little tumble off the cliff. \nLEGOLAS [Looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs Sharku] You lie! \n[Sharku chortles and dies. Legolas looks down at Sharku\u0092s fist and finds the Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down to see the great drop and rushing waters below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli comes to stand beside him.] \n[As he steps closer to the vessel, Saruman takes hold of Gr\u00edma\u0092s hand and pushes the candle away from the vessel firmly.] \nSARUMAN If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall. \n[He walks away towards the balcony.] \nGR\u00cdMA [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep. \nSARUMAN Tens of thousands. \nGR\u00cdMA But, my lord, there is no such force. \n[Both of them came onto the balcony of the tower. Gr\u00edma suddenly sees and hears the enormous armies laid out below in neat rows and is astounded and awed. He continues to hold the extinguished candle aloft as he gapes at the vast army below. A horn is sounded, announcing the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer is heard from the army. Saruman raises a hand.] \nSARUMAN A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand! \n[The army cheers and roars.] \nSARUMAN This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive! \n[The camera keeps zooming out from the balcony over the incredible size of Saruman\u0092s army, past Uruk-hai, spears, and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The camera focuses back on Saruman who then raises his hands in the air] \nSARUMAN To war!! \n[The army cheers and roars even louder.] \nSARUMAN [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men. \n[A tear flows down Gr\u00edma\u0092s cheek. The Uruk-hai army began their march to Helm\u0092s Deep.] \n[Merry and Pippin are travelling through the forest, carried by Treebeard.] \nPIPPIN Look! There\u0092s smoke to the south! \nTREEBEARD There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days. \nMERRY Isengard? \n[The two hobbits climb higher up onto Treebeard for a better view.] \nTREEBEARD There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things. \n[Pippin and Merry are now on top of Treebeard and they see a massive army moving across the land] \nPIPPIN What is it? \nMERRY It\u0092s Saruman\u0092s army! The war has started. \n[Aragorn is floating in the river, unconscious. He is washed ashore and dreams of Arwen.] \nARWEN [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace of the Valar protect you. \n[A horse arrives and nudges Aragorn, turning him over and nuzzling him.] \nARAGORN [Mumbles] Brego\u0085 [He grabs hold of Brego\u0092s mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.] \n[Arwen is lying on her bed, deep in thought.] \nMADRIL Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Th\u00e9oden\u0092s people have fled to Helm\u0092s Deep. [Points at the map] But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate. \nFARAMIR How many? \nMADRIL Some thousands. More come every day. \nFARAMIR Who\u0092s covering the river to the north? \nMADRIL We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won\u0092t hold it. \nFARAMIR [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. \n[The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds taken off them by Damrod and another ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod sitting behind them on a rock constantly watching them. Faramir comes up to them and sits.]. \nFARAMIR My men tell me that you are Orc spies. \nSAM Spies?! Now wait just a minute! \nFARAMIR Well if you\u0092re not spies, then who are you? \n[Frodo and Sam remain silent.] \nFARAMIR Speak. \nFRODO We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee. \nFARAMIR Your bodyguard? \nSAM His gardener. \nFARAMIR And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look. \nFRODO [The merest hesitation.] There was no other. \n[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.] \nFRODO We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in M\u00f3ria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor. \nFARAMIR [Intently] You\u0092re a friend of Boromir? \nFRODO Yes... for my part. \nFARAMIR It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. \nFRODO [Shocked] Dead? How? When? \nFARAMIR As one of his companions, I\u0092d hoped you would tell me. [Pause] He was my brother. \n[Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. Suddenly someone comes up to him.] \nGONDORIAN RANGER Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found the third one. \n[Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens as Faramir stands before him.] \nFARAMIR You must come with me. Now. \n[Frodo gets up and follow. They come to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking the Forbidden Pool.] \nGOLLUM [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] Myyy\u0085 PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!! \n[Back in their holding area, Sam and Frodo are alone.] \nSAM We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear. \nFRODO I can\u0092t. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but\u0085 I\u0092m sorry. The Ring\u0092s taking me Sam. If I put it on, he\u0092ll find me. He\u0092ll see. \nSAM Mr. Frodo... \n[They both stand as Faramir enters.] \nFARAMIR [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp. \n[Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's neck with the tip of his sword.] \nFARAMIR A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. \n[Frodo is backed up fearfully against the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs the Ring in his hand and jerks himself away.] \nFRODO No!! [He runs away from Faramir] \nSAM Stop it! Leave him alone! Don\u0092t you understand? He\u0092s got to destroy it. That\u0092s where we\u0092re going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire. \n[Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then Damrod enters.] \nDAMROD Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements. \nSAM Please. It\u0092s such a burden. Will you not help him? \nDAMROD Captain? \nFARAMIR Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. [He turns to leave.] \n[Sam looks after Faramir sadly.] \n[Aragorn is riding towards Helm\u0092s Deep. On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai army marching with great speed. He quickly makes haste towards Helm\u0092s Deep and soon sees the refuge.] \nARAGORN [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon n\u00een. (Well done, Brego, my friend) \n[He rides into Helm\u0092s Deep to the amazement of all.] \nREFUGEES He\u0092s alive! \nGIMLI [Pushing his way through the crowd.] Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. I\u0092m gonna kill him! [He sees Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless you, laddie! \nARAGORN Gimli, where is the king? \n[Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn makes his way in, he runs into Legolas who stands waiting.] \nLEGOLAS Le ab-dollen. (You\u0092re late.) [They smile. Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn\u0092s wounds.] You look terrible. \n[To the side, \u00c9owyn sees Aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas takes Aragorn\u0092s hand and gives the Evenstar pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar and claps Legolas on the shoulder.] \nARAGORN Hannon le. (Thank you.) \n[\u00c9owyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes.] \nTREEBEARD 'Tis a gathering. \nMERRY A gathering of what? \n[Merry and Pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard gathering.] \nTREEBEARD Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war. \n[Merry licks his lips in anticipation.] \n[Back at Helm\u0092s Deep, the women and children are being led into the caves.] \nSOLDIER 1 Move back! Move to the caves! \nSOLDIER 2 Keep moving! \nSOLDIER 3 Quickly now! \n[Old men and young lads are being drafted for war. The women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers. In the armoury, weapons are being distributed. Aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back.] \nARAGORN Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers. \nGIMLI Most have seen too many winters. \nLEGOLAS Or too few. Look at them. They\u0092re frightened. I can see it in their eyes. [The men around them fell silent. Legolas speaks to Aragorn.] Boe a h\u00fbn: neled herain dan caer menig! (And they should be... Three hundred against ten thousand!) \nARAGORN Si beriathar h\u00fdn. Amar n\u00e2 ned Edoras. (They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras.) \nLEGOLAS Aragorn, men i ndagor. H\u00fdn \u00fa-... ortheri. Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors. They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die!) \nARAGORN Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses and then walks away. Legolas makes as if to go after him.] \nGIMLI [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go, lad. Let him be. \n[In the hall] \nGAMLING Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord? \nTH\u00c9ODEN Who am I, Gamling? \nGAMLING You are our king, sire. \nTH\u00c9ODEN And do you trust your king? \nGAMLING [Puts armour onto Th\u00e9oden] Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end. \n[The villagers are handed their weapons. An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy. Another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes. Another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. Th\u00e9oden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN To whatever end\u0085 Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this? \n[Everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements. Aragorn is sitting on the steps. He sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously.] \nARAGORN Give me your sword. What is your name? \nHALETH Haleth, son of H\u00e1ma, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless.. \n[Aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings.] \nARAGORN A Eruch\u00een, \u00fa-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none!) \n[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter] \nGIMLI [Jumping and straining to see] What\u0092s happening out there? \nLEGOLAS Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box? \nGIMLI [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!! \n[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.The women and children in the caves huddle together in fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old man next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai in the neck.] \nARAGORN Dartho! (Hold!) \n[The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. With a hollow groan, the Uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. With a cry, the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts charging.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN So it begins. \nARAGORN Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!) \n[The Elves notch their arrow and aim.] \nLEGOLAS Faeg i-varv d\u00een na lanc a nu ranc. (Their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms.) \nARAGORN Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!) \n[Arrows rain down on the Uruk-hai below, killing many.] \nGIMLI Did they hit anything? \nTH\u00c9ODEN Give them a volley. \nGAMLING [to the men] Fire! \nMAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE Fire! \n[More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen.] \nARAGORN Fire! \nGIMLI [Impatiently] Send them to me! C\u0092mon! \n[The Uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears.] \nARAGORN Pendraid! (Ladders!) \n[The Elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. The first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk Berserkers on top of them.] \nARAGORN Swords! Swords! \nGIMLI Good! \n[Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai climb over the wall.] \nGIMLI Legolas, two already! [Holding up two fingers] \nLEGOLAS I\u0092m on seventeen! \n[At the Ent Moot] \nTREEBEARD The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done. \nMERRY How can that be your decision?! \nTREEBEARD This is not our war. \nMERRY But you're part of this world! Aren\u0092t you?! [The Ents look at one another, taken back] You must help, please! You must do something! \nTREEBEARD You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home. \n[Merry is putting on his jacket. Pippin approaches him slowly] \nPIPPIN Maybe Treebeard\u0092s right. We don\u0092t belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home. \nMERRY [Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. [Turns to Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder] There won't be a Shire, Pippin. \n[Pippin looks after Merry as he walks away.] \nGAMLING Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there! \nARAGORN Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad! (To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep! Haldir, to the Keep!) \n[Haldir nods and turns back. Gimli is being carried away, kicking and struggling as he goes] \nGIMLI [Protesting] What are you doing? Argh! What are you stopping for! \n[HALDIR HACKS AT A FEW URUK AS HE TURNS TOWARDS THE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.] \nWith a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead Uruk-hai.] \nARAGORN [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldir\u0092s side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.] \nGAMLING Brace the gate! \nSOLDIER Hold them! \nTH\u00c9ODEN [Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw your swords! \n[Th\u00e9oden and his commanders come to the gate, which is under heavy attack. The Uruk-hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood. Th\u00e9oden stabs at an Uruk-hai and receives a lance in his shoulder, blocked by his armour. Grimacing in pain, Th\u00e9oden continues to stab at the Uruk until led away by Gamling.] \nGAMLING Make way! We cannot hold much longer. \nTH\u00c9ODEN Hold them! \nARAGORN [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need? \nGAMLING Brace the gate! \nTH\u00c9ODEN As long as you can give me! \nARAGORN Gimli! \nTHEODEN Timbers! Brace the Gate! \n[Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming the gate.] \nGANDALF (V.O.) Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east. \nTH\u00c9ODEN Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time! \nGIMLI Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the horn of Helm Hammerhand] \nTH\u00c9ODEN Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn! \n[He mounts his horse and puts on his helmet. The sound of the horn rumbles through Helm's Deep as Gimli blows with gusto.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN FORTH EORLINGAS!! \n[Th\u00e9oden leads the charge out of the keep into the Hornburg, slashing away at the Uruk-hai as they go. Without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the Causeway, right into the column of waiting Uruk-hai. In the midst of battle, Aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun] \nARAGORN Gandalf. \nGANDALF Th\u00e9oden king stands alone. \n\u00c9OMER [Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He raises a hand] Rohirrim!! \n[Riders move up behind \u00c9omer.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN [Looking to the east] \u00c9omer! \n\u00c9OMER To the king! \n[The Rohirrim and the White Rider charge down the slope. Half the Uruk-hai army turns to face the challenge, bearing their spears down towards the riders. As the riders draw closer, the sun rises behind them, momentarily blinding the Uruk-hai who raise the hands (and spears) to shield their eyes. The riders crash right into the Uruk-hai and engage them in battle.] \n[The Ents are stomping over Isengard, swinging their huge limbs, throwing and stamping on Orcs and rolling huge boulders over the ground. An Ent is pulled down with chains by some Orcs, who immediately jump on and hacks away at his wooden limbs. Saruman rushes out onto the balcony of Orthanc and stares at the pandemonium in incredulity. Merry and Pippin also throws stones at Orcs, their aims true.] \nPIPPIN Yes! \nTREEBEARD A hit. A fine hit! \n[Two Ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. Some Orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent, setting him on fire. Saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. Some Ents are now breaking away at a dam.] \nTREEBEARD Break the dam! Release the river! \n[The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path. \nMERRY Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten their hold on top of Treebeard] \nTREEBEARD Hold on, little hobbits! \n[Treebeard braces himself against the flood. As the water rushes over Isengard, an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water. The water rushes into the caverns, washing away the bridges, mechanisms and structures within.] \n[Frodo walks slowly away from the safe corner. Gondorian Rangers are still running about, defending their stations.] \nSAM What are you doing? Where are you going?! \n[SLOW MOTION Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. A Nazg\u00fbl on a Fell beast emerges in front of him. Frodo stares at the Nazg\u00fbl, fixated. Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazg\u00fbl flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over. Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs. As they come to a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away.] \nFRODO Aaarrgghh!!! \nSAM [With tears running down his face] It\u0092s me. It\u0092s your Sam. Don\u0092t you know your Sam? \n[The madness fades and recognition returns to Frodo\u0092s eyes. He realises what he nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and Sting falls to the ground with a clang. Sam gets up slowly.] \n", "test1_input": "GR\u00cdMA So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill. \n[\u00c9owyn and Gr\u00edma stare at each other intently.] \n\u00c9OWYN Your words are poison! \n[\u00c9owyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. \u00c9owyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber people.] \nGIMLI You\u0092ll find more cheer in a graveyard. \n[Aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared. The company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards.] \nGANDALF [sees H\u00e1ma] Ah. \nH\u00c1MA I cannot allow you before Th\u00e9oden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Gr\u00edma Wormtongue. \n[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals for the others to surrender their weapons. Aragon hands over his sword and knives. Legolas gives a little twirl to his knives before handing them over to the guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.] \nH\u00c1MA [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff. \nGANDALF Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at H\u00e1ma innocently.] \n[H\u00e1ma hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas\u0092 arm.] \nGR\u00cdMA [Leaning down and whispering to Th\u00e9oden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He\u0092s a herald of woe. \nGANDALF The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Th\u00e9oden King. \n[As Gandalf approaches Th\u00e9oden, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants. A group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility.] \nGR\u00cdMA [Whispering to Th\u00e9oden.] He\u0092s not welcome. \nTH\u00c9ODEN Why should I\u0085 welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? [Looks to Gr\u00edma for affirmation.] \nGR\u00cdMA A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest. \nGANDALF Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gr\u00edma.] \nGR\u00cdMA His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizard\u0092s staff! \n[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight as Gandalf continues to approach Th\u00e9oden. Gamling tries to go forward but H\u00e1ma holds him back.] \nGANDALF Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows. \n[Gr\u00edma tries to crawl away unnoticed, but Gimli catches him and pins him to the floor.] \nGIMLI [Growls] I would stay still, if I were you. \nGANDALF Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand] \nTH\u00c9ODEN [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey! \n[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, exuding blinding white light. Th\u00e9oden is thrown back against his seat.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN Argh! \nGANDALF [Points his staff towards Th\u00e9oden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. \n", "test1_true": "ARAGORN Wait. \nTH\u00c9ODEN [In Saruman\u0092s voice.] If I go. . . Th\u00e9oden dies. \n[Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Th\u00e9oden flies back against the chair again.] \nGANDALF You did not kill me, you will not kill him! \nTH\u00c9ODEN [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine! \nGANDALF Be gone!! \n[Gandalf smites Th\u00e9oden as he lunges at him. Th\u00e9oden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palant\u00edr which he used to manipulate Th\u00e9oden. He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead. In the hall, Th\u00e9oden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair. \u00c9owyn runs to her uncle\u0092s side as he falls. Th\u00e9oden\u0092s head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN [Looks closely at \u00c9owyn] I know your face. \u00c9owyn\u0085 \u00c9owyn. \n[\u00c9owyn weeps with joy] \nTH\u00c9ODEN Gandalf? \nGANDALF Breathe the free air again, my friend. \n[The hall is shown to be filled with light again, as everyone marvels at the rejuvenation of the king.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN [Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.] \nGANDALF Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword. \n[H\u00e1ma runs up with his sword. Th\u00e9oden reaches for it with trembling hands. He wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny steel. In a corner, Gr\u00edma trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by Gimli. Suddenly, Th\u00e9oden\u0092s gaze turns to Gr\u00edma. Gr\u00edma is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs.] \nGR\u00cdMA Argh! [Beseechingly to Th\u00e9oden] I've only ever served you, my lord! \nTH\u00c9ODEN [Advancing towards Gr\u00edma, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! \nGR\u00cdMA [Grovelling] Send me not from your side. \n[Th\u00e9oden raises his sword to kill Gr\u00edma. Aragorn holds him back.] \nARAGORN No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account. \n[Gr\u00edma scrambles to his feet and pushes through the crowd] \nGR\u00cdMA Get out of my way! \nH\u00c1MA Hail, Th\u00e9oden king! \n[The crowd kneels in homage before Th\u00e9oden. Aragorn kneels also. Gr\u00edma rides out of Edoras. As Th\u00e9oden turns to go back into the hall, he looks up.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN Where is Th\u00e9odred? Where is my son? \n[A white flower comes into view, held up by a hand. It is released and spirals down to land among similar flowers, in front of a tomb.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN Simbelmyn\u00eb. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house. \nGANDALF Th\u00e9odred\u0092s death was not of your making. \n", "test2_input": "TH\u00c9ODEN No parent should have to bury their child. \n[Th\u00e9oden starts to weep] \nGANDALF He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h\u00e1l. Fer\u00f0u, Th\u00e9odred, Fer\u00f0u. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Th\u00e9odred, go-thou.) \n[Gandalf turns to go back to the hall and leaves Th\u00e9oden to grieve in private. He spots two children on horseback. The boy collapses and falls off the horse. Later, inside the Golden Hall, the two children are eating at a table, and \u00c9owyn is with them.] \n\u00c9OWYN They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree. \nFREDA Where\u0092s mama? \n\u00c9OWYN Shh... \nGANDALF This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Th\u00e9oden\u0092s chair. Th\u00e9oden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight. \nARAGORN You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. \u00c9omer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king. \nTH\u00c9ODEN They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. \u00c9omer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war. \n[Gimli takes a bite of his bread as he watches the exchange between Aragorn and Th\u00e9oden.] \nARAGORN Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not. \nTH\u00c9ODEN When last I looked, Th\u00e9oden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan. \n[Gimli takes a drink and burps.] \nGANDALF Then what is the king\u0092s decision? \n[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld] \nH\u00c1MA By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm\u0092s Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need. \n[People are moving about, gathering their belongings and preparing to move. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli walk towards the stables.] \nGIMLI Helm\u0092s Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king. \nARAGORN He\u0092s only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm\u0092s Deep has saved them in the past. \n[They enter the stables] \nGANDALF There is no way out of that ravine. Th\u00e9oden is walking into a trap. He thinks he\u0092s leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Th\u00e9oden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold. \nARAGORN They will hold. \nGANDALF [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim... that\u0092s what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men I\u0092ve walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East. \nARAGORN [Opens the stall gates] Go. \n[Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides out of the stable and over the plains of Rohan.] \n[\u00c9owyn opens a chest in which lies a sword. She unsheathes it and begins to practice. She swings around and is met by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.] \nARAGORN You have some skill with a blade. \n[With a swift move, \u00c9owyn swings her sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable, gaining the upper hand.] \n", "test2_true": "ARAGORN What do you fear, my lady? \n\u00c9OWYN A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. \nARAGORN You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I do not think that would be your fate. \n[He bows and \u00c9owyn gazes after him as he walks away.] \n[The people of Rohan are moving out of Edoras towards Helm\u0092s Deep, with Th\u00e9oden leading the way. At Isengard, Gr\u00edma confers with Saruman, holding a cloth to his mouth.] \nGR\u00cdMA Th\u00e9oden will not stay at Edoras. It\u0092s vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm\u0092s Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them. \n[Saruman\u0092s eyebrows rise in response. He walks through the depths of Isengard and gives orders to an Orc.] \nSARUMAN Send out your warg riders. \n[The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him, ferocious growls are heard and shadows dances.] \n[Gollum is trying to catch a fish in the river. He slips and falls, grasping at a slippery fish as he goes. Frodo and Sam follow behind.] \nSAM Hey Stinker! Don\u0092t go getting too far ahead! \nFRODO Why do you do that? \nSAM What? \nFRODO Call him names; run him down all the time. \nSAM Because\u0085 because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about. \nFRODO [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him. What it\u0092s still doing to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam... \nSAM Why? \nFRODO Because I have to believe he can come back. \nSAM You can\u0092t save him, Mr. Frodo. \nFRODO [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it? Nothing! \n[Sam walks away slowly.] \nFRODO [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that. \nSAM [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it! \nFRODO [Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He walks away] \nSAM Can\u0092t you hear yourself? Don\u0092t you know who you sound like? \n[Frodo continues to walk away without looking back.] \n[Nighttime, Frodo and Sam are asleep. Gollum is crouching in a corner by himself.] \nGOLLUM We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked, trickssssy, falssse! \n", "test3_input": "ARAGORN Hurry! Inside! Get them inside! \nGAMLING Into the Keep! \n[They all run towards the keep, Legolas firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai army as he goes.] \n[Treebeard is walking through the forest, carrying Merry and Pippin. The hobbits look dejected.] \nTREEBEARD I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there. \n[Pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes.] \nPIPPIN Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take us south! \nTREEBEARD South? But that will lead you past Isengard. \nPIPPIN Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It\u0092s the last thing he\u0092ll expect. \nTREEBEARD Mmmm. That doesn\u0092t make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps you\u0092re right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill. \nMERRY Are you mad? We\u0092ll be caught! \nPIPPIN No we won\u0092t. Not this time. \n[Faramir and company draws close to Osgiliath.] \nRANGER 1 Look! Osgiliath burns! \nRANGER 2 Mordor has come. \nFRODO [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go. \n[Faramir hesitates for a moment.] \nFARAMIR Hurry. [He presses them on] \nFRODO Faramir, you must let me go! \n[Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards Osgiliath] \n[Treebeard, Merry and Pippin come to the southern edge of the forest.] \nTREEBEARD And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully. They\u0092re always trying to get somewhere where they \u0096 Oh!! [He sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds] Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn. \nPIPPIN I\u0092m sorry, Treebeard. \nTREEBEARD [With tears in his eyes] They had voices of their own. [His gaze turns to the treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns] Saruman! A wizard should know better! \n[He lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest] \nTREEBEARD There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of men for this treachery. My business is with Isengard tonight. With rock and stone! \n[Merry and Pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest. They see many Ents emerging and marching towards them] \nMERRY Yes! \nTREEBEARD Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. Last march of the Ents! \n", "test3_true": "MADRIL Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we\u0092ll be overrun. \n[Frodo suddenly seems stricken] \nSAM Mr Frodo! \nFRODO It\u0092s calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me. \nSAM Hold on, Mr. Frodo\u0085 You'll be alright... \n[Frodo sees that Sam is speaking to him but he hears nothing. His senses are overcome.] \nFARAMIR Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. \n[Sam breaks away as they are being led away.] \nSAM Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad! \nRANGER Watch out! \n[A boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodo\u0092s eyes roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.] \nSAM Mr Frodo? \nFRODO [In a faraway voice] They\u0092re here. They\u0092ve come. \nFARAMIR [Looking up] NAZG\u00dbL!! [He grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.] Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his men] Take cover! \n[Banners of the White Hand are flying from the battlements of Helm\u0092s Deep. The Hornburg is overrun with Uruk-hai. Th\u00e9oden and company are in the hall of the keep.] \nTH\u00c9ODEN The fortress is taken. It is over. \nARAGORN [Carrying a table with Legolas to shore up the door of the hall] You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending it! \n[In the Glittering Caves, the women and children cry in fear as they hear the battering ram banging on the door.] \nWOMAN They are breaking in! \nARAGORN Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? [There is no answer.] Is there no other way? \nGAMLING There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many. \nARAGORN Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance. \nTH\u00c9ODEN So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate? \nARAGORN [Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them. \nTH\u00c9ODEN [A light of determination shines in his eyes] For death and glory. \nARAGORN For Rohan. For your people. \nGIMLI The sun is rising. \n[Aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through. He recalls Gandalf's words.] \n"}

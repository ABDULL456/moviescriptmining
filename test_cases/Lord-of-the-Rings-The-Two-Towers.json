Pippin struggles to reach his Elven brooch with his teeth. He then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground. A foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass.] \n[Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground, listening for the sound of footsteps.] \nARAGORN Their pace has quickened.

To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers? \n[Camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of Barad-d\u00fbr until the flaming Eye is in view.] \nSARUMAN (V.O.) Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth. \n[The trees around Isengard are being ripped down, chopped up and used to feed huge furnaces. The caverns of Isengard glow with the fires of industry, sounds of hammering fill the air and molten iron is poured into casts to forge weapons.] \nSARUMAN (V.O.) The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us. \n[Saruman stands in the midst of a gathering of Dunlanders.] \nSARUMAN The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. \nDUNLAND MAN Murderers! \nSARUMAN Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village! \nCROWD [Roars with approval] Argh!! \n[They stomp off to destroy the villages of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still among the stampede.

What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home. \nMERRY [Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.] \nWith a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead Uruk-hai.] \nARAGORN [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldir\u0092s side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief.

Grimacing in pain, Th\u00e9oden continues to stab at the Uruk until led away by Gamling.] \nGAMLING Make way!

A fine hit! \n[Two Ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. Some Orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent, setting him on fire. Saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. Some Ents are now breaking away at a dam.] \nTREEBEARD Break the dam! Release the river! \n[The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path. \nMERRY Pippin, hold on!

As the water rushes over Isengard, an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water.

Gondorian Rangers are still running about, defending their stations.] \nSAM What are you doing? Where are you going?! \n[SLOW MOTION Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. A Nazg\u00fbl on a Fell beast emerges in front of him. Frodo stares at the Nazg\u00fbl, fixated. Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazg\u00fbl flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over. Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs. As they come to a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away.] \nFRODO Aaarrgghh!!! \nSAM [With tears running down his face] It\u0092s me. It\u0092s your Sam. Don\u0092t you know your Sam? \n[The madness fades and recognition returns to Frodo\u0092s eyes. He realises what he nearly did and is overcome.

The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn\u0092t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy?

Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn\u0092t. They kept going because they were holding on to something. \nFRODO What are we holding on to, Sam? \nSAM There\u0092s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it\u0092s worth fighting for. \n[Standing in a corner, even Gollum seems moved. Faramir walks over and comes to kneel in front of Frodo] \nFARAMIR I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. \nMADRIL You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit. \nFARAMIR Then it is forfeit. Release them. \n[Sam shakes the ranger\u0092s hand from his shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir with gladness.

RIDDICK (shaking head) Had it with deals. 
FRY But I just wanted to say -- 
RIDDICK Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better. 
It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...." 
RIDDICK (CONT'D) Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there. 
FRY We can, can't we? Trust you? 
RIDDICK Actually... (completely genuine) That's what I been askin' myself. 
He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake. 
EXT. NIGHT 
The drag-sled begins moving. 
SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off, eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side- guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every shadow a threat. They are a train of light. 
CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles of booze. 
CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot. 
EXT. NIGHT 
Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND, the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from above, awaiting their chance. 
EXT. NIGHT 
FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished. 
JOHNS So you noticed too? 
FRY Riddick. Riddick. 
The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light. 
FRY Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them? 
RIDDICK Saw something I didn't like. 
JOHNS Such as. 
RIDDICK Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you? 
Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby CLICKING breaks up the confrontation. 
FRY Let's move. (to Audrey) Just a detour. He'll get us there. 
PARIS Can we switch? 
FRY What, switch what? 
PARIS I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can.... (off their stares) Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here -- 
JOHNS She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells. 
PARIS Oh, so I'm disposable? 
FRY I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just get this train moving! 
EXT. NIGHT 
They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner. 
At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty. 
PARIS Light, please, need light here.... 
Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light. 
PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl. 
A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam lunges at the last nanosecond...

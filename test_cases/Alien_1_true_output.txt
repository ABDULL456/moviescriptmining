INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
STANDARD So does anybody have any suggestions? 
FAUST We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it. 
STANDARD No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out. 
MELKONIS How? 
STANDARD Room by room, corridor by corridor. 
No one likes this thought. 
MELKONIS And what do we do when we find it? 
STANDARD We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it. 
FAUST We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong. 
ROBY We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods. 
HUNTER I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock. 
STANDARD Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change. 
They start for the exit. 
EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE 
The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP 
Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot policeman, including clear plastic helmet. 
He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical wall. 
He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside- down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down them. 
INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE 
Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space. He also wears the protective suit. 
Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels provide the only illumination. 
STANDARD I thought I'd find you here. 
MELKONIS I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship. 
STANDARD That's the one about the albatross, right? 
MELKONIS We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation... 
STANDARD We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us. 
MELKONIS Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation. 
STANDARD I can see you're putting your spare time to good use. (leans forward and taps him on the knee) Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen. 
MELKONIS (smiles at him) We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases. 
STANDARD Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE 
The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of shimmering metallic netting. 
Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles. 
HUNTER These have portable generators in them.  They're insulated down to here -- just be careful not to touch the end. 
He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal object.  A blue spark leaps. 
FAUST Might even incinerate the damn thing. 
STANDARD (sharply) I hope not. 
HUNTER Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive. 
STANDARD How do we locate the creature? 
FAUST With these. 
He picks up a small portable unit. 
FAUST (CONT'D) Tracking device.  You set it to search for a moving object... It hasn't got much range, but when you get within a certain distance, it starts beeping.

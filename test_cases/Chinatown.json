{"train": "CHINATOWN \nWritten by \nRobert Towne \nFULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans. \nCURLY'S VOICE (crying out) Oh, no. \nINT. GITTES' OFFICE \nCURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' shiny desk top. \nGittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a cigarette using a lighter with a \"nail\" on his desk. \nCurly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew. \nCurly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually bites into the blinds. \nGittes doesn't move from his chair. \nGITTES All right, enough is enough. You can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. I just had 'em installed on Wednesday. \nCurly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys. \nGittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly. \nGITTES Down the hatch. \nCurly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry quietly. \nCURLY (drinking, relaxing a little) She's just no good. \nGITTES What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right. \nCURLY Ain't worth thinking about. \nGittes leaves the bottle with Curly. \nGITTES You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought. \nCURLY (pouring himself) You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay. \nGITTES (settling back, breathing a little easier) Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake. \nCURLY Thanks. You know something, Jake? \nGITTES What's that, Curly? \nCURLY I think I'll kill her. \nINT. DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE \nNoticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed, dark- haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling with the veil on her pillbox hat. \nWOMAN I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to this personally. \nWALSH (almost the manner of someone comforting the bereaved) If you'll allow us to complete our preliminary questioning, by then he'll be free. \nThere is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office. \nSomething made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy. \nINT. GITTES' OFFICE \u0096 GITTES & CURLY \nGittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of perspiration on his desk. \nCURLY (crying) They don't kill a guy for that. \nGITTES Oh they don't? \nCURLY Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law. \nGittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting; \nGITTES I'll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class? \nCurly shrinks back a little. \nCURLY ...No... \nGITTES You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off. \nThis seems to upset Curly even more. \nCURLY I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore. \nGITTES (easing him out of his office) Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point... \nINT. OFFICE RECEPTION \nHe's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be read: \"J. J. GITTES and Associates. DISCREET INVESTIGATION\" \nGITTES I don't want your last dime. \nHe throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile. \nGittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up the stairs. \nINT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS \nFormer Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering: \n\"PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR\" \nSome of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking. \nBAGBY Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it but you can't drink it, you can't water your lawns with it, you can't irrigate an orange grove with it.  Remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert. Los Angeles is a desert community. Beneath this building, beneath every street there's a desert. Without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we'd never existed! (pausing, letting the implication sink in) \nCLOSE \u0096 GITTES \nsitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. He yawns, edges away from one of the dirtier farmers. \nBAGBY (O.S.) (continuing) The Alto Vallejo can save us from that, and I respectfully suggest that eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets and not on top of them. \nAUDIENCE \u0096 COUNCIL CHAMBERS \nAn amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers applaud. \nSomebody shooshes them. \nCOUNCIL COMMITTEE \nIn a whispered conference. \nCOUNCILMAN (acknowledging Bagby) Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the departments again. I suppose we better take Water and Power first. Mr. Mulwray. \nREACTION \u0096 GITTES \nLooking up with interest from his racing form. \nMULWRAY \nWalks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The man turns the overleaf on the map. \nMULWRAY In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster.  It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there. (referring to a new overleaf) Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface. Well, it won't hold. I won't build it. It's that simple. I am not making that kind of mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen. \nMulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion. \nCOUNCIL PRESIDENT (shouting to farmer) What in the hell do you think you're doing? (as the sheep bleat down the aisles toward the Council) Get those goddam things out of here! \nFARMER (right back) Tell me where to take them! You don't have an answer for that so quick, do you? \nBailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray. \nFARMER (through above, to Mulwray) You steal the water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock who's paying you to do that, Mr. Mulwray, that's what I want to know! \nL.A. RIVERBED \u0096 LONG SHOT \nIt's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds. \nAfter a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray gets out of the car. Me looks around. \nWITH GITTES \nHolding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed. \nThere Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all. \nGITTES \nTrains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's glasses. \nBELOW GITTES \nThere's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed, and into Gitte's view. \nMULWRAY \nHimself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water at his feet. \nHe moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, toward Gittes. \nGITTES \nMoves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks. \nMulwray says something to the boy. \nThe boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it. \nAfter a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly back upstream \u0096 scrambling up the bank to his car. \nThere he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking downstream from time to time. \nThe power lines overhead HUM. \nHe stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets back in the car. He drives off. \nGITTES \nHurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right back out. \nThe steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in and takes off. \nGITTES (continuing; eagerly) So what you got? \nWalsh shows him the photos. He looks at them. They are a series outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man whose appearance is striking. In two of the photos a gnarled cane is visible. \nGITTES (continuing; obviously annoyed) This? \nWALSH They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle. \nGITTES What about? \nWALSH I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing \u0096 apple core. \nGITTES Apple core? \nWALSH (shrugs) Yeah. \nINT. GITTES' OFFICE \nGittes tosses down the photos in disgust. \nGITTES Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing? \nWALSH Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures. \nGITTES Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse. \nThe PHONE has been RINGING. Sophie buzzes him. \nGITTES Yeah, Sophie? (he picks up the phone) Duffy, where are you? \nDuffy's VOICE can be HEARD, excitedly. \"I got it. I got it. He's found himself some cute little twist in a rowboat, in Echo Park.\" \nGITTES (continuing) Okay, slow down \u0096 Echo Park. (to Walsh) Jesus, water again. \nWESTLAKE PARK (MCARTHUR PARK) \nDuffy is rowing, Gittes seated in the stern. \nThey pass Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress, drifting in their rowboat, Mulwray fondly doting on the girl. \nGITTES (to Duffy, as they pass) Let's have a big smile, pal. \nHe shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast shots. \nMulwray and the girl seem blissfully unaware of them. \nDUFFY \nTurns again and they row past Mulwray and the girl, Gittes again clicking off several fast shots. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 SIGN: \n\"EL MACANDO APARTMENTS\" \nMOVE ALONG the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of the roof where Gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the roof and Gittes himself is stretched face downward on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below him where the girl and Mulwray are eating. Gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose. \nGittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. He tries to slow himself down. The loose tile also begins to slide. \nGittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his feet in the drain itself. The loose tile falls and hits the veranda below. He stops as it's about to slide over the edge. He carefully lays it in the drain. But a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls. \nWITH MULWRAY AND THE GIRL \nMulwray staring at the fragment at his feet. He looks to the girl. \nHe's clearly concerned. He rises, looks up to the roof. \nFROM HIS POV \nThe roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. He slowly sits back down, staring at the tile fragment. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 NEWSPAPER \"DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER BLOWS FUSE OVER CHIEF'S USE OF FUNDS FOR EL MACANDO LOVE NEST.\" \nIn the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart- shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken. Next to it is a smaller column, \"J.J. Gittes hired by suspicious spouse.\" \nINT. BARBERSHOP \u0096 GITTES \nHolds the paper and reads while getting his haircut and his shoes shined. In fact, almost all the customers are reading papers. \nBARNEY (to Gittes) When you get so much publicity, after a while you must get blas\u00e9 about it. \nA self-satisfied smile comes to Gittes' face. \nBARNEY (continuing) Face it. You're practically a movie star. \nIn b.g., customers can be OVERHEARD talking about the drought. \nInterspersed with above, someone is saying, \"They're gonna start rationing water unless it rains.\" Someone else says, \"Only for washing your cars.\" Third says, \"You're not going to be able to water your lawn either, or take a bath more than once a week.\" First says, \"If you don't have a lawn or a car, do you get an extra bath?\" \nGittes has been staring outside the barbershop. A car is stalled. \nThe hood is up. A man watches his radiator boiling over. \nGITTES (laughing) Look at that. \nBARNEY Heat's murder. \nOTHER CUSTOMER (end of conversation) Fools names and fools faces... \nEVELYN Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it. \nGITTES Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray... \nShe's walked past him toward the door. He stop her. \nGITTES (continuing) ...there's some misunderstanding here. It's not going to do any good to get tough with me. \nEvelyn flashes a cold smile. \nEVELYN I don't get tough with anybody, Mr. Gittes.  My lawyer does. \nEvelyn starts out the door and Gittes starts after her. This time he's stopped by the Gray-Haired Man who has also come out of his office and up behind him. \nGRAY-HAIRED MAN Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes. \nGittes turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complaint. Evelyn walks out the door. \nGRAY-HAIRED MAN (continuing; pleasantly) I suppose we'll be hearing from your attorney. \nGittes stares down at the papers in his hand. \nINT. GITTES' INNER OFFICE \u0096 GITTES, DUFFY & WALSH \nOn Gittes' desk. There are empty coffee cups, the summons and complaint, and the newspaper Gittes had brought with him from the barber shop. \nThe three men are sitting, worn and silent. Walsh chewing gum is the loudest noise in the room. \nGittes looks to Walsh with obvious irritation. Walsh stops chewing. \nDuffy puts out a cigarette in the dregs of one of the coffee cups. \nGITTES (to Duffy) There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy. \nDUFFY Okay. \nGITTES That's a filthy habit. \nDUFFY I said okay, Jake. \nGITTES Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too. \nWALSH Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address. \nGITTES All she needed for that was the phone book! \nWALSH No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer. \nGITTES When I find out who that phony bitch was. \nGittes is staring down at the newspaper. He suddenly grabs the phone, begins dialing. A tight little smile breaks out on his face. \nHe buzzes Sophie. \nGITTES Sophie. \nSOPHIE Yes, Mr. Gittes. \nGITTES Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz. (as he waits) And how about that snotty broad? (the phone to his ear) What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me \u0096 so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town. \nSophie BUZZES. \nGITTES (continuing) Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah, listen, where did you get those photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse over the El Macando love nest.  That's cute, Whitey... so who sent them to you... I sent them? (Gittes laughs a little hysterically) Why would I be asking how you got them if I sent them?... Whitey?... Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for once, my tit's in the wringer and it's beginning to hurt... yeah... yeah... yeah. \nHe hangs up. \nWALSH So he says you sent them? \nGITTES (after a moment) They're all a bunch of phonies. \nINT. DEPARTMENT WATER & POWER \u0096 HALL \nGittes stops outside a door marked: \n\"HOLLIS J. MULWRAY CHIEF ENGINEER\" \nHe enters an outer office. The SECRETARY looks surprised. \nGITTES Mr. Mulwray, please. \nSECRETARY He's not in, Mr.? \nGITTES Gittes. \nSECRETARY May I ask what this is regarding? \nGITTES It's personal. Has he been out long? \nSECRETARY Since lunch. \nGITTES Gee whiz. (he glances at his watch) And I'm late. \nSECRETARY He was expecting you? \nGITTES Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait? \nWithout waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door. \nCHINESE BUTLER Please. \nGittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for him to follow. \nTHROUGH THE HOUSE \u0096 GITTES \nFollows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water. \nCHINESE BUTLER You wait, please. \nGittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles at Gittes, probes into the pond. \nThere's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes it. \nAfter a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters recede. \nEXT. POND \u0096 GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER \u0096 DAY \nGARDENER (to Gittes) Bad for glass. \nGITTES (not understanding) Yeah sure. Bad for glass. \nThe Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming. \nHe looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object. \nHe then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto it for poise. \nEvelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair. \nShe's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office. \nEVELYN Yes, Mr. Gittes? \nGittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite. \nGITTES Actually, I'm here to see your husband, Mrs. Mulwray. \nHe laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There is none. \nThe Chinese Butler appears on the veranda. \nEVELYN Would you like something to drink? \nGITTES What are you having? \nEVELYN Iced tea. \nGITTES Yeah. Fine, thank you. \nChinese Butler nods, disappears \nEXT. POND AND GARDEN \u0096 MULWRAY HOUSE \u0096 DAY \nEvelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her. \nEVELYN My husband's at the office. \nGITTES Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando. \nEVELYN (sharply) That's not his apartment. \nGITTES Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk. \nHe waits for a response. Then: \nGITTES (continuing; uneasily) I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke. \nEVELYN Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit. \nGITTES What? \nEVELYN I said I'll drop it. \nThe iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them. \nEVELYN (continuing; pleasantly) So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon? \nGITTES Mrs. Mulwray? \nEVELYN (as she's mixing one of the drinks) Yes, Mr. Gittes? \nGITTES I don't want to drop it. \nEvelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly. \nGITTES I should talk this over with your husband. \nEVELYN (a little concerned) Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man. \nGITTES Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that. \nAgain he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction. \nGITTES (continuing) You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem. \nEVELYN (with a slight edge) What do you mean? \nGITTES I get by. \nESCOBAR Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have. \nLOACH Poking around in other people's dirty linen. \nGITTES Yeah. Tell me, you still throw Chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry? \nESCOBAR You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now. (smiles) And I'm out of Chinatown. \nGITTES Since when? \nESCOBAR Since I made Lieutenant. \nIt's apparent Gittes is impressed despite himself. \nGITTES Congratulations. \nESCOBAR Uh-huh. So what are you doing here? \nGITTES Looking for someone. \nESCOBAR Who? \nGITTES Hollis Mulwray. You seen him? \nESCOBAR Oh yes. \nGITTES I'd like to talk to him. \nESCOBAR You're welcome to try. There he is. \nEscobar points down to the reservoir. A couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water. It can be SEEN that one of them has hooked something. \nHe shouts. The other man hooks it, too. They pull, revealing the soaking back of a man's coat. They start to pull the body into the skiff. \nINT. CORONER'S OFFICE \u0096 EVELYN AND ESCOBAR \nAre standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet drawn back. Evelyn nods. \nEscobar drops the sheet. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them. \nESCOBAR It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim? \nEVELYN Of course. \nESCOBAR Obviously the fall must have knocked him out. \nEvelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant wheels the body out of the office. \nESCOBAR (continuing) This alleged affair he was having. The publicity didn't make him morose or unhappy? \nOUTSIDE THE CORONER'S \nGittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway. \nEscobar sees him, ignores him. Evelyn doesn't see him. \nEVELYN ...Well, it didn't make him happy... \nESCOBAR But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life? \nEVELYN (sharply) No. \nESCOBAR (a little uncomfortably now) Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question? \nEvelyn shows a flash of annoyance. \nEVELYN No. \nESCOBAR Do you know where she might be? \nEVELYN Certainly not! \nEscobar and Evelyn move slowly toward the door. \nESCOBAR You and your husband never discussed her? \nEVELYN (stopping, faltering) He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me. \nESCOBAR A complete surprise? \nEVELYN Yes. \nESCOBAR But I thought you'd hired a private investigator. \nEVELYN A private investigator? \nESCOBAR (gesturing vaguely toward the door) Mr. Gittes. \nEVELYN Well yes. \nEvelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her. She stops cold. They look at one another for a long moment. \nEVELYN (her eyes on Gittes) But I... I... did that because I thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put an end to... \nShe finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes. Escobar is right at her back. Gittes says nothing. \nGittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. CAMERA GETS ITS FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body. Eyes open, the face badly cut and bruised. \nMORTY Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A. \nGITTES (looking at. Mulwray) Yeah. Banged up pretty bad. \nMORTY That's a long fall. \nGITTES So how are you, Morty? \nMorty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant. \nMORTY Never better. You know me, Jake. \nAs he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing. Gittes spots the other body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray. \nGITTES (picking up on cough) Yeah, so who you got there? \nMorty pulls back the sheet. \nMORTY Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to hang around Ferguson's Alley. \nMorty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs. \nMORTY (continuing) Quite a character. Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains. Had a bureau dresser down there and everything. \nGittes has already lost interest. He starts away. \nGITTES Yeah. \nMORTY Drowned, too. \nThis stops Gittes. \nGITTES Come again? \nMORTY Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed. \nGITTES The L.A. River? \nMORTY (a little puzzled) Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that? \nGittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely. \nGITTES It's bone dry, Morty. \nMORTY It's not completely dry. \nGITTES Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon. \nMorty shrugs. \nMORTY We got water out of him, Jake. He drowned. \nGittes walks away mumbling. \nGITTES Jesus, this town... \nEXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD \u0096 GITTES \u0096 DAY \nHe's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the riverbed below. \nFROM THE BRIDGE \nGittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims \"OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000\" which was used as a roof of sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of Shuhardt's home. \nGittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes pulls it out, swearing. \nHe begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something. \nClearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy bank. \nThey look at one another a moment. \nGITTES (calling out to him) You were riding here the other day, weren't you...? \nThe Boy doesn't answer. \nGITTES (continuing) Speak English?... Habla Ingles? \nTHE BOY (finally) Si. \nGITTES Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he... \nThe Boy nods. \nGITTES (continuing) What did you talk about, mind my asking? \nThe shadows of the two are very long now. \nTHE BOY (finally) The water. \nGITTES What about the water? \nTHE BOY When it comes. \nGITTES When it comes? What'd you tell him? \nThe PHONE is RINGING. Sophie BUZZES. \nGITTES (pressing down intercom) Yeah, Sophie. \nSOPHIE'S VOICE A Miss Sessions calling. \nGITTES Who? \nSOPHIE'S VOICE Ida Sessions. \nGITTES Don't know her. Take a number. \nNEW ANGLE \u0096 REVEALING \nA bandage spread-eagled across Gittes' nose. \nWALSH So some contractor wants to build a dam and he makes a few payoffs. So what? \nGittes turns slowly to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose. \nWALSH (continuing) Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing. \nGITTES I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs. \nDUFFY Then what'll you do? \nGITTES Sue the shit out of 'em. \nWALSH Yeah? \nGITTES Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing. (a dazzling smile) We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. \nWALSH Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit. \nGittes looks irritated. The PHONE RINGS again. \nSOPHIE'S VOICE Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her. \nGITTES Okay. \nGittes picks up the phone. He winks to his boys. \nGITTES (continuing) Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure. \nIDA'S VOICE Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes? \nGITTES (clowning a little for the boys) Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions? \nWalsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story. \nIDA'S VOICE Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own. \nGITTES When did you come in? \nIDA'S VOICE I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember? \nWalsh has finished off the punch line and both men are laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing through and puts his hand over the receiver. \nGITTES (to Duffy and Walsh) Shut the fuck up! (then back to Ida) ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying? \nIDA'S VOICE Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen. \nGITTES I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both. \nIDA'S VOICE Oh no. \nGITTES ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over? \nIDA'S VOICE No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times... \nGITTES The obituary column? \nIDA'S VOICE You'll find one of those people. \nGITTES 'Those people?' Miss Sessions. \nShe hangs up. Gittes looks to his two men. \nINT. BROWN DERBY \u0096 CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER \nGittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the OBITUARY COLUMN, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper and puts it in his pocket. \nWhen he closes the paper we can SEE headlines in the left hand column: \"WATER BOND ISSUE PASSES COUNCIL\". Ten million dollar referendum to go before the public. \nEvelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He rises, allows her to sit. \nCLOSE ON EVELYN \nGittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly... She's wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored. \nGITTES Thanks for coming... drink? \nThe waiter's appeared. Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose. \nEVELYN Tom Collins with lime, not lemon, please. \nEvelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. When she looks back up she stares expectantly at Gittes. \nEVELYN I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all? \nGittes nods. \nGITTES Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand for? \nHe's been fingering the envelope... \nEVELYN (she stammers slightly) K... Cross. \nGITTES That your maiden name? \nEVELYN Yes... why? \nGITTES No reason. \nEvelyn turns into Gittes. \nEVELYN You must've had a reason to ask me that. \nGITTES (shrugs) No. I'm just a snoop. \nEVELYN You seem to have had a reason for every other question. \nGITTES No, not for that one. \nEVELYN I don't believe you. \nGittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn. \nGITTES (moving in) Do me a favor. Sit still and act like I'm charming. \nEvelyn involuntarily draws back. \nGITTES (continuing) There's somebody here. Say something. Anything. Something like we're being intimate. \nEvelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle his hand in front of their faces. She stares at him. \nEVELYN (meaning his nose) How did it happen? \nGITTES (quietly) Been meaning to talk to you about that. \nEVELYN (quietly) Maybe putting your nose in other people's business? \nGITTES (quietly) More like other people putting their business in my nose. \nEvelyn actually smiles a little. \nWOMAN'S VOICE You son of a bitch. \nGittes looks up and flashes his smile. \nGITTES Mrs. Match. How're you? \nMRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, and a menacing look in her eye. \nMRS. MATCH Don't give me that, you son of a bitch. \nGITTES Okay. \nGittes turns back to Evelyn. \nEVELYN (softly) Another satisfied client? \nGITTES Another satisfied client's wife. \nMRS. MATCH Look at me, you son of a bitch. You... you bastard. Are you happy, are you happy now? \nShe tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse. Gittes covers himself. Waiters rush over. \nMRS. MATCH You smug son of a bitch. My husband's so upset he sweats all night! How do you think that makes me feel? \nGITTES Sweaty? \nMrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again. She catches him on the nose. It hurts. He covers it, then swings his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin. \nMrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink. She grabs her shin, hopping around a little. The waiters who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over. \nGITTES Let's get out of here before she picks up her purse. \nThey rise and move toward the door. \nEVELYN (quietly) Tough guy, huh? \nGittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods. \nOUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT \u0096 DUSK \nGittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. The attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn. \nEVELYN Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard. \nGITTES (to attendant who dutifully starts for her car) Wait a minute, sonny. (to Evelyn) I think you better come with me. \nEVELYN What for? There's nothing more to say. (to attendant) Get my car, please. \nThe attendant starts after it again. Gittes leans on the open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but spits it out. \nGITTES Only when I breathe. \nYELBURTON (laughing) Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray? \nGITTES I never was. \nYELBURTON (stops smiling) I don't understand. \nGITTES Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me. \nYELBURTON Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense. \nGITTES Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned. \nYELBURTON Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about. \nGITTES Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news. \nGittes heads toward the door. \nYELBURTON Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff. \nGITTES Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards? \nYELBURTON I said, the northwest valley. \nGITTES That's like saying they're in Arizona. \nYELBURTON Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location... \nGittes nods. \nGITTES You're a married man, am I right? \nYELBURTON Yes... \nGITTES Hard working, have a wife and kids... \nYELBURTON Yes... \nGITTES I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over. (hands him a card) Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years. \nGittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton. \nINT. GITTES OFFICE \nGittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office. \nEVELYN MULWRAY \nIs sitting, smoking. She looks up when he enters. \nEVELYN What's your usual salary? \nGittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her. \nGITTES Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty for each of my operators, plus expenses, plus my fee if I show results. \nHe's sitting now. Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very shaken. \nEVELYN Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble? \nGITTES Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know. \nEVELYN I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved. \nGittes buzzes Sophie. \nGITTES Sophie, draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray. (he leans back; to Evelyn) Tell me, did you get married before or after Mulwray and your father sold the water department? \nEvelyn nearly jumps at the question. \nGITTES (continuing) Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he? \nEVELYN Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that. \nGITTES So you married your father's business partner? \nEvelyn nods. She lights another cigarette. \nGITTES (continuing; staring at her, points to the ashtray) You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray. \nEVELYN Oh. \nShe quickly stubs one out. \nGITTES Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father? \nEVELYN No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out... \nGITTES Over the water department, or over you? \nEVELYN (quickly) Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me? \nGITTES (noting her nervousness) Then it was over the water department. \nEVELYN Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke. \nALBACORE CLUB \u0096 DAY \nA pleasant but unobtrusive clapboard blue and white building on the bay overlooking the harbor. The seaplane lands. A motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns and heads in the direction of the plane. \nEXT. WINDING ROAD \u0096 RANCHO DEL CRUCE \nGittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign with a cross painted below the name. \nThe ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island. As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of the sea. \nThe wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered around a corral. The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and jeans. When he talks his strong face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged. \nEXT. BRIDLE PATH \u0096 GITTES & CROSS \nWalking toward the main house. A classic Monterey. A horse led on a halter by another ranch hand slows down and defecates in the center of the path they are taking. Gittes doesn't notice. \nCROSS Horseshit. \nGittes pauses, not certain he has heard correctly. \nGITTES Sir? \nCROSS I said horseshit. (pointing) Horseshit. \nGITTES Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that. \nCross pauses when they reach the dung pile. He removes his hat and waves it, inhales deeply. \nCROSS Love the smell of it. A lot of people do but of course they won't admit it. Look at the shape. \nGittes glances down out of politeness. \nCROSS (continuing; smiling, almost enthusiastic) Always the same. \nCross walks on. Gittes follows. \nGITTES (not one to let it go) Always? \nCROSS What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something. (stops and glances. back) And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life. \nThey move on. \nCROSS (continuing) Perhaps this preoccupation with horseshit may seem a little perverse, but I ask you to remember this. One way or another, it's what I've dealt in all my life. Let's have breakfast. \nEXT. COURTYARD VERANDA \u0096 GITTES & CROSS AT BREAKFAST \nBelow them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick up their heels. \nCross' attention is diverted by the animals from time to time. An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main course, broiled fish. \nCROSS You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that. \nGITTES (dubious) Thanks. \nCROSS If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising. \nGITTES It doesn't hurt. \nCROSS It's why you attract a client like my daughter. \nGITTES Probably. \nCROSS But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband. \nGITTES No. She happens to think the last one was murdered. \nCross is visibly surprised. \nCROSS How did she get that idea? \nGITTES I think I gave it to her. \nCross nods. \nCROSS Uh-huh. Oh I hope you don't mind. I believe they should be served with the head. \nGittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking. \nGITTES Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way. \nCROSS (laughs) Tell me. What do the police say? \nGITTES They're calling it an accident. \nCROSS Who's the investigating officer? \nGITTES Lou Escobar \u0096 he's a Lieutenant. \nCROSS Do you know him? \nGITTES Oh yes. \nCROSS Where from? \nGITTES We worked in Chinatown together. \nCROSS Would you call him a capable man? \nGITTES If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about. \nCROSS (painfully) Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl. \nGITTES How did you find out? \nCROSS I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town. \nGITTES Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her? \nCROSS Just find the girl. \nGITTES I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. \nCROSS Avocado groves? \nGITTES We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross. \nINT. HALL OF RECORDS \u0096 DAY \nDark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk. \nGITTES I'm a little lost. Where can I find the plat books for the northwest valley? \nThe Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little. \nCLERK Part of it's in Ventura County. We don't have Ventura County in our Hall of Records. \nWhich is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles. \nGITTES I'll settle for L.A. County. \nCLERK (regards him, then) Row twenty-three, section C. \nThe Clerk turns away abruptly. Gittes regards his back a moment, then goes to the stacks. \nTHROUGH THE STACKS \nGittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The second clerk gets on the phone. Gittes watches a moment, then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks. \nHe hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's huge and there's a lot to go through. \nThe print itself makes him squint. \nINSERT PAGE \nShowing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners. \nGITTES Hauls the huge volume back to the Clerk's desk. \nGITTES (to Clerk) Say... uh... sonny. \nThe Clerk turns sharply around. \nGITTES How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book? \nCLERK Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week. \nGittes looks a little surprised. \nGITTES Then these are all new owners? \nCLERK That's right. \nGITTES (astonished) But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months. \nCLERK If that's what it says. \nGITTES Can I check one of these volumes out? \nCLERK (quietly snotty) Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records. \nGITTES Well, then, how about a ruler? \nCLERK A ruler? \nGITTES The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across. \nThe exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler on the desk. \nGittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically. \nINSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY \nBeside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped. \nEXT. ROAD \u0096 GITTES DRIVING \u0096 DAY \nAmidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads. \nHe passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There is a \"SOLD\" sign on the collapsing barn. Gittes stops, checks it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records. \nOLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON \nAnd a few withered pepper trees. Gittes has paused at this dried-up intersection. There is a \"SOLD\" sign on a drug store. Gittes looks OFF SCREEN. \nComing INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction. \nBIG FARMER (shoving Gittes) Whyn't you pick on somebody your own size? \nRED FACED FARMER I said cut that out! Give him a chance to say something. \nGittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer. \nGITTES (reaching down for his wallet) Name's Gittes. I'm a private investigator and I'm not with either one. \nRED FACED FARMER Then what are you doing out here? \nGITTES Client hired me to see... whether or not the water department's been irrigating your land. \nRED FACED FARMER Irrigating my land? (exploding) The water department's been sending you people to blow up my water tanks! They threw poison down three of my wells! I call that a funny way to irrigate. Who'd hire you for a thing like that? \nGittes reaches into his pocket. The paper's on the ground. He picks it up. \nGITTES Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. \nBIG FARMER Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch who's done it to us. \nGITTES Mulwray's dead. You don't know what you're talking about, you dumb Oakie. \nThe Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt. \nRED FACED FARMER Well, that's that. \nBLACK SCREEN \nThere's a PURLING SOUND, which soon becomes defined into the SOUND OF VOICES talking quietly \u0096 about whether to move or not to move, doctors, etc. \nCLOSE \u0096 EVELYN MULWRAY \nIs staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened in porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog. \nThe Red Faced Farmer's wife has set tea out. The farmers, all of them, now seem awkward and a little embarrassed. \nFRONT PORCH \u0096 RED FACE FARMER'S HOUSE \u0096 REACTION \u0096 GITTES \u0096 DUSK \nHe focuses on Evelyn who sits right next to him. He's got dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots. \nGITTES (to Evelyn) What's going on? \nDUBOIS (quietly, almost as if he were in a hospital) You didn't look too good, so we thought we better call your employer. \nGittes nods. He checks his watch. He looks out. It's almost evening. \nGittes says nothing. The wife of the Red Faced Farmer (DUBOIS) looks reproachfully at Dubois. Gittes feels the back of his head, It obviously hurts him. \nEXT. DUBOIS FARMHOUSE \u0096 EVENING \nEvelyn and Gittes go out to her car, the cream colored Packard. \nDubois accompanies them, along with the Big Farmer who is carrying a crate of something. Gittes has cleaned himself up a little. \nDUBOIS Look here, if it's all the same with you, we'll get your car patched up. If you'll tell me what your trousers run you, I'll make good on them, Mr. Gittes. \nGITTES It's okay, Mr. Dubois. \nDUBOIS, (to Evelyn) It's just that they're after everybody out here, tearing up our irrigation ditches trying to make our land worthless so they can pick it up for twenty-five dollars an acre. \nGittes nods. \nDUBOIS (continuing) Anyway. Earl here is sorry, too. He wants to give you something to take back with you. \nGittes looks. Earl has the huge crate he's holding brim-full of avocados. \nGITTES Thanks, Earl. \nINT. CAR \u0096 EVELYN & GITTES \u0096 DUSK \nEvelyn driving. \nGITTES Thanks for coming... \nGittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one, offers one to Evelyn who refuses. \nGITTES That dam is a con job. \nEVELYN What dam? \nGITTES The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here. \nEVELYN The Valley? \nGITTES Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. (whips out papers, turns on the car light) That bother you? \nEVELYN No. \nGITTES (looking over papers) In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres. \nEVELYN Jasper Lamar Crabb? \nGITTES Know him? \nEVELYN No, I think I'd remember. \nGITTES Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid. \nGITTES They may not know it but they are. \nGittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the quilt. \nGITTES Hello, girls. \nTwo of the ladies giggle. The third continues to busy herself with her quilt, off by herself. \nGITTES (continuing) Which one of you is Emma Dill? \nTwo of them say \"she is,\" and point in different directions. The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting. Gittes approaches her. \nGITTES Are you Emma? \nSome old voice is singing softly, \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree.\" \nEMMA Yes. \nGITTES I've been wanting to meet you. \nEMMA Why? \nGITTES Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman? \nEMMA (stitching, smiles) I'm not. \nGITTES Well you own a lot of land. \nEMMA Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it. \nGittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it. \nGITTES That's just lovely. \nEMMA Thank you... \nHe looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, comes across the tail and by it the initials A.C. \nGITTES (indicating tail) Where did you get this material? \nEMMA (what it sounds like) The apple core club. \nGITTES The apple core? \nEMMA No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us. \nGITTES How do they do that? \nEMMA Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but \u0096- \nGITTES (kneeling) But what? \nPALMER'S VOICE We're a sort of unofficial charity of theirs, Mr. Gittes. Would you care to come this way? Someone wants to see you. \nGittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer. \nGittes rises. \nGITTES See you later, Emma. \nHe walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front. \nAT THE ENTRANCE HALL \u0096 MULVIHILL \nIs waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to Gittes. \nThe four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over everyone. \nMULVIHILL Come on I want you to meet somebody, Gittes. \nGITTES (glancing from Palmer to Mulvihill) Can we leave the lady out of this? \nMULVIHILL (a little uncertain) Yeah, why not? \nGITTES Okay, I'd like to walk her to her car. \nEVELYN I'll stay. \nGITTES (taking her by the arm) Get in the car. \nMULVIHILL I'll see she makes it. \nMulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor. \nPalmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor. \nGITTES (as Mulvihill hits the floor, to Evelyn) What are you waiting for? Get in the car! \nEvelyn goes. \nMulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand and kicks it. \nIt goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the wall. \nPalmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses. \nGittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience of ancients behind him. \nEVELYN (continuing) Boy oh boy, you're a mess. \nGITTES Yeah. \nEVELYN (working on him) So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown... \nGITTES Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was... \nGittes shrugs. \nEVELYN Hold still. Why? \nGITTES You can't always tell what's going on there. \nEVELYN ...No. Why was it. \nGITTES I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt. \nEVELYN Could you do anything about it? \nThey're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near his eye. \nGITTES Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second. \nHe takes hold of her and pulls her even closer, \nEVELYN (momentarily freezing) What's wrong? \nGITTES Your eye. \nEVELYN What about it? \nGITTES (staring intently) There's something black in the green part of your eye. \nEVELYN (not moving) Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris... \nGITTES ...A flaw... \nEVELYN (she almost shivers) ...Yes, sort of a birthmark... \nGittes kisses her lightly, gradually rises until he's standing holding her. She hesitates, then wraps her arms around him. \nINT. MULWRAY BEDROOM \u0096 TELEPHONE \nOn a nightstand, city lights visible through the open window behind it. It is RINGING. Evelyn's arm reaches INTO SHOT. SOUND of something hitting the headboard. Gittes moans. \nVIEW SHIFTS TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, holding his head, which he's just hit. Evelyn pauses in her reach to the phone. She turns to him, whispers, \"I'm sorry,\" kisses him on the head and lips. PHONE CONTINUES TO RING. She picks it up. \nEVELYN Hello... (in Spanish now) No, no, I'll come and help, just keep watching her and don't do anything until I get there... 'bye. \nVIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she's talking on the phone. She hangs up. She touches Gittes' cheek lightly. \nEVELYN I have to go. \nGittes stares at her silently. \nGITTES Where? \nEVELYN Just... I have to. \nGITTES And I want to know where. \nEVELYN (she starts out of bed) Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you. \nGITTES (stopping her) Where are you going? \nEVELYN (near tears) Please!... Trust me this much... (she kisses him lightly) I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag. \nGITTES The Albacore Club. \nEVELYN It has to do with my father. \nGITTES I know. \nEVELYN He owns it. You know? \nGITTES I saw him. \nEVELYN (sitting up straight) You saw my fa... father? When? \nGITTES This morning. \nEVELYN (panicked) You didn't tell me. \nGITTES There hasn't been a lot of time. \nShe leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe. \nEVELYN What did he say? (insistent) What did he say? \nGITTES That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do. \nEVELYN Do? To who? \nGITTES Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was. \nEvelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand. \nOf bungalow Gittes watches Evelyn, the girl and Kyo head for Kyo's black dusty sedan. \nGittes drops the curtain, heads swiftly to the phone. He dials. \nGITTES Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda. \nWALSH'S VOICE Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it? \nThe front BELL RINGS. \nGITTES I know where it is! Just do it. \nGittes hangs up and goes to the door. He opens it. No one is there. \nGITTES (not even bothering to look around the sides) Come on in, Lou. We're both too late. \nEscobar and his minions appear from either side of the door. \nGITTES Looks like she flew the coop. \nEscobar nods. \nESCOBAR I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went? \nGITTES Matter of fact I do. \nESCOBAR Where? \nGITTES Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up. \nESCOBAR What's the maid's address? \nGITTES She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you. \nESCOBAR No, Gittes, you'll show us. \nGITTES What for? \nESCOBAR If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up. \nGITTES (deliberately petulant) Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can. \nESCOBAR (shoving him toward the door) Tell us about it on the way to Pedro. \nEXT. SAN PEDRO \u0096 29TH STREET \u0096 DAY \nA steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar's unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside. \nESCOBAR That's it? \nGITTES Yeah. \nESCOBAR Well, let's go. \nGITTES Do me a favor, will you, Lou? \nEscobar waits. \nGITTES (continuing) Let me bring her down myself... she's not armed or nothing... she won't be any problem... I'd just like a minute alone with her... It would mean something... to...  her... and to me. \nEscobar shakes his head. For a moment it looks like it means no. \nESCOBAR You never learn, do you, Gittes? \nGITTES (a little chagrined) I guess not. \nESCOBAR Give you three minutes. \nGITTES Gee, thanks, Lou. \nGittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the stairs. He looks back down at Escobar. Gittes rings the bell. He waits. It opens. It's a WOMAN who's not recognizable. She's got the remnants of a black eye. \nWOMAN Yes?... \nGittes looks past her to Curly, the fisherman from the first scene. \nHe's seated at the dinner table with his father, his mother, and his children. Curly looks up in surprise. \nCURLY (happily) Mr. Gittes! Come in, come in. \nGittes enters and closes the door. Curly rises and comes over to him, greets him happily. \nCURLY Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes. \nGITTES Call me Jake. How is everything? \nCURLY Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us? \nGITTES No thanks. \nCURLY How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is... \nWIFE (coolly) Yes, I know. \nGITTES Thanks just the same, Curly. I could use a glass of water, though. Come out with me to the kitchen for a second. \nCURLY (puzzled) Sure thing. \nCROSS Yes... I think I can manage... \nCross dips into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of rimless glasses.. He puts them on, reads. \nGITTES \nStares at the bifocal lenses as Cross continues to look through the obituary column. He looks up. \nCROSS What does this mean? \nGITTES That you killed Hollis Mulwray. \nGittes is holding the bifocals with the broken lens now. \nGITTES Right here, in this pond. You drowned him...  and you left these. \nCross looks at the glasses. \nGITTES ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs. \nCROSS (finally) Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them? \nGITTES Haven't the faintest idea. \nCROSS That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city. \nGITTES And that's what you were going to do in the Valley? \nEXT. POND \u0096 CROSS AND GITTES \nCROSS (after a long moment) No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it. \nGITTES There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting. \nCROSS That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water. \nGITTES How do you do that? \nCROSS Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple. \nGittes nods. \nGITTES (then) How much are you worth? \nCROSS (shrugs, then) I have no idea. How much do you want? \nGITTES I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million? \nCROSS Oh, my, yes. \nGITTES Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford? \nCROSS (a long moment, then:) The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago. \nGITTES (with sarcasm) Who do you blame for that? Her? \nCross makes a funny little cock of his head. \nCROSS I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and right place, they're capable of anything. Take those glasses from him, will you, Claude? \nMulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses. Gittes doesn't move. \nCROSS It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's really not worth it. \nGittes hands over the glasses. \nCROSS Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn allows me to see her, or I'm not averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If I have to buy the jail. Hollis and Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen years. It's been too long, I'm too old. \nEXT. CHINATOWN STREET \u0096 NIGHT \nThe streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese in traditional dress. \nGITTES \nDriving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near a laundry truck. \nGittes sees them, keeps driving. \nCROSS (suddenly) Stop the car. Stop the car! \nMulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 CROSS \nLeaps out of the car shouting: \nCROSS Katherine! Katherine! Wait! \nGittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the pavement. \nCURLY \nStarts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him. \nGITTES No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get 'em out of here! \nHe bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it but someone else has it. \n", "test1_input": "EVELYN She's not tied up! \nGITTES You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will. \nEVELYN I am not! \nGITTES Then let's go talk to her. \nGittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming: \nEVELYN No! \nHer intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn jacket. \nHe looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them. \nEVELYN (continuing) She's too upset. \nGITTES What about? \nEVELYN Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave. \nGITTES You mean she just found out? \nEVELYN Yes. \nGITTES That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray. \nEVELYN What does it look like? \nGITTES Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell. \nEVELYN You're insane. \nGittes explodes. \nGITTES Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know. \nEVELYN You won't go to the police if I tell you? \nGITTES I will if you don't. \nA long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face. \nEVELYN She's my sister. \nEvelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes puts an arm on her shoulder. \nGITTES Take it easy... If it's your sister it's your sister... why all the secrecy? \nShe lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely puzzled. \nEVELYN (really upset) I can't... \nGITTES Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it? \nShe nods. Gittes sighs. \nEVELYN (finally) I would never ever have harmed Hollis. I loved him more than my own family. He was the most gentle, decent man imaginable... and he put up with more from me than you'll ever know... I just wanted him to be happy... \nShe begins to cry softly. \nGITTES (after a moment) I took your husband's Buick... (he opens the car door) I'll return it tomorrow. \nEVELYN Aren't you coming back with me? \nGITTES Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this. \nEVELYN ...That's not what I meant. \nThere is a long moment of silence. Gittes looks over to Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him. \nGITTES (finally) Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs. Mulwray. Good night. \nHe gets out and slams the car door. She drives off. \nINT. SHOWER \u0096 GITTES' APARTMENT \u0096 GITTES \nThe spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it. \nINT. GITTES' BEDROOM \u0096 GITTES \nPads around in elegant silk pajamas. \nHe walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert. Almost immediately the PHONE RINGS. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything. \nVOICE ON PHONE (male) Gittes?... Gittes? \nGITTES Yeah. \nVOICE ON PHONE Ida Sessions wants to see you. \nGITTES Who? \nVOICE 0N PHONE Ida Sessions, you remember Ida. \nGittes slowly rises to one elbow. \n", "test1_true": "VOICE ON PHONE Sure you do. \nGITTES Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office. \nHe hangs up, falls back down. PHONE RINGS AGAIN. AND AGAIN. Gittes swears, picks it up. \nVOICE ON PHONE 684 1/2 East Tensington. Echo Park. She begged me to call. She's waiting for you. \nBefore Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead. \nEXT. CERRITOS TOWER ROAD \u0096 HOLLYWOOD HILLS \u0096 EARLY MORNING \nGittes pulls up. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco. \nEXT. IDA SESSIONS' APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nGittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. Nothing. He opens it and enters. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nMorning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN \nClearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag. \nIce cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray. \nGittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter. \nWallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse. \nHe idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar. \nINT. BATHROOM \nGittes enters and turns on the light. \nESCOBAR Find anything interesting, Gittes? \nEscobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom. \nGittes looks at the two, doesn't reply. \nESCOBAR What are you doing here? \nGITTES Didn't you call? \nESCOBAR (jerk of his head toward the kitchen) How do you happen to know her? \nGITTES I don't. \nESCOBAR (turning toward other room) Let me show you something. \nINT. KITCHEN \nEscobar points to the number \"MU 7279\" on the side of one of the kitchen cabinets. \nESCOBAR Isn't that your number? \nGITTES Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often. \nESCOBAR Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring. \nHe indicates one of his assistants. \nESCOBAR'S ASSISTANT (a slight sneer) What happened to your nose, Gittes? Somebody slam a bedroom window on it? \nGITTES (right back, smiling) Nope, your wife got excited, crossed her legs a little too quick. You understand, pal. \nThe Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him. \nEscobar steps between the two. \nESCOBAR (to other Assistant) Loach. (Escobar pulls out a drawer) How about these? Look familiar? \nIn the open drawer are the photos of Mulwray and the girl in the park, boat, and at the El Macando on the veranda. \nGITTES (no point in denying it) Yeah, I took 'em. So what? \nESCOBAR How did she... (meaning the corpse) ...happen to have them? \nGittes takes a deep breath. \nGITTES Either you tell me or I guess 'cause I don't have the answer. \nEscobar nods. \nESCOBAR You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes? \nGITTES I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home. \nESCOBAR I want the rest of the pictures. \nGITTES What pictures? \nESCOBAR (meaning the corpse) This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray. \n", "test2_input": "GITTES Yeah? \nESCOBAR Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered. \nGITTES I heard it was an accident. \nESCOBAR C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir? \nGittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains nonplussed. \nESCOBAR You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died. \nGITTES (smiling) You accusing me of extortion? \nESCOBAR Absolutely. \nGITTES I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar. \nESCOBAR Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line. \nGITTES (smiling) Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou. \nEscobar manages a thin smile. \nESCOBAR I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum. \nGITTES Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir? \nThis is a little telling. \nGITTES (continuing) Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean. \nESCOBAR And why's that? \nGITTES He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him. \nThis stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it. \nESCOBAR What are you talking about? \nGITTES C'mon I'll show you. \nEscobar hesitates. \nGITTES (continuing) C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're in charge. \nThe men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 STORM DRAIN \nIt yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean. \nVIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk. \nGITTES (squinting in sunlight) It's too late. \nESCOBAR Too late for what? \nGITTES They only dump the water at night. \nA THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and Over to Escobar. \nESCOBAR Reach anybody? \nTHIRD ASSISTANT Yelburton, he's the new chief. \nESCOBAR I know who he is. Well? \nTHIRD ASSISTANT He says \u0096- \nGITTES I know what he says. \nESCOBAR (to Gittes) Shut up. (to Assistant) Go on. \nTHIRD ASSISTANT Yelburton says they're irrigating in the valley. There's always a little runoff when they do that. And he says is Gittes knows that, and has been going around making irresponsible accusations for the last week. \nEscobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment. \nONE OF ASSISTANTS Let's swear out a warrant for her arrest. What are we waiting for? \nGITTES (meaning Escobar) Because he just made lieutenant, and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar. \nEscobar stares hatefully at Gittes. \nESCOBAR Have your client in my office in two hours and remember. I don't have to let you go. I've got you for withholding evidence right now. \nEXT. MULWRAY HOME \u0096 DAY \nGittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's truck is there. \nGittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it. It's locked. \nHe reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock. \nThe Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at Gittes. \nGITTES Where's Mrs. Mulwray? \n", "test2_true": "Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room where luggage is packed and neatly piled. \nThe Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over the furniture. \nGITTES (indicating luggage) Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?... (no answer) on a trip?... vacation?... \nMAID No esta in casa. \nGittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to the veranda. \nEXT. MULWRAY VERANDA \u0096 GITTES \nIs unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He wanders a few yards in that direction. \nGARDENER \nSpots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles. \nGITTES \nIn turn, nods, smiles. \nGITTES Bad for glass. \nGARDENER \nBreaks into a big grin. Nods again. \nGARDENER Oh yes, bad for glass. \nHe points to the newly mown lawn. \nGARDENER (continuing) Salt water velly bad for glass. \nGITTES Can't quite believe what he's heard, \nGITTES Salt water? \nThe Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond. \nGARDENER Velly velly bad. \nGittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd looked closely, a starfish. \nCLOSE STARFISH \nIt has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just beginning to grow back. \nGITTES \nTouches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots something glinting in the bottom of the pond. \nGITTES What's that... down there? \nThe Gardener peers into the pond. \nGITTES (continuing) ...there. \nThe Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching the water. \nHe misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking through the frame where one lens is shattered. \nThe Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun. \nINT. MULWRAY HOME \nGittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table, lying on his handkerchief are the glasses. \nThe Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily watching him. \nCROSS' VOICE Hello. \nGITTES Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl. \nCROSS' VOICE You've got her? Where? \nGITTES Do you remember the figures we discussed? \nCROSS' VOICE Of course I do. Where are you? \nGITTES At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here? \nCROSS' VOICE Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well? \nGITTES Either that or she'll be in jail. \nCROSS' VOICE What are you talking about? \nGITTES Just bring your checkbook. \nGittes hangs up. \nEXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE \u0096 ADELAIDE DRIVE \nGittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the front door, pounds on it. \nThe Chinese servant answers the door. \n", "test3_input": "CHINESE SERVANT You wait. \nGITTES (short sentence in Chinese) You wait. \nGittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' arm. \nEVELYN How are you? I was calling you. \nShe looks at him, searching his face. \nGITTES Yeah? \nThey move into the living room. Gittes is looking around it. \nEVELYN Did you get some sleep? \nGITTES Sure. \nEVELYN Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something. \nGITTES (abruptly) Where's the girl? \nEVELYN Upstairs. Why? \nGITTES I want to see her. \nEVELYN ...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her? \nGittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room. \nGITTES Going somewhere? \nEVELYN Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why? \nGittes doesn't answer. He goes to the phone and dials. \nGITTES J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar \nEVELYN What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30. \nGITTES (cutting her off) You're going to miss your train! (then, into phone) Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can. \nEVELYN What did you do that for? \nGITTES (a moment, then) You know any good criminal lawyers? \nEVELYN (puzzled) No... \nGITTES Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it. \nEVELYN (evenly but with great anger) What the hell is this all about? \nGittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them. \nGITTES I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they? \nEVELYN I don't know. I mean yes, probably. \nGITTES Yes positively. That's where he was drowned... \nEVELYN What are you saying? \nGITTES There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license. \nEVELYN I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever... \nGittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself. gets up, shakes her. \nGITTES Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no? \nEVELYN ...no... \nGITTES Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister. \nEvelyn is trembling. \nEVELYN I'll tell you the truth... \nGittes smiles. \nGITTES That's good. Now what's her name? \nEVELYN Katherine. \nGITTES Katherine?... Katherine who? \nEVELYN She's my daughter. \nGittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself. \nGITTES I said the truth! \nEVELYN She's my sister. \nGittes slaps her again. \nEVELYN She's my daughter. \n", "test3_true": "EVELYN My sister. \nHe hits her again. \nEVELYN My daughter, my sister. \nHe belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing. \nGITTES I said I want the truth. \nEVELYN (almost screaming it) She's my sister and my daughter! \nKyo comes running down the stairs. \nEVELYN (continuing; in Chinese) For God's sake, Kyo, keep her upstairs, go back! \nKyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes back upstairs. \nEVELYN My father and I, understand, or is it too tough for you? \nGittes doesn't answer. \nEVELYN ...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away... \nGITTES To Mexico... \nShe nods. \nEVELYN Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know... \nGITTES ...so that's why you hate him... \nEvelyn looks slowly up at Gittes. \nEVELYN No... for turning his back on me after it happened! He couldn't face it... (weeping) I hate him. \nGittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie. \nGITTES Yeah... where are you taking her now? \nEVELYN Back to Mexico. \nGITTES You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere. \nEVELYN How about a plane? \nGITTES That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything. \nEVELYN I have to go home and get my things. \nGITTES I'll take care of it. \nEVELYN Where can we go? \nGITTES ...where does Kyo live? \nEVELYN With us. \nGITTES On his day off. Get the exact address. \nEVELYN Okay... \nShe stops suddenly. \nEVELYN Those didn't belong to Hollis. \nFor a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking about. Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his handkerchief. \nGITTES How do you know? \nEVELYN He didn't wear bifocals. \nGittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is momentarily lost in them. \nEVELYN \nFrom the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine. \nEVELYN Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart. \nKATHERINE (from the stairs) Hello. \nGITTES Rises a little shakily from the arm of the sofa. \nGITTES Hello. \nWith her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges. \nEVELYN (calling down) He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you know where that is? \nREACTION \u0096 GITTES \nHe nods slowly. \nGITTES Sure. It's Chinatown. \nTHRU WINDOW \n"}

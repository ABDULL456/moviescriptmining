{"test1_input": "CHINESE BUTLER Please. \nGittes looks behind him. The Chinese Butler is gesturing for him to follow. \nTHROUGH THE HOUSE \u0096 GITTES \nFollows him, trying to check out the rooms as he goes. A maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water. \nCHINESE BUTLER You wait, please. \nGittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles at Gittes, probes into the pond. \nThere's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes it. \nAfter a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters recede. \nEXT. POND \u0096 GITTES AND JAPANESE GARDENER \u0096 DAY \nGARDENER (to Gittes) Bad for glass. \nGITTES (not understanding) Yeah sure. Bad for glass. \nThe Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming. \nHe looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object. \nHe then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto it for poise. \nEvelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair. \nShe's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office. \nEVELYN Yes, Mr. Gittes? \nGittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn. He is annoyed as well. Nevertheless, he is elaborately polite. \nGITTES Actually, I'm here to see your husband, Mrs. Mulwray. \nHe laughs. a little nervously. He waits for a reply. There is none. \nThe Chinese Butler appears on the veranda. \nEVELYN Would you like something to drink? \nGITTES What are you having? \nEVELYN Iced tea. \nGITTES Yeah. Fine, thank you. \nChinese Butler nods, disappears \nEXT. POND AND GARDEN \u0096 MULWRAY HOUSE \u0096 DAY \nEvelyn sits at a glass-topped table. Gittes Joins her. \nEVELYN My husband's at the office. \nGITTES Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando. \nEVELYN (sharply) That's not his apartment. \nGITTES Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk. \nHe waits for a response. Then: \nGITTES (continuing; uneasily) I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke. \nEVELYN Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit. \nGITTES What? \nEVELYN I said I'll drop it. \nThe iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them. \nEVELYN (continuing; pleasantly) So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon? \nGITTES Mrs. Mulwray? \nEVELYN (as she's mixing one of the drinks) Yes, Mr. Gittes? \nGITTES I don't want to drop it. \nEvelyn looks up. Gittes smiles a little sheepishly. \nGITTES I should talk this over with your husband. \nEVELYN (a little concerned) Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man. \nGITTES Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that. \nAgain he laughs a little nervously. Again no reaction. \nGITTES (continuing) You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem. \nEVELYN (with a slight edge) What do you mean? \n", "test1_true": "EVELYN You may if you can, Mr. Gittes. \nGITTES (determined to be polite) Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere. \nEVELYN (with rising anger) Suppose they did. How does it concern you? \nGITTES Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just -- \nEVELYN It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you? \nGITTES Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning? \nEvelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her Jeans. \nEVELYN No. I went riding rather early. \nGITTES Looks like you went quite a distance. \nEVELYN No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30. \nGITTES I'll stop by. \nEVELYN Please call first. \nGittes nods. \nEXT. OAK PASS RESERVOIR \u0096 DAY \nGittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel up into the parched hills. \nTWO FIRE TRUCKS \nOne a rescue truck, are at the entrance to the reservoir. \nThe chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open and there are people milling around. The reservoir is below. \nGittes' car is stopped by a couple of UNIFORMED POLICE. \nGUARD Sorry, this is closed to the public, sir. \nGittes hesitates only a moment, then: \nGITTES (to the Guard) It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department. \nHe fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief pocket, hands it to the Guard. \nGUARD Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down. \nGittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well. \nGittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently dredging for something. \nOne of the men turns and sees Gittes. He recognizes Gittes and is visibly shocked. \nLOACH Gittes, for Chrissakes. \nGITTES Loach. \nLOACH (moving to Gittes, taking him by the arm) C'mon, get out of here before -- \nEXT. RESERVOIR \u0096 DAY \nLoach tries to ease him down the path. \nGITTES Before what? What the hell's going on? \nAt the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties, LUIS ESCOBAR. \nBoth Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy. \nLoach is actually sweating. Finally, Escobar smiles. \nESCOBAR Hello, Jake. \nGITTES (without smiling) How are you, Lou? \nESCOBAR I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine. \nGITTES Summer colds are the worst. \nESCOBAR Yeah, they are. \nGittes reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case. \nA FIREMAN No smoking, sir. It's a fire hazard this time of year. \nESCOBAR I think we can make an exception. I'll see he's careful with the matches. \nGITTES (lighting up) Thanks, Lou. \nESCOBAR How'd you get past the guards? \nGITTES Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little. \nEscobar nods. They walk a couple of steps. The other police, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them. \nESCOBAR You've done well by yourself. \n", "test1_id": 2238, "test2_input": "GITTES Yeah? \nESCOBAR Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered. \nGITTES I heard it was an accident. \nESCOBAR C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir? \nGittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains nonplussed. \nESCOBAR You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died. \nGITTES (smiling) You accusing me of extortion? \nESCOBAR Absolutely. \nGITTES I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar. \nESCOBAR Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line. \nGITTES (smiling) Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou. \nEscobar manages a thin smile. \nESCOBAR I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum. \nGITTES Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir? \nThis is a little telling. \nGITTES (continuing) Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean. \nESCOBAR And why's that? \nGITTES He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him. \nThis stops Escobar. He's dumbfounded by it. \nESCOBAR What are you talking about? \nGITTES C'mon I'll show you. \nEscobar hesitates. \nGITTES (continuing) C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're in charge. \nThe men around Escobar look to him. Escobar grudgingly nods. \nCLOSE SHOT \u0096 STORM DRAIN \nIt yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean. \nVIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk. \nGITTES (squinting in sunlight) It's too late. \nESCOBAR Too late for what? \nGITTES They only dump the water at night. \nA THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and Over to Escobar. \nESCOBAR Reach anybody? \nTHIRD ASSISTANT Yelburton, he's the new chief. \nESCOBAR I know who he is. Well? \nTHIRD ASSISTANT He says \u0096- \nGITTES I know what he says. \nESCOBAR (to Gittes) Shut up. (to Assistant) Go on. \nTHIRD ASSISTANT Yelburton says they're irrigating in the valley. There's always a little runoff when they do that. And he says is Gittes knows that, and has been going around making irresponsible accusations for the last week. \nEscobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment. \nONE OF ASSISTANTS Let's swear out a warrant for her arrest. What are we waiting for? \nGITTES (meaning Escobar) Because he just made lieutenant, and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar. \nEscobar stares hatefully at Gittes. \nESCOBAR Have your client in my office in two hours and remember. I don't have to let you go. I've got you for withholding evidence right now. \nEXT. MULWRAY HOME \u0096 DAY \nGittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. He looks in the garage. Evelyn's car is gone. Only the Gardener's truck is there. \nGittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. He rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it. It's locked. \nHe reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock. \nThe Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at Gittes. \nGITTES Where's Mrs. Mulwray? \n", "test2_true": "Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room where luggage is packed and neatly piled. \nThe Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over the furniture. \nGITTES (indicating luggage) Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?... (no answer) on a trip?... vacation?... \nMAID No esta in casa. \nGittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to the veranda. \nEXT. MULWRAY VERANDA \u0096 GITTES \nIs unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He wanders a few yards in that direction. \nGARDENER \nSpots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles. \nGITTES \nIn turn, nods, smiles. \nGITTES Bad for glass. \nGARDENER \nBreaks into a big grin. Nods again. \nGARDENER Oh yes, bad for glass. \nHe points to the newly mown lawn. \nGARDENER (continuing) Salt water velly bad for glass. \nGITTES Can't quite believe what he's heard, \nGITTES Salt water? \nThe Gardener nods vigorously. Points to the pond. \nGARDENER Velly velly bad. \nGittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd looked closely, a starfish. \nCLOSE STARFISH \nIt has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just beginning to grow back. \nGITTES \nTouches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots something glinting in the bottom of the pond. \nGITTES What's that... down there? \nThe Gardener peers into the pond. \nGITTES (continuing) ...there. \nThe Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching the water. \nHe misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking through the frame where one lens is shattered. \nThe Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun. \nINT. MULWRAY HOME \nGittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table, lying on his handkerchief are the glasses. \nThe Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily watching him. \nCROSS' VOICE Hello. \nGITTES Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl. \nCROSS' VOICE You've got her? Where? \nGITTES Do you remember the figures we discussed? \nCROSS' VOICE Of course I do. Where are you? \nGITTES At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here? \nCROSS' VOICE Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well? \nGITTES Either that or she'll be in jail. \nCROSS' VOICE What are you talking about? \nGITTES Just bring your checkbook. \nGittes hangs up. \nEXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE \u0096 ADELAIDE DRIVE \nGittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick. He hurries to the front door, pounds on it. \nThe Chinese servant answers the door. \n", "test2_id": 2239, "test3_input": "CHINESE SERVANT You wait. \nGITTES (short sentence in Chinese) You wait. \nGittes pushes past him. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door. She takes Gittes' arm. \nEVELYN How are you? I was calling you. \nShe looks at him, searching his face. \nGITTES Yeah? \nThey move into the living room. Gittes is looking around it. \nEVELYN Did you get some sleep? \nGITTES Sure. \nEVELYN Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something. \nGITTES (abruptly) Where's the girl? \nEVELYN Upstairs. Why? \nGITTES I want to see her. \nEVELYN ...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her? \nGittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room. \nGITTES Going somewhere? \nEVELYN Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why? \nGittes doesn't answer. He goes to the phone and dials. \nGITTES J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar \nEVELYN What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30. \nGITTES (cutting her off) You're going to miss your train! (then, into phone) Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can. \nEVELYN What did you do that for? \nGITTES (a moment, then) You know any good criminal lawyers? \nEVELYN (puzzled) No... \nGITTES Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it. \nEVELYN (evenly but with great anger) What the hell is this all about? \nGittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them. \nGITTES I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they? \nEVELYN I don't know. I mean yes, probably. \nGITTES Yes positively. That's where he was drowned... \nEVELYN What are you saying? \nGITTES There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license. \nEVELYN I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever... \nGittes has been in a state of near frenzy himself. gets up, shakes her. \nGITTES Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no? \nEVELYN ...no... \nGITTES Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister. \nEvelyn is trembling. \nEVELYN I'll tell you the truth... \nGittes smiles. \nGITTES That's good. Now what's her name? \nEVELYN Katherine. \nGITTES Katherine?... Katherine who? \nEVELYN She's my daughter. \nGittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when Evelyn says this it explodes. He hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself. \nGITTES I said the truth! \nEVELYN She's my sister. \nGittes slaps her again. \nEVELYN She's my daughter. \n", "test3_true": "EVELYN My sister. \nHe hits her again. \nEVELYN My daughter, my sister. \nHe belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing. \nGITTES I said I want the truth. \nEVELYN (almost screaming it) She's my sister and my daughter! \nKyo comes running down the stairs. \nEVELYN (continuing; in Chinese) For God's sake, Kyo, keep her upstairs, go back! \nKyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes back upstairs. \nEVELYN My father and I, understand, or is it too tough for you? \nGittes doesn't answer. \nEVELYN ...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away... \nGITTES To Mexico... \nShe nods. \nEVELYN Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know... \nGITTES ...so that's why you hate him... \nEvelyn looks slowly up at Gittes. \nEVELYN No... for turning his back on me after it happened! He couldn't face it... (weeping) I hate him. \nGittes suddenly feels the need to loosen his tie. \nGITTES Yeah... where are you taking her now? \nEVELYN Back to Mexico. \nGITTES You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere. \nEVELYN How about a plane? \nGITTES That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything. \nEVELYN I have to go home and get my things. \nGITTES I'll take care of it. \nEVELYN Where can we go? \nGITTES ...where does Kyo live? \nEVELYN With us. \nGITTES On his day off. Get the exact address. \nEVELYN Okay... \nShe stops suddenly. \nEVELYN Those didn't belong to Hollis. \nFor a moment Gittes doesn't know what she's talking about. Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his handkerchief. \nGITTES How do you know? \nEVELYN He didn't wear bifocals. \nGittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is momentarily lost in them. \nEVELYN \nFrom the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine. \nEVELYN Say hello to Mr. Gittes, sweetheart. \nKATHERINE (from the stairs) Hello. \nGITTES Rises a little shakily from the arm of the sofa. \nGITTES Hello. \nWith her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges. \nEVELYN (calling down) He lives at 1712 Alameda... do you know where that is? \nREACTION \u0096 GITTES \nHe nods slowly. \nGITTES Sure. It's Chinatown. \nTHRU WINDOW \n", "test3_id": 2240}

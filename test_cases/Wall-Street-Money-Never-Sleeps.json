Why are you with me? Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it for a moment, then... \nWINNIE Repetition compulsion. \nJACOB Huh? \nWINNIE It's Freud. \nJACOB And what does it mean, psych major? \nWINNIE Well, it's when people repeat the same dysfunctional relationships from childhood in their adult life in hopes of trying to master them. \nJACOB Like when children of alcoholics fall in love with alcoholics. \nWINNIE Yeah.

Gordon laughs with a shake of the head. \nGORDON GEKKO I've been asked that before... \n(AND THEN) They took a hundred, twenty two thousand, six hundred and forty hours from me... for a goddamn victimless crime. All the while I sit in my 8 by 12 and watch real crooks by the thousands give out mortgages like candy, package them into unexplainable derivatives and spit the cancer out into the world.

Nobody. \n(BEAT) You better believe I'm going to get mine. \nJACOB You're not going to miss America? \nGORDON GEKKO I'll always have America... it's why I'm here. I'm buying the island. \n(BEAT) I know it's kitschy but it's fun and good for business. Looking over the water... \nGORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) I have a lot business abroad now.

She doesn't want it... we don't want it. \n(BEAT) Because it's not about what you have... it's about what you do. And Gordon -- it's never about the money. Gordon shakes his head. \nGORDON GEKKO That sounds good. I bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow. But Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism kills every trade. \n(BEAT) Winnie will realize that at some point... and then we'll be fine. And Jacob finally looks away... in pity. \nGORDON GEKKO (CONT'D) See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall for is actually thinking we can fight what's inherent, what's inevitable... that we can somehow undo what genetics, or God, or whatever name you wanna tag it, has placed deep inside of us. Because whether it's greed or revenge or the compulsion to chase... it all amounts to the same thing... loss of control.

Gordon just looks at him. \nJACOB (CONT'D) But they're all lemmings. Simple psychology. You once said every crash should have a JP Morgan to step in and save it. \n(BEAT) Well Gordon -- this is your chance to be JP Morgan. And now Gordon shakes his head... \nGORDON GEKKO We're far from the bottom. It'll be a dead cat bounce. \nJACOB It'll buy us time. That's all I'm asking for... time. \n(BEAT) Time for the new administration to put their plan into action. \nGORDON GEKKO What do I get in return? \nAs Gordon turns... takes in the city of Dubai... in all of its ridiculous splendor... \nJACOB Full clemency. \nGORDON GEKKO You can offer that? \nJACOB Your daughter can. She works with the new Secretary of Treasury now. Considering that... \nGORDON GEKKO What else? \nJACOB Winnie. Me. Your grandson. Something money can't buy... a family. And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it all to register, then... \nGORDON GEKKO Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I cannot make. And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore behind... \nGORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) You wanna know what the mother of all bubbles was? Us. The human race. Scientists call it the Cambrian Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna. \nAND RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie waiting for him... \nGORDON GEKKO (V.O.)

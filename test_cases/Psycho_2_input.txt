NORMAN My mother. 
Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him. 
NORMAN She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone. 
ARBOGAST (after a pause) If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you? 
NORMAN Of course not. 
ARBOGAST If she paid you well? 
NORMAN Now, look...! 
ARBOGAST Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you? 
NORMAN I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women! 
ARBOGAST I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry. 
NORMAN (disturbed now) That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But... (a rueful smile) She didn't fool my mother. 
ARBOGAST Your mother met her? (quickly) Can I talk to your mother? 
NORMAN No. I told you, she's confined... 
ARBOGAST Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss. 
ARBOGAST Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb... 
NORMAN No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think... 
ARBOGAST All right! (starts away, toward his car, pauses) Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I? 
Norman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch. 
Norman stands, watching him drive away. 
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT) 
The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA PULLS AWAY and we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT) 
Arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and dial this number. As we reach phone booth, 
CUT TO: 
ARBOGAST (into phone) Miss Crane, please. (listens) She leave a number? (listens) Thanks. (hangs up, dials again, waits) Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast. (waits) Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it might make you feel a little better. Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday night at Bates'  Motel, out here on the old highway. (listens) Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent the night, left, period! (listens) I did question him, believe me. I think I got all there was to get. Just have to try to pick up the scent from here. (listens) Well... maybe that's because I don't feel entirely satisfied.  He's got a sick old mother, confined type, and I think she saw Mary and talked to her. Shame, too... confined old women love to talk to strangers. (listens) I was, but I think I'll go back to the motel, first. (listens) No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis. I should be back in an hour. (listens) All right. And Lila... You'll be happy to know what I think. I think our friend Sam Loomis didn't even know Mary was here. (smiles) See you in an hour. Or less. 
He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT) 
A distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office. We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. Into the foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office. 
EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT) 
Arbogast goes in. 
INT. OFFICE - (NIGHT) 
Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls. 
ARBOGAST Bates! 
He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees: 
C.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER 
C.U. - ARBOGAST

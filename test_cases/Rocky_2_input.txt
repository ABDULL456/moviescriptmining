GAZZO It don't matter.  It's my reputation.  These guys think they can get off light.  It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business.  See ya killer. 
Gazzo gets into his car. 
GAZZO (to Bodyguard) ... The Rock's a good kid. 
BODYGUARD (emotionless) ... A meatbag. 
They pull away. 
EXT. GYM - DAY 
Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind and mentally defective. 
RUDY ...See the fight last night? 
RUDY Nah, I was fightin' myself. 
RUDY Apollo Creed beat the bum to pieces. 
EXT./INT. GYM - DAY 
Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance. 
Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS. 
The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other. 
As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to wave and yell greetings. 
FIGHTER #1 Hey, hear ya knocked Spider Rice out in the sixth? 
ROCKY The third -- Shoulda seen it. 
Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag. 
FIGHTER #2 (removes glove) Hey, Rock, touch my hand. 
ROCKY How come? 
FIGHTER #2 C'mon, it's important. 
Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand. 
FIGHTER #2 (continuing) Can ya tell I just whacked-off? 
Rocky smiles and moves away. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that reads, "NO KISSING." 
Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails. He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers. Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation. 
After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes. 
ROCKY (mumbling) ... These ain't my clothes. 
He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside of the door. 
ROCKY (continuing) ... These ain't my pictures. 
A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is MIKE. 
ROCKY Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here? 
MIKE It ain't your locker no more. 
ROCKY Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more? 
MIKE Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there. 
Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up. 
FIGHTER ...Hey, Peanut, gimme some soap, Man. 
MIKE (irate) Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you, Nobody -- You don't call me Peanut. 
FIGHTER Peanut, gimme some soap.

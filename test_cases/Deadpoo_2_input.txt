DEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY gets up as if standing up out of an easy chair... 
DEADPOOL On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop... 
He PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN... 
8   INT. ESCALADE - MORNING                                               8 
THROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE.     SMASH! 
There are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORM of GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the face as he raises his arms in greeting. 
DEADPOOL ¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. There's no easy way to say this. I'm pregnant, Trevor. (ALT:) Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither. 
BOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS. FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING. 
From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE. 
A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man's NECK. The other man stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool's face into the seat's premium trim. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Rich... Corinthian... Leather. 
Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW. 
The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V. Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Scuse, por favor! 
The DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool's head into the console repeatedly. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ow.   Ow.   Ow. Ow. Ow. 
Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in the PASSENGER SEAT. 
He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy's ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy's HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP. 
Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD and BANGS his FOREHEAD into: 
The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver's forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION CHANGES: 
MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL ('SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!'). One more SMACK to get us back to MARIACHI. 
Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back CRAWL up the tailgate. 
Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER. 
Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
We're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass. 
The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD. 
Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man SCREAMS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Loved your work in Daredevil. 
Deadpool stuffs the lighter INTO the man's mouth and CLAMPS his hand over it.

The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path. 
The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN. 
Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into... 
...a ROLL.    The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY. 
Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW... 
The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike. 
Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING. 
Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass. BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB tied to MOBY DICK. 
The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES. 
The camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down. 
HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING: 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shit.   Did I leave the stove on? 
We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The guy's ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame. 
The RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN.

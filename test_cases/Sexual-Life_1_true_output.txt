LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
No, this is right.  This is exactly right. 
CUT TO 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
A few notches up from a greasy spoon.  Lorna sits at the counter, stirring her coffee.  A WAITRESS approaches. 
LORNA Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used to hang next to the pies? 
The Waitress looks over her shoulder. 
WAITRESS What sign? 
LORNA The one that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life." 
WAITRESS That thing?  We got rid of it. 
LORNA Oh. 
WAITRESS Have you decided? 
Before Lorna can speak, we hear-- 
WOMAN She'll have the steak and egg special. 
Lorna turns as TERRI, her roommate, joins her at the counter. A little older than Lorna, Terri is cute but a little dangerous. 
TERRI Look at her, she needs protein.  Lots of protein. 
LORNA (to the Waitress) 
White toast.  Dry. 
The Waitress leaves. 
LORNA Working early today, huh? 
TERRI No, I had something important to do... 
Terri opens her bag and pulls out a small, gift-wrapped box. 
TERRI ...Miss nineteen. 
LORNA I knew you'd remember. 
Terri gives Lorna a kiss on the lips. 
TERRI Of course I remembered.  Go on, open it. 
LORNA No, no.  I wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight.  And that's when I'll open it. 
TERRI You better like it.  I don't want to tell what I had to do to pay for it. 
LORNA Ooh.  It must be good. 
TERRI So what's the plan, Stan?  Something special today?  Other than splurging on toast. 
LORNA Yes.  There is something. 
TERRI Good.  Count me in. 
LORNA No.  Something big.  Something I've been thinking about for a long time. 
Terri sighs -- she knows exactly where this is going. 
LORNA I can't do this forever, Terri.  Look... 
Lorna points to the corner of her eye. 
LORNA Crow's feet!  I'm nineteen!  Crow's feet!  I know I keep talking about it, but this time I'm going to do it.  In fact, I did it. This is my last day. 
TERRI Okay... 
LORNA I called them.  I told them I was out. 
TERRI You did not. 
LORNA Uh-huh.  I have one more appointment.  Then, I'm...free. 
TERRI Give me your cell phone.  I'm calling them back right now. 
Lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on the counter.

The fire sensor. 
Judy pulls her gun, FIRES, hitting a ceiling sensor at the end of the corridor. Blast doors SLAM, sealing out most of the spiders. 
DON-CLOSE. Impressed. 
BLAST DOORS-CLOSE. Metal teeth begin tearing through the steel. 
Our group has made it to the door to the docking bay. They rush in, the Robot coming through the open doorway last and holding there. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY 
Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening. 
The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the spiders as they come down the hall, blowing them away. More pour through the now rending blast doors. There are just too many, rolling towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death. 
SMITH 
Open, damn you. 
WEST 
It's cycling a vacuum check. There is no way to speed up the protocols. 
SMITH 
Fools. I warned you not to come aboard this cursed craft. You've killed us. You've killed us all. 
Judy throws him, hard, into the wall. 
JUDY 
Shut up. 
WEST 
Now that's a bedside manner. 
The first spiders reach the Robot, leaping onto its metal bull. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Maureen and Penny are at the Com, powering up the engines. Will is within the holograph, fighting off the spiders. 
WILL 
Charge. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY 
The Robot's shell electrifies, the spiders recoiling. 
The airlock has opened enough for our heroes to duck inside. 
JOHN 
Will, get the Robot in here. 
The Robot stands in the open portal, covered by spiders, their fangs shredding his hull, his electrical charge beginning to SHORT. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
Will is throwing off the monsters, Extending the Robot's antenna spikes and scanner dishes to skewer spiders that are squeezing by. 
WILL 
I can't move him without letting the spiders into the ship. 
INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY 
JOHN 
Leave him behind. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
WILL 
I'm sorry, Robot. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-DOCKING BAY 
A spider pushes past the Robot, head slipping around his metallic body, bent on reaching the airlock and the crew within. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK 
JOHN 
Seal it. Now! 
Don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon. 
SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision. 
THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the airlock. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
The inner airlock door Opens. The crew tumble in. 
JOHN 
Get us out of here. 
Don is already powering up the ship's engines as Smith tries separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey. 
SMITH 
Get this cloying gargoyle off of me. 
He throws the beast hard across the bridge. The creature hits the wall, SCREECHING, begins racing across consoles. 
John has strapped in beside Don. 
JOHN 
Get me an external view. 
A MONITOR shows the hull of the Jupiter Two. More spiders are leaping onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull. 
JOHN 
Prepare to disengage. 
THE LIZARD MONKEY skitters up the back of Penny's chair, over her head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap. 
PENNY 
Get it off me. Get it off. 
Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature on her lap begins a perfect imitation of Penny. 
Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the ship is now entirely covered with spiders. 
WEST 
Initiating separation. 
LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its head in Penny's chest. A beat. Then Penny hugs the tiny beast. 
PENNY 
It's okay. Everything's going to be alright. 
But she sounds anything but sure. 
WEST 
We're clear. Everybody hang on.

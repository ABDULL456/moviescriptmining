INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
Buggin' Out sticks his head in and yells: 
BUGGIN' OUT Sal, we're gonna boycott ya fat ass. 
Before Sal and his two sons can answer, Buggin' Out is gone. 
EXT: STREET--DAY 
Buggin' Out has one foot up on a fire hydrant and tries to clean his soiled Air Jordan. 
ANGLE--JADE AND MOOKIE 
Jade and Mookie walk up to Buggin' Out. 
BUGGIN' OUT It's so nice to see a family hanging out together. 
MOOKIE We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work. 
JADE That's not even true.  I just want a slice. 
BUGGIN' OUT Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. 
JADE What did he do this time? 
BUGGIN' OUT Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame? 
JADE So? 
BUGGIN' OUT Have you noticed something about them? 
JADE No. 
MOOKIE (interjects) Yo, I'm gone. 
JADE I'll see ya there. 
BUGGIN' OUT Peace. 
Mookie leaves. 
BUGGIN' OUT Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian. 
JADE And? 
BUGGIN' OUT And I--we--want some Black people up. 
JADE Did you ask Sal? 
BUGGIN' OUT Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall. 
Jade looks at Buggin' Out like "Are you serious?" 
JADE Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way. 
BUGGIN' OUT So, in other words, you are not down. 
JADE I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause. 
BUGGIN' OUT Jade, I still love you. 
JADE I still love you too. 
INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY 
SAL Mookie, you are pushing it.  You're really pushing it.  I'm not paying you good money to fucking jerk me around. 
Mookie has nothing to say. 
SAL You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys. 
PINO 'Bout time, Pop.

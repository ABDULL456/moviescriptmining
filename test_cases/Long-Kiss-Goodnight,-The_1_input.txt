INT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY 
An old, walrus-mustached IRISHMAN ushers them down a concrete hallway. The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers: 
WALRUS MAN The elder Trelawney rented to her in '87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself to dispose of her things. I'faith, she's welcome to whatsoe'er she wishes, for ne'er has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye, divil take me if I'm lyin'. 
Henessey lights a cigarette, says: 
HENESSEY Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me Lucky Charms." 
ANGUS "Always after me Lucky Charms." 
HENESSEY Thanks. Just needed to hear that. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Drab, musty. Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm implements... Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner. 
HENESSEY See anything you recognize? 
SAMANTHA Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look. (sighs) I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little on edge. 
She pauses. Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in her eye... says softly: 
SAMANTHA I can feel her. Like a ghost. (beat) We could walk away, you know. There's still time, we could just... leave her dead. 
She hefts a SUITCASE onto a bench. OPENS it -- Draws a sharp breath: 
SAMANTHA Ay-i-yi! 
Clothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest, the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags: 
SAMANTHA Size four, no way. You know how long it's been since I could wear a size four? (beat) Can't be mine. Can they...? 
She checks the case for INITIALS -- C.E.B. Who...? 
Henessey grunts. In his book, well dressed is clean underwear. Holds up a small manila envelope. 
HENESSEY Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a guy. 
SAMANTHA What's in it? 
HENESSEY Another guy's address. Two addresses, is basically what I'm saying. 
Meanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase... A SHAPE. She feels it. At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam looks like she just took a stomach punch. 
Up until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything. She plunks the clothing back in place. Hides it. 
HENESSEY Anything else in there? 
SAMANTHA Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes. 
HENESSEY Yeah, well take a look at this. 
He holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*. Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's CHECK. Written to him, earlier that day... identical handwriting. CUT TO: 
INT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON 
NATHAN WINDEMAN is in a bad mood. A frail-looking man, mid- seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE watches TV nearby. In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself. Windeman scowls: 
NATHAN Alice, please...? 
Alice stares at him. Uncomprehending. 
NATHAN Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite are mutually exclusive. 
ALICE What's wrong with the dog? 
NATHAN It's simple. He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. I submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and I should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. *Wouldn't you agree*? 
Theatrical? Nah. The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats feet for the door. THE PHONE RINGS. Nathan snatches it up: 
NATHAN Hello? 
The voice is soft. Controlled: 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd like to speak with you. 
NATHAN Who... who is this? 
SAMANTHA You tell me, Mr. Windeman. 
Nathan pales. Blinks once. Twice. Manages: 
NATHAN ...Charly...? 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) My full name, please. 
NATHAN God, it really is you...!? Chapter, they think you're dead, *everyone* thinks --

{"train": "... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her fingernail. A drop of blood appears. \nPLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to disperse. \nHelicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away... \nKACLANG! \nOut of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere. The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers - rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK... \nSUPERIMPOSE: \"L.A. FRIDAY 1900 HOURS\" \nEXT. CONTAINMENT WALL - FIREBASE SEVEN - L.A. - NIGHT \nSearchlights sweep down across a column of policemen marching past a concrete wall. Camera begins to crane up the wall. Sound of roaring turbines. The howl of the Santa Ana wind. \nCamera reaches the top of the wall. Armed police troops stand on the battlements. Across what looks like an ocean is L.A. The view is from the Newhall Pass. \nHidden by the Santa Monica Mountains, L.A. glows in the distance with a hundred fires. Smoke surges from the jagged horizon. Above, the sky is an angry orange. \nANOTHER ANGLE - TOP OF THE WALL \nRes sensor lights glow in evenly spaced intervals. Searchlights sweep into the darkness. Cannons are in place every 200 feet, manned by police guards. \nEXT. SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT \nWater stretches into blackness. This was once the San Fernando Valley, but now it's all underwater. Pieces of debris - tops of buildings, the tail of an airplane, a radio tower - stick up above the surface. We can make out the letters of an old, half-sunken sign: \"SAN FERNANDO VALLEY MALL\" \nEXT. THE WALL - NIGHT \nThe wall stretches to the northwest up to the Santa Susanna Pass. Portions of the 118 Freeway arch up out of the water. \nEXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - BEHIND THE WALL - NIGHT \nFirebase Seven is a fortified base camp in the San Gabriel Mountains. It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles, troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main complex is Rotor City - row after row of black, multi-bladed, totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on the ground. \nA throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and cheering, their fists in the air. Cops with camcorders videotape the event. A police anchor reports... \nPOLICE ANCHOR He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the excitement around here is... (a great roaring skyward) Here he comes! \nA MASSIVE 7-ROTORED, 40-BLADED HELICOPTER TRANSPORT comes slamming down out of the black sky and lands. The growing crowd of cheering cops goes nuts like fans at a football game. They slap hands, dance wildly. \nINT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nA mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing holographic map of L.A. fills one wall. Most of the control personnel have left their work stations and gather around TV sets all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of Rotor City. \nA tall, steel-faced officer sits at his desk. This is Firebase Commander MAC \"BIG DOG\" MALLOY. Hard, battle weary features. BRAZEN, a section Lieutenant, comes up. \nBRAZEN Commander Malloy. They're bringing him out, sir. \nMalloy rises from his chair, steps to a nearby TV set, watches the scene from the Police Channel. \nMALLOY So we finally got him. \nEXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT \nThe crowd of cops is growing to a frenzy of wild anticipation. \nPOLICE ANCHOR Hold one! The door is opening! \nThe door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes... \nSNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing him. \nPOLICE ANCHOR Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A. \nCelebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to... \nA SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER \nThe bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the bunker entrance. \nThe deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps, thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers, the prisoners of a massive cultural war. \nAs Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares out: \nPOLICE VOICE (V.O.) You are now entering the Deportation Center. You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America. \nMALLOY An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to Washington. \nThe 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes... \nINT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER \nFrom the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on top. In the other, a machine gun. \nUTOPIA (to the camcorder) To the American people - it is time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror. \nMALLOY At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out. \nInside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation. \nINT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY \nPlissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera. She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage. \nUTOPIA Today is Day One of a brand new world. The days of the empire are finished. (beat) To the President - my father, you know what this is. \nShe holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it at the camcorder. \nUTOPIA You know what it will do. Unless you abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you. \nCONGRESSMAN Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If something should happen - \nUTOPIA It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover. \nShe says \"lover\" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can muster. The others are shocked. \nUTOPIA Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man I've ever known. I'm on my way to his arms. \nShe moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small hatch in the floor, scrambles down... \nWHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in front of him. \nMALLOY Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how. \nBRAZEN Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time. (hits a button) Somebody else was in there with her. \nAN IMAGE APPEARS \nIn front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around him. \nMALLOY Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A. \nCuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome, charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's on a loop. The image disappears. \nThe lights in the cell come up. \nBRAZEN Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences, then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in. \nPLISSKEN Sad story. You got a cigarette? \nMALLOY Shut up, Plissken. \nPLISSKEN What's the little black box do? \nMALLOY Top secret. Only on a need to know. \nPLISSKEN And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood. \nMALLOY That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back. \nPLISSKEN So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free? \nMALLOY That's the deal. \nPLISSKEN Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A. \nAfter a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and Brazen. He stares at Plissken for a moment, holds up some papers. \n3RD MAN If you bring out the prototype, you'll receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States. Just like in '97. Remember New York, Plissken? \nPLISSKEN (looks at him) Who are you? \nMALLOY It's the President, for Christ's sake! \nEXT. POLICE COMPLEX - NIGHT \nPlissken suits up. Submachine gun, handguns, six-guns. He, Brazen and Malloy walk quickly across the complex. \nMALLOY L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule. \nBRAZEN Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south. \nMALLOY Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre. \nEXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT \nAs Brazen's command helicopter takes off... \nINT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nPlissken stares at a photo of the anodized prototype. \nPLISSKEN I'll need to know more about this thing. \nMALLOY Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon. \nPLISSKEN Defense against what? \nMALLOY There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know? \nPlissken shrugs. \nMALLOY Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States. \nPLISSKEN So what does this thing do? \nMALLOY All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m. \nEXT. WALL - ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT \nThe Command helicopter lands near a large access tunnel inside the containment wall. \nINT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT \nPlissken, Brazen and Malloy walk through the dark, dank tunnel. Armed guards stand at the ready. A hatch in the tunnel floor stands open. A ladder disappears down into the darkness. \nMALLOY (points to the open hatch) You're going over by submarine. One-man submersible. Nuclear powered. \nPlissken arranges his gear, climbs into the hatch opening. \nPLISSKEN Where do I put ashore? \nMALLOY Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there. (beat) Once you go inside, you're on your own. (beat) You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you? (beat) We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason. \nPLISSKEN So you want me to take her out? (Malloy nods) Is that an order from the President? \nMALLOY Let's just say it's what's best for the country. \nPLISSKEN By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin? \nMALLOY A medical team will be standing by. \nPLISSKEN Not you? \nMALLOY No. \nPLISSKEN Good. \nKABLAMM! He fires, ripping hellish blasts at Malloy. There's no damage. Malloy laughs. \nMALLOY Thought you might try that. First clip is filled with blanks. Goodbye, Plissken. \nMalloy kicks the hatch and it slams down on top of Plissken. Brazen pushes a control button, sealing it shut. \nINT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT \nPlissken climbs down the ladder into a small submarine bay. Below him on a launching rig is a sleek, black one-man submarine shaped like a dart. The submarine's hatch is open. Plissken climbs inside. \nINT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT \nPlissken seals the hatch behind him. He has to lie flat on his stomach to operate the sub. He quickly hits various switches and buttons, powering up the cockpit. \nINT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM \nThey watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the freeway. \nINT. SUBMARINE \nPlissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%. \nEXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nThe sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads: \"SPEED LIMIT 55\". The sub screams past. \nINT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM \nBrazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status. \nBRAZEN His reactor's starting to overheat. \nMALLOY Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. \nINT. SUBMARINE \nPlissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green, moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%. \nMALLOY (V.O.) Plissken...? \nPlissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT \nThe sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object. \nKING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the Universal Studios Tour. \nThe sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future, passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean. It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a million pieces. \nThe sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls - hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One. \nINT. SUBMARINE \nPlissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit through tiny cracks in the hull. \nEXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT \nThe sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface. \nEXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT \nThe sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside with a hard thump. \nINT. SUBMARINE \nPlissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide backwards down toward the water. \nINT. SUBMARINE \nPlissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing. \nA bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the antenna. \nMALLOY (V.O.) Plissken...? \nPLISSKEN I'm here. \nMALLOY (V.O.) Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens. \nPLISSKEN It's history. I gotta go. \nPlissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the hillside when... \nWHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying something huge and rounded at the ends. \nPlissken raises his submachine gun... \n... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit. Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder. Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV. \nPIPELINE Too bad about your boat, man. (Plissken doesn't move) Supposed to be some swells out here tonight. Big ones. (beat) You like to surf? \nAND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops. \nSPINAL Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken. \nPlissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the rain... \nSPINAL Hey, what's going down, Snake? \nPLISSKEN I'm looking for somebody. \nSPINAL Who ain't? \nPlissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of the Bowl. \nSPINAL Say, is it true what they say about Cleveland, man? \nPlissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain... \nSPINAL Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can always shift down and mojo with us anytime. \nEXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT \nThe ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the distance, the sound of thumping music. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT \nPandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, \"Love is Like An Itchin' In My Heart.\" Crowds dance in the street. It's like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic. Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads: \"SAFE SEX\", \"NO CONDOMS NEEDED\", \"POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES\", \"SATISFACTION GUARANTEED\" \nOne of the hookers struts in front of Plissken. \nCLOSEUP - THE HOOKER \nOpening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises. \nHIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD \n... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through, cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches... \nThe caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard. \nPlissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least none that we can see. \nBLONDE HOOKER It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and I do some celebrating? \nPLISSKEN What's going on? \nBLONDE HOOKER You must be new around here. (beat) You look familiar. Have I done you before? \nPlissken grabs the hooker. \nPLISSKEN What's happening? \nBLONDE HOOKER Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang. Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man 'round here tonight. (whispers) He's gonna take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass. \nPlissken lets her go, stares... \nHIS POV - A CADILLAC \n... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels. Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of light and flicking them back into the night... \nBehind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa. \nPlissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's moved off... \nSeveral motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes, Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of the cycle, jumps on. \nON THE MOTORCYCLE \nThe Mescalito biker turns to react... \nWHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the bike, hops up on the seat. \nKAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan... \nEXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT \nAs the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the corner. \nHe looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie. After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm handguns, slipping them into their holsters. \nEXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT \nOn the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant clangs. \nPlissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then Plissken glances at his wrist watch. \nCLOSE - WRIST WATCH \nThree hours gone. \nPlissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset... \nVOICE (V.O.) Snake Plissken, right? \nHe spins around. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE \nSits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Wow! Snake Plissken! \nMap To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio, rises, walks over to Plissken. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'? \nPLISSKEN Where'd they go? \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake. \nHe searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I've been hearing about you ever since that New York deal back in the 90's. You're one smooth operator. (offers pen and paper) Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's Head, one to Slasher Smith...? \nPlissken grabs him by the throat. \nPLISSKEN Where are they? \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings. \nPlissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's forehead. \nPLISSKEN Location. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know. \nPlissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Nice little gizmo you got there. (whispers conspiratorially) Look, Snake. I've got connections in this town. You need something, I'm your man. \nWithout a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard toward Beverly Hills. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't walk through Beverly Hills. \nPlissken's figure disappears... \nEXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT \nThe old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red letters: \"QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT\" \nPlissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark Sunset Boulevard. \nEXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT \nPlissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now they are dark, ruined. \nCLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION \nAs a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie... \nSENTRY (into walkie) Specimen moving west on Sunset. \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT \nPlissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive. The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his right. He stops, stares down Sunset... \nPlissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and footfalls of the patients gets closer... \nPENDEJO BOB Those damn patients are coming back. You'd better climb aboard. \nPlissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction. \nINT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT \nThe golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle. \nPENDEJO BOB I use the eye and the music to scare em off. They're so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch of em right off the edge there a few months ago. \nHe points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the passage. \nTASLIMA (she peers over the side) How far down does it go? \nPENDEJO BOB Don't know - never do hear em land. Earthquake opened it up. \nThe golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel... \nINSIDE THE TUNNEL \nGuards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up ahead is a door marked: \"SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL\" \nINT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered with dust and grime. \nFilling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children, all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked everywhere. \nThe golf cart comes to a stop and they get off. \nPENDEJO BOB I own this whole place. Used to work here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit. What a mess. We were waist high in shit. (turns proudly to them) Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought my whole family, my amigos, down here to live with me. \nTASLIMA Gun runners. \nPENDEJO BOB Hey, it's a living, baby. \nPLISSKEN Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil? (looks at Taslima) Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay? \nTASLIMA I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave. \nPENDEJO BOB Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place, Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man. \nPendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to Plissken. \nPENDEJO BOB Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours. \nPLISSKEN Yeah. So how do I get to Venice? \nPENDEJO BOB All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there. \nHe leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other, carrying crates of weapons. \nPENDEJO BOB Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn left. \nPendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the ladder, followed by Taslima... \nPENDEJO BOB Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss. You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all. \nEXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT \nPlissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate. Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night. \nTaslima points to a freeway on-ramp. \nTASLIMA The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I don't think it's such a good idea. \nPlissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move. \nTASLIMA The freeways are dangerous. \nHe keeps walking. \nTASLIMA Goodbye, Snake. \nPlissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as close to 'thank you' as he gets. \nUTOPIA You said I could hold it. \nHe yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected. Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken. \nUTOPIA Who's that? \nCUERVO JONES You never heard of Snake Plissken? \nUtopia takes a couple steps closer, squints. \nUTOPIA He doesn't look like his picture. (frown) I bet he's fake. \nCUERVO JONES Now go get dressed. We have things to do. \nUTOPIA Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved. \nCuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia. \nUTOPIA Ooww! \nCUERVO JONES Go on now. Do as I say. \nPlissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal. \nCUERVO JONES I'm going to show her what it means to be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life. (smiles) Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs love. \nHe moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close. \nCUERVO JONES You want to hook up with us? Join the revolution? We're all getting out of here tomorrow night. (holds up the prototype) We're gonna rule the world. Come with us, Snake. \nPlissken says nothing. His good eye glares. \nCUERVO JONES No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish it later. So guess what? It's later. \nHe motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away... \nINT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT \nThe baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken is hurled in. The door slams shut. \nPlissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado. \nDELGADO You're mine now, Snake. All mine. \nDelgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone. \nPLISSKEN Shit. \nPlissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor... \nDelgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet. Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA- CLANG! \nDelgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the machetes CLANKS to the floor... \nPlissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises... \nWHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws... \nTHUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at it in horror, then crumbles to the floor. \nEXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT \nThe caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal. \nAbove, on top of the terminal, see a figure move. \nTOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL \nIt's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the side... \nPARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD \nStands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it. \nBeat. Beat. \nWHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the ground, takes his rifle. \nBall boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) (sound of effect of breaking glass) Shot clock! \nThe Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! \"I Love L.A.\" begins playing on the loudspeaker. \nThe players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players, JAMAAL, notices Plissken. \nJAMAAL Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland. \nThe other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand, thumping chests, high-fiving each other. \nJAMAAL Welcome aboard, Snake. \nBut Plissken pays no attention. He sees: \nCUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA \nSitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the court. \nCLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA \nSit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face. Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has a firm grip on the prototype. \nCUERVO JONES The time is now. We are the strongest. If we go together, the others will come. (beat) We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go together. What do you say? \nXi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands... \nPLISSKEN \nRealizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good, cold eye. \nPLISSKEN Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking it out in trade. I need a favor... \nJAMAAL Sure, Snake. Anything. \nPLISSKEN I need to get across the court now... without drawing attention to myself. \nJAMAAL Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's kick some butt! \nThe players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken. \nJAMAAL (whispers) You play much pick-up ball, Snake? \nPlissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end. \nJAMAAL Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, man. \nThe referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the ball. The game is underway. \nPlissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover. They go into a set play. \nThe game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full combat. \nThe Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him flat. No foul. \nUtopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones. \nUTOPIA It's that weird guy again. \nCuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit... \nPlissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands! \nJAMAAL Snake! Shot clock! \nTHE SHOT CLOCK \nTicks down: 4 - 3 - 2... \nA whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly... \nPlissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn sounds just as it leaves his hand... \nTHE BASKET \nSwish. Nothing but net. \nCUERVO JONES No! \nPlissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly. Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a hot dog stand. \nON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR \nPlissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her, and she fights him tooth and nail... \nUTOPIA Lemme go...! \nINSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR \nThe driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb, slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber. \nPLISSKEN AND UTOPIA \nAre thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood... and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop, as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the caravan suddenly puts on its brakes. \nScreaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic collision... \nCuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac. \nPlissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole in the street, pries it up... \nMescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges into the street, pointing at Plissken... \nCUERVO JONES Kill him, kill him...! \nPlissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot lead... \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT \nPlissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them... \nEXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE \nCuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the Forum... \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (grins to himself) Good thinkin', Snake. \nHe heads off down the street... \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL \nPlissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy drain away from the main tunnel... \nINT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT \nThe black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move along, slow as they come to... \nTHE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF \nOne side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our journey with Pendejo Bob. \nPlissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop- off, his eye burning into her... \nHer feet reach the very edge. \nPlissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror. She gulps air in staccato bursts... \nBeat. Beat. \nPlissken can't do it. He can't push her off. \nHe releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims... \nUTOPIA My... father sent you... didn't he? (beat) He sent you to kill me... \nPlissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights. \nUTOPIA Didn't he? (begins to cry) \nBut Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway. \nPLISSKEN Shit. \nPlissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares at her. \nCuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously, across the face. \nUtopia reacts to the stinging slap. \nUTOPIA Cuervo...? \nCUERVO JONES You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight. \nUTOPIA I tried... \nCUERVO JONES (in her face) Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you. (screams) Understand? (shakes her) Understand? \nUTOPIA Yes... \nHe shoves her down the tunnel... \nCUERVO JONES Let's go. \nThe others follow them... \nEXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT \nAs Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the sound of hundreds of helicopters rise. \nCUERVO JONES (looks up) Look, baby. They're all mine. \nPOV - THE SKY \nAbove Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way southeast, toward Orange County. \nEXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT \nLooking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign, and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city. \nANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY \nThey're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building - the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk, furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space. \nEXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT \nPandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares: \nPOLICE VOICE (V.O.) Full stage battle alert. All personnel to battle stations. \nINT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nMalloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert. \nMALLOY A sky full of enemy choppers on radar. Moving over the city to the southeast. \nA COM Officer rushes up to Malloy... \nCOM OFFICER Commander - massive vehicle and troop movement on the ground. All major streets leading to the southeast. \nPRESIDENT What're they doing? \nMalloy looks at the President grimly. \nMALLOY Getting ready to invade. \nPRESIDENT (beat) So where's Plissken? \nDARKNESS \nCreaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air... \nA huge blue eye opens. Looks around. \nDARKNESS \nPlissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh... \nDARKNESS \nAnd then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness. \nPlissken's eye blinks. \nPIPELINE You feel those pre-shocks, Snake? \nPipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm. \nPIPELINE Could be a big one comin' any minute now... \nPLISSKEN Where's... Cuervo Jones...? \nPIPELINE Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake. \nPLISSKEN Where? \nPIPELINE Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man. \nA thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand... \nPLISSKEN Take me there... \nBut he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his knees. Pipeline stares at him. \nPIPELINE You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help. (bends down, helps Plissken to his feet) You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up. \nPLISSKEN Who? \nPIPELINE Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way. \nPipeline points down the canyon to the east. \nPIPELINE She's connected with the Black Cowboys, and they don't take shit from nobody... \nSuddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly. \nPIPELINE Yo', man. It's a big one. \nAnd the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground. \nSkyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake. Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in. \nThunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls. \nAnd then suddenly it all stops. \nThe booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them continues to slosh about violently. \nPIPELINE Tsunami, Snake. \nHis eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to Plissken. \nPIPELINE Surf's up big time. \nNow there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on its way... \nPipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands. \nPIPELINE Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda ride. \nPlissken looks behind him... \nPOV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI \nIs blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a thunderclap. \nPlissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over to Pipeline, kneels down... \nPIPELINE Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get on your board till it peaks. \nBehind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for them. \nPIPELINE Don't lose it, man. You slip off your board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know what I mean? \nThe roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25 feet... It rolls up right behind them... \nPIPELINE Hang on, Snake! (yells) YAAAAAAA!!!! \nTHE FRONT EDGE \nOf the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they disappear under the blackness... \nCLOSE ON A TV SCREEN \nCuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera, holds the prototype in his hands. \nCUERVO JONES Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I'm arriving in style. \nPULL BACK from the TV screen to reveal we are in... \nINT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT \nMalloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens. \nBRAZEN He must be bouncing the signal from one of our communications satellites. \nPRESIDENT That means CableNet has already picked it up. This thing's going live all over the country. \nCUERVO JONES (on the TV) It's a brand new day comin' up this morning, and I'm just so proud to be leading the parade. See you soon, putos. \nSSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static. \nA grim silence. \nMALLOY The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President. (the President nods grimly) Shall I begin evacuation? \nPRESIDENT Does he know how to activate it? \nMALLOY Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button. \nBRAZEN What about Plissken? He could still be - \nPRESIDENT Forget him. He's dead. \nMALLOY That may not be true, Mr. President. (beat) He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead so many times I can't count. But he never stays down. \nA long beat. \nMALLOY There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait for Plissken, or surrender. It's your decision. \nThe President sighs heavily. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT \nJammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the Big One. \nThe van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship. \nINT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT \nThe glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship. \nINT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT \nThey walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable dirt. \nINT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThey enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There is light in the room beyond. \nINT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT \nPlissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool. A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over everything. \nAt the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns. \nMojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us. \nPlissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'? \nThe woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice. \nSPINAL (eyes brightening) Hershe - it's Snake Plissken. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you. \nPlissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the transvestite. \nPLISSKEN Yeah. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Me too? \nPLISSKEN (stares at him hard) We'll see. \nHERSHE Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff? \nSPINAL I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money. \nPLISSKEN The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars. \nSPINAL Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them. \nPLISSKEN Uh-uh. Bluebacks. \nThis gets everyone's attention. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Aw, come on, Snake. \nPLISSKEN Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God. \nHERSHE I don't know, sounds thin to me. \nPLISSKEN You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world? \nHERSHE (grim) No, that sucks. (beat) How are we getting out? \nPLISSKEN I don't know yet. \nSPINAL Shit. \nHERSHE You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us. \nSmoke has begun to drift into the pool area. \nMOJO DELLASANDRO (a soft voice) Use the air. \nThey look at him. \nMOJO DELLASANDRO They're burning. Santa Anas. The night wind. \nSPINAL What're you talking about, Mojo? \nMOJO DELLASANDRO Death from above... \nEXT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT \nPlissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire. \nThey look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro brings him back down to the decking. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I don't know about this thing. \nPLISSKEN Don't like it, don't come. \nSPINAL Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack? \nHERSHE My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy? \nAs Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small, metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I got an idea, Snake. (shows Plissken the radio) This looks like the prototype, right? \nPLISSKEN Yeah, kinda. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo. \nPLISSKEN If he lets you get close enough. \nHERSHE The wind's up. Let's go. \nThe men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he wants to die. \nHershe looks over at Plissken and grins. \nHERSHE See you in hell, Snake. \nSuddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes Cuervo Jones and Utopia. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it! Wait for me... \nKAWHUMP! \nMap To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food restaurant - KACRUNCH! \nA beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey Cuervo... \nCuervo Jones turns to Bivouac. \nCUERVO JONES Would you please kill him for me? \nBIVOUAC My pleasure. \nBivouac raises his machine gun... \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to be an attack. \nCuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map To The Stars Eddie races over... \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken. \nCUERVO JONES You told me he was dead. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I thought he was, but he came back. \nCUERVO JONES Where? \nMap To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath, looking like he may faint... \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Oh Cuervo... \nCUERVO JONES (long beat) What? \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (stalling) It's so good to see you again. \nCUERVO JONES Where's Plissken? \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE He's... near. \nCUERVO JONES You're stalling, Eddie. (grabs him) Talk, you little gringo! \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (eyes wide) Cuervo, look out behind you! \nMap To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him, and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand. At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded. \nCuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches. \nCUERVO JONES You've lied to me for the very last time. \nCuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The Stars Eddie's face... \nKABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street. \nWHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys dive right down across Main Street. \nKABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover. \nSpinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it... \nBLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere! \nCuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead helicopter when... \nPlissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo, Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap. \nSERIES OF FAST CUTS: \nChaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping hellfire from his automatic rifle. \nPeople running. Explosions. \nMap To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia. \nThe helicopter moves fast now - faster - \nLOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS \nAs they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a foot - \nCuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper... \nTHE LEAD HELICOPTER \nAs it lifts - five feet - climbing... \nThe helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's sprinting figure. \nPOV THROUGH WINDSCREEN \nSee the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans out the door. \nHERSHE We're not gonna make it over the fuckin' mountain! \nThe helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15 feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8 feet... 5... \nThe helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound, and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging half off the ship! \nOn the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off... \nEXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT \nAn alarm horn sounds. Everyone is on the move. \nINT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT \nA crowd surrounds a computer screen with a small green blip moving over a grid of L.A. \nCOM OFFICER Aircraft leaving the island, sir. It's passed into restricted space, heading this way. \nMalloy, the President, and Brazen exchange glances. \nPRESIDENT Is it Plissken? \nNobody knows. \nCOM OFFICER Commander, I'm getting radio contact with the aircraft. \nMALLOY Boost it. \nThe COM Officer flips a switch, and we hear Plissken's voice booming through HQ. \nPLISSKEN (V.O.) Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in. \nPRESIDENT Thank God. \nMALLOY (grabs a radio mike) Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype? \nINT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nPLISSKEN (into his radio) Yeah, I got it. \nPlissken glances at the transistor radio in his hand, shoves it in his boot, reaches his hand out to Map To The Stars Eddie. \nPLISSKE (to Map To The Stars Eddie) Now give me the real one. \nUtopia stares into Plissken's eye. \nMap To The Stars Eddie shrugs innocently \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't have it. \nSuddenly Utopia reaches into Map To The Stars Eddie's coat and pulls out the real prototype. She hands it to Plissken \nUTOPIA Now we're even, Snake. \nMap To The Stars Eddie makes a lunge for it, but Plissken whacks him in the face. His head bobs slowly back and forth for a moment, then he slumps in the seat. \nINT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT \nMalloy set up in the staging area for landing. \nPlissken rips out the grappling hook... \nAS BOOM! \nMap To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the water below. \nPlissken jumps back inside the cockpit. \nUTOPIA Snake, look. \nPOV THROUGH WINDSCREEN \nPolice battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms. Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water. \nIt is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the wall. \nEXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT \nMalloy, the President, Brazen and the rest the Firebase watch as Plissken's helicopter approaches, then zooms right over Rotor City and heads for the distant treeline. \nPRESIDENT Where the hell is he going? \nEXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT \nPlissken's helicopter comes in, lower and lower, into a hover five feet above the ground. Inside, Plissken pulls in all the power he's got. \nPLISSKEN It's taking all the power we've got to hover. \nCLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE \nShows 100% plus power. The helicopter is in a trembling hover. Inside... \nPLISSKEN Jump out. Head for the treeline and disappear. \nUtopia stares at him. \nPLISSKEN Go! \nUtopia jumps out of the helicopter... lands on the ground and takes off running into the darkness. Inside... \nPLISSKEN All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me. We're gonna land. \nPlissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll. Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades snap off... \nFROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE \nLooking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen, barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into the cockpit, engulfing Plissken... \nOutside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire. Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball. \nPlissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded... \n... as Malloy, the President, Brazen, and a squad of police arrive in vehicles. They slowly get out... \n... as Plissken limps toward them... \nPLISSKEN Where's the anti-toxin...? \nPRESIDENT Give me the prototype. \nPlissken reaches into his boot, hands it to the President. \nMALLOY Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real one. \nPlissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To The Stars Eddie's transistor radio. The President hurls the real prototype away, walks to Plissken and grabs the phony. Plissken glances at it lying on the ground. \nNobody moves. Plissken looks at their faces. \nPLISSKEN Give me the goddamn shot! \nSuddenly everyone begins to smirk. A couple cops laugh. \nMALLOY It was all a fake, Plissken. \nPlissken stares at him. More laughter. \nBRAZEN You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you. \n", "test1_input": "ESCAPE FROM L.A. \nScreenplay by John Carpenter \nDARKNESS \nA pounding, metallic beat begins.

DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES SKYLINE - DAY \nA hot summer's day. Heat ripples distorts the towering shadowing buildings in the dense smog. \nFEMALE NARRATOR An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter scale hits at 12:59 p.m., August 23rd, in the year 2000. \nSuddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion you have ever heard. The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly. The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding, slamming freight train of an earthquake. The 4-level Interchange as the Santa Monica Freeway shatters, crumbles, pulling exit ramps, cars, trees, and nearby buildings with it. \nSEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS \nBuildings shaking. Streets buckling. Cars rolling, crashing. People running. Gas mains exploding.

DARK OCEAN - NIGHT \nTRAVELING SHOT low, across the top of the water's surface. Climb up the side of a massive, rusted supertanker, abandoned, years ago. Break over the railing to reveal a gigantic neon sign which screams \"NEW LAS VEGAS.\" The supertanker has been transformed into a floating resort. \nThe camera increases speed, moves past huge billboards displaying gigantic glitzy ads: \n\"NUCLEAR NIGHTS IN HAVANA\" - an extravaganza with fabulous showgirls and laser recreations of Fidel's final night. \n\"MUSEUM OF NIGHT CLUB ARTS\" - a virtual reality tour featuring legendary Vegas entertainers. \n\"FREE ENTERPRISE WORLD\" - a virtual Disneyland for the whole family. \nNow camera flies low through glittering streets and back alleyways filled with gamblers, neon and glitz. \nEXT. ALLEY - NEW LAS VEGAS, 2013 - NIGHT \nAn alley strangled with tourists, gamblers, hookers, hustlers, and con men - professional expatriates from the West mingling with excited visitors from all over the world. \nSUPERIMPOSE: \"NEW LAS VEGAS OFF THE COAST OF SEATTLE THURSDAY 0330 HOURS G.M.T. \" \nA Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money, placing bets. \nTwo men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat. Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters. \nThe other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it. \nThe crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a dozen languages. \nThe salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in front of the two men. Then he leans over to... \nA VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom into the first glass. \nHe pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally, he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third glass. \nNow the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses on the table between the two men. \nThe two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from one end. \nThe salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger, sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead. \nThe fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then gulps it down. \nThe crowd explodes. More bets. \nThe salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a man with an eye-patch. \nThe man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars. \nOne glass left. The two men stare at it intently. \nThe salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally stopping on the fat man. \nThe salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison. His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws his hand. \nThe crowd reacts, boos, as... \nThe man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off. \nThe two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters. \nFlashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty, trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day... \nThe draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls face first into the alley, dead. \nThe crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the money... \nSNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism. The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend. \nPLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him... \nCLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM \n", "test1_id": 2916, "test2_input": "The crowd gumbles. \nPLISSKEN \nTurns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck. With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto his tongue, closes his mouth. \nThe doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward Plissken. \nTHE DOCTOR What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame you only have one. \nA nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good eye from its socket with his scalpel tips. \nFFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart! \nWHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls forward. \nThe scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut! \nPlissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off the step-ladder. \nWHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time as the doctor hits the pavement. \nThe patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly. \nSnake starts to run... \nTASLIMA Snake, help me. \nSNAKE Why? \nTASLIMA I don't know. \nAlmost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima follows him. \nPlissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees Taslima following... \nPLISSKEN Don't follow me. \nTASLIMA You need help. \nPLISSKEN Like hell I do. \nThen Plissken comes to a dead stop. \nHIS POV - DOWN THE STREET \nComes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken, pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone street... \nEXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT \nPlissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives chase. They stop at another small alley between two large buildings. \nTASLIMA Down this way. \nThey disappear into the small alley. \nEXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT \nIt's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75 foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire. \nPLISSKEN This is a dead end. (looks at her) You took us into a dead end! \nTASLIMA I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace. \nKACLANK! They turn... \nThe doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow... \nPlissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window. \nPLISSKEN Go! \nHe follows Taslima through the window. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT \nPlissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters - \"CAA\" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place. \n", "test2_true": "TASLIMA Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings. \nPLISSKEN The what? \nPlissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw dagger toward Plissken's good eye. \nTaslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two men. \nPLISSKEN (yelling) Are you gonna stand there? Give me the gun! \nTaslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away. \nPlissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway... \nINT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT \nThey come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door. \nPLISSKEN How do we get out of here? \nTASLIMA Sewers. Come on. \nShe pushes open the door... \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT \nPlissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit. \nTaslima stops at a sewer grate in the street. \nTASLIMA Down there. \nPlissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by Plissken... \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT \nDim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down... \nSuddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping back down the tunnel. \nFROM DOWN THE TUNNEL \nAn eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment. \nTASLIMA Snake - what is it? \nPLISSKEN How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city. \nSlowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye - floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a blasting, ringing sound. Music! \nIt's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC! \nFrom out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart. \nOn a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat is hooked to his belt. \nHe pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He holds the gun on them. \nRemoving his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like Los Lobos' lead guitarist. \nPENDEJO BOB What're you doing in here? \nPLISSKEN Looking to get out. \nPENDEJO BOB Good. I want you out. This is my sewer. \nPLISSKEN Which way? \nWith a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken. Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight. With it, he examines Plissken's face. \nPENDEJO BOB You're Snake Plissken. \nTASLIMA Yes. Isn't he cool? \nThere is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished. Pendejo Bob extends his hand. \nPENDEJO BOB An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me Pendejo Bob. \n", "test2_id": 2917, "test3_input": "And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hop in, Snake! \nTHE UNDERGROWTH \nAs the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke. \nDELGADO \nTakes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH! \nA GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME \nShoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves around a corner... \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nMap To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs into the front seat. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost burned your ass off! \nMap To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks. Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally, the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows down to a cruise of 70. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you. \nPLISSKEN Delgado? \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time. \nEXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old junked cars out of the way. \nINT. CADILLAC - NIGHT \nPlissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear. \nPLISSKEN Stop the damn car. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE No way. \nPLISSKEN I said pull over. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE All right. Anything for you, Snake. (beat) Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place. \nPlissken lowers the gun. \nPLISSKEN Where is it? \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Right over there. \nHe points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a button on the steering wheel with his finger. \nON THE DASHBOARD \nA small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two- inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat. \nPLISSKEN \nGrits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air. \nMap To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel closes up over the barrel. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He lets me use it sometimes. (looks at Plissken) Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot with a fun-gun. You feel it? \nPlissken gulps for air. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker. \nPlissken slumps back, collapses in the seat. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you down to one inch from death, that is living, man. \nPLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG \nKicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated streets of Venice. \n", "test3_true": "MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE You should've talked to me first, Snake. I could've set this whole thing up. I'm actually Cuervo's agent, you know. \nAs Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's voice begins to fade... \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE And I'd love to represent you, too. We could make a bundle together. I know I could really help your career...I mean, you're a legend and all - but the last couple years, man, it's like you've fallen off the face of the earth. \nON PLISSKEN'S FACE \nAs the world crashes to black! \nFADE IN: \nEXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL LAX - NIGHT \nLike a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac. \nBEHIND IT \nSurrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading: \"MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL\" \nPLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE \nOpens. Looks around fuzzily. \nINT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT \nHe is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by Mescalitos. \nIn one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment. Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards from Carefree, Arizona. \nCuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie scurries along at his side. \nMAP TO THE STARS EDDIE Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised. \nCUERVO JONES We'll see. \nCuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake. Holds out a glass filled with red liquid. \nCUERVO JONES Carrot juice? (no response) Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you. No? (no response) Your health. \nCuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head, grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air. \nCUERVO JONES You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts real bad. (beat) That's good. \nHe kneels down next to Plissken. \nCUERVO JONES Dying isn't good enough for you. You need pain. You'll never make it to where you want to go without a little pain. \nHe stands, considers Plissken for a moment. \nCUERVO JONES Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So typical of American idealism. The old west, Snake. \nCuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken. \nCUERVO JONES Man against the sky. The individual. Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake. You remind them of what they used to be. \nCuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly, illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are being fed and cared for by Mescalitos. \nCUERVO JONES Here is the real L.A., Snake. \nPlissken lifts his head to see. \nCUERVO JONES The poor. The old. The lost. People without hope. \nHe crosses back to Plissken... \nCUERVO JONES Do you know what they want? One word. Liberation. (beat) They want a chance to live - before it's all gone. They've been hated for too long (smiles) Now it's their turn. \nHe gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully unlocking him from the treadmill. \nStill wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet... \nAs Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still carries the prototype with her. \nUTOPIA Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best Actress. \nCuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds on to it. \n", "test3_id": 2918}

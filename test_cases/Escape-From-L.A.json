{"test1_input": "... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her fingernail. A drop of blood appears. \nPLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to disperse. \nHelicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away... \nKACLANG! \nOut of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere. The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers - rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK... \nSUPERIMPOSE: \"L.A. FRIDAY 1900 HOURS\" \nEXT. CONTAINMENT WALL - FIREBASE SEVEN - L.A. - NIGHT \nSearchlights sweep down across a column of policemen marching past a concrete wall. Camera begins to crane up the wall. Sound of roaring turbines. The howl of the Santa Ana wind. \nCamera reaches the top of the wall. Armed police troops stand on the battlements. Across what looks like an ocean is L.A. The view is from the Newhall Pass. \nHidden by the Santa Monica Mountains, L.A. glows in the distance with a hundred fires. Smoke surges from the jagged horizon. Above, the sky is an angry orange. \nANOTHER ANGLE - TOP OF THE WALL \nRes sensor lights glow in evenly spaced intervals. Searchlights sweep into the darkness. Cannons are in place every 200 feet, manned by police guards. \nEXT. SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT \nWater stretches into blackness. This was once the San Fernando Valley, but now it's all underwater. Pieces of debris - tops of buildings, the tail of an airplane, a radio tower - stick up above the surface. We can make out the letters of an old, half-sunken sign: \"SAN FERNANDO VALLEY MALL\" \nEXT. THE WALL - NIGHT \nThe wall stretches to the northwest up to the Santa Susanna Pass. Portions of the 118 Freeway arch up out of the water. \nEXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - BEHIND THE WALL - NIGHT \nFirebase Seven is a fortified base camp in the San Gabriel Mountains. It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles, troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main complex is Rotor City - row after row of black, multi-bladed, totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on the ground. \nA throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and cheering, their fists in the air. Cops with camcorders videotape the event. A police anchor reports... \nPOLICE ANCHOR He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the excitement around here is... (a great roaring skyward) Here he comes! \nA MASSIVE 7-ROTORED, 40-BLADED HELICOPTER TRANSPORT comes slamming down out of the black sky and lands. The growing crowd of cheering cops goes nuts like fans at a football game. They slap hands, dance wildly. \nINT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nA mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing holographic map of L.A. fills one wall. Most of the control personnel have left their work stations and gather around TV sets all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of Rotor City. \nA tall, steel-faced officer sits at his desk. This is Firebase Commander MAC \"BIG DOG\" MALLOY. Hard, battle weary features. BRAZEN, a section Lieutenant, comes up. \nBRAZEN Commander Malloy. They're bringing him out, sir. \nMalloy rises from his chair, steps to a nearby TV set, watches the scene from the Police Channel. \nMALLOY So we finally got him. \nEXT. ROTOR CITY - NIGHT \nThe crowd of cops is growing to a frenzy of wild anticipation. \nPOLICE ANCHOR Hold one! The door is opening! \nThe door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes... \nSNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing him. \nPOLICE ANCHOR Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A. \nCelebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to... \nA SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER \nThe bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the bunker entrance. \nThe deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps, thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers, the prisoners of a massive cultural war. \nAs Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares out: \nPOLICE VOICE (V.O.) You are now entering the Deportation Center. You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America. \n", "test1_true": "POLICE ANCHOR S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts. Youngest man ever decorated by the President. \nPlissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank. \nINT. SODIUM VAPOR CORRIDOR - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT \nA glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation Center. \nPOLICE ANCHOR You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes, Plissken. The murder of an Internal Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank president. Gun fighting for profit. The list goes on and on... \nINT. CONCRETE HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT \nDeeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the dark, low concrete passageway. \nPOLICE ANCHOR You used to respect the law. Served your country like no man before you. Role model to a generation. \nThe Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's face. \nPOLICE ANCHOR What happened to you, war hero? You were the best we had. \nSTEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT \nSteel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded message... \nPOLICE VOICE (V.O.) You are sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond the borders of the U.S. You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises. If you elect this option, notify the Cleric Sergeant in your Processing Area. \nPlissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into futuristic electric chairs. \nPOLICE ANCHOR The whole world's watching. Every good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules. What would say to them? \nPlissken's expression is blank. \nPOLICE ANCHOR What would you say to all of us who believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right over wrong, good over evil? Be my guest. What do you have to say, Plissken? \nPLISSKEN (beat) Call me Snake. \nThe guards move Plissken through a doorway, and the huge steel doors slam shut on the Police Anchor and the camcorders. \nINT. CORRIDOR - PROCESSING AREA - NIGHT \nMalloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move urgently along a corridor. \nBRAZEN ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve. \nMALLOY Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man. \nBRAZEN Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive. \n3RD MAN Let's get this over with. \nINT. CONCRETE CELL - NIGHT \nThe cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg irons. He looks around. \nIn the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks up the watch, examines it. \nThe cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the room unarmed. The door closes. \nMalloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd Man stays back in the shadows by the door. \nMALLOY How you doin' Plissken? (no reply) You like the watch? \nPLISSKEN You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want? \nMalloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows... \n3RD MAN Get to it. \nMalloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall... \nINT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA \nFrom the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge. Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty, virginal, she wears a \"True Love Waits\" button on her flowered dress. \nMALLOY At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab. The President's daughter, Utopia, was among them. \nPlissken continues to watch the image on the wall... \n", "test1_id": 2916, "test2_input": "The crowd gumbles. \nPLISSKEN \nTurns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck. With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto his tongue, closes his mouth. \nThe doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward Plissken. \nTHE DOCTOR What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame you only have one. \nA nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good eye from its socket with his scalpel tips. \nFFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart! \nWHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls forward. \nThe scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut! \nPlissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off the step-ladder. \nWHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time as the doctor hits the pavement. \nThe patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly. \nSnake starts to run... \nTASLIMA Snake, help me. \nSNAKE Why? \nTASLIMA I don't know. \nAlmost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima follows him. \nPlissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees Taslima following... \nPLISSKEN Don't follow me. \nTASLIMA You need help. \nPLISSKEN Like hell I do. \nThen Plissken comes to a dead stop. \nHIS POV - DOWN THE STREET \nComes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken, pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone street... \nEXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT \nPlissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives chase. They stop at another small alley between two large buildings. \nTASLIMA Down this way. \nThey disappear into the small alley. \nEXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT \nIt's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75 foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire. \nPLISSKEN This is a dead end. (looks at her) You took us into a dead end! \nTASLIMA I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace. \nKACLANK! They turn... \nThe doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow... \nPlissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window. \nPLISSKEN Go! \nHe follows Taslima through the window. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT \nPlissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters - \"CAA\" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place. \n", "test2_true": "TASLIMA Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings. \nPLISSKEN The what? \nPlissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw dagger toward Plissken's good eye. \nTaslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two men. \nPLISSKEN (yelling) Are you gonna stand there? Give me the gun! \nTaslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away. \nPlissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway... \nINT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT \nThey come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door. \nPLISSKEN How do we get out of here? \nTASLIMA Sewers. Come on. \nShe pushes open the door... \nEXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT \nPlissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit. \nTaslima stops at a sewer grate in the street. \nTASLIMA Down there. \nPlissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by Plissken... \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT \nDim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down... \nSuddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping back down the tunnel. \nFROM DOWN THE TUNNEL \nAn eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment. \nTASLIMA Snake - what is it? \nPLISSKEN How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city. \nSlowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye - floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a blasting, ringing sound. Music! \nIt's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC! \nFrom out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart. \nOn a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat is hooked to his belt. \nHe pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He holds the gun on them. \nRemoving his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like Los Lobos' lead guitarist. \nPENDEJO BOB What're you doing in here? \nPLISSKEN Looking to get out. \nPENDEJO BOB Good. I want you out. This is my sewer. \nPLISSKEN Which way? \nWith a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken. Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight. With it, he examines Plissken's face. \nPENDEJO BOB You're Snake Plissken. \nTASLIMA Yes. Isn't he cool? \nThere is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished. Pendejo Bob extends his hand. \nPENDEJO BOB An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me Pendejo Bob. \n", "test2_id": 2917, "test3_input": "CUERVO JONES No! \nPlissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.

The Cadillac careens off the street, slams into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a hot dog stand. \nON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR \nPlissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her, and she fights him tooth and nail... \nUTOPIA Lemme go...! \nINSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR \nThe driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb, slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber. \nPLISSKEN AND UTOPIA \nAre thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood... and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop, as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the caravan suddenly puts on its brakes. \nScreaming tires.

The street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot lead... \nINT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT \nPlissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them... \nEXT.

SEWER TUNNEL \nPlissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy drain away from the main tunnel... \nINT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT \nThe black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move along, slow as they come to... \nTHE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF \nOne side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our journey with Pendejo Bob. \nPlissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop- off, his eye burning into her... \nHer feet reach the very edge. \nPlissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror. She gulps air in staccato bursts... \nBeat. Beat. \nPlissken can't do it. He can't push her off. \nHe releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims... \nUTOPIA My... father sent you... didn't he? (beat) He sent you to kill me... \nPlissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights. \nUTOPIA Didn't he? (begins to cry) \nBut Plissken can't. He can't kill her.

He stares at her. \n", "test3_true": "Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid. \nPLISSKEN I said go! \nSlowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken.

He spins, drops the prototype... \n... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the sewer tunnel.

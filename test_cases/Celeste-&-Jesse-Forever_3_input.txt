Jesse looks uncomfortable. 
JESSE That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way. 
SKILLZ Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her. 
JESSE Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up. 
SKILLZ Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle. 
JESSE Huh? 
SKILLZ Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit. 
JESSE It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody. 
They reach the front of the line. 
YOGURT GIRL Do you know what you want? 
JESSE Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please. 
SKILLZ (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here. 
YOGURT GIRL Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together. 
JESSE Well...we're separated. 
YOGURT GIRL Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go. 
14 INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON 14 
Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to take in a Cindy Sherman photo. 
BETH It's so...grotesque. 
CELESTE But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way. 
BETH Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings. 
Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien Hirst collage. 
BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) I need to say this and then I'll never bring it up again. I'm sorry I wigged on you guys the other night but I don't know what you're doing. I think it's stupid that you're not together. You are best friends and that's the hard part. Nothing else matters. 
Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then: 
CELESTE Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend. 
BETH Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly. 
CELESTE Jesse is fine. 
BETH Can I show you something? 
CELESTE Sure. 
Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art. 
BETH Okay. Look. 
She points to her neck. 
CELESTE What am I looking at? 
BETH It's a hair. On my NECK. 
CELESTE Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck? 
BETH I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it. 
CELESTE Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip. 
BETH Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine. 
CELESTE Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake. 
BETH I should, at least before my wedding, right? 
CELESTE What is wrong with you?

PEBBLES                         BAM-BAM ... Wanna recite something?     Nah, what are we, little 'Inky Dinky Spidersaurus...'?   kids? How 'bout magic tricks? We could cut up a newspaper -- PEBBLES But then we'd need a hammer             BAM-BAM and chisel... oh, what about    That dumb thing?   You that thing with Dino?           think so...? Pebbles turns, the decision made. 
PEBBLES Okay. We're gonna sing a song with Dino. Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a straw hat and a cane. Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows it -- PEBBLES A one-and-a-two and-a -- 122   WIDER                                                           122

C)   And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all slide down the rope for a big finish.

Panting for breath, Pebbles, Bam-Bam and Dino wait for a reaction. BETTY (to Wilma, impressed) Well? Think they're ready for the talent show? WILMA I think they're ready for Rock Vegas. As they laugh and hug the kids and Dino, we -- CUT TO: 124   EXT. LODGE HALL - THAT NIGHT                                    124

Fred looks around, sees Barney approaching, having just left a group of angry Buffalo. 
FRED Barn -- w-what's going on? BARNEY They're mad at you, Fred... it's understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today -- Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.

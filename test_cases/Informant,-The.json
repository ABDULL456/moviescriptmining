{"test1_input": "70 INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO Pull back to reveal Herndon and Shepard presenting their prized tape to ROBIN MANN ESQ, early 40's-- humorless and contrary. The tape plays... \nROBIN MANN What did he say-- I can't understand him. \nANDREAS (on the tape) I don't care what you call it, just as long as we get what we want. The men on the tape all laugh. Andreas walksaway.Whitacre and Ikeda shake hands. And then Whitacre ripsoffthe sheet of paper from the easel with the PIE CHART onit. \nDraft: 1/15/03 64. \nWHITACRE (on the tape) I guess I should probably keep this, huh? Shepard freezes the tape triumphantly. \nROBIN MANN Where's the agreement? There's just a discussion. \nHERNDON If this isn't an agreement, then what are they doing there? \nSHEPARD Don't get bogged down in the words, look at the actions. \nROBIN MANN I've looked. I see a chart with a bunch of numbers. But, I can't pinpoint any agreement per se. \nHERN DON What do you want? The guy is standing there dividing up the market plain as day. Herndon opens up the evidence bag and shows her the flip- chart page that Whitacre took at the end of the meeting-- a smoking gun. \nROBIN MANN It could just be a proposal. All the other companies weren't there. Nobody used the word \"agreement.\" I'm just telling you-- as a lawyer-- what their lawyers are going to say. Herndon and Shepard look at Whitacre FROZEN ON THE MONITOR. They are discouraged. \nHERNDON I don't know how much more we can ask of the guy. \nROBIN MANN I'm not going to move for indictments with this. I need more. \nDraft: 1/15/03 65. \n71 INTERIOR DECATUR CLUB- DAY 71 Whitacre sits with MARTY ALLISON, 35, who's voice we've heard on Whitacre's voice mail many times.. The two are old friends and co-workers-- Marty's been trying to get Mark's ear for some time now. They've got some business together. \nMARTY ALLISON I feel like a real jerk here, but I need the dough. \nWHITACRE Nah, we'll figure something out. \nMARTY ALLISON I hope it's not a big deal, but I've been looking at a house and I need the cash back. \nWHITACRE Marty, when I hired you, what did you want? \nMARTY ALLISON Fifty grand. \nWHITACRE But, I went to Wilson and told him you wouldn't work here for less than seventy-five-- and I got it. You were the first guy I hired. \nMARTY ALLISON Mark, you've always been real generous with me and... Whitacre waves off the flattery. \nWHITACRE I gotta leave town for a couple of days, but when I get back, here's what I want you to do... And under... \nWHITACRE (V.O.) I like to think of myself as a good gift-giver. It shows that you're thinking about the other person even when they're not right in front of you. \n(MORE) \nDraft: 1/15/03 66. WHITACRE (V.0.) (cont'd) I know that Ginger likes jewelry and that the kids like stuff from other countries... Even if you just pick it up at the duty free at the airport with whatever money you have left over. \n72 INTERIOR HAMPTON INN HOTEL- NIGHT 72 Whitacre drops off more tapes for Shepard and Herndon. \nSHEPARD We got a problem, Mark. You can't take our equipment to Japan. We have no jurisdiction. \nWHITACRE So I'll take notes like in Vancouver. Whitacre takes out his Dictaphone and puts it on the bed. \nSHEPARD Well, sure, but there's something else I'd like you to think about. \nWHITACRE Okay. \nSHEPARD Like I said, we can't give you any recording equipment. \nHERNDON But, if you taped the meeting on your own and than gave us the tapes... \nWHITACRE So you want me to make a tape. \nHERNDON We're not allowed to say that. But, the sooner we get enough evidence, the sooner you can stop the taping. \nWHITACRE What if I get caught there? \nSHEPARD I don't know anything about Japanese laws, but if you're arrested, we may not be able to provide much help. \nDraft: 1/15/03 67. \nHERNDON That's why we need these lysine association meetings on US soil.. .Make it easier to wrap this up.

Mimoto and Ikeda enter. \nIKEDA Good morning, we are late. \nWHITACRE No problem, no problem, you lost twenty- thousand tons, but, hey... The group laughs at the WACKY PRICE FIXING JOKE. Whitacre checks his watch. \nWHITACRE Excuse me...I gotta take a moment. \nDraft: 1/15/03 68. Whitacre walks down the hall toward the rest room. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) I read this thing about moustaches on the flight back from Zurich...What facial hair says to women about a man's level of honesty. I think maybe it was in Esquire Magazine... Some psychological theory... \n75 INTERIOR BATHROOM- CONTINUOUS 75 Whitacre reaches into his suit jacket and takes out the recorder. He studies himself in the bathroom mirror and then flips the tape. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) I should ask Brian and Bob about it- - get the FBI's point of view... \nWHITACRE Imperial Palace Hotel, side two tape one... Just as he is putting the tape back into his jacket-- the door opens. ONE OF THE LYSINE EXECS enters. \nLYSINE EXEC Things are going well. Whitacre conceals the recorder. \nWHITACRE Want to get back in there. \n76 INTERIOR MOVIE THEATER- NIGHT 76 Whitacre sits alone fully engrossed by the movie. \nANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN \"The Firm.\" TOM CRUISE, as Mitch McDeere talks with FBI agent Wayne Tarrance, played by ED HARRIS at a DOGTRACK. \nMCDEERE Doesn't the dog ever get the bone? \nTARRANCE Yeah, I hear it happens every once in awhile. It's a disaster, they can never get that dog to run again. \n(MORE) \nDraft: 1/15/03 69. \nTARRANCE (CONT'D) Listen, Mitch, Mr. Boyles wants me to tell you how much the bureau appreciates... \nMCDEERE A million dollars. \nTARRAANCE What? \nMC DEERE A million dollars in a numbered account in Switzerland. IBG Bank International in Zurich. \nTARRANCE You sure as hell turned greedy overnight. \nMCDEERE .And my brother out now. \nTARRANCE Your brother is a convicted felon, Mitch. \nMCDEERE Then get yourself another snitch. Tarrance responds with a string of expletives and threats to knock McDeere's teeth down his throat. His verbal assault is put to a halt when his phone rings. It's Holly Hunter calling from the nearby parking lot. She plays Tarrance an incriminating tape of what he has just said. McDeere is wearing a wire. McDeere has him now. \nMCDEERE You want to reconsider? \nWHITACRE (V.0.) Most of the guys the government gets to do the tough stuff are probably drug dealers and mafia guys. I'm probably the only guy like me they've ever met-- \n77 EXTERIOR RURAL HIGHWAY- NIGHT 77 Whitacre drives his new RANGE ROVER through the darkness. \nDraft: 1/15/03 70. \nWHITACRE (V.0.)

It's just me and some Russian guy who's now a girl's soccer coach in New Mexico or something... \n78 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION BEDROOM- NIGHT 78 Whitacre tries to creep into the dark room without waking his wife. He starts to get undressed. Her voice in the darkness surprises him. \nGINGER Were you with Brian and Bob all this time? \nWHITACRE Yeah, we had to go over some tapes and... \nGINGER Mark, Brian called-- I know you weren't with him. Busted. \nGINGER Did you go again? \nWHITACRE I needed to unwind. \nGINGER You've seen that picture like five times now... She turns on the light to discuss her concerns. Mark is standing there without his shirt on-- A LARGE PATCH OF HAIR is missing from the middle of his chest. \nWHITACRE What's wrong with that? \nGINGER What's wrong? Why is your chest shaved, Mark? Why are there holes cut in your suit clothes? Why aren't you a part of this family anymore? Whitacre tries to laugh off her concern. He sits down on the bed and puts her hand on his smooth chest. \nDraft: 1/15/03 71. \n", "test1_id": 1893, "test2_input": "WHITACRE You know they needed to shave me for the tape recorder.

I didn't ask for this-- but I want to give this family everything. That's why I'm working so much. \nGINGER I don't know who you work for anymore, Mark. Do you? A beat. He smiles warmly at her. \n79 INTERIOR FBI DECATUR- DAY 79 Warm summer day-- out the window the smoke stacks of ADM send plumes of white smoke into the blue sky. Shepard and Herndon sit in their SHIRTSLEEVES transcribing tapes in the tiny office. There's a knock on the door. Shepard checks to see who it is through the eye-hole. Whitacre enters wearing the SAGE COLORED SUIT- full of confidence. \nWHITACRE Hey guys, I was in the neighborhood. I got some more tapes. \nSHEPARD Thanks, Mark. Come on in. \nWHITACRE And I've learned some important things recently. I've been told I'm probably going to be the next President of ADM. He glows. \nHERNDON Really? \nSHEPARD Who told you that? \nDraft: 1/15/03 72. \nR \nWHITACRE And that's not all. I'd say that ten of the products produced by ADM are price fixed. \nSHEPARD Ten? \nWHITACRE I would estimate that for all the companies involved, the total extra profit is in the range of 800 million to one billion dollars. That's just from the price-fixing. \nSHEPARD Can you tell us what products? Whitacre smiles-- he's got something else on his mind. \nWHITACRE You know, Brian, if all these companies are charged, they're going to be paying an awful lot in fines. Don't you think? \nSHEPARD I don't know, they might end up paying. But, nobody knows for sure how this will turn out. \nHERNDON We still need to get everyone together making an actual agreement before we have a case. \nWHITACRE Sure, sure I know that. But, I've taken a lot of risks and I need to think about my family. \nSHEPARD What do you mean? \nWHITACRE Well, I'd like it if, in their fine, ADM was ordered to pay me ten year's salary. \nSHEPARD Well, Mark... \nWHITACRE It's only fair. Also, one other thing. \n(MORE) \nDraft: 1/15/03 73. \nWHITACRE (CONT'D) I never expected this investigation would go on as long as it has. It's been almost two years and I think I should get total immunity if I agree to cooperate through the end. \nSHEPARD I can't grant you immunity Mark, you know that. Whitacre smiles wishfully like a big kid. Herndon senses that something's up. \nHERNDON Hey, Mark, it's kind of warm in here-- why don't you take off your jacket, sit down and we can talk about this. \nWHITACRE Oh, no, Bob, that's okay. Let me know if you want to reconsider. Whitacre leaves. Herndon looks at Shepard. \nSHEPARD What was that about? \n80 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MARK'S OFFICE- EVENING 80 Whitacre labels the tape of the FBI agents and tosses it in a box-- with other tapes. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) These floods out on the Mississippi, you have to think about these. It just looks like some boy scouts and sand bags on the news-right until you have your stock plummet because of crop losses... Then it looks like someone's knee deep in your kids college education looking for their photo albums.. .Brian doesn't understand stock options. He doesn't see what can happen if they take those away from me. \n$1 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MASTER BEDROOM- NIGHT 81 Ginger alone in bed at 3 AM during a rain storm. The regular patter of rain is punctuated by the sound of a SMALL ENGINE. She gets out of bed and goes to the window. \nDraft: 1/15/03 74. Whitacre stands in his bathrobe in the rain with the LEAF BLOWER. There's one wet leaf stuck to the pavement and he's focussed the full power of the blower on it but it's not going anywhere. Three deer stand like statues in the yard, oblivious to the rain. \nWHITACRE (V.O.) We got a deer problem here. They're in the corn, they're eating the small trees, they charge into the road. Too many deer. Take away all the predators and that's going to happen.. .No bears, no coyotes...So now you have all these deer-- weak and desperate. \nANGLE ON THE DEER Close enough to hear the rain on their METAL BODIES. They are YARD STATUES. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) And then one gets sick and they all get sick. Because they're broke and hungry and they make mistakes. Who's fault is that? You can't blame the deer for not having predators... \n82 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION DRIVEWAY- NIGHT/RAIN 82 Ginger approaches in her night gown under an umbrella. \nGINGER Mark, what are you doing? Whitacre can't tear himself away from the lone leaf. \nGINGER Come inside Mark, what's happening to you? She takes his arm and tries to lead him toward the house, but he turns on her. His eyes are filled with terror. She turns off the blower. \n", "test2_true": "Draft: 1/15/03 75. \nGINGER You're not better than somebody else because you have more cars or a bigger salary. Or some stables across the road. You used to know that, you used to know what mattered. You need to find that out again-- you need to turn to God. Whitacre stares at the leaf, trying to move it with his will. \nWHITACRE (softly so God won't hear) I don't need God. \n83 INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE- DAY 83 Whitacre flags down KIRK SCHMIDT, 40, a co-worker and a friend who is passing by. \nWHITACRE Hey, Kirk, I'm gonna be heading off to Europe and I was thinking I'd deliver the check for the ABP deal in person. \nSCHMIDT Remind me, ABP deal? \nWHITACRE Threonine microbe, they've made some substantial improvements and we need to get it into the market. I got the invoice somewhere... He fishes it out of a pile of papers and slides it across the desk. \nSCHMIDT We can overnight it. \nWHITACRE Nah, I'm gonna see this Thorstensson guy. I'll just hand it to him. \nSCHMIDT Then I'll get it over. Lysine's going great guns Mark, price is up to one-twenty. Out the window of the office Andreas looks at the tote board and smiles broadly-- he gives Whitacre a big thumbs up. Whitacre smiles and flashes a thumbs up back. \nDraft: 1/15/03 76. \nL \n84 EXTERIOR SAVOY BAUR EN VILLE, ZURICH- DAY 84 Whitacre emerges from the elegant hotel and heads down the crowded Bahnhofstrasse. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) ADM: Supermarket to the world.. .We'll have to change that. When it all comes out-- maybe the board'11 want to change the name of the company altogether. Like when all those companies became Beatrice in the 80's. There was that woman, `We're Beatrice...' They made light bulbs and corn and everything... Whitacre enters the SWISS BANK CORPORATION. He approaches A \nUNIFORMED PORTER. \nWHITACRE Guten Morgen, Ich mochte Herr Brief finden, bitte? The porter points toward a desk. \nWHITACRE Danke schon. Whitacre approaches a SECRETARY. Behind him another woman shrieks and falls down. The heel has broken on her shoe. Her papers scatter everywhere-- the secretary smirks at the \nFALLEN WOMAN. \nWHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.) Guten Tag...Wie gehts es They have a word for laughing Ihnen? Ich suche Herr Briel, at the misfortune of others. bitte. A word for that. Schadenfreude ... We don't have any words for that kind of thing. In a way, it's not really funny. The secretary buzzes and moments later a wooden door opens. DANIEL BRIEL emerges smiling. \nBRIEL Mr. Whitacre ...Wie gehts? Gut dass wir uns eben getroffen haben. The two men vanish behind a door. \nWHITACRE (V.O.) Brian and Bob always ask me if I do much sightseeing on business trips-They don't understand. \n(MORE) \nDraft: 1/15/03 77. WHITACRE (V.0.) (cont'd) You fly in, go to the meeting, go to the hotel, go to another meeting and get back on the plane. It's not that glamorous. \n85 INTERIOR HAMPTON INN- AFTERNOON Whitacre hands another small stack of tapes to Shepard and Herndon-- The agents are very excited, Whitacre has good news. \nWHITACRE We're having another association meeting to work out some issues in lysine-- dividing up volume, setting prices for some markets. \nSHEPARD Europe again? \nWHITACRE There's a price fixing investigation into cement manufacturing there-- it has everybody spooked. Europe's out. \nY` HERNDON We can't video tape in Japan-- that's not gonna help us. \nWHITACRE Hawaii. \nSHEPARD Hawaii? \nHERNDON What's his name, Mimoto, we have him saying on tape-- last fall that... He checks a three ring note-book full of transcriptions. \nHERNDON .they were \"concerned about severe penalties for anti-trust in the US.\" Whitacre smiles, very impressed with himself. \nSHEPARD So, why are they coming to the US? \nWHITACRE I got the association past their fears. \nDraft: 1/15/03 78. \nL \nANGLE ON A GOLF BALL Crushed by a driver-- the grass and tee fly. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) The state bird of Hawaii is the Nay Nay-- it's a kind of land based goose and the state motto is va mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono-- the customer is the enemy and the competitor is your friend. \n86 EXTERIOR SHERATON MAKAHA GOLF COURSE- OAHU 86 Mimoto, Ikeda, Whitacre, Wilson and ANOTHER FOURSOME OF ASIAN LYSINE EXECS crowd around a tee box in their golf clothes. Mimoto watches his drive split the palm lined fairway and head toward the Pacific. Wilson tees up his ball. \nTERRY WILSON What should we play for? \nMIMOTO If we win, we get Tyson Foods. All the execs laugh at the thought of dividing up the world's lysine market through golf. An EXEC IN A VISOR chimes in. \n", "test2_id": 1894, "test3_input": "VISOR Or, we could play a thousand tons a stroke. \nIKEDA We already know Whitacre's score-- sixty seven plus alpha. More laughter. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) I got a hole-in-one once-- back in Ohio when I was about eighteen. There was a little blurb in the paper and I won a windbreaker from the country club...I still have the news clipping somewhere stashed away for safe keeping... \nTHE T-BOX THROUGH A CROSS-HAIRS A series of photographs are snapped of the golfers. \nF \nDraft: 1/15/03 79. \n87 A NEARBY HILLSIDE Herndon and Shepard snap photographs with a very long lens from a golf cart parked on hillside. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) But, mainly I was active in the local 4-H Club. I think 4-H is a real good thing for kids...I got a lot of recognition from them and it's not just some local thing. It's a federal program-- part of the Department of Agriculture. OTHER FBI AGENTS dressed for the links shadow the lysine execs using LONG RANGE RECORDING EQUIPMENT. \n88 INTERIOR SHERATON MAKAHA- ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM 88 Herndon and Whitacre-- like a boxer and his corner man. \nHERNDON Just remember-- I want you to poll the room and get them to use the word \"agreement.\" \nWHITACRE Okay, Bob. It's gonna be a great meeting. \nHERNDON Let the action come to you. \nWHITACRE I gotta talk, Bob. \nHERNDON I know that... \nWHITACRE I mean, I'm representing ADM. Otherwise, everybody would be suspicious. \nHERNDON You can talk. Just don't dominate. We want to see others involvement. \nOK? \nWHITACRE Definitely. \nHERNDON It's that time again. \nDraft: 1/15/03 80. \nWHITACRE Oh, sure no problem. Whitacre takes off his shirt as the two men face each other in the hotel room-- an uncomfortable moment. Herndon starts spreading shave cream across Whitacre's chest. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) When it's over I think we'll be friends, all of us. Good friends. I'll have Bob over and Brian and we'll bar-b-que. Maybe not so much with some of the guys over at ADM-- probably not Mick and Terry...But guys like Sid and Marty and Rheinhard we've been through a lot together... \n89 EXTERIOR POOL SIDE- SHERATON RESORT 89 Wilson, Mimoto, Ikeda and Visor sip umbrella drinks \nTERRY WILSON We can't be manipulated by these Goddamn buyers. Thank God we have them, but they are not my friends. The men all nod. Whitacre appears pool side and begins to unbutton his Hawaiian shirt. Wilson turns to Ikeda. \nTERRY WILSON You're my friend. I want to be closer to you than I am to any customer, cause you can make it so I can make money or I can't make money. And all I want... Nobody is listening to him. They all stare at Whitacre. A \nLARGE PATCH OF HIS CHEST HAIR IS SHAVED. \nWHITACRE What? Whitacre looks down at his chest-- so does everyone else. Whitacre's got some explaining to do. \nWHITACRE Oh, that. Nah, I had to take this physical for some life insurance the wife wanted. They shaved me for the heart thing. Itches... Whitacre smiles shyly and settles into the pool. \nDraft: 1/15/03 81. \nWHITACRE (V.0.) It's not really lying when you're doing it to serve some greater purpose...I think that's what God would say-- it's not all cut and dry-- like that and you can't really send a lie out into the world on its own, you wouldn't do that with a child per se...A lie needs the company of other lies-- and so it may look like a lot of lies in the end, but it's really just the first one that counts... \n90 INTERIOR SHERATON MAKAHA- MEETING SUITE 90 A medium sized room overlooking the grounds. Orange Juice and fruit trays and an easel in the corner. The room seems a little cramped for the number of men assembling-- Whitacre, Wilson, Mimoto, Ikeda and a number of others from Asia and Europe. Whitacre searches for SOMETHING. \nTERRY WILSON Damn Mark, can't you call and get us a bigger room. This is crazy. \nWHITACRE Anyone seen my briefcase? \nMIMOTO We move to bigger room. They start to pack up their stuff. Whitacre panics. \nWHITACRE No, no. I don't think they have one... . Is my brief case behind the flip-chart? \n91 INTERIOR SURVEILLANCE ROOM- TWO ROOMS AWAY 91 Herndon enters with the BRIEF CASE-- Shepard is watching Whitacre on a monitor with other JUNIOR AGENTS. \nHERNDON He left it in his room. \n92 INTERIOR SHERATON MAKAHA- MEETING SUITE 92 I\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Whitacre on the phone. \nDraft: 1/15/03 62. \nWHITACRE Yeah, it's just there's more of us than we expected. Nothing larger? Really? Can you check again... \nCU ON THE PHONE BASE Whitacre's finger holds down the receiver switch. He's talking to no one. Mimoto picks up his chair and moves it right in front of THE LAMP/CAMERA. Another problem. \n", "test3_true": "WHITACRE Uh, Mr. Mimoto, I think you might be able to see the easel better... \nWHITACRE (V.O.) You think Mimoto would be any different in my position?

Shepard stares at the back of Mimoto's chair on the monitor. Helpless. They've come a long way to go back empty handed. Suddenly the room comes into view as Whitacre moves the chair from in front of THE LAMP/CAMERA. \nWHITACRE (on the monitor) What if we just move your chair over here. \nSHEPARD Thatta boy, Mark. \n94 INTERIOR SHERATON MAKAHA- MEETING SUITE 94 Terry Wilson starts the meeting. \nDraft; 1/15/03 83. \nI \nTERRY WILSON I'd like to welcome everybody here, glad everyone could make it and sorry for those who can't play golf tomorrow-- we're gonna have a good time. Whitacre's POV-- he scans the room. \nTERRY WILSON WHITACRE (V.0.) We have an old saying at ADM It's like that game on TV that applies here. It's where one guy knows a word better to have the elephants and tries to make the other inside the tent pissin' out, one say it... another word for than outside pissin' in. \"deal\"...how about \"consensus,\" or \"understanding.\" Maybe they'd take \"deal\"-- that's like \"agreement.\".. \nMIMOTO Outside piss? Language problem again. \nTERRY WILSON It's better to be part of the group. \nWHITACRE Competitors are our friends, remember? Customers the enemy. The group nods in agreement with Whitacre's translation. JM SUH of Cheil Corporation takes issue with this. The two argue... Whitacre looks at SUH, who is LOSING HIS HAIR... \nSUH WHITACRE (V.0.) I want to know why Cheil Male pattern hair loss can be Corporation has been excluded a real set back...I mean a from association in the past. lot of women, their father's are bald so they're kind of used to it...But, still seeing it in the drain every morning in your thirties, that's not fair at all and this Minoxidil thing-- it's not really, a cure... \nMIMOTO I explain it to you on the phone many times... Suh is kind of a baby-- Mimoto doesn't like him. Wilson steps in. \nDraft: 1/15/03 84. \nJ-- \nTERRY WILSON If the market is what we think it is... There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Conversation ceases. \nWHITACRE We have a couple other people joining us I think? MR. CHAUDRET from EUROLYSINE is making himself a fruit plate. \nMR. CHAUDRET From Sewon in Korea. \nMIMOTO And one from the FBI? Whitacre freezes. He's caught. He looks at the business men... DO THEY ALL KNOW? \nWHITACRE (V.0.) That's why there can't be any leaves on the walk. They give it away-Like the ants-- they can see a trail of ants... Mimoto smiles right at Whitacre-- the walls close in, and then, the room bursts into laughter. Whitacre gets it. He smiles back. \nWHITACRE And seven from the Federal Trade Commission. IT'S ALL A JOKE. More laughter and more knocks. Whitacre goes to the door. Mimoto calls out. \nMIMOTO Yes? FTC? Whitacre opens the door to find HERNDON DRESSED LIKE A HOTEL EMPLOYEE-- he hands Whitacre the brief case. \nHERNDON This was left in the lobby. The concierge thought it might belong to one of you gentleman. \nWHITACRE Okay. Hey, thanks. Herndon closes the door. \nDraft: 1/15/03 85. \nMR. CHAUDRET You forgot your briefcase in the lobby? \nWHITACRE When I was signing for the food-- I must've left it. \nMR. CHAUDRET In Paris it would have already been sold. More laughter. \nVIDEO MONITOR \nSUH How can we know ADM will stay at agreed upon levels? \nTERRY WILSON Our preference is to trust each other. If we find someone lyin'-- then we hire some mafia figure and rub you out. The group laughs. \nTERRY WILSON If we can't trust each other in the end, it ain't gonna work. \nMIMOTO You are okay for that? A beat. \nSUH Yeah, I'm all right. \nWHITACRE So what are we saying then? Wilson looks at Whitacre like he's an idiot. \nTERRY WILSON What, is there a language problem here? \nWHITACRE So, everyone is, uh... They just said so. It's like Whitacre is playing Password. \nDraft: 1/15/03 86. \nMIMOTO Agreed. Uh, five companies agree on quantity for the first time.

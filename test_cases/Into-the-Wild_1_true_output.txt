CHAPTER 4: FAMILY DISSOLVE TO: 
157   EXT. THE SLABS, NILAND, CA - DAY                           157 
This is the vista of former barracks foundations Rainey and Jan Burres had told Chris about. Hundreds of people in tents and trailers, a quarter inch to the right of a Rainbow Gathering as hillbillies and renegades mix with the hippies. There are canvas-covered booths set up for swap and trade. Even a few makeshift food stands. 
We SEE that many of the inhabitants have set up CHRISTMAS TREES outside their trailers and tents. Kids play naked in a mud pool. 
CUT TO: 
158   EXT. THE BOOTH OF JAN & RAINEY, THE SLABS - SAME          158 
We see Rainey selling their wares. Beside the booth, their van with its backseat door open. A little dog, Sunni, jumps out the van door, sniffing something out. Jan exits the van after the dog. 
JAN Sunni!    Come here boy. 
But Sunni has sniffed out Chris' large backpack leaning against the rear of the van. Jan is just beginning to recognize it, when from behind the van appears Chris, looking like a million bucks. 
CHRIS Surprise! 
JAN (overjoyed) Alex! 
As she goes to hug him - 
ANGLE: Rainey hearing his name, jumps up from his stool to join them. 
Big embraces all around. CUT TO: 
159   EXT. THE SLABS - NIGHT                                    159 
An impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a makeshift stage. Jan, Rainey, and Chris sit on chairs outside the circle of inhabitants, taking in the music. 
JAN You have to tell us everything. (Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him, Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA. 
Jan remarks, "I guess if you can figure out how to paddle a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska too.") 
At this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an              * innocent love song of her own composition, stealing seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance. 
JAN (CONT'D) I think you've made yourself a friend. 
CHRIS (blushing) She's only a teenager. 
JAN Good luck. 
The girl finishes her song. 
CUT TO: 
160   EXT. THE BOOTH OF JAN & RAINEY - DAY                      160 
Chris and Rainey man the second-hand goods booth while Jan bathes Sunni in a steel bucket by the van. Among the goods, a USED ORGAN. Chris is thrilled to have access to all the second-hand books that are part of Rainey and Jan's inventory. As he skims through Jack London's Odyssey of the North, Rainey notices Tracy sitting on the       * steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth. She picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes fixed on Chris. RAINEY How long can you stay with us? 
CHRIS Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into Salton City the day after Christmas. I've got to start thinking about getting ready for Alaska. When the sun gets a little lower tonight, I'm going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after the check comes in, I'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money's gonna go. (MORE) 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I'm going to have to pick up a lot of supplies before spring. So, I might take another job or I might be okay. 
RAINEY Well, you know, we'll give you a little something for every day you work the booth. 
CHRIS I'm not taking any money from you, Rainey.   It's been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you're doing good. 
RAINEY We are, and you were a big part of that, coming along when you did. Yep, things are good. (gives a little giggle) Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. Speaking of which, don't you think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there? 
Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,      * and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave- over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,           * putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a little wood nymph to Chris. 
TRACY                                 * Hi. 
CHRIS Hi. TRACY                                 * You selling books? 
CHRIS I am.   We are. 
TRACY                                 * I read a lot. 
CHRIS Do you? 
TRACY                                 * Yeah. 
CHRIS That's good.    I heard you play your song last night. 
TRACY                                    * (embarrassed) I'm terrible. 
Rainey amused by all of this. 
CHRIS You are not terrible. 
TRACY                                  * I'm not? 
CHRIS No.   You sing sweet. 
TRACY                                    * Thank you. I was going to go watch the kids play in the mud. Do you want to go? 
RAINEY Go on.   I'll watch the store.

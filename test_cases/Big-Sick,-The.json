{"test1_input": "THE BIG SICK \nWritten by \nEmily V. Gordon & Kumail Nanjiani \nOVER BLACK. \nWe hear audience laughter. \nANDY DODD (V.O.) Give it up for my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani! \nKUMAIL (V.O.) Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people are always asking me, what was that like? Really not that different from here. I mean we played cricket, which is just a spicier version of baseball. And we prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five times a day. And we marry someone our parents find for us. Arranged marriage, you know. For me, it was probably that we got episodes of the A-Team a little bit later. And by a little bit later, I mean we just got episode two. But other than that, it was exactly the same. \nA CREDIT SEQUENCE PLAYS. \nKumail drives an Uber around Chicago with VARIOUS PASSENGERS in the backseat. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT \nKumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage. \nCHRIS There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad comedians. \nKUMAIL You complain about the crowd like all the time. \nCHRIS Yeah, but that's when they're really bad. \nKUMAIL So like ninety percent of the time, they're really bad? \nCHRIS Will you just watch and give me notes tonight? If we both give each other notes, I think it would be helpful. \nKUMAIL Your notes are just to add more \"fucks\" into the bit. \nCHRIS Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and it's hard on the end. \nMary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to CJ. \nMARY That was truly horrible. \nKUMAIL Hey, that was great. \nMARY No, he didn't even crack a smile. I thought I was gonna puke. \nCHRIS Who? \nMARY Bob Dalavan. \nCHRIS Who's Bob Dalaban? \nCJ Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof. Don't you want to get noticed? Move to LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit. \nANDY DODD, the coked-up emcee, appears out of the bathroom. \nDODD No one's on stage? \nMARY No! \nDodd rushes on stage. \nKUMAIL He might have been doing cocaine. \nCJ Was he doing cocaine recreationally? \nMARY A true cokehead. \nDodd jumps up on stage. \nDODD (O.S.) Now before I bring up the next guy, you guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what happens after eight Jell-o shots. We urinate all over ourselves and puke. Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next comic. You know this man. \nChris slaps his own face. \nCHRIS Confidence. Poise. Smile. \nDodd (O.S.) Give it up for Mister Chris Jones! \nChris walks on stage. \nKUMAIL He's like if a serial killer fucked an inspirational speaker. \n", "test1_true": "CHRIS Just bought a laser printer. Printed out like six lasers so far. \nCJ, Kumail, and Mary watching Chris' set. Andy Dodd saunters backstage. \nKUMAIL Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd tonight. Could I do ten? \nDODD No. Five minutes. You put out chairs, you get five minutes. You know the deal. \nKUMAIL C'mon man. I'll double it up next time. \nDODD No. \nDodd walks back into the bathroom. \nKUMAIL What are you gonna do in there? \nDODD I'm making up next week's schedule. \nKUMAIL Okay. Cool. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER \nCJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from the wings. \nCJ I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to mansplain to her that, you know, we are on one little rock orbiting a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in a universe full of a billion galaxies, so I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit? You are cosmically over reacting to this. Honestly you are being super selfish. You're right, but you're selfish. \nKumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER \nKumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and starts his set. \nKUMAIL Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? I saw these news reports so I looked up what cheese is and cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM and heroin. So really, it's heroin. Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do the heroin, it's very powerful. You already have heroin. \nKumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) (pushing through) Is Pakistan in the house?! \nO.S. A WOMAN \"Woo-hoos!\" Kumail looks out at the crowd and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) You're not from Pakistan. I would have noticed you. \nShe smiles. \nCrowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary and CJ hang out at the bar. \nCHRIS He just gave you Montreal? Like you don't have to showcase or audition or anything? \nCJ It was too easy. Like I wanted to struggle. I wanted a story to be able to tell on talk shows and instead, like, you guys don't know how hard it is not to struggle. It's a struggle succeeding effortlessly. \nMARY Did he say anything about me? \nCJ Sure. \nCHRIS What about me? \nCJ Both of you. He said, those guys performed... \nMARY I truly hate you, actually. \nCHRIS We all hate you. \nKumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks loud over the music. \nKUMAIL Hi. \nEMILY Hi. \nKUMAIL Um, my name is Kumail. \nEMILY Yeah. We know. \nJESSIE We saw you perform. \nKUMAIL Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of the way, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it threw me off. You really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude. \nEMILY I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed you. It was supportive. \nKUMAIL Okay, that's a common misconception. Yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative. \n", "test1_id": 2103, "test2_input": "EMILY So if I yelled out \"You're amazing in bed,\" that would be a heckle? \nKUMAIL Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle. \nJESSIE Wow. Goodbye! \nJessie walks away. \nEMILY Don't go! You scared my friend off now. \nKUMAIL What's your name? \nEMILY Emily. \nKumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin. \nKUMAIL I want to show you something, Emily. This is your name in Urdu. \nEmily picks up the napkin, looks at it. \nEMILY Whoa. Does this move work? \nKUMAIL I've had some minor success with it. \nEMILY Bullshit. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATER \nEmily and Kumail are still at the bar. \nKUMAIL So you came to a comedy show with your friends? \nEMILY Yeah, we're all grad students at U of C. \nKUMAIL What are you studying at grad school? \nEMILY I study psychology. I'm going to be a therapist. \nKUMAIL Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and ask people, \"how did that make you feel?\" \nEMILY Eventually. Right now I'm doing field work with a group of guys convicted of domestic violence. \nKUMAIL Jesus. \nEMILY Cheers to that. \nKUMAIL Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To you becoming a therapist. \nEMILY Great. To me getting my masters. We'll start there and then we'll go to the rest of it. \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER \nKumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere, no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch watching TV. \nKUMAIL So my roommate Chris is probably on the couch. He's going to try and start a conversation. So no matter what- do not engage. Okay? Let's go. \nCHRIS Hi! \nEmily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact. Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Good for him. \nINT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS \nKumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are clothes everywhere. \nKUMAIL Do you want to watch a movie? \nEMILY Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down? Or... \nKUMAIL Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know what, go for that area. I cleaned that earlier this year. \nKumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty clothes. \nEMILY Should I take my shoes off or is this a shoes on bed? \nKUMAIL No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict rules. \nEmily crawls onto the air mattress. \n", "test2_true": "KUMAIL Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat inflatable mattress? \nEMILY I did think it might be an actual mattress. \nKUMAIL Well air mattresses are actual mattresses. You're being bigoted towards air based comfort items. \nKumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of the Living Dead is playing. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Night of The Living Dead? \nEMILY Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie. \nKUMAIL Okay, so basically the dead start rising. And the good guys, um... \nThey eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and kiss. \nINT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM \nChris hits the Siri button on his iPhone. \nCHRIS Text Lauren. You up girl? \nSIRI What do you want to say to Warren? \nCHRIS Ah, no. Fuck. \nChris hits the Siri button again. \nSIRI What do you want to say to- \nCHRIS You up? Period. Send. \nSIRI That may be beyond my abilities at the moment. \nCHRIS Fuck. \nINT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKumail and Emily post-coital. \nEMILY What are these scars? \nKUMAIL Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination. \nEMILY I thought only old people had those. \nKUMAIL Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still fighting some battles you guys have already won. \nEMILY What were you like in high school? Were you like, super funny? Were you really smart? \nKUMAIL I was very shy. They called me chashmullee. \nEMILY What is that? \nKUMAIL It roughly translates to \"dweeb.\" I'll show you a picture. \nKumail flips through his phone and produces his old high school photo, shows it to her. \nEMILY Of you in high school? Oh my god! \nKUMAIL Boom. \nEMILY No. \nKUMAIL And I'm thinking I'm killing it right now. \nEMILY What inspired this hair cut? \nKUMAIL Hugh Grant. \nEMILY Oh no. And you're so serious. \nKUMAIL I read in an interview with Hugh Grant, he said he doesn't smile because it makes his face look fat. So I didn't smile in pictures for many years. What were you like in high school? Were you voted... Most Sexy? \nEMILY No. I was voted \"Most Noticeable.\" \nKUMAIL That's good. \nEMILY No. It's really not good. I had acne, and I was a Goth and I had this terrible perm. The kids called me Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually I do know why, it's because they thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, I think I'm gonna go home. \n", "test2_id": 2104, "test3_input": "Kumail and Mary chat off to the side of the stage. \nKUMAIL Emily's parents are here. \nCHRIS (O.S.) Auntz, auntz, auntz. \nMARY Tonight? Why? \nCHRIS Is anybody here from out of town? \nTerry claps. Beth barely pays attention. Chris focuses on Terry. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) A few, a few. What's your name, sir? \nTERRY Terry. \nCHRIS Terry. And who's this lady next to you? Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth? \nBETH It's Beth. \nBackstage Kumail peers through the curtain, cringing. \nCHRIS Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where are you guys from? \nTERRY We're from North Carolina. \nCHRIS Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State! Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what brings you to Chicago? \nBETH Our daughter's in a coma. \nChris tries to absorb that. He turns to another person in the crowd. \nCHRIS Where are you from? \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE- SAME \nSUMERA It's getting late, I should go. \nShe moves to get up, but Sharmeen and Azmat stop her. \nAZMAT No, I think I should call him up, I'll just call him up. (into phone) Hello, Kumi-beta? What do you mean, who is calling? This is your father. Ok, ok. (he hangs up the phone) He will be here any moment. (to Naveed in Urdu) I just faked that call. Did you call him? \nNAVEED (in Urdu) A hundred times. No response. \nSUMERA I think I should make something clear. (in Urdu) I can understand what you're saying. \nFATIMA (in Urdu) I thought you said you'd never been to Pakistan. \nSUMERA (in Urdu) I said I'd never been there but we speak it at home. \nAZMAT (in Urdu) For someone who's never been to Pakistan you speak Urdu very well. \nSUMERA (in Urdu) Thanks. \nAZMAT Do you want to sing? \nAzmat leads the group in song while Sumera reluctantly claps alongside them. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR- LATER \nKumail on stage performing. \nKUMAIL I want to name my kid Void so he won't be able to cash any of his paychecks. \nBeth and Terry watch from the audience, laughing. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, sir, this says Void on it. But that's my name. Curse you, father! (gesturing upwards) I work on the second floor of the bank in this fantasy scenario. \nHECKLER Go back to ISIS! \nA hush over the crowd. Kumail not sure how to respond. \nKUMAIL Toast is a really strange food. \nBETH (to heckler) What did you just say? \nHECKLER I said, he should go back to ISIS. \nKUMAIL Toast is the only food that- \n", "test3_true": "HECKLER No I was saying that to him because... \nBETH Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS recruiter here. \nThe crowd laughs. \nKUMAIL Glad we got to the bottom of that. Toast is like a- \nBETH What is it about him that made you say that? \nKUMAIL I think we know what the answer is. \nHECKLER Lady I wasn't talking to you. \nBETH What is it about him? \nKUMAIL We don't have to go down this path. We know what's at the end of it. \nHECKLER Cuz of how he looks. \nKUMAIL There it is. \nBETH That is like saying that all frat boys wearing country club hats and Hawaiian shirts have shriveled up, tiny little dicks! \nThe crowd reacts. \nKUMAIL Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for you to find out, but he's right. I actually am a terrorist. I just do stand-up comedy on the side to keep a low profile. \nHECKLER Fuck you. \nKUMAIL First of all, very clever. Did you write that at home? Toast is- \nBETH Fuck you! \nHECKLER Fuck you. \nBETH No fuck you! \nHECKLER You're a bitch, you know that? \nBeth jumps out of her seat and rushes towards the Heckler. A man restrains her while she claws at him. \nBETH (being dragged out by security) I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your fucking phone number?! \nTerry heads out after Beth. \nTERRY I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry. \nHe stops in front of the Heckler. \nTERRY (CONT'D) I'm not sorry actually cause you're a terrible person... I don't want to kick your ass here in front of everybody. Yeah, that's right. I've got levels, motherfucker. This elevator goes all the way fucking down, you fucking prick! \nINT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER \nKumail drives with Beth in the passenger seat and Terry in the back. \nINT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- CONTINUOUS \nBeth, Terry, and Kumail enter, all a bit shell-shocked. \nBETH I think I'll make tea. (reconsiders) Actually I'll open a bottle of wine. (re-reconsiders) Does Emily have whiskey? \nKUMAIL On top of the fridge. \nTERRY So uh, Cubs doing good, huh? \nKUMAIL I don't know anything about baseball. \nShe starts to pour. They all just sit there. \nBETH I am so sorry about that. That was... I just sort of lost control. \nTERRY I thought it was sexy. \nKUMAIL Me too. Not like sexy, but like cool sexy. Not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna not say sexy anymore. \nBETH Hey, you guys wanna get something to eat? \nINT. EMILY'S KITCHEN COUNTER - LATER \n", "test3_id": 2105}

{"train": "THE BIG SICK \nWritten by \nEmily V. Gordon & Kumail Nanjiani \nOVER BLACK. \nWe hear audience laughter. \nANDY DODD (V.O.) Give it up for my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani! \nKUMAIL (V.O.) Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people are always asking me, what was that like? Really not that different from here. I mean we played cricket, which is just a spicier version of baseball. And we prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five times a day. And we marry someone our parents find for us. Arranged marriage, you know. For me, it was probably that we got episodes of the A-Team a little bit later. And by a little bit later, I mean we just got episode two. But other than that, it was exactly the same. \nA CREDIT SEQUENCE PLAYS. \nKumail drives an Uber around Chicago with VARIOUS PASSENGERS in the backseat. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT \nKumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage. \nCHRIS There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad comedians. \nKUMAIL You complain about the crowd like all the time. \nCHRIS Yeah, but that's when they're really bad. \nKUMAIL So like ninety percent of the time, they're really bad? \nCHRIS Will you just watch and give me notes tonight? If we both give each other notes, I think it would be helpful. \nKUMAIL Your notes are just to add more \"fucks\" into the bit. \nCHRIS Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and it's hard on the end. \nMary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to CJ. \nMARY That was truly horrible. \nKUMAIL Hey, that was great. \nMARY No, he didn't even crack a smile. I thought I was gonna puke. \nCHRIS Who? \nMARY Bob Dalavan. \nCHRIS Who's Bob Dalaban? \nCJ Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof. Don't you want to get noticed? Move to LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit. \nANDY DODD, the coked-up emcee, appears out of the bathroom. \nDODD No one's on stage? \nMARY No! \nDodd rushes on stage. \nKUMAIL He might have been doing cocaine. \nCJ Was he doing cocaine recreationally? \nMARY A true cokehead. \nDodd jumps up on stage. \nDODD (O.S.) Now before I bring up the next guy, you guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what happens after eight Jell-o shots. We urinate all over ourselves and puke. Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next comic. You know this man. \nChris slaps his own face. \nCHRIS Confidence. Poise. Smile. \nDodd (O.S.) Give it up for Mister Chris Jones! \nChris walks on stage. \nKUMAIL He's like if a serial killer fucked an inspirational speaker. \nEMILY So if I yelled out \"You're amazing in bed,\" that would be a heckle? \nKUMAIL Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle. \nJESSIE Wow. Goodbye! \nJessie walks away. \nEMILY Don't go! You scared my friend off now. \nKUMAIL What's your name? \nEMILY Emily. \nKumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin. \nKUMAIL I want to show you something, Emily. This is your name in Urdu. \nEmily picks up the napkin, looks at it. \nEMILY Whoa. Does this move work? \nKUMAIL I've had some minor success with it. \nEMILY Bullshit. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATER \nEmily and Kumail are still at the bar. \nKUMAIL So you came to a comedy show with your friends? \nEMILY Yeah, we're all grad students at U of C. \nKUMAIL What are you studying at grad school? \nEMILY I study psychology. I'm going to be a therapist. \nKUMAIL Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and ask people, \"how did that make you feel?\" \nEMILY Eventually. Right now I'm doing field work with a group of guys convicted of domestic violence. \nKUMAIL Jesus. \nEMILY Cheers to that. \nKUMAIL Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To you becoming a therapist. \nEMILY Great. To me getting my masters. We'll start there and then we'll go to the rest of it. \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER \nKumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere, no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch watching TV. \nKUMAIL So my roommate Chris is probably on the couch. He's going to try and start a conversation. So no matter what- do not engage. Okay? Let's go. \nCHRIS Hi! \nEmily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact. Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Good for him. \nINT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS \nKumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are clothes everywhere. \nKUMAIL Do you want to watch a movie? \nEMILY Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down? Or... \nKUMAIL Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know what, go for that area. I cleaned that earlier this year. \nKumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty clothes. \nEMILY Should I take my shoes off or is this a shoes on bed? \nKUMAIL No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict rules. \nEmily crawls onto the air mattress. \nEmily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress. \nKUMAIL Wait we haven't even had sex again yet. \nShe tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it. \nEMILY No. No. I'm really not that kind of girl. I only have sex once on a first date. Plus a hand job. \nKUMAIL Well I haven't had that yet! \nEmily laughs. \nEMILY You don't get that because you made fun of me. \nKUMAIL What is happening right now? What are you doing? \nEMILY I'm changing under this blanket. \nKUMAIL I've seen everything. Do you remember, we were just having sex? \nEMILY Yeah, but you were in the throes of passion then. Listen, I had a really nice time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna call an Uber and go home. \nEmily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone makes a noise. They exchange a look. \nKUMAIL Your driver will be ready as soon as he puts on his pants. \nEMILY Were you available for rides while we were fucking? \nKUMAIL Yeah, but I only looked a couple of times. \nINT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER \nKumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back. \nKUMAIL So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club sometime and we can grab a drink? \nEMILY I'm not really - I know this sounds like a line - but I'm not really dating right now. I have a lot of school and work and just a lot on my plate. \nKUMAIL That's perfect because I'm not really dating right now either. I actually have a pretty strict two-day rule where I can't see someone more than two days in a row. So since we hung out for two days, if I were to see you again, which I won't because you're not dating, I'm not dating, I wouldn't be able to see you until Monday. \nEMILY We haven't hung out for two days. We've hung out for about five hours. Just to like, be totally clear. \nKUMAIL Yesterday and today. Cause it's after midnight, today is actually tomorrow. Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two days. \nEMILY You see, I don't date time nerds, so that really takes you off the table. \nKUMAIL That works out, because I am a hard core time nerd. \nEMILY Yeah, I can tell. \nKUMAIL I'm like, very strict about AM/PM stuff. \nEMILY So wait, just to establish, what did we just decide? \nKUMAIL We decided we aren't ever going to see each other again. \nEMILY Great. I'm glad we're on the same page. \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - BRUNCH \nKumail is eating brunch with his father, AZMAT, his mother SHARMEEN, his brother, NAVEED, and his sister-in- law, FATIMA. \nAzmat Look at these jeans, Kumi. They're from Citizens of Humanity, that's the brand's name. Touch them. They're so soft. \nKUMAIL I don't want to touch your jeans. \nAZMAT They're like sweatpants. You should be stylish like your father. It's not very difficult. Just observe me. \nNAVEED Get some Daddy Style. \nSHARMEEN Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not like Naveed's, just a small one. \nAZMAT Maybe like mine, small and stylish. \nSHARMEEN Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why you don't enroll for LSAT now? \nKUMAIL Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet. I like that you bring it up as though you've never brought it up before. \nNAVEED How's the stand-up coming Bhai? \nKUMAIL It's from the show. Thank you. \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE - LATER \nSharmeen and Kumail are seeing Zubeida out. \nSHARMEEN I hope you come back. \nZubeida exits, Sharmeen looks at Kumail expectantly. \nSHARMEEN (CONT'D) Kumi, there's not going to be a magic spark, okay? You have to work at it. You have to stay open. \nKUMAIL Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were better at it, you know? (MORE) \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I mean you've had so much practice and you're still not that good at it! \nSHARMEEN Ha. Ha. Ha. \nKUMAIL You brought your A-game with Naveed, but then with me, you're kind of just phoning it in a little bit. \nSHARMEN Again with the comedy, the comedy. All the time with the comedy. Be serious! \nKUMAIL I am serious! That's why I want to help you get better! \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER \nKumail puts the HEADSHOT in the cigar box with a bunch of other pictures of Pakistani women. \nINT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER \nKumail drives Emily. She is in the back seat again. \nEMILY So, are you ever going to let me sit in the front seat? \nKUMAIL No, I'm a professional. And you're paying for this ride. \nEMILY I don't want to pay for this ride! It's surging right now. \nKUMAIL Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in the number. \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER \nEmily and Kumail on the couch in front of the TV. \nKUMAIL Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a string of failures. So, it turns to its most bankable star, Vincent Price. \nEMILY Is this your compatibility test? Like, the way people are with Vonnegut or The Big Lebowski? \nKUMAIL No! Just watch the movie. And take it seriously. \nEMILY I'm going to love it. I love it when men test me on my taste. \nKUMAIL I just want to share this movie with you, so I don't know why you're reading into- \nEMILY How many women have you shown this movie to? \nKUMAIL Zero. \nEMILY How many women have you shown a B Horror movie to on like, a third date. \nKUMAIL This is not a B horror movie. \nEmily laughs. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes cause when the menu comes up, there's some spoilers in the menu. \nEMILY I'm ready, I'm ready! \nKUMAIL Ok, I'll hit play. \nLATER, Kumail checks out Emily's reaction, she doesn't seem into it. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Watch! \nEMILY I'm watching! \nKUMAIL Shhhhhh! Watch this part. \nEMILY Stop watching me! \nEmily with Kumail and his friends: CJ and Mary. \nCJ Emily, has Kumail told you that in addition to being an Uber driver he also has a one-man show? \nEMILY No, he did not tell me that.   Do you really? \nKUMAIL It's really nothing. It's just something I'm fiddling around with. \nEMILY How is a one man show different from stand-up? \nKUMAIL It's really not. \nMARY There's lots of wigs and costume changes. \nCJ There's a lot of acting in it. \nMARY And then like at the end of it, you've got this very awkward conversation where you go, \"I really liked it.\" \nKUMAIL But I thought you really liked it! \nMARY I really liked it. \nEMILY I can't wait to see the show. \nKUMAIL You will never see the show... \nCJ You have to see the show. \nMARY You have to see it. \nKUMAIL It's not ready. \nCJ You will love the acting. \nKUMAIL They're fucking with you.   It's not really like that. \nEMILY Are they fucking with me or you? It seems like they're fucking with you. \nINT. PLAYGROUND THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT \nTiny theater, sparsely attended (Emily, her friend JESSIE, Mary and CJ). On stage is a kid's room. A NINJA TURTLES POSTER, a PRAYER MAT. \nKUMAIL I'm twelve years old. This...this is home. Feels like I never left. Do you smell that? That's my mom cooking the Murgh Roghen Joash. \nCJ (quietly, in the audience) Fuck. \nKUMAIL Do you hear that? That's my father watching cricket on the telly. Do you feel that? That's the weight of Pakistan's history. \nTIME CUT TO: \nA MAP OF PAKISTAN is behind Kumail. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Pakistan was formed when it separated from its biggest rival, India, on August 14th 1947. \nTIME CUT TO: \nKumail now wears CRICKET PADS & holds a BAT. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Six runs! \nTIME CUT TO: \nKumail pulls up a diagram of a cricket field. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Silly Mid On, Short Mid Wicket, Midwicket, Deep Mid Wicket, Mid On, Long On, Long Off... \nCJ stretches in the audience. \nJESSIE (quietly, from the audience) I have to leave as soon as the show's over. I can't stay. \nEmily nods in understanding. \nKUMAIL So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you know you're getting a Yorker soon. \nTIME CUT TO: \nReturn to the MAP OF PAKISTAN \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports are cotton and... \nKUMAIL It's not freaking me out. \nEMILY I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I know it's only been a few months. (MORE) \nEMILY (CONT'D) But I just wanted to tell you that I am completely overwhelmed by you. It's the last thing I was expecting. \nKUMAIL This is also the last thing I was expecting and I also feel completely overwhelmed by you. \nEMILY That's a weird thing to say. \nKUMAIL Why? I just said what you said. Exactly what you said. \nEMILY Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said it.   It's okay. \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEmily watches Kumail sleep. \nINT. TRADER JOE'S - NIGHT \nKumail and Emily grocery shop. \nEMILY So listen, my parents are coming to town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come for lunch? \nKUMAIL Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule, right? You'll come to Mary's party Friday night and then you'll probably spend the night. So I won't be able to see you until Monday, so... \nEMILY Okay. Well, I would love to meet your parents. They live in the city, right? \nKUMAIL Well, they live in the suburbs. You know, I don't really see them very much. \nEMILY Have they asked about me? What do they think? Do they want to meet me? My parents want to meet you. \nKUMAIL Of course, of course. They're dying to meet you. \nEmily stumbles. \nEMILY Ow... oh my god.. \nKUMAIL Are you okay? What happened? \nEMILY Totally fine. \nKUMAIL Do you need assistance? \nEMILY I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took this stupid hip hop dance class last weekend. \nKUMAIL You should get it looked at. Do you want ice? \nEMILY Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally fine. \nKUMAIL Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry you? I can carry you the rest of the day? \nEMILY Kumail, seriously, stop. \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING \nEmily is eating cereal in bed. Kumail is in the kitchen making coffee. \nKUMAIL (calling out) Hey, I liked your friends.     That Craig guy or was it Greg? (MORE) \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I can never tell with those names. I'm glad I like him cause I don't want to have to come up with excuses to avoid him, you know. Like, oh no, I have kite surfing tonight. \nEmily opens the cigar box and sees the headshots of the women. She flips through them. \nKUMAIL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Did you know in the UK it's pronounced \"Crayg\". Which is good because that's actually how it's written, right? He's a \"Crate\" guy. \nKumail enters. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) (sees her with the box) I was going to tell you about that. \nEMILY Are you like judging Pakistan's Next Top Model or something? Seriously, who are these women? \nKUMAIL You know how we have arranged marriage in my culture? These are those women. \nEMILY These are women in Pakistan who want to marry you? \nKUMAIL They're not in Pakistan. \nEMILY You've met these women? \nCJ Is that what you want? \nKUMAIL It's amazing. It's the same material. \nSAM What do people say? \nAUDIENCE Sam! \nSAM People say what? \nAUDIENCE Sam! \nSAM I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much! \nSam exits the stage. \nKUMAIL I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him how I actually feel about it. \nSam passes. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Great set, dude! \nCJ fistbumps Sam. \nSAM Crushing it! \nKUMAIL Love the new stuff! \nSam exits. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) We should be ashamed of ourselves. \nCJ We're weak. \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE- NIGHT \nThe family is in the living room with, KHADIJA, another Pakistani girl. \nKHADIJA I wouldn't really call it an obsession but... I'm pretty good at magic. \nSHARMEEN Can you make his belly disappear? \nAZMAT No, I'm too happy with my belly. \nKHADIJA Does anyone have a dollar? \nAZMAT I will give you something. \nAzmat hands her a bill. \nKHADIJA 20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't you think he'd look cool with sunglasses? \nShe draws a pair of sunglasses on top of Andrew Jackson's head, and folds the bill. \nKHADIJA (CONT'D) We sprinkle the magic dust on. \nKhadija makes a sprinkling motion with her fingers over the folded up bill. \nKUMAIL Yeah, you can't do it without the magic dust. \nKHADIJA Yeah, I need it. All right... \nShe snaps her fingers. \nKHADIJA (CONT'D) Ok. Watching carefully - \nKhadija unfolds the bill. Andrew Jackson is now wearing the sunglasses. \nFATIMA That is amazing! And he does look better with glasses! \nKUMAIL How did you do that? \nKHADIJA Oh no, a magician never reveals her tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr. Nanjiani. \nAZMAT Do you think I could use this twenty dollar bill to buy something? \nKHADIJA It looks better now, right? \nKumail shares a look with Sharmeen. \nCUT TO: \nDR. SPELLMAN Our theory is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. \nTERRY (taking NOTES) Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an \"f\" or a \"ph\"? \nDR. SPELLMAN Ph. \nMONTAGE of doctors babbling unintelligibly as Beth and Terry visibly panic. \nINT. WAITING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER \nTerry, Beth, and Kumail sit, surrounded by: KIDS WITH COLORING BOOKS, ADULTS WITH MAGAZINES, various CHARGERS plugged into the wall. These are the PEOPLE WHO WAIT. \nKUMAIL That was very reassuring, wasn't it? Apparently, there are good and bad comas. And the kind that they put her in, the medically induced ones, are definitely the good kind of coma. (MORE) \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Like you know how there are good and bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good or bad. \nTERRY Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle things from here. You've been very helpful. Thank you. For signing the thing- \nKUMAIL My pleasure \nTERRY But you can go now. \nKUMAIL Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the Mideast. \nHe picks up his backpack and exits. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT \nKumail, Mary, Chris, CJ, & Sam sit with notebooks open. \nCHRIS What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at the airport get a boner. Does that mean drugs or bombs? \nCJ That's good. What if instead of it being at the airport, you quit comedy and never did comedy ever again? \nCHRIS Fuck you. It's a good bit. \nCJ Just for the sake of the public. So they wouldn't have to look at your face or hear your words. \nKumail interjects. \nKUMAIL It's okay that I'm not there, right? Like, I don't need to be there, right? \nSAM What happened? \nCHRIS He put his girlfriend in a coma. You know, the way you do. \nMARY He signed a paper that allowed doctors to put her-- \nCJ He suggested it. \nKUMAIL She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors know medical stuff. That's what doctors do. They're good at medical stuff. This is a medically induced coma. This is their specialty. \nMARY Maybe. \nCHRIS It might be a good thing. She might wake up with a new skill. Like my cousin blacked out once and when he came to, he thought he knew a different language. \nCJ Did he? \nCHRIS No, it was just gibberish that he made up. It was brain damage. \nCJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out. \nSAM I got another Taco Bell one... \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING \nTerry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's. Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them. \nBETH Did you forget something? \nKUMAIL Is she up yet? \nTERRY No, she's not. They won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning. \nKUMAIL I know you guys said you don't need me to stay, but I think I'm just going to wait anyway. \nBETH You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious. \nDR. CUNNINGHAM On the lung. \nBETH What's the risk? \nDR. CUNNINGHAM Low. My advice to you is that you go home, you get something to eat, and try to relax. \nINT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT \nKumail drives Beth and Terry. Everyone looks dazed. \nEXT. EMILY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER \nKumail helps Beth and Terry carry their luggage upstairs. \nINT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- CONTINUOUS \nThey enter. Beth and Terry begin looking around. \nTERRY She left the lights on, eh? \nBETH My favorite sweater. \nTerry looks at Emily's bookshelf and pulls out a BOOK. Beth puts the sweater on and takes her laptop out, sits on the couch. \nBETH (CONT'D) I'm gonna do some research. \nTERRY Oh hey, that's the book I gave her. \nBETH No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you have that little notebook from the doctors? \nTerry hands her the notebook. \nTERRY No, this is the book I gave her. \nKUMAIL I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms real quick. \nBETH I remember. I met her at the falafel place and then we went to that book store that's hardly ever open and I bought it for her. \nTERRY You're not the only one who gives her things. \nBETH What's up with you? \nTERRY I'm just tired of you thinking that you're the only one who gives her things. I gave her that book. \nBETH Look at the inscription. \nTERRY No. That's stupid. \nBeth shrugs and goes back to the computer. Terry looks at the inscription, frowns, puts it back. \nINT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- SAME \nKumail leaves the door open a crack. He sees in the LIVING ROOM Terry and Beth are whisper-quarrelling. \nHe begins to clean. Pulls a MARIJUANA PIPE and BAG OF WEED off the dresser and shoves it into the back of her closet. \nHe notices the BRAINS SHIRT in the closet. He touches it. We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt. \nHe opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More flashbacks of Emily. \nTERRY (O.S.) Kumail. \nKumail, a bit startled, turns. \nKUMAIL Hey. \nTERRY Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I was just wondering if we wanna do anything. Got any parlor games... \nKUMAIL I don't-what are parlor games? \nTERRY Card games, word games. You play any word games? \nKUMAIL No, I've never played- \nTERRY You ever played You Can't Rhyme It? \nKUMAIL How does that go? \nTERRY It's basically where you try to find a word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme. \nKumail and Mary chat off to the side of the stage. \nKUMAIL Emily's parents are here. \nCHRIS (O.S.) Auntz, auntz, auntz. \nMARY Tonight? Why? \nCHRIS Is anybody here from out of town? \nTerry claps. Beth barely pays attention. Chris focuses on Terry. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) A few, a few. What's your name, sir? \nTERRY Terry. \nCHRIS Terry. And who's this lady next to you? Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth? \nBETH It's Beth. \nBackstage Kumail peers through the curtain, cringing. \nCHRIS Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where are you guys from? \nTERRY We're from North Carolina. \nCHRIS Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State! Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what brings you to Chicago? \nBETH Our daughter's in a coma. \nChris tries to absorb that. He turns to another person in the crowd. \nCHRIS Where are you from? \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE- SAME \nSUMERA It's getting late, I should go. \nShe moves to get up, but Sharmeen and Azmat stop her. \nAZMAT No, I think I should call him up, I'll just call him up. (into phone) Hello, Kumi-beta? What do you mean, who is calling? This is your father. Ok, ok. (he hangs up the phone) He will be here any moment. (to Naveed in Urdu) I just faked that call. Did you call him? \nNAVEED (in Urdu) A hundred times. No response. \nSUMERA I think I should make something clear. (in Urdu) I can understand what you're saying. \nFATIMA (in Urdu) I thought you said you'd never been to Pakistan. \nSUMERA (in Urdu) I said I'd never been there but we speak it at home. \nAZMAT (in Urdu) For someone who's never been to Pakistan you speak Urdu very well. \nSUMERA (in Urdu) Thanks. \nAZMAT Do you want to sing? \nAzmat leads the group in song while Sumera reluctantly claps alongside them. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR- LATER \nKumail on stage performing. \nKUMAIL I want to name my kid Void so he won't be able to cash any of his paychecks. \nBeth and Terry watch from the audience, laughing. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, sir, this says Void on it. But that's my name. Curse you, father! (gesturing upwards) I work on the second floor of the bank in this fantasy scenario. \nHECKLER Go back to ISIS! \nA hush over the crowd. Kumail not sure how to respond. \nKUMAIL Toast is a really strange food. \nBETH (to heckler) What did you just say? \nHECKLER I said, he should go back to ISIS. \nKUMAIL Toast is the only food that- \nKumail, Terry and Beth are eating pizza. \nBETH So is it always like that? \nKUMAIL Oh like tonight? No, usually a different mom comes in to help me. I'm joking. No, it's not always like that. I'd quit if it was. \nTERRY Here's a joke. \nBETH No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as funny as a fart at a funeral. \nTERRY This is funny, this is a funny one. A giraffe walks into a bar and he says to the bartender, \"Highballs on me.\" You get it, right? \nKUMAIL Oh that was the end of the joke? \nTERRY Yes. \nKUMAIL That was the whole joke? \nTERRY That's the joke. That's the beauty of it, boom. \nKUMAIL I thought there was more. \nTERRY He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would stand to reason his testicles are high and a highball is a type of drink, and you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny first. \nHe gives up and eats. Kumail chuckles. \nKUMAIL No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly explained. \nTERRY You're just busting my high balls. \nKumail laughs. \nINT. EMILY'S KITCHEN TABLE - LATER \nTerry swills WINE and swishes some in his mouth. \nTERRY Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel. Good. How about you? \nKUMAIL Hmm, fruit-forward. \nTERRY Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward. \nKUMAIL This one is in the front seat. It's driving the wine car. \nTERRY Exactly. \nBETH I like wine cause of the buzz. \nTERRY She's a bit of a lightweight. \nBETH So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the sofa in less than an hour! \nTERRY Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not true. \nINT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM- LATER \nTerry, passed out on the sofa snoring. Kumail & Beth sit. \nBETH You weren't supposed to be on the show tonight, were you? \nKUMAIL Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah I was. I was the headliner. \nBeth stares him down. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Okay. I lied about the show to get out of hanging out with you guys. And then I lied about headlining to impress you guys. \nBETH Well that didn't work. \nKUMAIL Also, I think I screwed up with your daughter. \nBETH Yeah, you did. (then) I don't know how people do it when their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he got cancer, then he had a stroke, then a heart attack, then he had a recurrence of the cancer. But you know what killed him? \nKUMAIL Cancer? \nBETH Car accident. We think maybe it was a heart attack while he was driving. And he did still have cancer too. And you know what? He ate sprouts his whole fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30 years. I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight. \nKUMAIL You wanna stress eat? \nBETH Fuck yeah. \nTERRY Will you just stop for a second? They're the doctors. You act like you know what you're talking about. You don't. \nBeth searches in her bag. \nBETH I can't find my cellphone. You got a phone? \nTERRY Don't give her a phone. You don't need a phone. You don't need to call anybody right now. \nKumail takes out his phone, hands it to Beth. She starts fiddling with it. \nTERRY (CONT'D) They're doing it. They're the experts here, and I trust them. \nBETH Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can you unlock that thing? \nBeth hands the phone back to Kumail, he unlocks it, hands it back. \nBETH (CONT'D) There's a reason why they're #17 and Northwestern's #1. And it's not because people trust them! \nTERRY Oh - you think that you're smarter than me because you say big sentences. Well you're not! \nKumail is trying to give them space, unsure what to do. \nBETH I don't think I'm smarter than you! You just don't think you're as smart as I am! That's not my fault! \nTERRY Right. It's never your fault. Everything's my fault. \nBETH Oh there are some things that are definitely just your fault. \nTERRY Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop freaking out and calm down. \nBETH And you need to stop being a coward. \nTERRY Greatest hits, coming back. You can stop, I'll replay the rest of this from memory. \nKumail slips away. \nINT. GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER \nKumail looking at gift items. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER \nKumail walks with a giant STUFFED GIRAFFE. \nINT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nKumail puts the STUFFED GIRAFFE by her bed. Nurse Judy smiles. \nNURSE JUDY Oh, you're giraffe-ing it. \nKUMAIL It was the biggest thing they had. I don't even know if she likes giraffes. We never talked about giraffes. Hey, do they know what they're doing? Cause they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme Disease? You know the girl on The Real World had it? Did you guys look for that? \nNURSE JUDY Yes, we did. \nKUMAIL Did you know she gets hurt all the time? She messed up her ankle recently - could that be Lupus? \nNURSE JUDY Kumail. We're looking into everything. We're not holding anything back from you. We're still just eliminating possibilities. \nKUMAIL Cause Beth wants to move her to Northwestern. \nNURSE JUDY Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands, but we put her in a coma for a reason. To stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. The infection could spread. Trust me she is fighting. And so are we. \nKumail looks frightened. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTerry balls up his coat to use as a pillow, trying to get comfortable. Kumail enters. TERRY sees him and sits up. \nKUMAIL Hey Terry. I was just talking to the nurse - You okay? \nTERRY Yeah, of course. Totally fine. \nTerry's eyes are very puffy and red. \nTERRY (CONT'D) Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait here until they kick me out. Keep an eye on her. \nLong pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another. \nKUMAIL Do you wanna crash at my place? \nTERRY Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's terrible advice. \nTerry is clearly fraught. \nTERRY (CONT'D) Love isn't easy. That's why they call it love. \nKUMAIL I don't really get that either. \nTERRY I know. I thought I could just start saying something and something smart would come out. \nINT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nKumail wakes up. Terry is gone. There is a note. \"Headed to the hospital. See you there - Terry.\" \nINT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT \nKumail pulls on his shoes as Chris exits the bathroom. \nKUMAIL Hey did you see Terry? \nCHRIS No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm going to Sevies. You want anything? \nKUMAIL No, I'm good, thank you. \nCHRIS You don't want a hot dog or nothing? \nKUMAIL Dude it's 8:30 in the morning. \nCHRIS Okay, no hot dog. \nChris opens the door to leave as Azmat and Sharmeen enter. \nSHARMEEN We just spoke to Khadija's parents. \nKUMAIL What are you doing here? \nSHARMEEN What is wrong with you, Kumi? \nKUMAIL Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry- \nSHARMEEN Sorry? That's all you have to say? \nKUMAIL I wasn't that into her. \nSHARMEEN \"Into her\"? Do you know how difficult it is to get an appointment with her? She is in very high demand. \nKUMAIL Okay. So? \nSHARMEEN So? \nKUMAIL Can we please talk about this another time? \nSHARMEEN No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this now. We have sacrificed everything for you. \nKUMAIL I know, okay? \nSHARMEEN We have left our family. We have left our home. I have missed the birth of my sister's daughter. I have not seen my mother for fifteen years. Your father, he had to do his graduate school. Again. He had to give exams. Again. \nAZMAT I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s. They used to call me Father Time! \nKUMAIL I know that. I really appreciate everything you did for me, but can we talk about this another time? \nSHARMEEN Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer, fine. If you want to do the stand-up comedy and embarrass us as a family, fine. There is only one thing that we have ever asked from you: that you be a good Muslim and that you marry a Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing! \nKUMAIL Can I ask you something that has never made sense to me? Why did you bring me here if you wanted me to not have an American life? (MORE) \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) We come here but we pretend like we're still back there? That's so stupid! \nAZMAT Don't you talk to your mother like that! \nKUMAIL You don't care what I think. You just want me to follow the rules. But the rules don't make sense to me. I don't pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in years. I just go down there and I play video games. \nAZMAT You don't believe in Allah? \nKUMAIL I don't know what I believe, Dad! I don't know. And I can't marry someone you find for me. \nSHARMEEN And why not? \nKUMAIL Because I'm in love with someone. I am. Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a therapist. And right now she's very sick but I couldn't tell you that. It makes me so sad that I couldn't tell you any of that. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I truly, truly do. And I know Islam has been really good for you, it has made you good people, but I don't know what I believe. I just need to figure it out on my own. \nKUMAIL What the fuck, you fucking idiot? \nKumail gets out of the car, runs to the pick up window. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human being. You're a human being. Look at me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck me! Look at me. PLEASE! \nSTU Today's my first day. \nKUMAIL Fuck you! \nKumail turns to the garbage can nearby and just starts pulling garbage out. He locks eyes with Stu. \nSTU I'll just ring you up for four burgers. \nSTU looks down and starts typing. \nKUMAIL I'm sorry. \nSTU (un-emotional) Do you want any fries or drink with that? \nKUMAIL I'll take four fries. I'm sorry. \nKumail begins to put the trash back in the trash can. \nINT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT \nParked, Kumail sits scarfing down burgers and fries. He gets a text from Chris: \"Where are you? You're up in \nKUMAIL Fuck! \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - SHOWROOM \nKumail enters. Big crowd. Mary's on stage. Chris runs up. \nCHRIS Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh wait, are you getting all dark and moody before your set? Yeah, punish yourself like a nasty little baby. \nKUMAIL I am not in the mood. Okay Chris? \nCHRIS I'll get you in the mood. \nKumail walks towards CJ and Sam. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) (to everyone) I'll get you all in the mood. \nCJ You all right? \nKUMAIL Why does everybody say the same fucking thing? Yeah, I'm doing great. \nCJ Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking. \nDodd runs up to Kumail. \nDODD The fuck've you been, man? You're on next! \nDodd runs off. On stage, Mary is doing well. Kumail's phone rings. It's Terry. Kumail hesitates. Then answers. We see Kumail's face. He doesn't say anything. On stage - Mary finishes her act. We hear Terry's voice on the call. \nTERRY (O.S.) Kumail, it's Terry. Listen, we're not moving here. The doctors, they said.. \nWe don't hear the rest of the call. \nDODD This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani! \nKumail is dazed. We see Bob Dalavan in the audience. \nINT. TRIPLE DOOR - CONTINUOUS \nKumail slowly walks up to the stage. He stands there silently, looking at the audience. Then, finally... \nKUMAIL Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? Like that's the name of it, it's called cheese. I saw all these news reports, and they were like, there's a new drug, it's called cheese. Everyone's doing it in the Midwest, kids are doing it. \nTitters. Barely anything. Bob Dalavan not laughing. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) It's just really hard to do stand-up comedy when your girlfriend is in a coma. \nThe audience laughs nervously. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Not quite sure what part you're laughing at. They say she's fighting, but she doesn't look like she's fighting. She looks like she's just laying there. I said horrible things to her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like she gets excited every time she sees a bird. She's like, look at this, it's a bird. And I'm always like, yeah, they're all over the place, they're birds. But she likes that bird. Every bird she sees, she sees it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HALLWAY - SAME \nCunningham speaks with Terry and Beth. \nDR. CUNNINGHAM Emily has a rare condition called Adult Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, which is strange. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection so it tries to fight it. It's like a big biological misunderstanding. \nTERRY Yeah, yeah. \nDR CUNNINGHAM We gave her anti-inflammatories and she stabilized within hours. She's gonna take time to recover but she'll be fine. \nTERRY Wow. \nINT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - SAME \nKumail speaks with Emily. \nEMILY What are you doing here? \nKUMAIL I was visiting someone down the hall and I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi to Emily. \nEMILY Oh. \nKUMAIL No, I'm joking, I was here for you. \nEMILY You're an asshole and I don't like you. \nKUMAIL I'm not an asshole. I'm really not. \nEMILY No, you're an asshole. \nKUMAIL You have a lot of drugs in you so you're not thinking as clearly. \nEMILY Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny to me. You just make me sad. You make me sad inside of my heart, and it makes me sad to look at you. So I think you should probably go. Just go and tell my mom I want her. \nKumail doesn't know what to say. \nEMILY (CONT'D) Will you please get my mom? \nKumail nods and heads out to the hallway. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nKumail goes up to Beth and Terry. \nKUMAIL Emily wants to see you. \nBeth goes back inside Emily's room. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I'm gonna head out. I don't think I should be here. \nTERRY Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your living condition is a potential health risk and you're not that funny. But.... you're probably not suited to do anything else either so that's troublesome-- \nKUMAIL You really made it sound like you were going to say something positive there. \nTERRY I guess I did, didn't I? You know I know the good stuff. You know how I feel. I gotta get in there. \nTerry heads back inside. \nINT. EMILY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTerry walks in. Beth sits on Emily's bed as Kumail watches through the window. Beth notices Kumail. \nEXT. EMILY'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nBeth comes outside into the hallway. \nKUMAIL So you gonna hang around Chicago for a while? \nBETH Yeah. She's got physical therapy. \nKUMAIL Did you ever think you'd be excited to have your daughter go through physical therapy? (beat) It's so strange that we could go through one of the most intense experiences of our lives together and just never see each other again. \nBeth puts her hands on Kumail's face. She looks at him. \nBETH Maybe. But I hope not. \nThey smile. Kumail walks out of the hospital. \nINT. COMEDY CLUB - A DIFFERENT NIGHT \nHe holds up a JAR FULL OF ASHES. \nEMILY What did you do? Did you cremate someone? \nKUMAIL These are the ashes of all the Pakistani women - not the women - the pictures of the Pakistani women. I thought this was a good idea, but it feels a little stupid. \nKumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But I've changed. And I am the person you need me to be. I really am. So, will you take me back? \nEMILY Kumail, I'm really glad that you went through this experience, but you have to understand that all that happened while I was asleep. Like you felt one way a few weeks ago and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way and the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look at all of this, and I just think, I can't do it again. I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand? \nKUMAIL Okay. \nKumail packs up his bag of devotion. \nSONG PLAYS... \"GET SHIT TOGETHER\" MONTAGE \n-- Kumail drives a passenger around. \n-- Kumail cleans his room. \n-- Sharmeen, Azmat, Naveed, and Fatima have a family dinner. Kumail's not there. \n-- Emily does physical therapy with Beth and Terry. \n-- Kumail drives passengers around. \n-- Emily, Beth, and Terry eat take out together. \n-- Kumail at the theater works on his one-man show. \n-- Emily in bed with Beth sleeping next to her. Terry by himself on the sofa. \n-- Kumail and CJ put up fliers for Kumail's one man show. \n-- Kumail makes a Facebook page for his one man show. \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nKumail enters the dining room without knocking on the door. Azmat, Sharmeen, Naveed, and Fatima are eating dinner. Kumail joins them. We see he has another LARGE BAG. \nKUMAIL Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I am a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not I get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous. Standard parliamentary procedure. So all those in favor of not kicking Kumail out of the family, raise your hand. \nKumail raises his hand. Everyone else stares silently. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the family, denied. So you guys can just talk to me. \nEveryone is silent. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was going to happen. I have a solution. \nKumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) \"Hi. How are you?\" It's just a real basic one. \"Pass the salt.\" Practical. \"Always with the comedy.\" Mom, made that one specially for you. \"Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome than your brother Naveed?\" \nNAVEED Bullshit. \nNaveed and Azmat exchange a look. \nKUMAIL I admit this one is designed to stir up some controversy. \"It's interesting how you can't really kick someone out of your family because they'll always be your family.\" I agree with that one. It's a good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here for you. \nKumail leaves the cards on the dining table. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry I lied about the girls and the LSAT and all of that. That was wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving to New York to pursue stand-up, but I am not leaving this family. \nKumail leaves. Eye contact around the table. \nINT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT \nEmily on her bed. She impulsively Googles Kumail and finds his MONTREAL AUDITION, which is described as \"WORST BOMB IN HISTORY!!!\" She plugs her headphones in and watches a beat. \nKUMAIL (V.O.) My parents want me to get arrange married. Or as it's called in Pakistan, romance! Earlier today, I told them everything. I told them about my life. I told them about Emily. They kicked me out of the family. I may never talk to them again. So that happened - \nKNOCK on the door. \nEMILY What is it? \nBETH (O.S.) Can I come in? \nEMILY I was in the neighborhood and I saw that you were gonna be here so I thought I'd come say hi. \nKUMAIL You look great. How's your blood oxygen level? \nEMILY Oh, well within range. \nKUMAIL Nice. \nThey stand there. It's tense. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Uh, this is my brother, Naveed. \nEMILY Hi, I'm Emily. \nNAVEED I've heard lots about you. \nEMILY It's so good to finally meet you. (to Kumail) There's actually something I wanted to tell you. \nNaveed clocks the tension between them. \nNAVEED Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye. \nNaveed slips out as Emily and Kumail stare at each other. \nINT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - SAME \nTerry lies on the pull out sofa. Just before Beth gets to Emily's room she stops. \nBETH Are you warm enough? \nTERRY Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of socks on. \nShe smiles, walks into Emily's bedroom. Terry gets under the covers. Beth reemerges and approaches his couch-bed. \nBETH Do you mind? \nTERRY No... no... \nBeth gets under the covers with him. They snuggle. \nBETH I'm glad we're going home tomorrow. \nTERRY Me too. See? I should have brushed my teeth. \nBETH I like it. \nINT. PLAYGROUND THEATRE - LATER \nKumail and Emily sit on the bed from his show together. \nEMILY When something like this happens, there's this sort of expectation that you're going to have this completely new lease on life and feel totally different about everything. Like cherish every sunrise. And for the most part I just feel like, ugh I can't get up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like I've been talking about myself so much. Are you doing a lot of stand-up? \nKUMAIL Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy Festival audition, like horrifically. \nEMILY I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be honest with you, it wasn't great. \nKUMAIL I know. \nEMILY But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I liked. \nKUMAIL I'm moving to New York. \nEMILY Really? \nKUMAIL Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna drive out. We have a place already. \nEMILY When do you leave? \nKUMAIL Next weekend. \nThis kinda hits them both like a ton of bricks. \nEMILY I'm so excited for you. That is great. I think you are going to do so great in New York. \nKUMAIL What were you going to say? \nEMILY What? \nKUMAIL You said you were going to say something to me. What was it? \n", "test1_input": "KUMAIL It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old lemon meringue pie? \nEMILY You're so funny! Actually, no, I just...I really need to get a cup of coffee. \nKUMAIL I can make you coffee. \nEMILY I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste. \nKUMAIL All right, I'll come with you. \nEMILY No, no! Why would you do that? \nKUMAIL It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna let you go on your own. \nEMILY Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's the most misogynist thing I've ever heard. \nKUMAIL Why are you being so weird? \nEMILY Fuck you, I'm not being weird. \nKUMAIL You're being so weird. \nEMILY Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're being so weird! \nKUMAIL How am I weird? I want to sleep while it's sleep time. \nEMILY This is normal. Girls go to get coffee in the middle of the night. Have you never had a girlfriend before? This is what it's like. \nKUMAIL Are you okay? \nEMILY Everything is not okay. Everything is not okay. \nKUMAIL You can tell me anything, you know that right? You can tell me anything. \nEMILY I have to take a shit, okay? I have to take a huge fucking dookie. I can't take a poo in your bathroom because you don't have any matches and you don't have any air freshener. What kind of person doesn't have any matches or air freshener in the bathroom? The walls are so thin! And Chris is right out there. \nKumail starts laughing. \nEMILY (CONT'D) Please stop laughing! Please, please. \nKUMAIL Okay, I have an idea. \nEXT. KUMAIL'S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER \nKumail sits on the stoop outside. After a beat, Emily sheepishly walks out and sits next to him. \nKUMAIL How are you? \nEMILY I do not want to talk about it. \nINT. BATTING CAGES - DAY \nNaveed fully geared up: batting helmet, gloves, elbow pad, eye-black. Kumail behind the backstop, watching. \nNAVEED Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about shifting weight and torque. \nA BALL ZINGS at Naveed, he misses completely. \nNAVEED (CONT'D) Oh Christ! \nKUMAIL Oh. \nAnother ball zings. Misses again. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa. \nAn 8-year old KID in a cage nearby cracks a clean hit. \nKUMAIL (CONT'D) Hey he's pretty good. Just do what he's doing. \nNaveed throws down his bat and exits the cage. \nINT. BATTING CAGE SNACK SHACK - LATER \nKumail and Naveed eat from tiffins & ramekins. They fork- fight over their meal. \nNAVEED Mine. \nKUMAIL Come on. \n", "test1_true": "KUMAIL These cookies are really good. \nNAVEED They're biscuits! Listen to yourself. You hardly sound Pakistani. \"Cookies\"? You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus. You're such a burger. \nKUMAIL I'm not a burger. \nNAVEED Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger. \nKUMAIL I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually a British term. \nNAVEED Well thank you for that information that no one gives a shit about and you should listen to mom and grow a beard. \nKUMAIL It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's all patchy. \nNAVEED Try being a man and conditioning like I do. \nKUMAIL What's the whole thing with Muslims growing beards anyway? It's such an arbitrary thing. Like who decided that? Oh, we have to have beards. \nNAVEED Yeah. There are a billion of us and you are the only one with the truth. Is that right? The sun is just shining down on you right now. It's just parting like \"ahh\". \nKUMAIL You know, I have to tell you something, Bhai. \nNAVEED Here we go. Yeah? \nKUMAIL I've been dating this girl. \nNAVEED Acha. \nKUMAIL \nShe's white. \nNAVEED I thought you were going to say you were involved in a hit and run or you got caught forging some checks. But a WHITE GIRL? Such a cliche. \nA white family stares in their direction. \nKUMAIL It's okay! We hate terrorists! \nNAVEED Listen. I understand. You're in America. You wanna mow a few lawns and see what it's like. But eventually you have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I hung out with other girls. But then I married Fatima. We hardly spoke two words to each other the first few months! But now, Kumi, she's like my best friend. You have to break up with her immediately. \nKUMAIL If I find someone who's as good for me as Fatima is for you, Mom would understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't love me less? \nNAVEED She would definitely love you less. Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the word when guys stop returning girls' calls? \nKUMAIL Ghosting? \nNAVEED Yes. (dead serious) You have to end it now or Mom will fucking ghost you. \nNaveed gets up. \nNAVEED (CONT'D) Now come on. \nHe exits, leaving Kumail alone at the table. \nINT. GRAD PARTY - LATER \nKumail and Emily are sipping wine out of plastic cups. \nEMILY I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd say it's very fruit forward. \nKUMAIL Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice that's gone bad. How do you know so much about wine? \nEMILY Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my first marriage and I drank a lot and one way to cover drinking is to know a lot about wine. \nKUMAIL I'm sorry wait, what did you say? \nEMILY That knowing a lot about wine sort of covers for drinking a lot. \nKUMAIL No, the huge piece of information you're trying to blow right past. \nEMILY Yeah. I was married. \nKUMAIL You were married? \nEMILY I was. I was married. Do you want to talk about something else? \nKUMAIL Yeah, cause I don't really have any questions other than...when did you get married? When did you get divorced? What's his name? How tall is he? Did you love him? I guess I have a couple of questions. \nEMILY Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in college. Everyone I knew was getting married super young, so we did. And one day I was at a restaurant and I saw this couple making out and I thought \"I don't think about my husband like that, but I guess that's okay\" and then another part of my brain was like \"NO IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE\". I feel like this is freaking you out. Does this freak you out? \n", "test1_id": 2103, "test2_input": "EXT. CITY VIEW     HOSPITAL - LATER \nA MASSIVE HOSPITAL looms over a quiet residential area. \nINT. CITY VIEW HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nKumail walks up to the reception desk. \nKUMAIL Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um, Emily Gardner? She was checked in... \nA MAN is rolled in a stretcher by EMTs.   The nurses run off. \nINT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER \nKumail walks by curtained beds hearing screams, wailing, moaning. He finally sees Emily in a bed, hooked up to wires and monitors. She looks scared, a bit sedated. \nKUMAIL Hey. \nEMILY What are you doing here? \nKUMAIL Jessie called me and wanted me to make sure you were okay. So how are you doing? \nEMILY Fine. Totally fine. Never been better. A thousand percent fine. Just like fainted a little at work. I didn't have breakfast this morning. \nKUMAIL Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You know that. \nNURSE BETTE Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready soon. Okay? \nEMILY Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home and sleep in my own bed. \nNURSE BETTE Sir, can you step outside a moment, please? If you want to stay you have to go to the security desk to get a pass. \nKUMAIL Where is the security desk? \nNURSE BETTE It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked in. At the security desk. \nKUMAIL The security desk is at the security desk. Got it. \nINT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM   - LATER \nEmily is propped up. Kumail next to her. He has a badge. \nKUMAIL Can I get you something? Water. Juice. Coffee? \nEmily is essentially passed out. Kumail isn't sure what to do. NURSE JUDY brings in a doctor. DR. WRIGHT, 30s, looks over at Kumail. \nDR. WRIGHT May I speak with you for a second? \nKUMAIL (to Emily) I'll be right back. \nINT. ICU ROOM HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS \nKumail follows Dr. Wright out to a busy hallway. \nDR. WRIGHT There is a massive infection in her lungs. All her vitals are elevated. Does she have HIV? \nKUMAIL What? No. I mean she-- \nDR. WRIGHT Are you her husband? \nKUMAIL No-- \nDR. WRIGHT We need to intubate her immediately. I need a family member to sign this. So I'm going to ask you again. Are you her husband? \nKUMAIL What does \"intubate\" mean? \nDR. WRIGHT We have to put her on a respirator and to do that we need to put her in a medically induced coma. \nKUMAIL Coma. \nDR. WRIGHT Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on the infection. And it needs to happen right now. So, I'm going to ask you one last time, are you her husband? \nKumail signs the forms. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nDr. Wright and Orderlies rush Emily down the hallway on a GURNEY. Kumail runs with them. Trying to keep up. \nEMILY What's going on?! Where are you taking me? \n", "test2_true": "NURSE JUDY You should call her family. \nINT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM \nKumail, freaked out, stares at Emily, hooked up to various wires on her arms and chest. He sees her purse and digs out her iPhone. It's locked. He looks over at Emily. \nKUMAIL I'm sorry. \nHe puts her finger on the phone. It unlocks. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKumail scrolls down to PARENTS on Emily's phone and dials. A WOMAN'S VOICE picks up, \"Hello?\"... \nKUMAIL Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail, Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be calling you so late. Emily's fine. Just want to get that taken care of. She's fine. She is at City View Hospital in Chicago in a medically induced coma. But the doctors say that- - Yes I did say coma. \nINT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - LATER \nKumail sits in a chair looking at Emily who is hooked up to a breathing machine. \nHe dozes off. \nINT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM- NEXT MORNING \nKumail sleeps. He wakes up to a COUPLE sitting by Emily's bed. TERRY, 50's, rumpled, BETH, 50's, put- together. \nKUMAIL Hey. I'm Kumail. \nBETH We know who you are Kumail. \nThey're clearly tired, terrified. Nurse Judy enters. \nNURSE JUDY Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would like to see you now. \nBETH (whispers, to Emily) Be right back. \nThey leave. Kumail awkwardly follows them. \nINT. BEREAVEMENT ROOM- MOMENTS LATER (SUNDAY MORNING) \nKumail, Terry, Beth sit. A waterfall coos. Meditations on the wall: \"Darkest Nights Produce The Brightest Stars\"; \"Grief is love's unwillingness to let go\", etc. \nNURSE JUDY Listen, the doctor will be here any minute. She's just running a little late. Don't read anything into this being in the bereavement room. It was the only room we had available. \nTERRY Okay. Thank you. \nShe exits.    Terry nervously taps on his knees, annoying Beth. \nBETH Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane. \nTERRY I know, I know. But it makes me feel better. \nThe doctor walks in. \nDR. CUNNINGHAM Hello. \nBeth and Terry stand to greet her. \nDR. CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D) Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's attending. I'll be coordinating all the doctors and orchestrating her treatment strategy. \nBETH \"All the doctors\"? How many are there? \nDR. CUNNINGHAM Five. \nBETH Five? Why so many? Is that normal? \nDr. CUNNINGHAM Yes, it's standard with patients in the ICU. We come at it from different angles-- \nWhen we cut back it is a different person now. DR. LEWIN. Terry, Kumail and Beth stay but the doctors change. \nDR. LEWIN We immediately initiated orotracheal intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected her heart at this point. \nCUT TO: \nDR. WHELAN We don't know the exact nature of the infection yet, but we've got her on a broad spectrum of antibiotics. \nCUT TO: \nDR. PLATT ...critical infections centering around the costodiaphragmatic-- \n", "test2_id": 2104, "test3_input": "DR. SPELLMAN She should be up by tomorrow morning at the latest. We'll also test the pleural fluid from the thoracentesis so we can create a more targeted antibiotic strategy. \nBETH So this is good news? \nDR. SPELLMAN It's very good news. We'll just hold onto her for a few more days and then you can have her back. \nTERRY She's a fighter, right? \nDR. SPELLMAN Yes. \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nKumail eating with his family. \nSHARMEEN I was so worried. We saw on the news that a train derailed and we thought that you were on the train and you had died. \nKUMAIL Nobody died on that train, Ma. \nSHARMEEN But did they look under the train? \nAZMAT So, where were you last night? What were you doing? \nKUMAIL Nothing. I wasn't doing anything. \nSHARMEEN Kumail. \nKUMAIL Alright, I'll tell you. I was... studying for the LSAT. \nSHARMEEN Really? \nKUMAIL Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm gonna go to law school, become a lawyer, and do law. \nThe doorbell rings. Sharmeen gets up. \nSHARMEEN Oh, let me see who that could be. \nShe exits. \nKUMAIL Really, Dad? You said that nobody was gonna come. That it was gonna be just us. \nNAVEED Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him? \nKUMAIL Yeah, I know. \nFATIMA He should be on Saturday Night Live. \nNAVEED SNL. \nSharmeen returns with Khadija. \nSHARMEEN Everybody remember Khadija? She just dropped in. She was just in the neighborhood. \nKhadija waves awkwardly, and her parents, FARHAN and TINA appear. \nSHARMEEN (CONT'D) And these are her parents, Farhan and Tina. They also just dropped in. \nINT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - LATER \nTina holds forth in Urdu. The grown-ups laugh. Khadija tries to lock eyes with Kumail. \nEXT. KHADIJA'S HOUSE - LATER \nKumail walks Khadija to her door. \nKHADIJA I've just been through so many of these appointments and I never have anything in common with the guys. You know when girls at work complain about dating, I just want to body slam them. They have no idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm becoming the bruised apple at the bottom of the apple bucket. \nKUMAIL No, no. You're not. \nKHADIJA I am. \nKUMAIL You're not. \nKHADIJA So do you want to hangout sometime? Like without our parents? Have you been to the cat cafe? The cats just come up to you and nestle in your lap and you just pet them. \nKUMAIL I don't think that's a good idea. \nKHADIJA You don't like cats? \nKUMAIL I mean I don't think it's a good idea for us to hangout again. It's not you. You're fantastic. I just can't do this arranged marriage thing -- with anybody. \n", "test3_true": "KUMAIL It wasn't my idea. \nKHADIJA I'm just really tired. Do you ever want to just be in a relationship so you can finally relax? \nKUMAIL I'm sorry. You deserve better than me. \nKHADIJA People are always telling me what I deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so sorry about everything. I'm gonna go. \nKhadija starts walking to her front door, then stops and turns back to Kumail. \nKHADIJA (CONT'D) And you know what? I watched the X-Files, like three whole episodes, and it's a bad show. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nBeth, Terry, and Kumail sit. Beth and Terry with their laptops, Kumail with his iPhone. Each diligently typing. We see they're each looking things up on WebMD. \nTERRY Wow, they should call this website, \"Everything is Cancer Dot Com\". Everything you put in, it could be cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on. You take the fun out of hiccups now. \nBETH Do you know this is the 17th best hospital in Chicago? \nTERRY Really? Out of how many? \nBETH I don't know, but Northwestern's number one. \nTERRY Well how do they rate it? What's their methodology? \nBETH I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad. \nTERRY It's not great, unless the sample size is, you know, that all depends. \nKUMAIL Here, look at the comments. \nTERRY This is why I don't want to go online cause it's never good. You go online, they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best movie ever. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER \nTerry talks on his cellphone and paces. Dr. Cunningham tracks him down. \nDR. CUNNINGHAM Terry - Hi. Can we talk? \nTERRY Yeah. \nDR. CUNNINGHAM We got the biopsy results. They are unfortunately inconclusive. We are concerned- \nMusic drowns out the rest of their conversation as Terry looks increasingly distraught. \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER \nTerry speaks with Beth and Kumail. \nTERRY They couldn't find out what the disease was, or where the virus came from or the bacteria or whatever. \nKUMAIL But they took out the infection so it shouldn't matter? \nTERRY I know, that's what I said but her vitals didn't normalize. And now they say that the infection is continuing to spread, it's in her kidneys. \nKUMAIL But the kidneys are so far from the lungs. \nTERRY I know, it's an aggressive infection and they said what they gotta do now is figure out what this mystery disease actually is. \nBETH I'm calling Northwestern. \nTERRY Just hold on, hold on. \nBETH Terry! Goddammit! \nKUMAIL I think we should talk about this-- \nBETH --You shut up! I'm sick of this shit, Terry. We're getting her out of here! \nTERRY They're in the middle of the whole process of elimination. \nBETH So you're saying Northwestern can't take that information and continue the search? This place is a shithole. \nShe looks towards the other people in the waiting room. \nBETH (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that? \nShe takes her bag from Anna. \n", "test3_id": 2105}

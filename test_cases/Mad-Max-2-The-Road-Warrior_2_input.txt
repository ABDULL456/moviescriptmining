MECHANIC - Go on! Go! Just another mercenary! He spits. MAX ignores him, dragging the plate past Pappagallo's tent. It is crowded with CAMP PEOPLE, laying their plans for escape. They fall silent, turning to watch MAX. 
104, COMPOUND WALL. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 104. The black-on-black waits next to the fence, near the place where the Mohawkers attempted to build the "bridge of cars" across the ditch. MAX has cut a hole in the barbed wire and is manouevrin6 the metal plate on top of the first car starting to build a ramp from thw, compound, over the top of the cars and onto the far side of the ditch. 
DISSOLVE. 
105, INSIDE THE COMPOUND. LATER THAT NIGHT. 105 The HUMUNGUS has stepped up his theatrics of terror. His voice booms across the night - reciting dark poetic descriptions of death and hell. The CAMP PEOPLE, gathered in Pappagallo's tent, watch as the GYRO CAPTAIN walks towards the spot where MAX is working. PAPPAGALLO sits at his desk,flicki.ng an egg timer: the sand trickling from one end to the other. E. fs 
106. CUMI'OUNU WALL. BRIDGE OF CARS. NIGHT. 106, MAX, who is locking the last metal plate into position, looks up at the GYRO CAPTAIN. 
GYRO CAPTAIN I just want you to know that I don't agree with them, He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent. 
GYRO CAPTAIN I don't think you're a coward. A bit stupid - but not a coward, Where else you gonna find what we 've got here? Food... fuel... clean women. MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to the ramp. 
GYRO CAPTAIN Men, too, if that's your inclination. Jesus! All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you driving the tanker we can do it. I know you can. I saw you out there. Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker. MAX gets up, snaking his head. 
MAX I haven't got time to explain. Just believe me - I've got everything I want. The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him short. 
MAX Good luck tomorrow. I hope you make it. Sc. 106. Cont. 
106. cont. 106, MAX puts out his hand. â¢ The CAPTAIN, a little surprised, shakes hands with him. 
GYRO CAPTAIN Thanks. Thanks a lot. The CAPTAIN walks back towards the GROUP watching from Pappagallo's tent. He shrugs his shoulders. MAX opens the door of the black-on-black.

LeBoeuf There. 
Rooster There?! My bullet! 
LeBoeuf Your bullet? If you hit what you aim at, eckshplain my shoulder! 
Mattie Gentlemen, shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang. 
Rooster One more, this will prove it. Hold fire! 
He tosses a corn dodger and fires. It holds to its arc and falls. LeBoeuf is smug. 
LeBoeuf Azh I shed, Khoghburn. 
Rooster roars: 
Rooster Did you not see the piece fly off?! 
RIDING 
Some time later. 
Rooster sways in the saddle, holding a bottle, humming. 
He tips his head up and tilts the bottle all the way back, confirming that this one too is now empty. 
Riding forward, he leans out of the saddle, stretching low to one side, his hand extended with the bottle. Wavering, he places it upon a large rock as he passes. 
His arm waves for balance as he straightens but he keeps his place on the horse. He half- turns, propping himself with one hand on his saddle-back, to address Mattie and LeBoeuf: 
Rooster Find our way back! 
SKY 
Framed by a mine entrance. 
Rooster steps into the square, wood-beam frame of the entrance, looking in. 
A beat, and he pulls out his six-gun and fires in. 
Echoing ricochets. 
Wide outside: Rooster before the entrance; Mattie and LeBoeuf standing close by. Very still. 
The little camp is deserted. 
Rooster turns to pan the hills. 
At length: 
Rooster Lucky Ned! 
Very faint echo. 
Faintly, from our distant perspective: 
LeBoeuf Very good, Khoghburn. Now what. 
CRACKLING CAMPFIRE 
It is raining. 
The campfire is roughly canopied by a hide draped at a cant over a pair of tree branches. 
Mattie pours hot water from a kettle into a large tin cup holding a corn dodger. She takes a fork and starts mashing the dodger into mush. 
LeBoeuf sits before the fire, coat over his head, one hand on his jaw, which is swollen. 
LeBoeuf Cogburn does not want me eating out of his store. 
Mattie That is silly. You have not eaten the whole day, and it is my store not his. 
Rooster Let him starve! 
Rooster, bellicose, stumbles to the fire with a few thin branches. As he leans in toward the fire the water draining off the low edge of the canopy drums onto his neck. He waves a hand back at it like a man swatting flies. Rooster He does not track! He does not shoot--except at foodstuffs!-- 
LeBoeuf That wazh your idea. 
Rooster --He does not contribute! He is a millstone, with opinions! He is a man who walks in front of bullets!

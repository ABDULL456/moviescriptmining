134. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE REC ROOM. EVENING 
Young athletes, some tall, some short, some heavyset, some not, are sitting on refectory chairs to watch TV. Ali does too. His hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven. He looks younger. He could be a student. 
135. EXT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. NIGHT/DAY 
A truck rushes headlong through the countryside. First it is day, then night. 
136. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. DAY 
Through the window, Ali sees a twelve-ton Scania pull to a stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn. Ali runs out to meet it. 
137. EXT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE - PARKING LOT. DAY 
Richard lowers his window. 
RICHARD I can't come in any further or I won't be able to get back out! Ali checks out the huge semi. 
ALI Looks like you changed trucks! 
RICHARD Bosses, in fact. I'm back to being exploited. Ali doesn't insist. Richard opens his door to let out Sam who is already trampling him, trying to get out. 
RICHARD (to Sam) Got everything? Your bag, your coat, your hat, your mittens? You haven't forgotten anything? Now give me a kiss. Sam gives him a kiss. Richard slips him out and into Ali's arms. 
ALI How are things there? 
RICHARD They're okay. 
ALI My sister? 
RICHARD She found a job at a school cafeteria. She seems to enjoy it. 
ALI Does she know about today? 
RICHARD Yes. She says it's good for the kid. 
ALI Tell her I can't help out for the time being but that as soon as I have a little money... 
RICHARD Don't worry. When's your fight? 
ALI Next month. On the 9th. Richard smiles admiringly. 
RICHARD Keep us posted if you win. 
ALI Sure I will. 
RICHARD Yeah, right... Okay, I'm off. I'll deliver my load in Colmar and pick up the kid at around 7, okay? 
ALI Okay. 
RICHARD No later, because I have to be back tomorrow at 11. The two men say good-bye. Sam waves good-bye. 
138. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAY 
A path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees. Ali pulls a plastic sled with Sam on top. Whenever there is a slope, he lets Sam glide down it and runs after him. Snow falls from the trees. He looks up and sees a couple of squirrels jump from branch to branch. Sam has never seen any before. Ali neither. Sunlight filters through the branches. A group of cross- country skiers trudges by. 
SAM I want to skate too! 
ALI They're not skating. They're skiing.

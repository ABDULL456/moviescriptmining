FISHER (semi-gone) What happened? Oh my God... 
MICHAEL We were playing... she slipped... she hit her head. 
ADAM (incredulous) Playing? 
SUITE 
Adam moves into the living room, heads for the phone. Boyd intercepts him. They wrestle for the phone. 
BOYD Wait! 
ADAM What? 
BOYD What are you doing? 
ADAM (hysterical) What are you talking about? 
BOYD What do you think you are doing? 
ADAM I'm calling the ambulance. 
BOYD Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing? 
ADAM Calling the ambulance. 
BOYD Why? (beat) Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance? 
A reasonable point. BEAT. 
ADAM We have to call the ambulance. 
BOYD Why? 
Fisher entering, freaked... 
FISHER Oh, Jesus... call the police. 
BOYD No. 
FISHER She's dead. Call somebody! 
BOYD Shut up. 
FISHER Call 911. 
BOYD Shut up. 
MICHAEL She slipped. 
ADAM (attacking Michael) What did you do? 
MICHAEL (defensive) You never heard of accidents?! Get off me! 
Adam slaps Michael. Moore tries to break it up. 
BOYD Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME! 
SILENCE. 
BOYD Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First... are we sure she's dead? 
ADAM Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating. 
MOORE She's dead. 
MICHAEL It was an accident! 
BOYD Are you sure this was an accident? 
ADAM You're a lying deviant. What did you do?! 
MICHAEL The floor was wet. She slipped! 
ADAM Why was the floor wet? 
MICHAEL I don't know why the floor was wet! 
ADAM Why?! 
Fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is; they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the b.g. 
BOYD Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.

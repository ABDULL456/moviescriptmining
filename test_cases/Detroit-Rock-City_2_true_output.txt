Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the whole car gets a great laugh for a while. 
They finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes. Lex still has the joint now as Christine looks at it. 
CHRISTINE Man, this is some kickass shit! (beat) Gimme a hit off that jay will ya? 
Lex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to her as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
HELLO DETROIT, GOODBYE TICKETS! 
MONTAGE 
The Volvo passing a big sign that says: "Welcome to Michigan, the Great Lakes State." 
The Volvo racing toward the Detroit skyline. 
Detroit landmarks: The General Motors Building, the Ford Building, Motown Records, and finally... 
COBO HALL, where thousands of fans in KISS tees gather, waiting for its doors to open. 
Unbelievable traffic stretches to an intersection at which stand four key landmarks... a cathedral, a convenience store, a parking lot, and a male strip joint. They face one another, each on its own corner. 
A gigantic sign on the auditorium's facade flashes the commandment, "YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY" over and over again. 
EXT. COBO HALL - SUNSET 
The sun hangs low on this day as the Volvo sits in traffic, passing Cobo Hall. Movement is nearly impossible. 
KISS FANS cram every square foot of open macadam, pushing through the jammed cars. STREET VENDORS hawk KISS souvenirs from tee-shirts to pennants. Some are in stands along the sidewalk. Others come right up to car windows. 
INT. VOLVO - SUNSET 
Christine is fast asleep between Jam and Lex. 
LEX Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella. 
TRIP (whispers lustfully) Let's lift up her shirt. 
HAWK (pointing out windshield) There it is! 
All look ahead. COBO Hall. A HALO GLOW forms around the building accompanied by a CHOIR OF ANGELS. 
JAM (in reverence) We made it! 
LEX Curly driving, Hawk. We still got two hours to spare. 
HAWK Ample time to grab our tickets at the station. See, up ahead. W.A.R.P. 
One block on the left is the W.A.R.P. tower. 
HAWK Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes. 
JAM Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me. 
The opening to the Carpenters' "TOP OF THE WORLD" begins. 
INT. W.A.R.P. TOWER ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
"TOP OF THE WORLD" continues, playing through the speaker of the ascending elevator inside which Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam stand. They watch the numbers climb, smiling. 
HAWK What was that D.J.'s name again? 
TRIP Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar... 
INT. SIMPLE SIMON'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam poke their heads around the corner of an office doorway totem pole-style. 
HAWK Simple Simon? 
SIMPLE SIMON strikes a pose before a full-length mirror in a glittery-back Gene Simmons tee-shirt, silver pants, and very high heel boots. He has a huge Afro and bushy moustache. He turns when he hears Hawk. 
SIMPLE SIMON The one and only. But can you kids hurry this up? I'm due at Coco Hall in half an hour for the warm-up. 
They all enter and stand at Simple Simon's desk.

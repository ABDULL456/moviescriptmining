INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin. 
The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver. 
OLIVER (so high he's wobbling) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain. 
No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil. 
OLIVER (continuing) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He drifts between the two.  Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes. 
ERIC [Cotton.] 
Ricardo hands him a cotton ball. 
OLIVER (continuing) It's really quite brilliant you know. That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show. 
Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture. 
ERIC (to Oliver) [Here, shut up and hold this.] 
He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe. 
Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it. 
ERIC [Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins.] 
They all laugh at this. 
INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture. 
JEAN Do you want heroin? 
ZED No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow. 
Jean and Claude laugh at this. 
JEAN No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right. 
Jean snorts a line. 
Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no". 
CLAUDE Okay. 
JEAN (recovering from the snort) That's good. 
Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing. 
Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed.  Francois sits on the floor. 
Eric rolls up his sleeve. 
ERIC (to Ricardo in French) [Hold my arm.] (then to Zed) My vein is like a rock. 
Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the syringe, then all the way back in. 
He withdraws the needle. 
Ricardo lets go of his arm. 
Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep. 
Then Jean takes another snort. 
Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer. 
Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it. 
JEAN (to Zed) Try some.  It's called chasing the dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it for centuries. 
ZED I don't think so. 
JEAN Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper. 
They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke. 
Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

BOURNE off the tram -- GUNS appear -- 
BOURNE runs to his left -- stops short -- 
The other cops are coming this way -- SCREAMING at him -- 
Not a lot of options -- BOURNE looks over the rail -- 
DOWN BELOW 
A COAL BARGE passing, the prow just emerging -- 
BOURNE 
On the rail and JUMPING even as the FIRST SHOT is fired -- 
239   EXT. DOUBLE COAL BARGE -- NIGHT                           239 
BOURNE lands hard -- stands -- voltage going up one leg -- 
And they're SHOOTING at him. 
He can worry about the leg later.   He RUNS. 
Back toward them! 
The barge moving slow -- BOURNE disappears under the bridge. 
240   EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT                               240 
Guns aimed, POLICE waiting for a clear shot.   TWO OF THEM DASH to watch over the other side. 
241      EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE -- NIGHT                             241 
Countering -- the barge going one way -- BOURNE the other -- dodging all the super-structure on deck -- all the while keeping his cover overhead -- 
And LEAPING to the second barge! 
And more of the same, until -- 
BOURNE running out of barge -- 
LEAPING back onto the BRIDGE FOOTING and -- 
242      EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT                                242 
THE POLICE watching the barge fully emerge -- continuing down river -- SHOUTING IN GERMAN that he's either "in the water" or "hiding on the barge". 
Off they go -- down the stairs -- 
Leaving the PASSENGERS on the tram blinking out in shock -- 
And BOURNE -- climbing back over the rail -- 
Limping back on the tram just before -- 
The DOORS CLOSE -- and off it goes -- 
243      EXT. NEXT BRIDGE DOWN -- NIGHT                             243 
POL   ICE converge from both ends -- Barge goes under as KIR   ILL arrives at the center of the bridge -- missed aga   in -- behind KIRILL, a train snakes off into the nig   ht...

CRONIN moves around the bedroom, then into the bathroom          * and --                                                           *

CRONIN                                     * Pam, you need to see this.                             * 
PAMELA moves in behind him.                                      * 
CRONIN (CONT'D)                         * Who's Neski?                                           * 
Both of them staring.                                            *

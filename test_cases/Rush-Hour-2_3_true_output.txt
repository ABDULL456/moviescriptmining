LEE Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood for your bullshit. 
Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're about to come to blows. 
CARTER What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper? 
LEE I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok. 
CARTER Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy. 
LEE Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass! 
CARTER I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw. 
LEE No.  She's a school teacher. 
CARTER You're not very good at this, are you? 
LEE Good at what? 
CARTER Forget it. 
A long beat while Lee considers what to say. 
LEE Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case. 
CARTER Ask me if I give a shit. 
Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell. 
LEE Ricky Tan killed my father. 
Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee. 
LEE (CONT'D) He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along. (beat) Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty. 
CARTER How the hell did Tan get away with it? 
LEE All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly. 
CARTER (pause) This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me... (realizing) This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right? 
Lee's caught, fibs badly. 
LEE No, no, that would be crazy -- 
CARTER You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing... 
LEE I thought you'd think it was crazy. 
CARTER IT IS CRAZY! 
LEE I know.  I know.  I am sorry. 
Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and yells. 
CARTER So are you getting on the plane or not?! 
LEE What? 
CARTER Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first. 
LEE I cannot go to LA... 
Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the cop beneath the attitude.

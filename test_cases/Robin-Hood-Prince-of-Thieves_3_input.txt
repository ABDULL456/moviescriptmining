CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Break one open! FRIAR (nervous) Why waste fine vintage, my lord? A cask is shattered... wine torrents out. WILL SCARLET Try another. There are many barrels, only a few outlaws. A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the steps -- Wulf. Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes a flame. 
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks the man's view. SENTRY What is your business, woman? FANNY Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear. Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly view up 'ere, ain't it? She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times. He slumps unconscious. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree- branch crutch. WOUNDED SOLDIER Give room for a fightin' man and his ma. Step aside, or I'll make ya. I wanna see the bastards walk on air. 
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses. FANNY 'Bout time, ya gurt lug. She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an arrow. FANNY We be too late. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround the base. The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose. SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the barrels. A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow. The executioner's eyes glint through the slits. Nottingham intently watches Wulf. The Chieftain stands, impassive. Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns. Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close. An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye slit. The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap. Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight. Little John yells.   Fanny screams. A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch... Robin! Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the choking cord. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape. The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked... by the Celt with the boar's head. KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass confusion. Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's rope. He hauls him onto the platform. 
Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig... It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his arm. HAL Here... By God... Let's fight 'em! WOODSMAN Hal! What happened to your stutter? HAL It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap! A guard attacks, Hal fells him. HAL Take that, ya mug. No stutter this time!    The woodsmen join battle with the guards. The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head. The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan. CHIEFTAIN Impostor!   You dishonor the clan. Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering blows. 
FROM PARAPET John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him. LITTLE JOHN Fight fair... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He aims.   Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a shaft. LITTLE JOHN ...Or don't fight at all.

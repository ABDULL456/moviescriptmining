FERGUS Dil, this is Jude. 
DIL You following me? 
JUDE Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil? 
DIL Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy? 
JUDE That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say. 
DIL Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose. 
JUDE Don't go looking for it, Dil. 
DIL Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday. 
JUDE A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy? 
DIL A girl has to have a bit of glamour. 
JUDE Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James... 
She leaves. Dil watches her go. 
DIL It's her, isn't it? 
FERGUS What's her? 
DIL She's the thing you had to tell me. 
FERGUS Kind of. 
DIL I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry. 
She looks at Col 
DIL You see that, Col? 
COL Saw it, Dil. 
DIL Fuck it, is what I say. 
COL Yeah. Fuck it, Dil. 
DIL Fucking men, Col -- 
COL Fuck 'em. 
There are tears in her eyes. She stands. 
DIL And fuck you, Jimmy -- 
She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very small. 
COL You could always make it up to her. 
FERGUS How? 
COL When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed. 
FERGUS She's not a girl, Col -- 
COL Whatever you say. 
But Fergus rises and walks out. 
EXT. METRO - NIGHT. 
A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting. 
JUDE She went that way -- 
Jude grabs his arm. 
JUDE But you come with me. 
She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting. They get inside. 
ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB. 
Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting in the car. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT. 
In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her. Fergus sits in the back.

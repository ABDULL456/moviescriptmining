MAN What the fuck. 
WATTS Hey, we can go. 
The man is confused. 
MAN What do you want? 
WATTS Nothing. 
The man goes to pick up the phone to call the police. Watts stops, turns and get's in his face. 
WATTS (CONT'D) No need for that, we are leaving. 
Watts, Zoe and Martha walk to the front door. 
Patrick appears behind the man. 
PATRICK Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt. 
MAN What do you want? 
PATRICK We're not stealing, we don't want anything. 
MAN Just get out. 
PATRICK We're just looking at the house. It's nice. (BEAT) We didn't realize you were home. We wouldn't have come in otherwise. 
MAN Just Leave. 
PATRICK I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police. 
MAN I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe. 
PATRICK Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine. 
MAN Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go. 
Martha walk outside. Patrick just stands there, he won't leave. Katie and Zoe walk out of the other room and are standing behind the Man. They don't move. He feels surrounded. 
MAN (CONT'D) Get the fuck out of my house. 
Martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door. No one knows what to do. The girls are looking to Patrick but he's not doing anything. Suddenly Katie lunges at the man and stabs him in the neck. Blood spurts out and she stabs him again in the ribs. 
They all run out. 
INT. FARM BEDROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Martha is in a small wood paneled room lying on a mattress. She is stunned. 
She looks through the open door to see Katie and Watts washing in the bathroom. 
Patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with Martha. Martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep. 
PATRICK Look at me. 
Patrick runs his hands through her hair. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) You okay? 
MARTHA Uh huh.

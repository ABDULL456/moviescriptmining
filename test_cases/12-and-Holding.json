{"train": "12 AND HOLDING \nWritten by \nAnthony S Cipriano \nFADE IN: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING \nTWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes through a suburban neighborhood. \nRudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS. \nINT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS \nRudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop. Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys cautiously look around and whisper. \nJACOB You see `em? \nRUDY No. But that doesn't mean they're not here. \nAfter a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their safety. \nRUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Jacob, come on. It's cool. \nSuddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground. \nRudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and debris come flying at him. \nAs Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his mask. He quickly runs for the tree. \nTWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come running out of the woods, rocks in hand. \nRudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him. \nINT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid. \nJACOB What the hell is that? \nRUDY Piss. \nRudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny. \nEXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nNow drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree, screaming. They try to shake the urine off. \nKenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up to the boys. \nKENNY You and your deformed brother are dead! \nINT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nJacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted. \nRUDY (calling to Kenny) Anytime you're ready, dickhead. \nEXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nJeff and Kenny walk off. \nKENNY They're fucking dead! \nJeff runs off screen and throws up. \nINT. FISHER HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING \nLEONARD FISHER (12), severely obese, sits at the dinner table, eating pancakes. \nHis FATHER, PATRICK (35) and TWO YOUNGER SISTERS, HALEY (8) and SARA (6) are seated with him. They are all overweight. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLEONARD'S MOTHER, GRACE (35), the largest of them all, crosses to the table, sits and starts eating. \nJUMP CUTS show the progression of their meal. From globs of syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks. \nEST. EXT. CHUNG RESIDENCE - MORNING \nRUDY Don't be such a pussy. \nLEONARD Yeah, I could probably take them both myself. \nRUDY What are you gonna do, Leonard, eat them? \nJACOB All I'm saying is, who cares if they tear it down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRUDY This is OUR place. We've been coming here since we were seven. \nJACOB Nothing lasts forever. \nRUDY You're such a butt-munch. \nRudy pushes Jacob.   Jacob pushes back.   The two start fighting. \nMALEE You guys, it's your birthday. Could you try and get along? \nOff the boy's fighting - \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON \nYacco sits across from DEBBIE POOLE (42), housewife, conservatively dressed. \nDEBBIE I don't think therapy is helping. \nYACCO Why do you say that?   Are you still \"cutting\"? \nEmbarrassed, Maggie lifts up her shirt sleeve. We see that her arm is covered with cuts. Dried blood is everywhere. Yacco is horrified by the sight. \nYACCO (cont'd) Oh, Debbie. \nDEBBIE It feels much better than it looks. Really. \nSuddenly, Malee bursts into her mother's office. \nMALEE Ma, I... Oops. \nYACCO Malee, out. Now. \nMALEE I'm sorry. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMalee quickly exits the office. \nYACCO Excuse me for a moment. \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS \nYacco enters the reception area.       She is obviously angry. \nYACCO I told you a 100 times to knock. \nMALEE I said, I was sorry. \nYACCO Why aren't you with the boys? \nMALEE Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with their parents. \nYacco crosses to a desk and removes a FLUTE from a drawer. \nYACCO I found this in the backseat of my car this morning. Do you know how much flutes cost?   Go outside, sit on the front steps and practice. \nMALEE But, mom. \nYACCO Now! \nAngered, Malee grabs the flute and exits. \nEXT. FRONT OF YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMalee drops on the stoop like a ton of bricks.      After a beat, she reluctantly begins playing her flute. \nA few pedestrians stop to listen. \nMALEE Keep it moving. This ain't a show. \nJIM I already told you, Gabe, I'm not selling that land. Not 30 acres not five. \nGABE I'm willing to pay top dollar. \nJIM I'm not gonna let you tear down those woods, so you can stack twenty houses right on top of each other. \nGABE I'm gonna write down a number. \nJIM No! My kids... hell, your kids play in those woods all the time. You can't put a price on that. \nGabe writes down a number and hands it to Jim. \nGABE I believe I can. \nJim looks at the figure and his eyes go wide. \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nA line of PICNIC TABLES surround nearby GRILLS. Leonard's family minus Leonard sit, eating as if there's no tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSOCCER MOM # 1 (O.S.) Look at them. So unhealthy. \nON TWO SOCCER MOMS, watching Leonard's family eat. \nSOCCER MOM # 1 (cont'd) You know, Grace can barely walk because of her weight. \nSOCCER MOM # 2 Where do you think she finds clothes big enough to fit? \nThe two woman walk off. As they disperse, we see LEONARD, standing behind them. He has heard every word. \nHurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted. \nPatrick rises and crosses over to the buffet table. \nPATRICK Good eating, huh son? \nPatrick grabs the ladle and begins to fill up his plate. \nLEONARD Maybe you shouldn't have seconds, Dad, you know? \nPATRICK Who are you, Richard Simmons? C'mon, enjoy the day. \nHe walks off with his food. Leanard looks down at the food, shrugs, then helps himself to a heaping porion. \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE STREET - DUSK \nRUDY straddles his bike while watching a group of 8-year- olds, having a water balloon fight. Jealous, he reminiscences to a time when he was one of those kids. \nKENNY (o.s. ) Me and Jeff are gonna pay that tree house of yours a little visit tonight. \nRudy spins around to find Kenny, standing at his side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKENNY (cont'd) When we're through, it'll be a pile of scrap. \nRUDY Why don't you take your smelly ass back to the trailer park? \nKENNY Free country, asshole. \nRUDY You got nothing better to do than pick on us all the time? \nKENNY I did until yesterday. \nRUDY I thought you liked \"golden showers\". Oh no, that was your mother. \nKenny pushes Rudy to the ground and then jumps on top of him. Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered. A crowd of kids surround them, chanting, \"FIGHT, FIGHT\". \nJeff hocks a phlegm wad onto Rudy's face. Rudy screams as the stream of saliva, drips across his nose and onto his lip. \nNEIGHBORHOOD FATHER (O.S.) What's going on over there? \nKenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over. \nKENNY I'll finish this tonight! \nKenny pushes Rudy down once more and runs off.      Rudy slowly rises, wiping the saliva from his face. \nCONTINUED: \nLEONARD (re: snack cakes) Some provisions. \nRUDY We're only gonna be here a couple of hours. \nLEONARD When two o'clock rolls around, you'll be begging for one of these. \nRudy shakes his head, removes his BAT from his backpack. \nLEONARD (cont'd) (re: baseball bat) I didn't bring my glove. \nRUDY Moron, the bat is for Jeff and Kenny. You know, to scare them a little. \nHe swings it hard. \nRUDY (cont'd) Maybe it's best if we don't talk. Just listen. Listen for them, and don't fall asleep. \nLEONARD I'm wide awake. I could stay up all night. \nEST. EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe treehouse is illuminated by the full moon, which rests in the sky above. The thunderous sound of a million crickets fills the air. \nINT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBoth boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window and buzzes past Leonard's ear. He haphazardly swipes at it in his sleep, wakes himself up. \nLEONARD Oh, shit. \nRudy jumps awake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUDY What... What is it?    They here? \nLEONARD No. \nLeonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in the floor. He is about to exit. \nRUDY Where you going? \nLEONARD They're not gonna show up, I'm goin' home. It's three o'clock- \nSuddenly, a FLAMING COCKTAIL comes flying through the window. It hits Rudy in the head, explodes and engulfs him in flames. \nEXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME \nJeff and Kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse. Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside. \nKENNY Now yours.     And aim for the window. \nJeff lights his COCKTAIL. It misses the window and smashes into the side of the tree house. \nKENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Ha ha, you suck. \nJeff and Kenny hear Leonard and Rudy screaming from inside. \nJEFF You hear that? \nINT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME \nRudy, now covered in flames, rolls on the floor, screaming. \nRUDY Put it out! Put it out! \nLeonard struggles to put out the flames with his backpack, but it's of no use. He spins around and finds the wall behind him, engulfed with flames. He screams, terrified. \nEXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME \nJeff and Kenny are frantic. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJEFF They're in there!   They're in there! \nJeff turns around and runs back home through the woods. \nINT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME \nYacco crosses to Malee and sits beside her. \nYACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) So, how was it? \nMALEE It was a funeral, Mom.     How do you think it was? \nYACCO I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let Rudy's parents know I'm available if they need to talk. I won't charge for the sessions. \nMalee looks to Yacco, stunned by her comment. \nYACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) You know, it's okay to cry. \nMALEE I know it's okay to cry. I don't need you to tell me, it's okay to cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry. \nYACCO Okay. \nYacco re-enters her office.       A beat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMalee starts to cry. \nEXT. JACOB'S HOME - LATER THAT AFTERNOON \nCars fill the driveway and line the street in front of Jacob's house. \nINT. TWIN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME \nMourners stand in small groups, engaged in hushed conversations. Jim sits in his recliner, crying. \nINT. TWIN'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nA number of MOTHERS watch as Ashley obsessively prepares a platter of deviled eggs. Concerned, one of them crosses over to her. \nMOTHER Ashley, there's more than enough food here. \nASHLEY No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs. It's right that I make them. Where's the paprika? \nAshley opens up her cupboards in search of the paprika. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Jesus, you put something down, and it disappears. \nNow angry, Ashley starts throwing objects out of the cupboards, haphazardly. \nMOTHER # 1 Ashley. \nAshley slams her cupboard doors shut. She looks around and spots the GARBAGE PAIL across the kitchen. \nASHLEY Maybe I threw it out. \nAshley crosses to the garbage. She lifts it upside down and dumps the trash all over the floor. Ashley gets on her knees and starts searching. \nThe other women look to each other, uncomfortable.     Mother # 1 kneels down beside her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMOTHER # 1 Ashley. \nAshley ignores her. Mother # 1 grabs Ashley's hands and looks her in the eye. \nASHLEY It's okay. \nAshley stops cold.     The grief and heartache hit once again. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Not my baby! Please God not my son! \nThe mothers collectively drop to the floor and surround Ashley in an attempt to comfort her. They give no care to the pile of garbage they now sit in. \nINT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nLeonard lies in a bed, staring out the window. There is a BANDAGE wrapped around his forehead. Patrick sits beside him in a chair. \nGrace enters, carrying bags of MCDONALD'S food with her. \nGRACE This hospital is a nightmare. The elevator is never there when you need it. \nPatrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch. \nPATRICK Where are the girls? \nTEACHER How do you know? \nJACOB Cause he's dead. \nTEACHER I realize being new at this school puts me at a disadvantage, but joking about a fellow classmate's death is anything but funny, Mr.... \nThe teacher checks her attendance sheet. \nTEACHER (cont'd) ...Carges.     Wait, are you... \nJACOB I'm his brother. Was.     And I'm not joking. He's dead. \nThe teacher looks around at the other students, realizing Jacob is telling the truth. \nTEACHER I'm so sorry. Wow, this is awkward. Would you like the seat left empty? \nJACOB Why? \nTEACHER In memory. \nOff Jacob's look - \nINT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER THAT DAY \nCOACH GILMORE (55), overweight, gym teacher, dressed in a jogging suit, snaps gum while addressing his students. \nThe class of boys stand up against the wall.    Leonard is amongst them. His gym uniform barely fits. \nCOACH Alright, ladies, welcome to gym. We will be starting things off this year with the United States Standardized Fitness Test. \nThe entire class groans. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm sure you all remember it from last year. I will be testing you in a number of physical fitness areas. \nAs coach speaks, Leonard looks as if he's going to throw up. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nON CHIN UP BAR - MOMENTS LATER \nA STUDENT performs chin ups with great ease. \nCOACH (V.O.) The state's requirement for upper body strength is ten chin ups. \nThe student finishes his run with a count of twelve.   He hops off the bar and crosses over to his classmates. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) Leonard, you're up. \nLeonard crosses to the chin-up bar, grabs a hold of it and begins struggling to lift himself up. Unfortunately, he can only manage 1/8th of an inch. Leonard drops off the bar, exhausted. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) What are you doing, let's go! \nLEONARD That was as far as I could pull myself up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA few students laugh.        Coach shakes his head, disgusted. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nON A STUDENT DOING SITUPS - LATER \nCoach stands over the boy, timing him with a stop watch. \nCOACH Ten seconds. You need forty to pass. \nThe student increases his speed. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) Time.   42.     Good job. \nThe student rises off the mat and walks over to the other boys. Leonard enters frame and drops on the mat like a ton of bricks. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) (rolling his eyes) Go! \nLeonard struggles to lift himself up but, he can't do it. \nCOACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) Come on, son, fight it. \nLeonard's face turns red. He clenches his teeth. Unfortunately, due to the pressure he is exerting, he blows a loud fart. The gym erupts with laughter. \nEXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - TRACK - LATER \nCONTINUED: \nMalee closes her book, looks over at Leanord. \nLEONARD I can't believe it either. A year ain't shit! Rudy is dead forever. \nJACOB I want them dead. I want to kill them. I could handle a year in Juvy hall. \nMALEE Whoa, what those guys did was an accident. If you were to kill them, it's premedicated. You'd get 20 years to life at least. \nJACOB So I'm just supposed to sit here and take it? Be like you guys. \nLEONARD What is that supposed to mean? \nJACOB You seem to have gone on with life pretty easily. Don't you miss him? Don't you care? \nMALEE It's not that we don't care.     It's just... \nJACOB Life goes on. \nMALEE It does. You have to deal with it. If you don't, it could like eat you alive forever. 90 percent of people's problems is due to their inability to get over the past. \nLEONARD How do you know? \nMALEE My mom tells that to all her patients. I've eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLEONARD That's awesome. Can I listen in sometime? \nMALEE No. Anyway, she says, if a person wants closure, they gotta deal with their problems head on. Go see these guys and let them know how you feel. \nJACOB I don't think my parents would be up for that. \nMALEE Go alone. Juvy hall is only like forty minutes from here. Take the bus. \nOff Jacob, thinking- \nINT. JACOB'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON \nThe bedroom door slowly opens. Jacob peeks his head inside the darkened room and quietly enters. He tip toes over to his parent's bed. Ashley lies asleep, wrapped up in a bundle of blankets. \nJacob crosses to her night stand and opens the top drawer. He removes her purse, unzips it and steals some cash, which totals around 60 dollars. \nINT. CARGES LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nJim sits in his chair, staring off into space.   Jacob enters and crosses to the front door. \nJACOB Bye, Dad. \nEXT.

JUVINILE HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTH - LATER \nJacob and Kenny sit, staring at each other through a plate of glass. Kenny picks up the ONE WAY PHONE. Jacob does also. \nJACOB Where's Jeff? \nKENNY He's sick.     I think he... \nJACOB (interrupting) I hate you. You know that?     You bastard. \nKENNY Rudy knew we were going to be there. He never should have come. You want the truth, all this happened cause of you. \nJACOB Me? \nKENNY Yeah, you deformed retard! The only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was because of that thing on your face. \nJACOB Every night, I lie in bed and plan your murder. \nKENNY I'm shaking. \nJACOB First I'm going to take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers then your nose then your tongue. Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes with the end of a broomstick. Well, not really poke them out, but I'm gonna push them back into your brain. Then I'm gonna take scissors and cut off your ears. When they find you, it's gonna be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back together. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - SAME TIME \nGUS \"Light my Fire\" is always playing. \nYACCO What? \nGUS Light my fire. The Doors song. (singing) \"Da da something... wallow in the mire... Da, da... we couldn't get much higher. Come on baby light my fire. \nYacco stares at Gus.    He is suddenly self conscious. \nYACCO Interesting. \nINT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME \nMalee circles the words \"Light My Fire\" again and again and again. \nINT. JACOB'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAYS LATER - EVENING \nSFX: CLANGING POTS AND PANS, coming from downstairs. \nJacob exits his room and goes to inspect the noise. \nINT. JACOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nJim stands on a chair, cleaning out the kitchen cupboards. \nPots and pans line the counter tops, dishes cover the table and non perishable foods are spread out across the floor. \nJacob enters and is taken aback by the sight of Jim standing on a chair and wearing an APRON and RUBBER GLOVES. \nJACOB Dad? \nJIM Jacob. \nJACOB You okay? \nJIM Fantastic. \nJim rips the rubber gloves off with his teeth. \nJIM (CONT'D) (cont'd) You know, for the past few weeks, I sat in this house. I couldn't move. Everything reminded me of Rudy. Then from out of nowhere I had a revelation. I am alive! Your mother is alive! I became overcome with joy because I realized how lucky we are to still have you. \nJACOB Me? \nJIM Jacob.   I love you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJim grabs Jacob and hugs him tightly.    Jacob pulls away, unsettled and bit frightened. \nJIM (CONT'D) (cont'd) (half crazed) I went to work today. For the first time in weeks. It was as if I had just gotten out of college! I was fearless! I went after accounts I had avoided for years because I thought they were out of my league. I spoke to presidents, vice presidents, business managers, sales reps. I was amazing. I was magic. But when I came home to share the news with your mother, I discovered her asleep. When I looked around the house, I realized that her \"office\", for lack of a better word, was also piled up. So, I took to the house. I have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom. Even if it takes me all night, I don't care. Jacob? \nJACOB (frightened) Yeah? \nJIM Will you join me? Join me in this celebration of life. A symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new. \nJACOB Do I have to? \nJIM (thrown for a loop) No, you don't have to. \nJACOB Good night, Dad. \nOff Jim's look - \nEXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAYS LATER - NIGHT \nParents and students file inside. A large SIGN above the door reads, JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH FALL RECITAL. \nINT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS \nA packed audience listens to A GIRL (12), standing center stage and singing \"The Rose\". She is not nearly as good as she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle. \nWe FIND Malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along with the rest of the orchestra. She looks to the front row, but Gus is no where to be found. \nThe girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds. \nMr. Farmer crosses to the microphone. \nMR. FARMER I'm sure Bette Midler would be most impressed with that rendition. \nThe crowd laughs.   Mr. Farmer didn't mean for it to be a joke. \nGus gives Malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks off. Malee melts. She stands frozen, clutching onto her flute in ecstacy. \nEXT. STREET - MORNING \nWith fire and determination, Leonard jogs. Unfortunately, he is quickly winded by the run. He bends over, gasping. \nSUPERIMPOSE SHOT OVER SHOT: Leonard appears, running past his old, weaker self. Stronger, he makes a few more yards and then is forced to stop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He leans over for air, and we SUPERIMPOSE another SHOT OVER SHOT of Leonard, weeks later, running past his weaker self. (This series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating the progression of time and weight loss.) \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - STAIRCASE/KITCHEN - DAY \nLeonard runs up and down the stairs, sweating like crazy. \nGrace appears, watching him around the corner.     She shakes her head and then returns to the kitchen. \nGRACE That boy is going to bring the entire house down. \nPATRICK Let him be. He's looking good. I'm proud of him. \nGRACE (to the girls) Girls, have you decided what you're going to go as for Halloween? \nSARA Either a witch or a princess. \nGRACE That's nice. Haley? \nHALEY I'm going to go as a marble. \nGRACE What do you mean, a marble? \nHALEY You know, like a bag of marbles, but just one marble. \nINT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTHS - LATE AFTERNOON \nJacob and Jeff sit across from each other on the phone. Jeff has two black eyes and a fat lip. He is crying profusely. Jacob doesn't appear at all sympathetic. \nJEFF I'm really sorry, man.   I... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJACOB You just think about what I said. Get out of my sight. And send Kenny in on your way out. \nJeff rises and walks to a door, leading to the jail. A moment later, Kenny enters, looking pissed off. He sits across from Jacob and picks up the phone. \nKENNY What did you say to him? \nJACOB I thought you'd both like to know that Halloween was Rudy's favorite holiday. \nJacob picks up some pictures and presses them against the glass. \nJACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd) These are pictures from every single Halloween since we were five. You see how happy he was? \nKENNY Stop it. \nJACOB After we'd go trick or treating, we'd sit in our room and swap the candy we hated. Rudy loved Snickers, I Almond Joys. \nKENNY Almond Joy sucks. \nJACOB What sucks is that I'll never get to sit in my room and swap candy with my brother ever again. Thanks to you. \nKENNY Why are you doing this? \nJACOB To remind you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKENNY How could we forget? You been coming here for months to \"remind us\". \nJACOB No one is forcing you to talk to me. \nKENNY Anything to get out of my cell. \nJACOB Is your cell small? \nKENNY Yes. \nJACOB So is a coffin. \nMALEE Why do I have to do this? It's Christmas break. \nYACCO You'll be one step ahead in January. \nMALEE Just because you're an atheist, I don't get to celebrate the holidays. \nYacco shoots Malee the look of death. \nMALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Don't you find it hard not believing in anything? \nYACCO Malee. \nMALEE I'm going for a bike ride. \nYACCO There's a foot of snow outside. \nMALEE The streets are ploughed. Besides, I like looking at all the lights. \nYACCO Be home in an hour. Be careful. \nEXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nMalee flips through a TELEPHONE BOOK.

She kicks it aside and discovers a SPARE KEY underneath. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nMalee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old couch. Malee continues on to the kitchen. \nINT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMalee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room. Pots, pans and stacks of TV dinners line the counter top. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMalee enters and stops cold at the sight of the bed. Its unmade and the sheets and blankets are entangled in a ball. Aroused, Malee sits on the bed and then lies back in ecstacy. \nEXT. FRONT OF GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME \nGus drives up, parks along the sidewalk, and gets out. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nMalee goes through a photo album. We see pictures of Gus, dressed in a firefighter's uniform.

APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - SAME TIME \nGus lazily makes his way upstairs. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nMalee holds Gus' gun.

APARTMENT BUILDING - GUS'S FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME \nGus fumbles for his keys. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nMalee stands in front of the mirror, posing. \nMALEE Freeze!   That's right. \nMalee laughs in spite of herself. In the process, she unknowingly cocks the trigger.   Malee places the gun to her forehead and pretends to shoot herself. \nTIGHT ON TRIGGER, a hair away from firing - \nSFX: BAM! \nINT. GUS' APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME \nThe loud bang we heard was the front door slamming shut.   Gus opens it and inspects the door frame. \nINT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN/BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER \nGus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some one else there, but Malee is nowhere to be found. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMALEE My mother is a total snoop. She goes through my stuff like all the time. (beat) Please, Jacob. Somebody's life might depend on it. \nJacob crosses to his closet, removes his metal LOCK BOX and opens it. Jacob takes the gun and places it inside. \nJACOB Is it loaded? \nMALEE No, but I do have some bullets. \nMalee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets. Jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box. \nMALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Sure your parents won't find it? \nJACOB Nobody has the combination, but me. Besides, I could be building a bomb in here, and they wouldn't even know. \nOff Jacob, locking the box up. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFADE IN: \nEXT. STREET - MONTHS LATER - MORNING \nON TWO FEET, running. We REVEAL that it's LEONARD. His once skin tight sweat suit, hangs off of him. More than just skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape. He runs fast, carefully avoiding puddles of melting snow. (Spring is fast on the horizon.) \nINT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTH - NEXT DAY \nJacob and Kenny talk via one way phone. Their demeanor has changed since last we saw them. No longer fraught with contempt and acrimony, they speak like two old friends. \nJACOB I sent in some comics for ya.   The X-men one is pretty sweet. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKENNY That last batch was awesome. \nJacob checks his watch. \nJACOB I better get going, I don't want to miss my bus. \nKENNY Before you go, I got some news. Apparently, the parole board feels I've been a model prisoner, so they're giving me early release. \nJACOB What?   How can they do that? \nKENNY I don't know. They just did. You're pissed, aren't you? I knew you would be. (off Jacob's silence) It was an accident, Jacob. \nJACOB So you're getting out.   Gonna head back to school, or... \nKENNY Fuck school. I'm going to live with my Dad in New Mexico. He's working on a ranch out there. \nJACOB You can't leave the state. That violates your probation. You'll have to... \nKENNY My dad won't tell anyone. No one will even care I'm out there. \nJACOB Your mom will. \nKENNY Jacob, in the entire time I've been locked up, you were the only one who came to see me. Trust me, she won't care. \nINT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON \nMalee fans out a fist full of twenty dollar bills. \nMALEE 200 dollars! Dad sent me 200 dollars! \nYacco, smiling, gets ready for work. \nMALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) I have to call him. \nYACCO No! (covering) Your father... went out.     He's not home right now. \nMalee eyes her mother, suspicious. \nMALEE You're acting weird.     What's going on? \nYACCO Nothing. \nMALEE Well, do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it? \nYACCO I'd prefer it if you'd put that money in the bank. (off Malee's look) Fine, spend it. You'll have to do it alone though. I have a patient this afternoon. Have a good day. \nYACCO Malee, dinner! \nYacco notices a number of department store bags strewn everywhere. \nYACCO (cont'd) Malee? (noticing something) Oh my God! \nREVEAL MALEE, standing across the room. She is no longer the gawky, adolescent girl. Rather, she has been transformed into a beautiful young woman. Her glasses have been replaced by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin length curls. \nYACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) What did you do? \nMALEE I got a new look. You know, for Spring. What do you think? \nMalee spins around, giving Yacco the full picture. \nYACCO You look... \nMALEE Beautiful? \nYACCO Different. What happened to your glasses? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMALEE Contacts. It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain. \nYACCO Honey, in the future, I'd like to know if you're going to radically change your appearance. Clean your stuff up and come down for dinner. \nYacco exits.    Malee looks in the mirror, deflated. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - AFTERNOON \nGus watches a CEMENT TRUCK, dumping cement into a foundation. Once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. Malee is revealed, standing there and holding a picnic basket. \nGus sees the new and improved Malee for the first time.      His jaw drops. \nGUS Malee?   My God, you look... \nMALEE Different? \nGUS Beautiful.     You look beautiful. \nOff Malee's smile - \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER AREA - LATER \nGus and Malee eat their lunch. \nMALEE I felt like I needed a change, you know? \nGUS I bet you're driving the boys at school wild. \nMALEE Boys my age are so immature. I'm more attracted to older gentlemen. \nMalee smiles at Gus.       He knows where this is going, and he's suddenly nervous. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUS You don't want somebody that much older than you. An age difference can cause problems. \nMALEE What kind of problems? \nGUS A lot of times when a couple has an age difference, they wind up splitting up because they want different things. \nMALEE You mean sex. \nGUS No. \nGus catches a look of relief on Malee's face. \nGUS (cont'd) I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a boy even three years older than you is probably more \"experienced\". Boys can be impatient about that sort of thing. \nMALEE Are you impatient? \nGUS No, but when I was a kid. \nMALEE Why don't you have a girlfriend? \nGUS I did, but it didn't work out. \nMALEE How old was she? \nOff Keith's hurt look - \nINT. LIBRARY - LATER \nMalee stands at the card catalogue, flipping through the \"S\" section. She comes to cards with the word SEX in the title. \nINT. MALEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING \nMalee enters her room, locks the door behind her and empties her bag of SEX books on the bed. The first one she peruses is the \"KARMA SUTRA\". At first glance, Malee's eyes go wide in shock. She grabs her backpack and removes a number of index cards. Malee starts taking notes. \nINT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTHS - NEXT DAY \nJacob is on the one way phone with Kenny. \nJACOB He's not some baby.   He's like 10. \nKENNY You're blaming me for this? \nJACOB No.   But can you believe it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKENNY Maybe this is the only way they can get over Rudy's death. \nJACOB He's a person not a fucking vase. \nKENNY I know. \nJACOB I gotta get out of there. I can't live in that house for one more day. I want to go with you to New Mexico. \nKENNY No way. You've never even   been out on the road. \nJACOB So. \nKENNY It's not easy. After first night falls, you'll be pissing yourself. \nJACOB No, I won't. \nKENNY You don't need me to run away from home. \nJACOB That's not what this is about. \nKENNY Yes, it is. (beat) And you want to come with ME of all people. Are you forgetting, I was the one who killed Rudy! \nJACOB That was an accident. \nKenny appears stunned.    Jacob has never accepted that truth. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'll be helpful. I can get everything we'll need together. As soon as you're released, we can go. \nKenny appears to be weighing the decision. \nJACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd) Please. \nKENNY If this is what you want.   Alright. \nINT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nYacco is on the phone with her ex-husband. \nYACCO (INTO PHONE) ... I'm not asking for much. Just call her from time to time... Because she needs to know her father cares... Call collect. \nMalee enters the kitchen. \nMALEE Is that Dad? Can I talk to him? \nYACCO Take some responsibility for yourself and grow... Hello?... \nYacco slams the phone down. \nYACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) He hung up. \nMALEE Well, what do you expect?   All you ever do is yell at him. \nYACCO Malee, you don't understand. \nMALEE He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it bothers you, but I love him. You keep this up then one day, when I'm old enough, I'll leave here and go and stay with him. \nLeonard descends the staircase, holding a tray of food. \nGrace instantly rises. \nLEONARD I hope someone is hungry. \nGRACE Get me out of here now! \nLEONARD No joke, Ma. For the next two weeks while Dad and the girls are away, you will be kept down here. I'll provide you with nutritious meals and plenty of water. You, mother, will learn what it means to be healthy. \nGRACE That's what this is about, food? \nLEONARD I'm trying to save your life, mom. Trying to give you a life. Cause I love you. \nGRACE My life is fine.   I don't need you to \"save me\". \nLeonard looks at his mother, sympathetic. \nLEONARD You don't even realize how sick you are. It's a problem when an otherwise healthy woman can't drag her ass up a flight of stairs because she's so obese. You're staying down here. \nLeonard turns and crosses back to the staircase. \nLEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) Oh, and no cigarettes either. \nINT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING \nThe kitchen is now spotless. Malee removes TWO TV DINNERS from the oven. She crosses over to the kitchen table and places the food onto plates. \nThe table is set to the nines. A small candle burns in the center. Once the table is set and the food served, Malee takes a step back and smiles. \nINT. GUS' APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER \nMalee strips off her clothes and puts on a long, silk robe. \nEXT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME \nGus drives up, gets out of his car and enters the building. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nGus approaches his door. As he takes out his key, he notices that the welcome mat has been pushed off to the side. Gus lifts the mat up and sees that his spare key is gone. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - FRONT ENTRANCE/ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nGus enters.   He knows someone else is in there. \nGUS Hello? \nWe follow him into the kitchen and FIND MALEE, standing beside the table and dressed only in her robe. \nGUS (CONT'D) (cont'd) What the hell is this? \nMALEE I made dinner, my love.   And I have a surprise. \nGUS You've been in my apartment before, haven't you? \nMalee drops her robe, revealing her naked body.    Gus quickly looks away. \nGUS (CONT'D) (cont'd) Malee, put your clothes on now! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMALEE Don't you like my body? \nMalee starts walking towards him. \nGUS Malee, stop. \nMALEE It's okay because I love you. \nGus doesn't answer. Malee is right behind him now.     She puts her head on his back. \nMALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Touch me. \nGus slowly turns around and looks at Malee for a long, pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses to the living room. \nMALEE (cont'd) Where are you going? \nGUS To go call your mother. \nGus exits.    Malee stands the fool. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nASHLEY I know you think we favored Rudy... \nJACOB You did!    Admit it. \nASHLEY I admit he was easier to raise, but we didn't love him more. Jacob, listen to me. You came with a different set of challenges. \nJACOB My birthmark. \nASHLEY It's not easy being different... \nJACOB (screams) I'm not different!! You always made me feel like something was wrong. There's nothing wrong with me. \nASHLEY I know... \nJACOB No, you don't! It's like you don't know how to deal with me. You never did. \nASHLEY I'm sorry if that is how you feel. You do the best you can as a parent. You don't always know what's right. But you're my son. I'd do anything for you. I'd fight for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die for you. \nJACOB Rudy used to say that exact same thing. \nASHLEY It's true. And as unchristian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead. Someday, when you grow up, you'll understand what I mean. Someday. \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME \nSFX: TOILET FLUSHING \nGrace exits the bathroom and begins walking around the basement, looking for a way out. She crosses to the boarded up door and tries to pull the boards off. Unsuccessful, she returns to the bed and sits. \nAfter a beat, Grace spots the tray of food, which is still untouched. Angry and disgusted, she takes it and throws it at the wall. \nCUT TO: \nLATER THAT NIGHT - \nGrace paces nervously while blabbering to herself. \nGRACE When Pat calls, and I don't answer, he'll know something is wrong. He'll know. I'll be fine. \nCUT TO: \nLATER THAT NIGHT - \nGrace nervously rocks back and forth. Sweat covers her body. She glances at the tray of food, which rests on the floor. \nCUT TO: \nLATER THAT NIGHT - \nGrace stands at the base of the stairwell, screaming. \nGRACE Open this door now! Let me out, God damn it! Leonard! \nCUT TO: \nLATER THAT NIGHT - \nGrace is crying. She catches sight of the meal that she threw on the floor. \nAfter a beat, Grace crawls over to it and starts shoving it down her throat. She doesn't seem bothered by the fact that her dinner is covered with dirt. \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - NEXT DAY - AFTERNOON \nYacco exits her office to find Gus waiting for his session. They speak not a word. He rises and enters the office. She follows, shutting the door behind her. \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nGus and Yacco sit in their respective seats. \nYACCO Before we begin, I want to apologize. I should have known what was going on with Malee. \nGUS It's my fault. I knew she had a crush on me. I guess, I felt bad for her. She's a very unhappy girl. \nYacco looks down, embarrassed. \nGUS (CONT'D) (cont'd) If it's any consolation, the whole thing was very \"therapeutic\" for me. (off Yacco's look) Sorry. That was a very selfish thing to say. \nYACCO This is your therapy. Not mine. Why was it therapeutic? \nGUS I slept last night. I can't remember the last time I slept so deep or so sound. I don't remember dreaming or anything. \nLeonard is slumped over, unconscious. \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME \nGrace coughs hard. \nGRACE Leonard, don't you smell that...? (sotto) Oh God, he can't. Leonard! Leonard, the gas is on! \nGrace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the stairs. After a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing. \nWith the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap. \nLuckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side. With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing. \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nExhausted and wheezing, Grace drags herself over to the stove and shuts the gas off. She looks around for Leonard and sees him in the living room, slumped over and unconscious. \nGRACE No! \nGrace frantically shuffles over to the living room. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Leonard, wake up!

The same nurse from earlier is by his side. \nNURSE It's alive! \nLEONARD What happened? \nNURSE Gas leak. \nLEONARD My mom, she's... \nNURSE She's fine. They've taken her into surgery. She blew out her knees somehow. We're trying to get your father on the phone right now. \nLEONARD I... \nNURSE Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY \nJacob straddles his bike, watching a crew spread cement over the foundation of a house. Jacob appears lost in thought. He looks at a picture of Rudy and himself together. \nJacob touches his face in the photograph. He traces his finger along the outline of his birthmark. \nKENNY (O.S.) Tonight, we ride. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - BESIDE KENNY'S TRAILER - DUSK \nJacob and Kenny share a cigarette. \nKENNY We got sleeping bags, a tent, canteens and a lantern.

It's gonna be great. \nJACOB I guess. \nKENNY Come on. You can't be a pussy all your life. \nJACOB (beat, hauntingly) I know. \nKENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) The main road is this way. \nJACOB Yeah, but if we cut through the construction site, we'll hit the railroad tracks. It's faster and no one will bother us. \nKENNY Good point. \nKenny files in behind Jacob, and the boys make their way deep into the construction site. Thunder and lightning crash. \nINT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nKeith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and now tries to pry the top open with a SCREWDRIVER.

I knew you'd chicken... \nJacob rises, holding the gun.   He points it at Kenny. \nKENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) What the fuck? \nJacob shakes, frightened and reluctant to do what he believes he has to do. \nJACOB I can't let you leave, Kenny.     You have to pay for what you did. \nKENNY Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I... I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll do my probation. \nJacob cocks the gun.   Tears stream down his checks. \nJACOB You killed him. I gotta do this... for my family. It's the only way. \nKENNY Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an accident. I swear. Please, don't. This isn't you. \nJACOB I know. But I can't be a pussy all my life. \nJacob fires. Kenny is hit in the head.      He drops to the ground instantly. \nThe force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground.      As he falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face. \nJacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body. Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the hockey mask. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER \nJacob is inside one of the UNPAVED house foundations, digging a hole. He cries, struggling to finish what he has done. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nOnce a hole is dug, Jacob throws Kenny's body inside and starts covering it up with dirt. \nINT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJacob climbs through his window, soaking wet. He crosses to his closet and begins to change.

He finds Rudy's glove. He smells the leather and smiles. \nJacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed.    He places the glove beside Keith. \nKEITH I thought I wasn't supposed to touch this. \nJACOB You're awake. \nKEITH Yeah. \nJACOB It's yours. Just don't leave it outside. If it gets wet, the leather will crack. \n", "test1_input": "LEONARD It feels gross. Like there's a film on my tongue. \nThe nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched apple and places it in Leonard's hand. \nLEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) I don't like apples. \nNURSE So, you can't taste it, right? Maybe you'll like the crunch. \nThe nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a smile comes to his face. He likes it. \nINT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nJacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories come back to him. \nJacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal LOCK BOX.

Leonard is beside them on a scooter. He as a band-aid on his forehead. \nMALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking out right now. \nLeonard shoots Malee a look.    She silences herself. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLEONARD You holding up alright, Jacob? \nJacob shrugs. \nLEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm sorry.

I should of been there. \nMALEE You wouldn't have been able to do anything. And it could have been you who died. \nJACOB I wish it was. You know the last thing Rudy said to me? He said, I can't be a pussy all my life. He was right, I am. And Rudy might be dead because of it. \nMALEE Don't say that. (beat) Why don't you talk to your parents about this? \nJACOB They can't help me. \nMALEE Give them time. It'll get better. \nJACOB What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't gone back to work yet.

You gotta get crazy. \nGUS What are you doing to \"get crazy\"? \nMALEE I play the flute. \nGUS (laughs) Yeah, that's totally nuts. \nMALEE No, not that. See, every year my school has this recital. I've always been too scared to play a solo in front of people, but this year I've decided to do it. \nGUS Good for you. When is it? \nMALEE Why do you care? \nGUS Cause I'm gonna go. \nMALEE What? You can't go!    Nobody goes to these things. I don't even think my mom is going. \nGUS You gotta have somebody rooting for ya. Besides, I like music, and I owe you for bringing me lunch. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMALEE (laughs, embarrassed) Okay. Tuesday at 8:30 in the junior high school auditorium. \nGUS I'll be there. \nMALEE (vulnerable) Don't say it if you don't mean it. \nGUS I'll be there.      Front row. \nMalee smiles.    She's got a major crush on Gus now. \nCUT TO: \nTIGHT ON TV: VIDEO GAME - HALO. Two soldiers fire at each other with supersonic weapons. One soldier is particularly annihilated. GAME OVER appears. \nINT. CARGES LIVING ROOM. DAY \nREVEAL Jacob and Leonard in front of the TV. Malee off to the side, reading a book. \nLEONARD I can't believe how much you suck at this game. \nJacob throws his remote down. \nLEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) You wanna play again? \nJACOB No. \nThe boys sit in silence for a beat. \nLEONARD You wanna shoot some hoops? \nJACOB No. (beat) The sentencing thing totally upset my mom. She was up half the night, crying. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test3_input": "PATRICK What's your point? \nLEONARD Dad, you and mom are going to die young if you keep eating as poorly as you do. \nPATRICK What is this obsession you have with weight? \nLEONARD The coach for Jefferson High is also my gym teacher. He told me that if I got into shape, I could start as center for the Freshman team when I get to high school. \nPATRICK Center is a great position. Toughest guy on the field. A good center can make or break a team. \nLEONARD I know.   That's why I'm trying so hard to get into shape. You guys should to. At the rate you're going, you won't make it to your 60's. \nPATRICK Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares. \nLEONARD She doesn't! Tonight she served spaghetti and meatballs from a can. The amount of sodium alone can wreck havoc on a person's blood pressure. Not to mention... \nPATRICK Leonard, people just don't drop dead from eating meatballs. \nOff Leonard's look - \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON \nMalee hands Gus her bag of Halloween Candy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUS I can't take your Halloween candy. \nMALEE You'll be doing me a favor. Chocolate gives you zits. Besides, if I want to keep this firm ass as an adult, I gotta develop good eating habits now. \nGUS (uncomfortable) Maybe just a snickers. \nGus opens a snickers bar and starts eating. \nMALEE So work is good? \nGUS To be honest, I can't wait till this job is finished. This place is creepy. You know, a boy died here like right before we started working. \nMALEE Rudy.   His name was Rudy. \nGUS You knew him? \nMALEE He was one of my best friends. Remember that funeral I went to? \nGUS That was him? \nMALEE I thought you knew. Two boys threw a flaming cocktail at him. Can you imagine killing someone like that? How evil can you get? \nGus eyes Malee, completely unsettled. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nObviously drunk, Gus stumbles to his front door.   He fumbles for his keys and enters. \nINT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER \nGus lies in bed with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a GUN in the other. Distraught and at the point of tears, Gus opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet. \nThen he spins the chamber and locks it. Gus puts the gun to his head and fires. NOTHING. He throws the gun across the room, grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till it's gone. \nINT. JACOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING \nAshley stands with a big smile on her face. \nASHLEY Jeff Laskey is dead. \nJim and Jacob look up, stunned. \nJIM What? \nASHLEY He committed suicide in his jail cell last night. Sally Yngve called just now to tell me. \nJim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins eating. She is smiling. \nJACOB Why are you smiling?    A boy died. \nASHLEY No, a monster that murdered my son died. Justice is served; end of story. \nAshley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior. \nINT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTH - LATER THAT NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKENNY He used his bed sheet, waited until lights out and then jumped. \nJACOB That's terrible. \nKENNY His cell mate let him hang there the entire night. \nJACOB I'm sorry, Kenny. \nKENNY Like you even give a shit. I bet when you heard, you started dancing. \nJACOB No. \nKENNY I knew he wouldn't make it. It's my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint when I met him, but he sure as hell wasn't headed here. (tearing up) That fucking asshole! \nKenny drops the phone and begins crying in his arms. Jacob watches through the glass, touched by Kenny's reaction. \nMUSIC OVER SHOT:    UPBEAT CHRISTMAS MUSIC \nINT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING \nJacob sits on the floor, surrounded by boxes and wrapping paper. Santa has obviously been good to him. \nJim sits on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep. \nAshley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it. She is a drastically different woman than the last time we saw her. She looks upbeat and pretty. \nJACOB An IPOD!   Sweet! \nAshley looks at Jacob and smiles.    He has just unwrapped an IPOD. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nASHLEY You like it? \nJACOB I love it.     You guys went crazy this year. \nAshley smiles at her son. It's a bittersweet moment for her. \nJIM I'm going to shower. \nASHLEY Jim, Jacob still has one more present. \nJIM I thought we were going to wait. \nJACOB No, do it now! Now! \nAshley crosses to the couch and sits beside Jim.    They hold each others hands. \nASHLEY After serious debate, your father and I have decided... to adopt A BABY! \nJACOB What? \nJIM We're gonna adopt a baby. Hopefully a boy. \nOff Jacob's shock - \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - DINING ROOM       - DAY \nLeonard's extended    family sits at the kitchen table, eating Christmas dinner.     His extended family is just as overweight as his immediate.     Leonard barely touches his own plate, too disgusted to eat.     He rises. \nLEONARD May I be excused? \nThe entire family stops eating and turns to him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE No! \nLeonard sits back down.    His family quickly resumes eating. \nINT.

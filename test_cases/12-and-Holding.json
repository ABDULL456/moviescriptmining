{"test1_input": "12 AND HOLDING \nWritten by \nAnthony S Cipriano \nFADE IN: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING \nTWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes through a suburban neighborhood. \nRudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS. \nINT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS \nRudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop. Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys cautiously look around and whisper. \nJACOB You see `em? \nRUDY No. But that doesn't mean they're not here. \nAfter a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their safety. \nRUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Jacob, come on. It's cool. \nSuddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground. \nRudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and debris come flying at him. \nAs Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his mask. He quickly runs for the tree. \nTWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come running out of the woods, rocks in hand. \nRudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him. \nINT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nJacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid. \nJACOB What the hell is that? \nRUDY Piss. \nRudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny. \nEXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nNow drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree, screaming. They try to shake the urine off. \nKenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up to the boys. \nKENNY You and your deformed brother are dead! \nINT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nJacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted. \nRUDY (calling to Kenny) Anytime you're ready, dickhead. \nEXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME \nJeff and Kenny walk off. \nKENNY They're fucking dead! \nJeff runs off screen and throws up. \nINT. FISHER HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING \nLEONARD FISHER (12), severely obese, sits at the dinner table, eating pancakes. \nHis FATHER, PATRICK (35) and TWO YOUNGER SISTERS, HALEY (8) and SARA (6) are seated with him. They are all overweight. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLEONARD'S MOTHER, GRACE (35), the largest of them all, crosses to the table, sits and starts eating. \nJUMP CUTS show the progression of their meal. From globs of syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks. \nEST. EXT. CHUNG RESIDENCE - MORNING \n", "test1_true": "YACCO (O.S.) The check is supposed to be here on the first of the month... She's your daughter, you asshole! \nINT. CHUNG HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nYACCO CHUANG (35), Asian-American, sexy, uptight, psychiatrist, paces the hallway on the phone. \nHER DAUGHTER, MALEE (12) with long, black, braided hair and thick rimmed glasses, peeks her head out of the bathroom. \nMALEE Mom, I need help. \nYACCO (INTO PHONE) (ignoring her) Any parent is \"parent of the year\" next to you, you selfish prick. \nYacco walks off.    Deflated, Malee reenters the bathroom. \nINT. CHUNG HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMalee is wrapped in a towel and holding a TAMPON. Confused, she grabs the TAMPON BOX and reads the directions. Malee's confusion quickly turns to disgust. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD ENTRANCE - LATER \nLeonard sits upon a large rock with the words, LINDSAY ACRES inscribed on the center of it. He eats POPCORN. Hanging off the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner, which reads, 5th ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PICNIC. ALL INVITED. \nMalee rides her bike up to Leonard. She HONKS her BIKE HORN at every pedestrian in her path. \nMALEE Move it, people.    Outta my way! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe comes to a screeching halt an inch in front of Leonard. \nLEONARD (mouthful) You're late. \nMALEE Yeah well, I began menstruating this morning, and I had some difficulty inserting the tampon. (off his disgusted look) What? It's a natural process. You know, I could conceive, carry and birth a child right now. \nLEONARD Big deal.    You won't. \nMALEE But I could. That's what matters. \nLEONARD The twins said, they'd meet us at the spot. \nLeonard gets on his bike. \nMALEE Wanna race? \nLEONARD Nah, I'm good. \nINT. TREE HOUSE - LATER \nJacob wipes at his head wound, frightened. \nJACOB Maybe I should have mom look at it. \nRUDY If you didn't have that damn mask on, you'd have seen it coming. Our birthday comes once a year, and you ask for a hockey mask. You don't even play. \nJACOB Jason from \"Friday the 13th\" wears one. He's bad ass. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUDY Exactly. Jason wouldn't run home `cause of a little blood. He'd get back up, decapitate his victim and move on. \nJacob looks out the makeshift window in the wall. \nJACOB You think Jeff and Kenny will come back? \nRUDY I dropped piss on their heads.    I'd say the odds are pretty good. \nMALEE (O.S.) You did what? \nRudy and Jacob turn to find Malee and Leonard, entering the tree house. \nRUDY Jeff and Kenny were here. I dumped the piss I've been saving on their heads. \nLEONARD Why were you saving piss? \nRUDY Just incase. Pretty smart, huh? \nJACOB No, it's stupid cause now they're gonna come back here and kick all our asses. \n", "test1_id": 390, "test2_input": "RUDY Don't be such a pussy. \nLEONARD Yeah, I could probably take them both myself. \nRUDY What are you gonna do, Leonard, eat them? \nJACOB All I'm saying is, who cares if they tear it down. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRUDY This is OUR place. We've been coming here since we were seven. \nJACOB Nothing lasts forever. \nRUDY You're such a butt-munch. \nRudy pushes Jacob.   Jacob pushes back.   The two start fighting. \nMALEE You guys, it's your birthday. Could you try and get along? \nOff the boy's fighting - \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON \nYacco sits across from DEBBIE POOLE (42), housewife, conservatively dressed. \nDEBBIE I don't think therapy is helping. \nYACCO Why do you say that?   Are you still \"cutting\"? \nEmbarrassed, Maggie lifts up her shirt sleeve. We see that her arm is covered with cuts. Dried blood is everywhere. Yacco is horrified by the sight. \nYACCO (cont'd) Oh, Debbie. \nDEBBIE It feels much better than it looks. Really. \nSuddenly, Malee bursts into her mother's office. \nMALEE Ma, I... Oops. \nYACCO Malee, out. Now. \nMALEE I'm sorry. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMalee quickly exits the office. \nYACCO Excuse me for a moment. \nINT. YACCO'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS \nYacco enters the reception area.       She is obviously angry. \nYACCO I told you a 100 times to knock. \nMALEE I said, I was sorry. \nYACCO Why aren't you with the boys? \nMALEE Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with their parents. \nYacco crosses to a desk and removes a FLUTE from a drawer. \nYACCO I found this in the backseat of my car this morning. Do you know how much flutes cost?   Go outside, sit on the front steps and practice. \nMALEE But, mom. \nYACCO Now! \nAngered, Malee grabs the flute and exits. \nEXT. FRONT OF YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMalee drops on the stoop like a ton of bricks.      After a beat, she reluctantly begins playing her flute. \nA few pedestrians stop to listen. \nMALEE Keep it moving. This ain't a show. \n", "test2_true": "Rudy and Jacob stare into the camera with big grins. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUDY/JACOB Cheese! \nVFX: CAMERA FLASH \nThe boys relax their poses as ASHLEY and JIM CARGES (30's), enter the shot. Ashley puts her camera down on the table and picks up a large PRESENT. \nJIM Okay, you got your small gifts this morning. Now for the big ones. \nASHLEY This one is Rudy's. \nRudy rips into the present, revealing a SONY PLAY STATION. \nRUDY Sony play station! Oh my God!      Oh my God! Yes! Too cool! \nJIM Since neither of you wanted a party this year, we were able to splurge. \nAshley removes an ENVELOPE from her purse. She hands it to Jacob. His enthusiasm suddenly turns to worry. \nJACOB What is it? \nASHLEY Only one way to find out. \nJacob removes a colorful PAMPHLET from the envelope. \nJIM Go ahead, read it. \nJACOB \"Plastic Surgery.     Isn't it about time?\" (horrified) I don't get it. \nASHLEY Your father and I are going to pay to have your birthmark removed. \nJIM Isn't that great. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJACOB You got me surgery for my birthday? \nJIM Not just one.     A series of them. \nRUDY (overcompensating) Cool. \nJACOB It's not \"cool\".    It totally sucks! \nJacob drops the envelope, walks from the room. \nJIM Jacob? \nINT. TWIN'S HOUSE - BOY'S BEDROOM - LATER \nRudy enters the darkened room and crosses over to Jacob, who has his face planted in his pillow. Jacob has been crying. \nRUDY Don't sweat it. You can borrow my play station anytime you want. \nJACOB This isn't about the play station. It's about this thing on my face. Everybody hates it. \nRUDY I don't. \nJACOB Who cares what you think? You're the reason for all of this. Perfect you with your perfect skin. There to show the world what I'm supposed to look like. (beat) You know, sometimes I just wish I wasn't your twin. \nRUDY Screw you! Know what, I take it back, you can't use my play station. \nRudy exits the room, slamming the door after him. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT DAY \nIt's your typical fourth of July block party. Families crowd the streets with BBQ GRILLS, cotton candy and beer. Children ride their bicycles, which are adorned with streamers, balloons and noise makers. \nOff to the side, Malee and Jacob sit, eating SNOW CONES. \nEXT. STREET - SAME TIME \nJim Carges tends to some burgers on his grill.   GABE ARTUNION (40), real estate agent, approaches. \nGABE 30 acres. \n", "test2_id": 391, "test3_input": "Gus gives Malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks off. Malee melts. She stands frozen, clutching onto her flute in ecstacy. \nEXT. STREET - MORNING \nWith fire and determination, Leonard jogs. Unfortunately, he is quickly winded by the run. He bends over, gasping. \nSUPERIMPOSE SHOT OVER SHOT: Leonard appears, running past his old, weaker self. Stronger, he makes a few more yards and then is forced to stop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: He leans over for air, and we SUPERIMPOSE another SHOT OVER SHOT of Leonard, weeks later, running past his weaker self. (This series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating the progression of time and weight loss.) \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - STAIRCASE/KITCHEN - DAY \nLeonard runs up and down the stairs, sweating like crazy. \nGrace appears, watching him around the corner.     She shakes her head and then returns to the kitchen. \nGRACE That boy is going to bring the entire house down. \nPATRICK Let him be. He's looking good. I'm proud of him. \nGRACE (to the girls) Girls, have you decided what you're going to go as for Halloween? \nSARA Either a witch or a princess. \nGRACE That's nice. Haley? \nHALEY I'm going to go as a marble. \nGRACE What do you mean, a marble? \nHALEY You know, like a bag of marbles, but just one marble. \nINT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTHS - LATE AFTERNOON \nJacob and Jeff sit across from each other on the phone. Jeff has two black eyes and a fat lip. He is crying profusely. Jacob doesn't appear at all sympathetic. \nJEFF I'm really sorry, man.   I... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJACOB You just think about what I said. Get out of my sight. And send Kenny in on your way out. \nJeff rises and walks to a door, leading to the jail. A moment later, Kenny enters, looking pissed off. He sits across from Jacob and picks up the phone. \nKENNY What did you say to him? \nJACOB I thought you'd both like to know that Halloween was Rudy's favorite holiday. \nJacob picks up some pictures and presses them against the glass. \nJACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd) These are pictures from every single Halloween since we were five. You see how happy he was? \nKENNY Stop it. \nJACOB After we'd go trick or treating, we'd sit in our room and swap the candy we hated. Rudy loved Snickers, I Almond Joys. \nKENNY Almond Joy sucks. \nJACOB What sucks is that I'll never get to sit in my room and swap candy with my brother ever again. Thanks to you. \nKENNY Why are you doing this? \nJACOB To remind you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKENNY How could we forget? You been coming here for months to \"remind us\". \nJACOB No one is forcing you to talk to me. \nKENNY Anything to get out of my cell. \nJACOB Is your cell small? \nKENNY Yes. \nJACOB So is a coffin. \n", "test3_true": "JACOB What happened to him? \nKENNY He pissed off the wrong guy off. Jeff is totally fucked right now. \nJACOB Good. \nKENNY Don't come back here ever again. \nJACOB Free country. I'll come if I want. \nKENNY Don't expect me to show up. \nKenny slams down the phone and exits.   Jacob smiles, having shaken him. \nINT. LEONARD'S HOME - FRONT DOOR - THAT NIGHT \nGrace hands out candy to a few trick or treaters at her door. \nGRACE Be careful now.   Have a good night. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nGrace crosses to the kitchen table where Pat is doing a crossword puzzle. \nGRACE Kids keep coming later every year. \nSFX: FRONT DOOR, opening and closing. \nHaley and Sara storm into the kitchen in tears. Haley is dressed as a MARBLE, and Sara is dressed as a WITCH. \nHALEY I hate him! I hate him! \nGRACE Who?    What happened? \nHALEY Leonard! He threw away all our Halloween candy. \nGRACE/PATRICK What? \nSARA He grabbed our bags and just threw them down a gutter. \nLeonard enters.   Haley and Sara run out of the kitchen. \nPATRICK What the hell is going on? Why did you throw away their candy? \nLEONARD Because their sugar intake is completely unhealthy. Besides, Halloween is supposed to be a celebration of evil. How did candy get wrapped into it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGRACE I am going to ask you this once, and I want a straight answer. Are you in a cult? \nPATRICK Grace! \nGRACE This is what happens when kids join cults. The first thing they change is their diets. \nLEONARD I'm not in a cult. This is all information you can find in books. \nGRACE The issue here is that you have stolen one of the most exciting nights of the year from your sisters. \nPATRICK If anybody had done this to you when you were a child, we never would have heard the end of it. \nLEONARD I wish somebody had done it to me. I wish either one of you had given a shit about my weight. \nLeonard storms out of the kitchen.    Patrick and Grace are speechless. \nINT. LEONARD'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nLeonard lies on the floor, doing sit-ups.       He can actually do a few now. Patrick bursts into the room. \nPATRICK I do not care for your language. \nLEONARD I'm only trying to help you guys. \nLeonard stops exercising. \nLEONARD (cont'd) You're fat dad. Mom is fat.   Us kids are fat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n", "test3_id": 392}

MEET JOHN DOE 
Written by Robert Riskin 
based on a story by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell 
Ext. Bulletin Office - Sidewalk. 
Close-up: Of a time-worn plaque against the side of a building. It reads: 
THE BULLETIN 
"A free press for a free people." 
While we read this, a pair of hands come in holding pneumatic chisel which immediately attacks the sign. As the lettering is being obliterated, 
Dissolve to: Close-up: A new plaque on which the lettering has been changed to: 
THE NEW BULLETIN 
"A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." 
Cut to: Int. Bulletin outer office. Full shot: Of a mid-western newspaper office. 
Med. shot: At a door at which a sign-painter works. He is painting HENRY CONNELL's name on the door. It opens and a flip office boy emerges. The painter has to wait until the door closes in order to resume his work. 
Full shot: Of the outer office. The activity of the office seems to suddenly cease, as all eyes are centered on the office boy. 
Med. shotpanning: With the office boywho has a small sheet of paper in his hand. He walks jauntily to a desk, refers to his paper, points his finger to a woman, emits a short whistle through his teeth, runs a finger across his throat and jerks his thumb toward managing editor's office. The woman stares starkly at him while her immediate neighbors look on with sympathy. The office boy now goes through the same procedure with several other people. All watch him, terror written in their eyes. 
Med. shot: Toward CONNELL's office door where painter works. It opens and three people emerge. Two men and a girl. The girl is young and pretty. All three look dourful. The painter again has to wait for the door to shut before resuming his work. The two men exit. The girl suddenly stops. 
Close shot: Of the girl. Her name is ANN MITCHELL. She stands, thinking, and then suddenly, impulsively, wheels around. Camera pans with her as she returns to CONNELL's office door, flings it open and disappears. The painter remains poised with his brush, waiting for the door to swing back. There is a slight flash of resentment in his eyes. 
Int. CONNELL's office. Full shot: CONNELL is behind his desk on which is a tray of sandwiches and a glass of milk, half gone. Near him sits POP DWYER, another veteran newspaperman. ANN crosses to CONNELL's desk. 
CONNELL 
(on phone) 
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay. 
ANN 
(supplicatingly) 
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . . 
Secretary enters. (Her name is Mattie.) 
SECRETARY 
More good luck telegrams. 
ANN 
Well, you know how it is, I, I've just got to keep working. See? 
CONNELL 
Sorry, sister. I was sent down here to clean house. I told yuh I can't use your column any more. It's lavender and old lace![1] 
(flicks dictograph button) 
MATTIE 
(over dictograph) 
Yeah? 
CONNELL 
Send those other people in. 
MATTIE 
(over dictograph) 
Okay. 
ANN 
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say. 
CONNELL 
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments. 
ANN 
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please. 
She can get no further, for several people enter. They are cowed and frightened. ANN hesitates a moment, then, there being nothing for her to do, she starts to exit. She is stopped by CONNELL's voice. 
CONNELL 
All right, come in, come in! Come in! 
(to Ann) 
Cashier's got your check. 
(back to others) 
Who are these people? Gibbs, Frowley, Cunningham, Jiles 
(to Ann at door) 
Hey, you, sister! 
Ann turns. 
CONNELL 
Don't forget to get out your last column before you pick up your check! 
ANN's eyes flash angrily as she exits. 
Int. Outer Office. Med. shot: ANN storms out. The painter again has to wait for the door to swing back to him. 
Int. ANN's office. Full shot: ANN enters her office and paces around, furious. A man in alpaca sleeve-bands enters. His name is JOE. 
JOE 
You're a couple o' sticks[2] shy in your column, Ann. 
ANN 
(ignores him, muttering . . .) 
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off! 
JOE 
Did you get it, too? 
ANN 
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down! 
JOE 
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column. 
ANN 
Yeah. Lavender and old lace! 
Suddenly she stops pacing. Her eyes widen as a fiendish idea strikes her. 
ANN 
Wait, Joewait! 
She flops down in front of her typewriter. 
ANN 
(muttering) 
Wants fireworks, huh? Okay! 
She begins to pound furiously, her jaw set. 
Close-up: Of ANN. Eyes flashing as she types. 
Close-up: Of JOE, watching her. The wild look in her eye and the unnatural speed of her typing causes him to stare dumbly at her. 
Med. shot: ANN bangs away madly. Finally she finishes. She whips the sheet out of the typewriter, hands it to JOE. 
ANN 
Here. 
As JOE takes it, ANN begins to empty the drawers of her desk.

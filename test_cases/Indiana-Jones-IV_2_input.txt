INT. TANK 
Indy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg. 
INDIANA Call your mommy. 
Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the microphone. INTERRUPTING. 
INDIANA This is Jones. I've got your tank. (pause) It's all over, pal. You lose. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO 
He is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana. 
MEPHISTO Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For a supposedly intelligent man...you jump to childish conclusions. Remember... You are driving our tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere. (vehement) You are far from defeating us, my friend. The battle has only just begun. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS. Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an ENTIRE ARMY! 
INDIANA 
DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank. Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING. 
EXT. PLAINS 
Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT glance to Scraggy. 
INDIANA We've got to move. Fast. (points to Tyki) Ask him if he knows the way to the City from here. 
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana. 
SCRAGGY He do not know exact place... But it is somewhere over there. 
Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away, we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround the mountains. Indiana SIGHS. 
INDIANA A lotta' good that does us... It could take us months...years...to search everyone of those. 
Betsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket. 
BETSY Maybe he knows what to do with this... 
Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana. 
SCRAGGY It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu Kung"... 
INDIANA But whattayou do with it? 
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror. Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. 
The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS! 
Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN. But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier. 
CLARE "I come from Land Of City On Clouds". 
Indiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical REFLECTION. 
CUT TO: 
THE TANK 
travelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls. 
INT. TANK 
Indiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS. Kezure EXPLAINS. 
KEZURE This is called "Taskipi". Only the bravest play. 
Upon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game BEGINS. 
Indiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him. 
BETSY I've been talking to Dr. Clarke about our problem. 
INDIANA (struggling with tank) Problem?... Hey... What're you two doin' talkin' behind my back?... 
CLARE Betsy needed help. I obliged. 
INDIANA Since when did you become the female Sigmund Freud?

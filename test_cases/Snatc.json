Well, it's too late now, that's Concorde. \nSHOT OF CONCORDE'S WHEELS TOUCHING DOWN \n30   EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY \nHands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car. \nDOUG \nHow about a hug for your old cousin Doug? He stops looking for his car and focuses on Doug. \n\u00b7 HANDS \nFuck off you fat bald bastard - and where's my car? \n31   EXT. BOOKIES \nThe black guys are sitting in the car still.         The occasional squeak comes from the dog. \nVINNY \nHow am I going to get it out? \nSOL \nHe'll probably cough it up. \nVINNY \nDo you think he'll be alright? Sol shrugs. \nSOL \nHope not. \nTYRONE \nWhat are we waiting for? \nSOL \nWe are waiting for a man carrying a case. \nTYRONE \nWhy? \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED: \nSOL \nBecause the deal is that we give the Russian the case and we keep the money. He rubs his fingers symbolically together \nTYRONE \nWhat's in the case? Sol turns round to talk to Tyrone. \nSOL \nFuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of questions. You concentrate on the driving okay? He turns back just as a MAN is stepping into the bookies: he is carrying a case. \nSOL (CONT'D) \nShit, was that him? \n.'               VINNY \nDon't ask me, you're the one supposed to keep an eye on it. How many fingers did he have? \nSOL \nAre you serious? I am sorry but I couldn't get the binoculars out in time. \nVINNY \nWell let's not stand on ceremony, let's start the show. They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors. Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol hangs back with the shotgun. \n32   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY \nInside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter. Vinny doesn't mince around and goes straight to the counter, where the HEAD CLERK PAULINE, comes up to help. \nPAULINE \nYes sir, how can I help? \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED: \nVINNY \nYou can start by giving me all your money. \nPAULINE \nDoes Sir know who this bookies belongs to? \nVINNY \nIt. belongs to me now. Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing.              Pauline looks more than a little concerned \nVINNY (CONT'D) \nIf you know what's good for... He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun. \nSOL \nVi nce ? Vince?? He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise tells him to look up.     , \nSOL (CONT'D)                           . \nWhat are you doing Vince? And what the fuck are you doing up there? A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter. Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is called for.                               . \nSOL (CONT'D) \nI have got your man out here. If you don't put down the screen I'll blow his fucking head off! You hear me? \n", "test1_true": "I don't care, you can do what you like he's not related to me. \nSOL \nYou think you can try me? \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED: (2.) \nSol raises the gun and fires into the side .of- the wall. There's an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in the side of the wall. The powerful kick from the gun also makes Sol momentarily airborne. \n33   EXT. BLACK GUYS' VAN -- DAY \nWe see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun. \n34   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY \nSol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through. \nSOL \nDrop the screen now! You just seen what it did to this wall so think what it could do to you. Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely scared. \nPAULINE \n(to the other clerk) . Do it. . . . I said do it. The screen comes down with a thud. This means that Vince comes down with just as serious a thud. He lets out another groan. \nSOL \nHow you doing Vince? A weakened voice retorts. \nVINNY \nHow do I look like I am doing you fucking idiot? I would be doing a lot better if you would stop using my name. Consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business for Sol. He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face. \nSOL \nNow fill this bag. . . ' . - . - \nPAULINE \nAll bets are off. \nSOL \nI am not here to make a fuckin bet. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED: \nPAULINE \nAll bets are off. \nSOL \nAre you fuckin stupid? I don't care if the fuckin bets are off. I want... \nPAULINE \nIf all bets are off then there can't be any money, can there? There is a pause. Sol knows he's fucked. She points to a black board that clearly states \"ALL BETS ARE OFF\" \nSOL \nI ain't buying that. \nPAULINE \nI ain't fuckin selling it, it's a fact!                                         . ''. Pause \nSOL \nWell, what have you got? \nPAULINE \nNothing, I mean we got a few coins but no notes. \nVINNY \nCan we just get out of here please. I am not feeling too funny. Sol's temper does have a limit. \nSOL \nWell I am not feeling too fucking funny myself, let me tell you! Sol points at the man on the floor who is carrying the case. \nSOL (CONT'D) \nLet me see your hands. The man holds his hands up. He has got a perfect set of five fingers on both hands. Sol puts his head in his hands. Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on the counter. Sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy with a bag full of change. He puts his gun down and starts to rifle through the bag. Pauline can see Vinny's pistol on the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED: (2.) \nSOL (CONT.'D) \nCopper coins?   What do you mean copper fuckin coins? Pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol. Sol .goes for it too, but he's beaten to it. Sol ducks, pulling Vince with him, Pauline lets out a series of shots in their direction, Sol counter blasts over the top of the counter. The security screen comes flying back up. \nVINNY                             . \nGet me out of here now Sol. Vinny does sound convincingly desperate. \nSOL \nWe're going Vin. He grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs Vince and marches towards the double'doors. They open the first set and then they try to open the second. They push the door nothing happens. There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly, Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh. Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yells emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and desperate whimpering. \nSOL (CONT'D) \nNo security, eh? At that point Tyrone appears and pushes the door open. The door was open the whole time - only Sol was pushing it the \nwrong way. \nTYRONE \nWhat the fuck are you two doing? They stumble out into the street. Vinny is in big trouble. They throw him into the van. Just as Sol gets into the back, we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind. Tyrone pulls out. And the rear doors of the van behind them fly open. Franky Four Fingers appears from the back of this \u00b7 van. He was locked in due to the fact that the black guys' van was blocking his exit. \n(CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:   (3.) \nSOL \n", "test1_id": 2601, "test2_input": "BTT and Hands are driving along.

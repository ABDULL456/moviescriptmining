{"train": "SNATCH \nBy Guy Ritchie \nDraft 4                    FOR EDUCATIONAL August/9/1999               PURPOSES ONLY \n1\u00b7    EXT. RUSSIA -- NIGHT \nWe open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military- jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian). He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the, guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier. \nThis next section will be intercut with the credit sequence. \n2    INT. BACK OF RUSSIAN CAR -- NIGHT \nOn the back seat is FRANKY FOUR -FINGERS, (New York street wise Jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which is handcuffed to his wrist. He is flanked by TWO RUSSIAN HOODS. This next section will be subtitled. \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nHow much further do we have to go? Just then the car comes to a standstill. The window is wound down and a gun barrel is stuck through. The RUSSIAN DRIVER looks dramatically calm. \nRUSSIAN \nPass him the money. Franky hesitates for a second. \nRUSSIAN (CONT'D) \nFranky you know you have no choice. So please can we get on with it? Franky knows discussion is futile. He flips the case open and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery. \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED: \nFranky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin monocle to his eye. He's satisfied. \nCUT TO: MUSIC,A CLOSE UP OF THE DIAMOND. MIX TO: ANOTHER \nDIAMOND BEING HELD BY AN OVERWEIGHT BLACK MAN. CUT TO: MONTAG \nINVOLVING ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THE FILM. DEALING OR HAVING \nSOMETHING TO DO WITH DIAMONDS OR THEFT. ONE SHOT AND SET UP \nTAKES US SEAMLESSLY INTO ANOTHER SHOT AND SET UP. THIS GOES \nON FOR THE DURATION OF THE CREDITS. CUT BACK TO: \nFranky Four Fingers opens a fancy case, presses a hidden catch, this reveals a second wall within the case, he then carefully places the stone within this secret compartment and firmly closes the case. The Russian next to him is playing with a revolver, he spins the chamber. \nRUSSIAN (CONT'D) \nIf you need a man in London then call this number. Franky takes the card looks at it and repeats the name. \n. FRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nBoris? \nRUSSIAN \nBoris, Boris can get you anything you need. \nCUT TO:CU OF SPINNING GUN CHAMBER \n3   INT. LONDON - AMUSEMENT ARCADE -- DAY \nC UT TO:CU OF SPINNING GUN CHAMBER \nWe are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear fruit machines beeping in the distance. Meet BORIS THE BLADE and TOMMY who is toying with a heavy-looking revolver. \nTOMMY \nIt's a bit heavy isn't it Boris? \nBORIS \nHeavy is good. Heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work you can hit him with it. Tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers. He's impressed. At that moment the door opens and in walks a MAN carrying two heavy sacks of coins. He's a rough looking bastard, he's massive, and extremely ugly. Meet GORGEOUS \nGEORGE. \n(CONTINUED) \n3     CONTINUED: \nTOMMY \nYes Gorgeous? George looks at the weapon and can see that he's interrupting. \nGORGEOUS GEORGE \nSorry Tommy, I hope that I am not interrupting. \nTOMMY \nOh of course you're not interrupting Gorgeous, I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted you to join us. George isn't too bright \nGORGEOUS GEORGE \nWhat are you doing Tommy? \nTOMMY \nI am baking a cake Gorgeous, not that i t ' s any of your business. Put the takings down, and be a good chap. -. George puts down the coins. Tommy implies he should leave. Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking stupid. Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't left, so he turns back, \nTOMMY (CONT'D) \nIs there anything else Gorgeous, a cup of tea perhaps? No? Well in that could you kindly fuck off and shut the door behind you? \nTommy turns round to Boris with a slight shake of his head. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) \nNot too bright but he hits like a train. OK I ' l l take it. You're a gambling man Boris, so I'll toss you for it. Heads it's mine, tails I'll give you twice the price. Boris chews this for a second. \nBORIS \nI ' l l toss the coin. He tosses the coin \nCUT TO: CU OF SPINNING COIN \n4   INT. NEW YORK_OFFICE -- DAY \nCUT TO :CU OF SPINNING COIN \nMeet HANDS. On the phone. Cool young street wise NY diamond dealer. He catches a coin. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nWhich one was it that kept the four grand from the Clapham job? Pause \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nDon't let me ask again. I would like answers, but I am not in the mood for asking questions, get busy lads, or it's feeding time, oink, oink, know what I mean? Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways action implying the guilt lies with Gary. Gary catches this and opens his mouth to protest. One of Brick Tops's henchmen, ERROL, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles. The henchman man pulls out a plastic bag and a roll of tape. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D') \nYou know what to do with that don't you Liam? \nCUT TO FIGHTERS. SMALLER FIGHTER IS DISTRACTED. \nHARRIS \nDon't look for your sake. \n(CONTINUED) \n7   CONTINUED:   (2) \nPOV of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over Gary's head and tying tape round his neck. Gary tries to resist but it's futile and we vaguely witness the demise of poor Gary. \nCUT TO BRICK TOP \nBRICK TOP \nYou're a ruthless cunt Liam, I' l l give you that. Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nBut I got no time for grasses. \nWe cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes. The bar comes down again. Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nFeed em to the pigs Errol. With a short beat. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nHe's looking good, Bomber, is he not? How's their man getting on? We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring... \n8   EXT. ANOTHER BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING - - DAY \n...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring. Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is distracted. \nTOMMY \nIs he allowed to do that? Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle \nTURKISH \nIt's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy, not a tickling competition. These lads are out to hurt each other. \nGORGEOUS GEORGE \nOi Turkish, can I have a drink? Turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself v \n(CONTINUED) \n8   CONTINUED: \nTURKISH \nWhat do I look like to you George, a fuckin water boy? Turkish looks at the WATER BOY. \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nOi son, look lively. \nHe turns .back to Tommy. \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nLook at it. \nHe turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep the training gear and administration for the fights \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nHow am I supposed to run this thing from that? We gonna need a proper office. He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nI want a new one Tommy and you 're going to buy it for me. \nTOMMY \nWhat's wrong with this one? Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his \"I have seen better days\" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he tries to open it. \nTURKISH \nOh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's just I am not sure about the colour. He passes him a piece of paper \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nHere it's all arranged. You just gotta pick it up. Here's an address. Tommy looks at the address and frowns. \nTOMMY \nI t ' s that campsite. \nTURKISH \nThat's right, you're buying a caravan, caravans live in campsites. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED:   (2). \nTOMMY \nThey aren't pikey are they? \nTURKISH \nI don't know what they are, all I know is they have a caravan, and we want a Caravan. \nTOMMY \nI hope they're not pikies.     I hate fucking pikies. \nWhat are we doing here? \nTOMMY \nWe are buying a caravan. \nGORGEOUS GEORGE \nOff a pack of fucking pikies? What's wrong with you? This'll get messy. \nTOMMY \nNot if you're here. \nGORGE OUS GEORGE \nOh fuck off Tommy you never said anything about pikies. \nTOMMY \nCalm down, we are buying and then we are off. \nGORGEOUS GEORGE \nOh you bastard, I hate fuckin pikies. They arrive in the camp site and the car is immediately surrounded by KIDS. The kids (most of whom are on bikes) speak with a sort of Anglo-Irish mix that sounds as rough as the kids look.         , \nKID 1 \nThat's a flash car Mister. \nTOMMY \nNot as flash as your bike though is it? \nKID 1 \nWho you looking for? \nTOMMY \nMr O'Neill. \nKID 1 \nDo you want me to go and get him? \nTOMMY \nGood lad. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED: (2_)                . \nThere is a pause, the boy doesn't move. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) \nWell are you going to go and get him? \nKID 1 \nYeah. There is another pause. \nTOMMY \nWell what are you waiting for? \nKID 1 \nThe five quid you are going to pay me. Chuckling. \nTOMMY \nOh fuck off, I'll find him myself. \nKID 1 \nTwo fifty. \nTOMMY \nYou can have a quid. \nKID 1 \nOh you're a tight fucker aren't ya? A man shouts from the background. He's a young fella with a hard but friendly face (when he smiles). He's covered in grease and facial hair, and his trousers are done up with string. But he's wearing a Cartier watch and Gucci shoes, and a large gold identity bracelet. This is MICKY O'NEILL. \nMIC KY \nWhat are you doing Paul? Get out of the way boy. Are you Tommy, have you come about the caravan? \nTOMMY \nMr O'Neill? \nMICKY \nFuck man, call me Micky. Micky comes up to the car, cleaning his grease covered hands with a hand towel. \nTOMMY \nHow are ya? \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED: ( 3 ) \nMICKY \nI am well sir, well, quite well, the weather is being kind to us but the engines aren't. \nGorgeous George steps out of the car.      Micky takes a step back. \nMICKY (CONT'D) \nFuck me, would you look at the size of him, Jesus man how big are you? Hey kids how fucking big is he? \nKID 2 \nHe's a big man that's for sure. \nMICKY \nThe are psychological advantages to a gun that looks like it can perforate the moon. \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED: ( ? ) \nTyrone gets into the car, starts it up again and puts some money in the car wash machine. \nSOL \nCan you get this fuckin dog to stop dribbling on me? Vin pulls the dog back. \nSOL (CONT'D) \nI worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk about overkill. One look at a crack desperate brother and you could wave a knife and fork around, and I am sure they would lick the salt of your scrotum. The car wash starts. \nVINNY \nWhat the fuck are you doing? \nTYRONE \nI never do a job unless I have a clean car, I like to make my wheels look crisp. \nVINNY \nAre you serious,? You' re a getaway driver, you're not here to show your fuckin car off.               \u00b7\u00b7. The machine starts. They do the windows up and that point the dog lets out a fart. The water starts to hit the windshield so they can't undo the windows. There is more an atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger. \n16   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE \nGorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their Land Rover and pulls away. They wave at Micky and he reciprocates. \nMICKY \nHe's a good dog. He'll get a little homesick for a while but he'11 get over it. Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky sitting next to him. \n17   INT. CAR -- DAY \nTOMMY \nI don't know what all your fuss was about. They aren't bad fellas. Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop. The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the campsite. \n18   EXT. CARAVAN -- DAY \nThey are looking at the damage.   Of course i t ' s completely useless now. \n. GORGEOUS GEORGE \nI don't think it's supposed to have done that. \n19   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE -- DAY \nThe dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back. \nMICKY \nThe deal was you bought it how you saw it. Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance \nMICKY (CONT'D) \nLook, I have helped ya as much as I am gonna help ya. You still got a car and I suggest you use it before you're not welcome anymore. There is a silence for a while. The atmosphere has gone more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around. \nGORGEOUS GEORGE \nHey... Interrupted \nMICKY \nIt was only a question of time before you got some attention. Nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they are trying to say something without talking. \nTOMMY \nJust give us my money and you can keep your caravan. \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED: \nMICKY \nWhy the fuck do I want a caravan that's got no fuckin wheels? I am not going to do that. \nGorgeous George steps forward. \nMICKY (CONT'D) \nWhere the fuck do you think you're going? You want to settle this with a fight? \nMUM \nYou'll do no such thing Michael. You'll... \nMICKY \nAlright Mum, we shan't, we'll settle it some other way, now don't get upset. \nMUM \nI won't have you fighting, Micky. Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting Micky. \nMICKY \nOkay mum okay. You need to sit down. Micky calls to one of the lads standing by. \nMICKY (CONT'D) \nDarren look after Mum. Get her sitting down. We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely concerned for his mum. Pause as Micky waits for her to be well gone. \nMICKY (CONT'D) \nI ' l l fight you for it. \nTommy looks at Gorgeous George.        Gorgeous George raises his eyebrows. \n20   INT. HORSE BOX, PIKEY CAMP -- DAY \nThe two fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous, Micky is dwarfed by comparison. Gorgeous George takes a swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his hands are still by his,side. \n(CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED: \nGorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly even looking at the big man. \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nJesus! \nTOMMY \nWhat? \nTURKISH \nLet's use the fuckin pikey. \n22   INT. DOUG'S OFFICE -- DAY \nDoug the Head and Franky Four Fingers are doing a deal. Doug has a case open and is admiring a couple of stones. \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nFrom Russia with love. You interested?                                . \nDOUG \nI told you I was interested. Pause.   Franky's in a rush. \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nI got stones to sell, fat to chew and many different men to see about many different dogs, so if I am not rushing you, could you spit shine the top of your smoothie and move a little faster? \nDOUG \nHold tight Franky, when in Rome. \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nI am not in Rome Doug, I am in a rush. He looks at his watch \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS (CONT'D) \nI gotta make the bookies. \nDOUG \nBookies? What you betting on? \n(CONTINUED) \n22   CONTINUED: \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nSome guy called Bomber Harris. \nDOUG \nThe unlicensed boxer? You know something I don't? \nFRANKY FOUR FINGERS \nMaybe. Doug raises his eyebrows \nDOUG \nYou get busy Franky. Put a couple of hundred down for me. \n23   INT. PIKEY ENCAMPMENT -- DAY \nTURKISH \nWhat do you say? \nMICKY \nHow much you going to pay us? \nTOMMY \nTen k. \nMICKY \nI lose more than that running for the bus. I ' l l do it for a caravan. \nTURKISH \nA what? \nMICKY \nNo a caravan. \nTOMMY \nA what? \nM ICKY \nYou are sitting in one if that makes things easier. I want a top caravan. \nTOMMY \nIt was us that wanted a caravan.- Anyway what's wrong with this one? \nMICKY \nIt's not for me, it ' s for me Mum. \n24   INT. DOUG'S OFFICE -- MORNING \nDoug is on the phone to Hands. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED: \nDOUG \nI overpaid Hands, I want you to recognize charity when i t ' s offered. \nHANDS \nDo shut up, where is he now? \nDOUG \n29   CONTINUED \u00b7 \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nCars are his religion. He can drive a Valiant in the States but I can't drive a Vantage because they won't tolerate the emissions. Well, it's too late now, that's Concorde. \nSHOT OF CONCORDE'S WHEELS TOUCHING DOWN \n30   EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY \nHands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car. \nDOUG \nHow about a hug for your old cousin Doug? He stops looking for his car and focuses on Doug. \n\u00b7 HANDS \nFuck off you fat bald bastard - and where's my car? \n31   EXT. BOOKIES \nThe black guys are sitting in the car still.         The occasional squeak comes from the dog. \nVINNY \nHow am I going to get it out? \nSOL \nHe'll probably cough it up. \nVINNY \nDo you think he'll be alright? Sol shrugs. \nSOL \nHope not. \nTYRONE \nWhat are we waiting for? \nSOL \nWe are waiting for a man carrying a case. \nTYRONE \nWhy? \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED: \nSOL \nBecause the deal is that we give the Russian the case and we keep the money. He rubs his fingers symbolically together \nTYRONE \nWhat's in the case? Sol turns round to talk to Tyrone. \nSOL \nFuckin 'ell Tyrone you ask a lot of questions. You concentrate on the driving okay? He turns back just as a MAN is stepping into the bookies: he is carrying a case. \nSOL (CONT'D) \nShit, was that him? \n.'               VINNY \nDon't ask me, you're the one supposed to keep an eye on it. How many fingers did he have? \nSOL \nAre you serious? I am sorry but I couldn't get the binoculars out in time. \nVINNY \nWell let's not stand on ceremony, let's start the show. They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors. Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol hangs back with the shotgun. \n32   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY \nInside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter. Vinny doesn't mince around and goes straight to the counter, where the HEAD CLERK PAULINE, comes up to help. \nPAULINE \nYes sir, how can I help? \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED: \nVINNY \nYou can start by giving me all your money. \nPAULINE \nDoes Sir know who this bookies belongs to? \nVINNY \nIt. belongs to me now. Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing.              Pauline looks more than a little concerned \nVINNY (CONT'D) \nIf you know what's good for... He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun. \nSOL \nVi nce ? Vince?? He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise tells him to look up.     , \nSOL (CONT'D)                           . \nWhat are you doing Vince? And what the fuck are you doing up there? A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter. Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is called for.                               . \nSOL (CONT'D) \nI have got your man out here. If you don't put down the screen I'll blow his fucking head off! You hear me? \nTyrone get us outta here. Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky) seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected to his wrist. \nSOL (CONT'D) \nI said, get us outta here Tyrone! \n35   EXT. CAESARS PALACE STREATHAM \nThe Aston Martin comes to a screeching halt outside. Doug is quite pale from the ride. Hands looks almost satisfied with the car. \nHANDS \n...-.!         gotta say it's not bad. He then looks at the sign of the rundown venue, his eyes squint incredulously. \nHANDS (CONT'D) \nCaesar's Palace? \n36   INT. CAESARS PALACE STREATHAM \nDoug approaches the entrance. \nDOORMAN \nPrivate night tonight chaps. Doug passes him a ticket. The doorman steps to the side. They continue to walk past several other doorman who all inspect the ticket. \nHANDS \nJesus are we ever going to get in there? \nDOUG \nYou gotta understand that this isn't exactly Vegas and it's not exactly legal. \nHANDS \nI am not looking for Vegas, Doug, I am looking for Franky Four Fingers. \nDOUG \nWell he said he was going to be here. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:     . \nHANDS \nIf there's gambling involved, he'll be here. They get nudged aside by an entourage of men coming through. \nHANDS (CONT'D) \nHello, who's your man? Hands points out Brick Top who is being crowded by minders. \nDOUG \nHorrible bastard, it's his fight, made all his money in. \nHe touches the side of his nose and inhales. \nHANDS \nOriginal. \nDOUG \nSo he doesn't need to do this, but he's got dark taste for fights and blood, he wants to impress London's criminal royalty.. He points out JACK \"THE ALL SEEING EYE\" and SALT PETER: they are surrounded by heavies. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \n..with a tip on when who hits the floor. Any man with veins in his brains knows Brick Top knows the answer. Cut back to Jack and Salt Pete. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nThose boys make Brick top look like a skirt clinging thumb sucker. And i f y o u p l a y wi t h f i r e . . . \u00b7 Cut to a few still shots of atrocities committed by the men in question.                                              , \n.:   CUT TO: TURKISH & MICKY \nTURKISH \nSo Michael, you got it clear? It's the fourth round. I'll tap you anyway to let you know when to go down. \n(CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED: ( 2 ) \nMICKY \nJust make sure the man doesn't kill me before the fuckin fourth. \nCUT TO:BRICK TOP & ERROL \nBRICK TOP \nAs long as we keep them happy. Brick Top nods at Jack and Salt Peter, they nod back. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nMake sure they are kept sweet. The last thing I want is them fuckin moaning. \n37   INT. BOXING RING -- NIGHT \nREF           .'\u00b7 \nIn the blue corner I have the young and only unchallenged cutthroat of calamity, meaner than Beelzebub's conscience cleaner. Give it up for the bone crunching one punch machine gun -- Micky. A murky sound of displeasure emanates round the arena.         The audience don't know who he is and don't care either. \nR EF (CONT'D) \nAnd in the other corner a man that needs no introduction to destruction, the solo warrior of Walthamstow, sometimes known as Buckshot Peter, or sometimes known as the dictator . to the devastator, he put the ' e ' in eradicate, the ' o ' in obliterate and the ' a 1 in annihilate, you know this monster of a monster, the sinister prime minister.. . . \"Bomber the \"mad man\" Harris\"! The audience goes mad. It's hard to tell whether it's out of affectionate enthusiasm or just enthusiasm. \nR EF (CONT'D) \nNow I want a good dirty fight lads, So now it's that time again.. . . Let's. . . . Get ready to rrrrrrummmmmble. The two come out to fight. Bomber Harris lifts his monster hands to do damage. They pace each other for a second. Then Micky lets one go.                 < \n( CONTIN UED) \n37   CONTINUED: \nIt hits Bomber Harris square on the jaw this has the effect of forcing blood out of his ears the man is positively out cold. We crashtrack into various characters' reactions: Brick Top, Turkish and Tommy etc. All are in shock. The ref (who is obviously paid off as well) tries to resuscitate Harris/ but it's not happening, he catches a look of desperation from one of the villains and is eventually left with little choice but to hold Micky's hand up. We cut to the nasty looking characters that we saw before they have approached with their heavies, and they are obviously not satisfied.            . \nSALT PETER \nTha-nks for the tip, Brick top. \nBoris pulls out a wad of notes \nBORIS \nThere's ten grand. \nVINNY \nKeep it. We want this, or at least half of this. \nVin holds up the stone: the atmosphere changes. \nBORIS \nWhat was in the case was mine, what was in the bookies was yours, ok there wasn't much but, here's ten large to help the situation. \nVINNY \nI am afraid it's too late for that Boris.                  - He holds up the diamond. Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back into the case while he's talking and changes the combination. \nVINNY (CONT'D) \nWe want half and that's because we are being generous. We could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone. Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and within a second shoots poor Franky in the face. Franky's body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. The black guys are stunned into silence. \nBORIS \nYou fuckin idiots. He couldn't know who I am. Now open the case and give me.the stone. The black guys are left with their mouths open, everything just changed gear and they weren't expecting that. \nBORIS (CONT'D) \nWho's next? You have the ten grand now give me the stone. The pause continues. Boris lets a shot off that tears worryingly close to Sol's head. \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED:   (2.) \nSOL \nThe only man that knows the combination you just shot. Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four foot machete that he was concealing about his person. He pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with full force. We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy. Pointing to the ground: \nBORIS \nHe's your problem now. You can keep the\" ten grand along with the body, but if I see you again...well look at him. He points to Franky. While he is saying this he bends down and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed arm in newspaper. He then walks out of the shop casual as you like. \n43   EXT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE LONDON -- MORNING \nTurkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around: all seems to be clear. \nTURKISH \nI ain't going in the front. \nTOMMY \nI don't think it's a good idea you going in at all. The car surges off round the back. \nTURKISH \nUnless you are going to transcendentally extract the passports and cash from out of a steel safe, I can't see any other way of getting them. Keep your eyes peeled. Turkish has another look around the back \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nWell I can't see anyone. After I have got in go round the front and call me if you see anything. \n44   INT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE \nTurkish lets himself in and walks through.        Everything seems to be fine.     \u00b7 \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED: \nHe walks into his office, has a quick look around and makes his way to the safe under the floor. He decides to put the kettle on, does so, and his attention is caught by something, he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting to be made. He stands back and looks at the cupboards he sees that they are all open. Then he sees that the kettle is already boiled. \nERROL \nOink, oink.    Where do you keep the sugar? \nTURKISH \nShit you scared the life outta me. \nJOHN \nYou wait till you see what the pigs do to you. \nTURKISH \nWhat brings you two here, run out of pants to sniff? \nERROL \nThat's very good Turkish. \nJOHN \nVery cool Turkish. \nTURKISH \nWell what do you want? \nEROL \nI want two sugars in my tea.       What do you want John? \nJOHN \nI want to see him lying cold and still, but we aren't here for what we want are we Errol? Errol shakes his head slowly.       Turkish's phone rings.   They let it ring for a while. \nERROL \nWell aren't you going to answer it? Turkish does. \n45   EXT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE LONDON -- MORNING \nTommy on the phone. \n(CONTINUED) \n45   CONTINUED: \nTOMMY \nTONY (CONT'D) \nOh you silly cunt. Tony stands and walks towards Charlie. Charlie is understandably shocked and fires another. It goes straight through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind. \nCHARLIE \nGo down-boy, go down. \n(CONTINUED) \n47   CONTINUED: \nTony keeps going for him. Charlie raises the gun and points it at Tony's face and fires the last shot. The bullet goes straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is frustrating the words. \nTONY \nOhh you'f in twouble nowf. \nTony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. Fear has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless. \nFADE IN: \n48   INT.

But you can't find me Franky. \nDOUG \nNo it's true. I can't find'him, but I know a man that can. Cut to a shot of Hands encouraging him to continue. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nTony. Bullet Tooth Tony.     He'll find Franky for you. \nHANDS \nWho's he? Susi interrupts. \nSUSI \n\u00b7What is he?' Would be a more appropriate question. Doug frowns at Susi, but continues. \nDOUG \nHe's the best chance you have of finding Franky. \n(CONTINUED) \n48   CONTINUED:    . \nSUSI \nHe has upset every bad boy in town, at some point, or another but nobody's got the nuts to knock him off because they aren't sure whether you can kill the bastard. \nHANDS \nYou really think he can find him? \nSUSI \nHe'll find you Moses and the burning bush if you pay him to. \nHANDS \nOk so let's get hold of him. \nDOUG \nFirstly you gotta understand he's a little strange.                                       . \nHANDS \n.He could swing from trees wearing rubber dresses as far as I am concerned, all as I care about is whether he can find Franky. \n49   INT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE --DAY \nTurkish and Tommy pull up outside the pikey camp.             Micky's Mum is sitting in her chair surrounded by kids. \nMUM \nThey're very nice Tommy.       Thank you. Tommy has produced a bunch of flowers from somewhere.              Turkish finds this a great surprise. \nTURKISH \nWhere did they come from? You're a snake in the grass Tommy. \nMUM \nYou looking for Micky? \nTURKISH \n'Do you know where I can find him? \nMUM \nYes.

He pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the picture of the Rolls Royce of caravans. \nTURKISH \nThat's not the same caravan. \nMICKY \nThis isn't the same fight. \n(CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED:    _                        - \nTURKISH \nI t ' s twice the fuckin size of the last one. \nMICKY \nThe fight is twice the size. And my mum still needs a new caravan. \nTURKISH \nMicky you are lucky we aren't worm food after your performance, I think buying a tart's mobile palace is a little fuckin rich. \nThere is a pause while Micky frowns.       Turkish looks a little sheepish. \nTURKISH (CONT'D) \nI didn't mean that your mum was a tart. I just meant... \nMICKY \nSave your breath for cooling your porridge. I'll bet you for it. \nTURKISH \nWhat like Tommy did last time? Do me a favour? \nMICKY \nI ' l l do you a favour, you have first     , bet. If I win I get the caravan, if I lose I'l l do the fight for free. Turkish considers this, uneasily.       He looks at the dogs they look keen and fit. \nTURKISH \nOkay, I reckon the hare gets caught. But he's in. Gypsy Romany Music starts. Cut to slow motion, CU of dogs' enthusiasm, CU of pikeys and their fingers skillfully dealing in money, inhaling cigarettes, etc. \n53   INT. CAR -- \nSlow motion.

Brick Top is waiting there. Brick Top asks questions. We can't hear what he's asking, but we can see that Tyrone isn't playing the game. \n62   EXT. FIELD \nThe dogs are moving in. \n63   INT. DOG HOUSE \nA door is opened and Tyrone is thrown in. A rabid Neapolitan mastiff pitbull hybrid that is attached to the end of a long pole with a lasso at the other end is brought in, it will quite clearly savage anything in its way. \n64   EXT.

He puts the phone down and inhales. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nAnything for an easy life. That fuckin pikey being difficult. Hello, we here? \n71   EXT. PAWN BROKERS \nWe see Errol outside with a glass cutter. He puts it around the door and creates a circle with the sharp side, pulls it out and puts his hand through to kill the alarm.

The interconnecting door opens slowly. \nBRICK TOP \nHope it ' s not a bad moment. Sol looks at Vin, Vin looks at Lincoln: they are understandably surprised. Brick Top looks around the room the silence continues. Brick Top helps himself to the most comfortable seat. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nDo you know who I am? \nBAD BOY LINCOLN \nYeah I know. \nBRICK TOP \nGood.   That will save me some time then. \nVINNY \nWell I don't. \nBRICK TOP \nWhat you gonna do with your man there? You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together. \n(CONTINUED) \n72   CONTINUED: \nSOL \nWould someone mind telling me who you are? \nBRICK TOP \nAfter you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya? Pause while the black guys are still holding the body. The door opens and in walks Errol. He passes Brick Top a cup of tea in a take away container. \nVINNY \nLincoln, who is this man? \nBRICK TOP \nAnd then I hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig shit do you? Ever seen the size of one of their molars?                                        \u00b7 \nHe holds up his fist \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nThey go through bone like i t ' s butter. You gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute,. . . Pause \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nHence the expression greedy as a pig.

Other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course. The door opens and we see John, who is wearing a pair of extremely large plastic gloves, showing Brick Top the shotgu that he has found. \nJOHN \nBTT and Hands are driving along.      Rose Bud is in the back. \nBTT \nA bookies got blagged last night. \nHANDS \nBlagged? \nBTT \nRobbed. I gotta see a man who looks like he might know something, but it can't be done on the phone if you know what I mean. He turns to Rose Bud. \nROSE BUD \nI need a cun. \n(CONTI NUED) \n75   CONTINUED: \nBTT \nNo you don't, Rose Bud my old son, you need me. \n76   INT.

SEEDY STREET \nBTT is in the car with Hands and Rose Bud. The car is parked at the feet of Mullet, who is in discussion with another horrible character.

Mullet gives the man a furtive kick and makes eyes to shut up.                     , \nBTT (CONT'D) \nClean the breakfast7off your top lip/ and make yourself busy sunshine.

CARAVAN CAMP SITE \nMicky is looking at his caravan; it's in flames, real proper roaring flames. People are desperately trying to put the flames out. Micky is covered in dirt from his futile efforts. One of the other pikies who's involved in trying to extinguish the fire turns round and sees Micky standing there motionless. He can see he's upset. \nPATRICK \nWhat's wrong with Micky? \nDAREN \nHis mam was in there Patrick.   They burnt his mam. All real sound recedes and we drift in to music. The camera slowly tracks in on Micky. It's hard to read how devastated he is. The camera reaches Micky's face, the reflections of the flames can be seen in his water swollen eyes, but his cheeks remain dry.         . \n82   INT. BTT CAR \nBTT is driving, Hands in the passenger seat and Rose Bud in the back. BTT's got a bleeding eye and his hand is wrapped up in a bandage.

Rosebud places a blade at the Russian's neck. \n(CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED: \nROSE BUD \nI think you have got something to tell us. \nHANDS \nTake it easy Rosy, take it easy. \nBTT looks at the blood that's already starting to pierce the skin from where the blade is pressed against the Russian's neck.

The milk obviously hits an on-coming car . in the other direction. There is a terrible crashing noise. Tommy and Turkish come to a standstill, and look back to see a small pile up on the other side of the road. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) \nWhat was in that milk? \n92     INT.

They go out of one room into another, and Errol shuts the door behind them. Vin looks uncomfortable. Another door is opened and a man brings out Lincoln. Lincoln is in bad shape and is relieved to see familiar faces, they are now shut in a room . \nSOL \nYou alright Lincoln? \nERROL \nDo you know why the governor is the governor? \nVINNY \nErr. . \nERROL \nI t 's because people are scared of him. You know why they are scared of him? \nSOL \nErr . \nERROL \nIt's because of stories. I am sure you've heard one or two of those stories. For example, did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to kill em. He thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale. That way everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course. We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin, Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just happened . \n(CONTINUED) \n111   CONTINUED:    (2) \nBAD BOY LINCOLN      , \nGrab it. \nSOL \nWhat? \nVINNY \nThe gun you prick.

Tony shrugs \nKEN \nHe's pissed in my fuckin pocket, look! Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers. \nBRICK TOP \nDo shut up Ken.   That was a bit naughty Tony. Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression. \nHANDS \nWell come on, let's have a look. Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his eye. \nHANDS (CONT'D) \nWhat are you playing at? - He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground. \nHANDS (CONT'D) \nIt's a zirconia.

Brick Top opens the door as he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken. The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the dirt. \n122   INT.

Where did you get it? \nVINNY \nThose gypsies, they threw it in with a load of moody gold. Sol considers this and decides it can't be all bad. \nSOL \nIt better not be dangerous. \nVINNY \nDoes it look dangerous? \nSOL \nYes, it fucking does Vin.

You like a dog fight, Turkish? \nTURKISH \nI like my dog to growl at the post man. \nBRICK TOP \nGorgeous ready for tonight? \nTURKISH \nWe don'c have a Gorgeous anymore. Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the noise around him to drop. It does marginally. \nBRICK TOP \nYou're going to have to repeat that. \nTURKISH \nWe have lost Gorgeous George. Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts. \nBRICK TOP \nI said keep the noise down.. . . A tangible silence between the men reflects Brick Top's authority. \nBRICK TOP (CONT'D) \nWell, where did you lose him? He isn't a set of fuckin car keys is he? And it's not as though he is inconfuckinspicuous is it? \nTURKISH \nI am not backing out. \nBRICK TOP \nYou can bet your bollocks to a barn dance you're not backing out. \n(CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED: .(2) \nTOMMY \nWe are changing the fighter.

I am not happy Sol. - The dog starts whining. \nVINNY (CONT'D) \nGive him something to shut him up. \nSol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front. The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp. The brothers look on in shock. \nSOL \nHe can't swallow a whole ball. \nTYRONE \nHe swallowed it. The dog looks up having completed the task.

But there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a Volante and a fuckin Vantage.

NARITA AIRPORT - NIGHT \nWe hear the sound of a plane landing over black. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe back of a GIRL in pink underwear, she leans at a big window, looking out over Tokyo. \nCUT TO: \nMelodramatic music swells over the Girl's butt in pink sheer underwear as she lies on the bed. \nTITLE CARDS OVER IMAGE. \nLOST IN TRANSLATION \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nPOV from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon at night blur by. \nCUT TO: \nIn the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late- forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, staring out the window. \nP.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky Japanese pop stars singing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT \nBob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky rise. \nThe automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT \nBob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by Japanese businessmen below his shoulders. \nThe elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto \nthe massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt. \nBob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo. \nThe Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long sentences in Japanese. \nTRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, translates but it is only a short sentence now. \nTRANSLATOR He wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines. \nBob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from Japanese to English. \nBOB That's all he said? \nTRANSLATOR Yes, turn to camera. \nBob thinks let's just get it over with. \nBOB Turn left or right? \nThe Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director answers her in a long excited phrase. \nTRANSLATOR Right side. And with intensity. \nBOB Is that everything? It seemed like he was saying a lot more. \nThe excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on. \nTRANSLATOR Like an old friend, and into the camera. \nDIRECTOR (to Bob)) Suntory Time! \nThey get ready, and roll camera: \nBob turns and looks suavely to the camera: \nBOB For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. \nThe Director yells something about ten sentences long. The translator nods. \nTRANSLATOR Could you do it slower, and with more intensity? \nBOB Okay. \nThe Translator answers for him in four sentences. \nON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line. \nBOB For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOKYO - NIGHT \nShinjuku High rises sparkle. \nINT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT \nTall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city. \nA sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar. \nSome drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over their shoulders recognize him. \nThe mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close- up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had forgotten about. He looks at himself. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nCharlotte lays close to her young husband, John. She looks to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly. She leans her chin on his shoulder. \nCHARLOTTE Are you awake? \nHe doesn't answer. \nCHARLOTTE John? \nHe grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, and grabs her under the covers. He kisses her. \nJOHN Go to sleep. \nHe holds her close, but she can't sleep. \nCUT TO: \nCharlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings. The sun is starting to come up. Below she watches cars going places. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBob lies in bed awake. The clock says 4:20. \nThe in-room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in. Bob looks at the fax machine but doesn't get out of bed. \nThe fax curls and falls to the floor. \nCLOSE ON FAX - \n\"BOB- \nYOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHICH SHELVES YOU WANT IN YOUR STUDY. PLEASE PICK ONE OUT AND LET ME KNOW. I'M HAVING LOTS OF QUALITY TIME WITH THE CONSTRUCTION CREW. HOPE YOU'RE HAVING FUN THERE. LOVE, L\" \nThree pages of shelf diagrams follow. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL GYM - NIGHT \nThe gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. Bob passes piles of little towels and bottles of water. He takes a water for his workout. \nHe approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the drink holder of the machine. He looks at the lit-up instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese. \nHe pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese. \nHe gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English word- gently,   gently...vigorous)   He tries to keep up with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards instead. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARK HYATT LOBBY (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY \nThe agency group wait for Bob. They stand up as he approaches from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp. \nShe looks at him. \nCHARLOTTE Oh. \nShe lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her. \nCHARLOTTE I'll just have a beer. \nHe makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days. \nBOB What about you? Why are you here? \nCHARLOTTE My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here. \nBOB How long have you been married? \nCHARLOTTE Two years. \nBOB Try twenty-five. \nCHARLOTTE You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche? \nBOB I'm thinking about it. \nCHARLOTTE 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife? \nBOB Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia. \nCHARLOTTE (amused with too much info) Oh. \nBOB What do you do? \nCHARLOTTE I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring. \nBOB What did you study? \nCHARLOTTE Philosophy. \nBOB Oh, what do you do with that? \nCHARLOTTE I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot. \nBOB It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though. \nCHARLOTTE Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too. \nBOB Thanks. \nThey clink glasses. \nCHARLOTTE I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

(She's carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.) \nCHARLOTTE No, I thought it was funny. Forget it. \nHis producer comes up to them. John puts his arm around Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine. \nPRODUCER (looks at his watch) We should get going. \nJOHN OK, I'll see you later. \nHe kisses her on the cheek, and is gone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nCharlotte walks into the empty hotel room. C.U. - Charlotte's feet as she clips her toenails. \nCUT TO: \nC.U. -Charlotte's hand by an ashtray, writes in a journal. \nCUT TO: \nCharlotte looks in a mirror, trying on an unfinished scarf she's knitting.  She checks the length on herself. \nCUT TO: \nCharlotte sits on the big window sill checking her messages on the phone. \nCHARLOTTE (O.S.) (voice mail recording) Hi, leave a message... \nWe hear the # key as Charlotte hits it to interrupt the message. \nVOICE MAIL You have eighteen new messages. Press - \nShe hits a button. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hi Charlotte, I don't know if you're in town... but I'm having a birthday party for my dog, Louise, tomorrow night, at my house around eight... \nShe pushes a number to delete the message. \nMOTHER (O.S.) fabulous time in Japan!  How exciting, and hope you and your adorable husband are enjoying it...I was sitting next to Cathryn Myles last night at this dinner and she was telling me about her daughter who had this awful boyfriend and a messy break-up and how hard it is,and now she's single and wants to start a family, I'm so glad that you're settled, and not in that situation.  Anyway, call me when you have a chance, I'm trying to put Thanksgiving plans together, whether we want to go skiing or.

Charlotte hangs up \nCUT TO: \nCharlotte lies on the bed, in the knit scarf and underwear She's doing a quiz in a magazine: \n\"ARE YOU HAVING A MID-TWENTIES CRISIS? \nARE YOU FATIGUED? \nDO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOUR CAREER IS GOING? \nDO YOU HATE MOST PEOPLE?\" \nCUT TO: \nA quiet group of JAPANESE WOMEN are gathered around a table. Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being instructed in Ikebana floral design. Each woman has a little vase and elegant flower cuttings. She watches as they delicately arrange the tiny flowers. \nThe INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside the women, Charlotte tries to follow along. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL - BATHROOM \nCharlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off. She can see mount Fuji in the distance. \nThe audio tape plays on the stereo. \nDR. KENEGARD (dry & monotonous) Plato's text calls this image the \"paradeigma\".  So the lot is the image that is your inheritance, your place on earth, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul before you even got here- or better said, that is always and continually being selected by your soul,because time does not enter the equation of myth.- \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING \nWith her back to us, Charlotte looks out the big window. \nJohn comes up and kisses her. \nCHARLOTTE How'd it go today? \nJOHN Good...I'm tired. \nHe hugs her for a moment, leaning on her. \nJOHN I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing. \nCHARLOTTE Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you. \nJOHN You wanna come? \nCHARLOTTE Sure. \nJOHN (doesn't really want her to) Ok. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT \nAt a corner table Charlotte sits with John, Kelly, and DJ CLEAN, a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in Japan. \nCharlotte is bored while Kelly talks on. \nSausalito performs in the background. \nKELLY ...My Dad was anorexic. \nCHARLOTTE (she's never heard of that) Really? \nJohn shoots Charlotte a look. \nKELLY (very serious) He was on the American side at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time. \nBENZO Where? \nKELLY My dad fought on the American side at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food. \nJOHN (trying) Oh, that's too bad. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON \nCharlotte sits on the bed talking to John who's coming out of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work. He checks himself in the mirror, CHARLOTTE Am I shallow? \nJOHN No, what are you talking about. \nCHARLOTTE I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything. \nJOHN That's ok. \nHe looks for his mobile phone. \nCHARLOTTE I don't know what to do. \nJOHN That's ok, you'll figure it out. \nHe comes close and kisses her. \nCHARLOTTE You smell weird. \nJOHN What? \nShe leans back to look at him. \nCHARLOTTE Like popcorn? \nJOHN I got some hair stuff. \nShe looks at him funny. \nCHARLOTTE Hair stuff? \nJOHN I gotta go to work. \nHe grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when his cell phone rings. \nJOHN I'll be right down...I'm just leaving...ok. \nHe kisses her, and leaves. \nJOHN See you later. \nCHARLOTTE Bye. \nCUT TO: \nShe makes a call. We see her back and hair, as she looks out the bright window. \nCHARLOTTE Lauren? \nLAUREN (O.S.) Charlotte?! How's Tokyo? \nCHARLOTTE It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I\u0097. \nLauren's Call-waiting beeps, cutting off her sentence. \nLAUREN Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec? \nCHARLOTTE Sure. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHIBUYA - DAY \nCharlotte stands alone on a side street, smoking a cigarette and watching the CROWDS go by. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

At the fitting, they had all these rock n roll clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band doesn't look tough at all...they look better just skinny and nerdy, like how when they came in...they looked so uncomfortable in these Keith Richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don't you think? \nShe's drifted off. \nCHARLOTTE Yeah. \nJOHN Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to... \nHe gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go.

He comes out with it on inside out so it's just an orange T-shirt. \nHe asks her to cut the label out for him. She goes to find some scissors. He picks up A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling audio-book box. \nBOB A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this? \nCHARLOTTE No. \nShe returns with the hotel room sewing kit. \nBOB I read it, too. \nShe smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors. \nThrough the windshield they see the Bartender and sidekick coming with baseball bats. \nThey hear a bang on the door and Charlie hops in.

I'm not worried about you. Keep writing. \nCHARLOTTE But, I'm mean. \nBOB That's ok. \nCHARLOTTE And marriage, does that get easier? \nBOB It's hard.

She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything. \nCHARLOTTE That's too scary. \nBOB When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying. \nCHARLOTTE (getting tired) No one ever tells you that... \nBOB But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you. \nCHARLOTTE That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much. \nBOB Where'd you grow up? \nCHARLOTTE In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there. \nThey are starting to get tired. \nBOB I know. \nCHARLOTTE John thinks I'm so snotty. \nBOB You are. \nCHARLOTTE I know, but that's what you like about me. \nShe looks over at him. He does like her. \nCHARLOTTE Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together? \nBOB Because that would be too easy. \nThey fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite sides of the bed. \nFADE OUT: \nEXT.STREET BASKETBALL COURT - DAY \nFull of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys. \nAll over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob dominates the game. \nBOB It's for my daughter. \nCHARLOTTE How old is she? \nBOB Four. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, she'll love it. \nThe Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf. \nCharlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. Bob makes fun of her gracelessness. \nBOB Nice one. \nCHARLOTTE (mouth full) Fuck off. \nThey have lunch, he makes her laugh. \nHe looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple. \nBOB What happened to your toe? \nCHARLOTTE I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day... \nShe slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue. \nBOB That doesn't look good. \nShe enjoys the sympathy. \nCHARLOTTE It's bad isn't it? \nBOB We should get you to the doctor. \nCHARLOTTE You think so? \nBOB Yeah, look at that thing. \nShe smiles at him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DAIKANYAMA STREET - DAY \nBob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. He tries to explain \"hospital\", he does pantomime, draws a first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand.

When are you coming home? \nBOB Tomorrow. \nLYDIA (O.S.)

I'm Carl West, and we're thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the NY bar in Shinjuku. \nHe sings \"Where or When\" with all his heart. \nNow, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other and chuckle. \nSINGER Jt seems we stood and talked like this before,   we looked at  each other in  the same way thenr   but I cant remember where or when... \nBob and Charlotte sit there together. \nBOB I don't want to go back tomorrow. \nCHARLOTTE I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime. \nBOB Why can't it last? \nCHARLOTTE I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band. \n(alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality changes things...and we can't stay here forever) \nHe looks over at her. \nThe singer continues Where or When, as they sit there together, the view sparkling. \nSINGER (O.C.) Somethings  that happen for the first time,   seem to be happening again and so it  seems we have met before, and laughed before,   and loved before,   but who knows where or when... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nBob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator. \nCHARLOTTE \nBOB That'd be great. \nCHARLOTT E Ok, see you in a second. \nA member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little silver tray. \nMiss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do with them and has to carry them. \nThe Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him. He hangs up the phone. \nBOB 0hr hi. \nEXEC WOMAN You're leaving? \nShe looks at him like, we could have had some fun. \nBOB Yeah, yeah, I'm going. \nHe sees Charlotte come out of the elevator. \nBOB I have to go, thanks, bye. \nHe rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag. \nCHARLOTTE Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave? \nBOB Yes, no. \nShe hands him his jacket. \nBOB Thanks. \nShe waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell her he loves her, that she should come with him. \nCHARLOTTE That's it? \nThe concierge tells him his car is here. \nCHARLOTTE You're leaving right now? \nBOB Yes. \nCHARLOTTE Well... have a good flight. \nBOB Thanks. \nCHARLOTTE (hurt) Ok, bye. \nShe walks away. \nA hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go out, the doors close on her back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK HYATT - DAY \nIt's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk. \nINT. CAR - DAY \n", "test1_input": "WOMAN Lip my stockings! \nHe backs away, as he tries to understand her. \nWOMAN Lip them! \nShe throws her leg up to him on the bed. \nBOB Huh? \nShe pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands. \nBOB Oh, you want me to rip them? \nHe pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap. \nShe pretends to struggle. \nWOMAN Please let me go! \nHe pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense. \nWOMAN Let me go! \nShe pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know what she wants. \nShe rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black. \nBOB I think you should leave. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY \nIn the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke and drink coffee. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY \nBob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his stay. \nIn the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding. \nAcross, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands out in the crowd. \nShe's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the elevator doors. \nCharlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave. \nMISS KAWASAKI Mr. Harris \nHe is approached by a group of eight excited people from the commercial company there waiting to take him. \nPRESS AGENT (as they are on their way) We just got a request from Tanabe Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! It is a big honor to be invited to his show. \nBob feigns enthusiasm briefly. \nMISS KAWASAKI Can you stay until Friday? \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY \nBob's back is to us as a MAKE-UP ARTIST is putting some final touches on him. The PHOTOGRAPHER is giving her enthusiastic direction in Japanese. Bob talks on his cell phone, not paying attention to the make-up artist. \nBOB Can you get me on a flight Thursday night? \nELAINE (O.S.) We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan. \nBOB Yeah, they told me. \nELAINE (O.S.) These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it? \nBOB Just get me out of here as soon as you can. \nELAINE (O.S.) Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa... \nBOB Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye. \nHe hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder. \nThe commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner. \nIn front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory. \nsmall documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves. \nThe agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Can you put hands close to face. \nThe photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands at his face. \nBOB Urn, I don't think so. How bout I just hold the bottle. \nThe photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the whole thing, what you do for money. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT \nBob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs. The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed in red, and takes her singing very seriously. She sings a slow version of \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\". \nC.U. - a golden beer is poured very slowly. \nBob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away. \nAcross the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people (all smoking). One of them, CHARLIE, in a shiny suit, keeps taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts. \nJAZZ SINGER Thank you. We're glad to be here, we're Sausalito. \nCharlotte laughs and looks down, the Japanese audience clap very seriously... she and Bob catch eyes - about Sausalito and how weird it is there. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR - LATER \n", "test1_id": 858, "test2_input": "CHARLOTTE Is that for me? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK HYATT - LATE AFTERNOON \nBob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in her arm. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL SPA BATH - EVENING \nBob reclines in the big Japanese wooden tub, steam rises as he is turning red. His phone rings. He dries his hands quickly to reach it before it stops ringing. \nBOB Hello? \nLYDIA (O.S.) Bob? \nBOB Hi, Lydia. \nLYDIA (O.S.) Is this a bad time? \nBOB Uh, no. \nLYDIA (O.S.) (O.S.) It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy. \nBOB Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost. \nLYDIA (O.S.) It's just carpet. \nBOB That's not what I'm talking about. \nLYDIA (O.S.) What are you talking about? \nBOB I don't know. \nLYDIA (O.S.) Is there anything I can do? \nBOB I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better. \nLYDIA (O.S.) What? \nBOB You know, eat healthier. \nLYDIA (O.S.) Alright? \nBOB Not all that pasta. \nLYDIA (O.S.) Fine. \nBOB Like Japanese food. \nLYDIA (O.S.) (sarcastic) Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday. \nBOB Oh, come on. \nLYDIA (O.S.) I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok? \nBOB Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye. \n", "test2_true": "INT. CAR - NIGHT \nBob rides in the back of a cab. \nCHARLOTTE (V.O.) (voice-mail message) Hi Bob, it's Charlotte... how are you doing today?... I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys at this place called Orange around ten... come meet us if you get this... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT \nBob's cab pulls up at an empty office building. \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT \nBob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic office building. \nHe goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never thought was there. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ORANGE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nLights strobe and Peaches' seedy \"Fuck the Pain Away\" booms through the speakers. \nTan JAPANESE STRIPPERS with platinum hair dance and hang from a pole on a little platform. \nBob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty. \nHe looks over at a table of young AMERICAN INVESTMENT BROKERS. He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable. \nCharlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys. She sits down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill me?' look. \nCHARLOTTE How long have you been here? \nHe looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for forgiveness. \nThey look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it. \nThrough a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances in a dark corner of pillows. \nCharlotte looks at Bob. \nCHARLOTTE C'mon, let's go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOKYO STREETS - NIGHT \nBob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations hang above them. \nBOB Where's your husband? \nCHARLOTTE (like she's said it a million times) Working. \nBOB Do you ever see him? \nCHARLOTTE (sorta) Yeah. \n", "test2_id": 859, "test3_input": "BOB Do you know where we are? \nCHARLOTTE No. \nShe puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake \"one-cup\". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee. \nCHARLOTTE Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs... \nThey keep walking, small figures on a little empty street. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT \nAs they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, the blonde actress, singing to them. \nShe stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing \"Nobody Does It Better\" with all her heart. \nBob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying to be invisible). \nFADE IN: \nINT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nCharlotte lies in bed. She picks up a photo next to the bed as she dials the phone.- \nThe picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone answers - it's a weird Japanese recording. \nCHARLOTTE Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good... I love you, bye. \nINT. TRAIN - DAY \nCharlotte watches the Japanese countryside go by out her window. \nEXT. KYOTO - DAY \nCharlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small figure in the landscape. \nShe approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono walk under a parasol with their family. \nCharlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them. \nCharlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up. \nCUT TO: \nShe walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves. \nAt the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine. \nAt its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY \nExciting music plays as the talk/game show starts. \nBob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the HOST. \n", "test3_true": "A TRANSLATOR translates. \nBOB (nodding) I enjoy the sport. \nThe Translator translates - four sentences longer and with added enthusiasm. \nAfter a few questions the Host excitedly announces something to the AUDIENCE in Japanese. They scream, the lights flash, Bob has no idea what's going on. \nA cloud of smoke reveals the IRON CHEF, with feathered hair, wearing an 18th century waistcoat.  A large red chef hat is placed on Bob's head. \nTRANSLATOR They now have the competition for you with the Iron Chef. \nBob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now Bob and the Iron Chef are at dueling counters. The Host barks instructions in Japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal lobster on it is tied around Bob, the crowd cheers - there's no way out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nBob rides in the back of the presidential, looking out the window at the city. \nHe pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it. It's Charlotte, peering over her shoulder with a little smile, from their sake-drenched night at Nobu's compound. \nINT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT \nMelodramatic '70s Japanese music plays. Bob sits alone, hating himself, at the bar. The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, and a seat next to him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOB'S ROOM - MORNING \nIn the harsh-morning light, Bob wakes up in his bed. \nHe hears the Jazz Singer singing in the shower \"Midnight at the Oasis\". \nHer red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room service. She seems to have taken over the whole room. He wants it all to go away. She walks off to the bathroom and there's a knock at the door. Bob rushes to get it before she can. \nHe opens the door a crack, Charlotte looking sweet, is standing there. Her hair is back in a pony-tail. Bob's just wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking up. \nCHARLOTTE Rough night? \nHe's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates himself, doesn't need more help. \nCHARLOTTE I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around? \nBOB Yes, but no, I can't right now. \nThe singer starts singing again in the background. \nCharlotte gives Bob a look. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, I guess you're busy, huh. \nBOB I don't want to be. \nHe watches Charlotte walk away down the beige hall. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 860}

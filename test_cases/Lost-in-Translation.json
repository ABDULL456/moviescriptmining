{"train": "The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long sentences in Japanese. \nTRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, translates but it is only a short sentence now. \nTRANSLATOR He wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines. \nBob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from Japanese to English. \nBOB That's all he said? \nTRANSLATOR Yes, turn to camera. \nBob thinks let's just get it over with. \nBOB Turn left or right? \nThe Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director answers her in a long excited phrase. \nTRANSLATOR Right side. And with intensity. \nBOB Is that everything? It seemed like he was saying a lot more. \nThe excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on. \nTRANSLATOR Like an old friend, and into the camera. \nDIRECTOR (to Bob)) Suntory Time! \nThey get ready, and roll camera: \nBob turns and looks suavely to the camera: \nBOB For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. \nThe Director yells something about ten sentences long. The translator nods. \nTRANSLATOR Could you do it slower, and with more intensity? \nBOB Okay. \nThe Translator answers for him in four sentences. \nON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line. \nBOB For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOKYO - NIGHT \nShinjuku High rises sparkle. \nINT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT \nTall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city. \nA sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar. \nSome drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over their shoulders recognize him. \nWOMAN Lip my stockings! \nHe backs away, as he tries to understand her. \nWOMAN Lip them! \nShe throws her leg up to him on the bed. \nBOB Huh? \nShe pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands. \nBOB Oh, you want me to rip them? \nHe pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap. \nShe pretends to struggle. \nWOMAN Please let me go! \nHe pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense. \nWOMAN Let me go! \nShe pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know what she wants. \nShe rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black. \nBOB I think you should leave. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY \nIn the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke and drink coffee. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY \nBob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his stay. \nIn the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding. \nAcross, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands out in the crowd. \nShe's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the elevator doors. \nCharlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave. \nMISS KAWASAKI Mr. Harris \nHe is approached by a group of eight excited people from the commercial company there waiting to take him. \nPRESS AGENT (as they are on their way) We just got a request from Tanabe Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! It is a big honor to be invited to his show. \nBob feigns enthusiasm briefly. \nMISS KAWASAKI Can you stay until Friday? \nThe mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close- up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had forgotten about. He looks at himself. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nCharlotte lays close to her young husband, John. She looks to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly.

HOTEL GYM - NIGHT \nThe gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. Bob passes piles of little towels and bottles of water. He takes a water for his workout. \nHe approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the drink holder of the machine. He looks at the lit-up instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese. \nHe pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese. \nHe gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English word- gently,   gently...vigorous)   He tries to keep up with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards instead. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PARK HYATT LOBBY (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY \nThe agency group wait for Bob. They stand up as he approaches from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp. \nShe looks at him. \nCHARLOTTE Oh. \nShe lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her. \nCHARLOTTE I'll just have a beer. \nHe makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days. \nBOB What about you?

Did you buy a Porche? \nBOB I'm thinking about it. \nCHARLOTTE 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife? \nBOB Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia. \nCHARLOTTE (amused with too much info) Oh. \nBOB What do you do? \nCHARLOTTE I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring. \nBOB What did you study? \nCHARLOTTE Philosophy. \nBOB Oh, what do you do with that? \nCHARLOTTE I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot. \nBOB It takes a while to figure it out.

CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL - BATHROOM \nCharlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off. She can see mount Fuji in the distance. \nThe audio tape plays on the stereo. \nDR. KENEGARD (dry & monotonous) Plato's text calls this image the \"paradeigma\".  So the lot is the image that is your inheritance, your place on earth, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul before you even got here- or better said, that is always and continually being selected by your soul,because time does not enter the equation of myth.- \nCUT TO: \nINT.

So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food. \nJOHN (trying) Oh, that's too bad. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON \nCharlotte sits on the bed talking to John who's coming out of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work.

She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything. \nCHARLOTTE That's too scary. \nBOB When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying. \nCHARLOTTE (getting tired) No one ever tells you that... \nBOB But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you. \nCHARLOTTE That's nice.

He does like her. \nCHARLOTTE Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together? \nBOB Because that would be too easy. \nThey fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite sides of the bed. \nFADE OUT: \nEXT.STREET BASKETBALL COURT - DAY \nFull of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys. \nAll over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob dominates the game. \nBOB It's for my daughter. \nCHARLOTTE How old is she? \nBOB Four. \nCHARLOTTE Oh, she'll love it. \nThe Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf. \nCharlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. Bob makes fun of her gracelessness. \nBOB Nice one. \nCHARLOTTE (mouth full) Fuck off. \nThey have lunch, he makes her laugh. \nHe looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple. \nBOB What happened to your toe? \nCHARLOTTE I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day... \nShe slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue. \nBOB That doesn't look good. \nShe enjoys the sympathy. \nCHARLOTTE It's bad isn't it? \nBOB We should get you to the doctor. \nCHARLOTTE You think so? \nBOB Yeah, look at that thing. \nShe smiles at him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Bye. \nBOB Do you know where we are? \nCHARLOTTE No. \nShe puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake \"one-cup\". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee. \nCHARLOTTE Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs... \nThey keep walking, small figures on a little empty street. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT \nAs they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, the blonde actress, singing to them. \nShe stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing \"Nobody Does It Better\" with all her heart. \nBob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying to be invisible). \nFADE IN: \nINT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nCharlotte lies in bed.

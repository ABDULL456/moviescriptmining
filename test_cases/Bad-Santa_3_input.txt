Willie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties tumbles out, rolling everywhere. 
MARCUS You cocksucker! 
Willie starts the engine and pulls out, and Marcus yells to the receding car: 
MARCUS ...EVER HEAR OF THE OPEN-BOTTLE LAW?! (then, to himself) -- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker! 
EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
Willie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel complex. He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to his unit. 
He pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window. 
Surprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against the wall. 
Someone inside is rifling the room. 
Willie hisses at a nearby hooker: 
WILLIE Opal, come here. 
Opal looks at him with disdain. 
OPAL Screw you, Willie -- last time I didn't shit right for a week. 
WILLIE No, not that -- come here! 
Reluctantly, she sidles over. 
WILLIE Who the fuck's in my room, did you see someone go into my fuckin' room? 
OPAL Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha -- looked like a cop. 
WILLIE Ah fuck. 
INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Marcus is on the phone with Willie. 
MARCUS What guy?! You get a look at him? 
INTERCUT: 
EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT 
Willie is at a pay phone. 
WILLIE No, I think it's a cop though. You think someone's onto us? 
MARCUS Is there anything in the room? Anything professional? 
WILLIE No. Clothes. 
MARCUS Just ditch. You got anywhere to sack out for a while? 
INT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT 
The Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. 
KID Santa! 
WILLIE Yeah. 
KID You're bringing my present early? 
WILLIE NO. 
KID But I never told you what I wanted.

In his stolen clothes, he charges across the staff parking area and into the snowy expanse of meadow beyond. \nRunning for a thicket of winter woods. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nMerlin and Jumpy stride out to join Gabriel and Pug. Ashley follows, stumbling to keep up. \nGABRIEL Where the HELL did he go? \nMERLIN Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one. \nPUG That motherfucker -- \nMERLIN And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him. \nGabriel darkens. \nGABRIEL Get. Him. Back. \nEXT. SNOWY MEADOW - DAY \nRudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. He keeps struggling, losing his footing, fighting his way toward the cover of trees. From far away... \nASHLEY (O.S.) Nick! Run! RUN!!! \nRudy turns back to see Merlin, Jumpy and Pug round into view back at the parking lot. They see him. \nAnd charge into the snowfield. \nRudy breaks into the trees. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nGabriel pushes Ashley into the Nova and peals out of the parking lot. Onto reservation roads. \nEXT. WOODS - ON CHASE - DAY \nRudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper into snowdrifts, slowing him down. Stumbling forward, shivering, breath frosting -- \n-- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but struggling too. With guns held. \nRudy keeps battling through the drifts -- \n-- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest; the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him. \nRudy keeps running. \nINT. NOVA \nBouncing over a snowy dirt road, having found a shortcut into the woods. Gabriel searches the trees, Ashley too. \nEXT. WOODS \nMerlin, Jumpy and Pug keep up their steady march. Rudy's running figure now only fifty yards distant. \nMERLIN You keep running, Nick! Keep running now! Can't keep warm if you don't keep running! We'll just be right back here... keeping track of your trail. \nANGLE to show Merlin's striding right in Rudy's bootprints. Pug FIRES off two shots. \nThey KICK UP snow just behind Rudy, struggling, panting... \nMERLIN (O.S.) Wherever you run... we'll get there. Fast as you want... we'll be there. We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve, fifteen, twenty-hour days. \nRudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush away his footprints. Realizes it's useless. \nA BULLET whistles through the pine branches. \nMERLIN (O.S.) We got nothing but time. \nRudy takes a breath, crashes onward -- \n-- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder. Closer. It's a car's engine. \nRudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it. \nEXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY \nAs Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner comes a Chevy Nova -- \n-- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy. \nRudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded slope cradling a meadow and frozen river -- \nASHLEY No!!! \n-- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the other way. Gabriel fights her for control -- \n-- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow! \nOn the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road. \nAT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM \nRudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball. \n", "test1_true": "Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top edge and takes aim -- \nASHLEY RUN!!! \n-- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind -- \nSending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp -- \nTO THE BOTTOM \n-- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles to clear the ice from his face -- \n-- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw. \nRUDY That's for reading her mail. \nHe extends a hand to Ashley -- \nRUDY Come on. \n-- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls, the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond. \nMore GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way down the ravine. \nEXT. FROZEN RIVER - CONTINUOUS \nRudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic. \nRUDY We get to the bridge, we're all right! \nASHLEY Nick, the ice is -- \nRUDY Get to the bridge! (waving at traffic) HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE! \nHe grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way -- \n-- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She vanishes from sight in an instant! \nRudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at the ripples in the freezing water. \nAshley's not coming up. \nRUDY \nLooks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge. \nThen the highway. Safety within sight. \nBut he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly and LEAPS into the ice-hole -- \nEXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE \n-- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body like needles. He writhes, spinning around -- \n-- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at the ice above her. Strength giving out. \nRudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further away from the opening. \nWith Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, pressing the barrel against the ice above them -- \n-- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray- blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches for a sheath of ice, splashing -- \nTO THE SURFACE \n-- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge. \nInstinctively, they spin around -- \nTO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG \n-- standing right behind them. Guns trained. \nGABRIEL (rubs his jaw) At the rate you're going, Nick... I'm gonna have a hard time ever considering you family. \nHe extends his hand, a gesture of help. But menacing. \nGABRIEL How lucky ya feeling now. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIEL'S RIG - DAY \nPitch black. We can barely make out a huddled, fetal form, quaking and trembling. It's Rudy. Dripping wet, on the verge of hypothermia. Trying to stay conscious: \nRUDY I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br- br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p (struggling) ...pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for the k-k-k (waits) ...king. \nThe trailer doors swing open, crashing harsh light upon him. He squints into the light, shivering madly. \nRUDY Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum. \nINT. KNIGHTS INN GAME ROOM - DAY \nGabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. Bullseye. \nMerlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's feet, unable to stand. Still trembling. \nA couple KIDS scamper into the doorway -- \nMERLIN Game room's closed. \n", "test1_id": 1320, "test2_input": "ANGLE ON BEDFRAME \nAs two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle handcuff off the frame. \nANGLE ON CLOSET \nAs Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips the paper off, untwisting the wire. \nANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW \nAs Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside. \nEXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nLight snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer. \nAT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER \nRudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and gear boxes in the back seat. \nHe takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming it around until it trips the door lock. \nThe lock pops up; Rudy pops in -- \nINT. BLAZER \n-- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade. \nRUDY Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta be keeping a gun... \nHe rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing. \nSome HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nRudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing \nMERLIN AND JUMPY \nstride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear. \nON SCENE \nRudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side. Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him. \nRudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem to. They stand at the Nova, talking. \nRudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. He slips around the corner, out of sight. \nAROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL \nRudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving toward a side entry -- \n-- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER. \nAbove his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this wall. \nSounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES. \nRudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. Because his breathing has stopped. \nINT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT \nRudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads \"Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty.\" \nRudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view -- \nIt's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling and splashing someone offscreen -- \nASHLEY ...and he's saying \"We're not gonna help him just to walk away. If we're gonna help him... we're gonna get it all... \nShe splashes again. Taunting -- \nASHLEY ...he wants to help now, he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here, he'd go on and rob it by himself -- \nAs Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward her in the pool. \nGABRIEL He wants the money. \nASHLEY No, baby. He wants me. \nGabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles. \nASHLEY He wants... your \"sister\"... \nGABRIEL ...whoever she is. \nAnd they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. A steamy embrace. \nASHLEY Nick Mason's gonna help us more than we ever dreamed. \nANGLE ON RUDY \nin the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness. \nIN THE POOL \nGabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow. \nGABRIEL All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters... \n", "test2_true": "GABRIEL Searching for a money man... \nASHLEY We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth -- \nGABRIEL -- till he fucked his parole -- \nASHLEY -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that? \nGABRIEL That's a book, baby. (presses closer) That's a book of love. \nThey kiss again. Gabriel strokes her wet hair: \nGABRIEL I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you. \nASHLEY One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas. \nGABRIEL I've been doing good, though. \nASHLEY Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck. \nGABRIEL Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain. \nASHLEY What, he should see me help you catch him? \nON RUDY \nstill in the shadows, welling with betrayal. \nASHLEY (O.S.) He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand. \nGABRIEL (O.S.) He'll be dead when he does. \nBACK IN THE POOL \nGabriel and Ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water. \nGABRIEL Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you... \nASHLEY Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree... \nAnd as their words turn to moans and murmurs... \nIN THE SHADOWS \nRudy is gone. \nINT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell on his way toward the \"Exit\" sign posted above a door. He's almost there, marching fast -- \nRUDY Here's my present to you, truck drivers -- \nAS THE EXIT DOOR OPENS \nMERLIN (O.S.) Where the hell's Gabriel? \n-- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside. \nJUMPY With his girlfriend. Making up for \"Nick\" time. I'm going down to the bar, you want something? \nMERLIN Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on our convict. \nThey separate, Jumpy down the hall, Merlin to the stairs -- \nINT. STAIRWELL \nMerlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight down. \nChecks the hall for Jumpy, then races out -- \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nRudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro. Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact -- \nRUDY Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a bike, it's like riding a bike! \nBut there's nothing. The engine won't start. \nINT. STAIRWELL \nMerlin reaches the second floor, steps into the hall. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nRudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow. \nRUDY How far you gonna get, Rudy... \nRealizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate. \nAnd his eyes find the Blazer. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL \nMerlin ambles the corridor. Approaching Rudy's room. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nRudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake down. Forces the gearshift into \"Reverse.\" \n", "test2_id": 1321, "test3_input": "EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - NIGHT \nThe neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a dozen cars in the parking lot. \nINT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT \nFilled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only two FAT WOMEN sitting at them. Three INDIANS at a poker table. An OLD TIMER in his 90's playing blackjack. \nINT. SECURITY LEVEL \nA ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs to a camera catwalk that rings the casino. \nJack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY, watching the lack of activity below: \nJACK BANGS And all through the house... not a creature was stirring... (sighs) Why don't you go ahead and send most of your guys home, Ed. \nSECURITY BOSS Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas. \nThe boss smiles, heads off. Jack Bangs swigs his brandy, eyes his high-tech security gear glumly: \nJACK BANGS Hell. Nobody even comes here to cheat... \nEXT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT \nThe Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy: \nGABRIEL Go. \nRudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out. \nGabriel's rig rumbles up the road. \n[NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end, are in their Santa Claus suits.] \nRUDY AND JUMPY \nmake their way across the lot, heading for the entrance. \nRUDY Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you something. You have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an Indian casino? \nThe Native American considers. As they walk: \nJUMPY Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. Stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment... they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. Still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any United States suburb, satellite city or industrial park. Destroying the Indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which I, it's true, am one -- \n-- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors -- \nINT. TOKAHAWK - NIGHT \n-- and SLAM inside, stumbling into each other, suddenly LAUGHING and slapping backs. Surveying the casino: \nRUDY Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody! \nRudy spreads his Santa arms wide and whoops. Jumpy laughs with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred: \nRUDY Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- MONEY! \nThe few gamblers inside look up at the commotion. Bear the Bartender. Two CASHIERS and one WAITRESS. Ed the Security Boss strides over, smiling tightly: \nSECURITY BOSS How you gentlemen doing tonight? \nRUDY We're out of work tonight, that's how! Christmas Eve! We're out of work! \nJUMPY (shakes his hand) Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season... \nRUDY We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations! \nRudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket, drops some to the floor. Jumpy retrieves them -- \nJUMPY ...bunch of us got together for the union party. Hey, how late are you open? \nSECURITY BOSS (eyes on the money) All night and all day. \nRUDY I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress Civil Defense Fund! Are there any representatives here present? \nA Waitress sidles close; checks with the Boss. He nods okay. \nWAITRESS What can I get ya, Santa? \nRUDY Santa drinks American beer. \nSECURITY BOSS (to Jumpy) What's your game, guys? \nJUMPY Blackjack. Got a buddy from Woolworth's out parking the sleigh. \nThe Security Boss stares him down. Then: \nSECURITY BOSS Good luck, gentlemen. \nHe steps aside and indicates the tables. Jumpy claps him on the back, pushes Rudy on through the slots. \nEXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT \nGabriel's truck at the roadside, hazards on, with signal triangles as if broken down. Gabriel places the last one, hurries back down the casino road. \nEXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA - NIGHT \nAshley sits between Merlin and Pug. Gabriel jogs by the car. \nAshley checks her watch: \nASHLEY Three minutes. \n", "test3_true": "Rudy and Jumpy sit at a blackjack table, beside the Old Timer. \nJovial ad libs as the Waitress brings Rudy's beer.

You hit for my card! \nOLD TIMER I... sorry, Mister... \nRUDY That was my king! \nOLD TIMER Well...sorry... \nJUMPY (to the Waitress) How are you tonight? \nWAITRESS Fuckin' freezing.

Watch out for this guy. \nThey throw chips in. The Waitress circles around: \nWAITRESS What can I get ya, Santa? \nGABRIEL American beer. \nThe Old Timer hits and stays.

Watch my bank. \nRudy nods, slugging beer. He's becoming an unruly drinker. The Old Timer motions to hit; but before the Dealer can pull the card, Rudy slams the table, points to it: \nRUDY That is my card, guy. My card. \nDEALER He hit, mister. \nRUDY He didn't hit. (to Old Timer) You didn't hit. You're not hitting. \nOLD TIMER But you don't even know what it is! \nThe dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. Then hits Rudy and busts him.

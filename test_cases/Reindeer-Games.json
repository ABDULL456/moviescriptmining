{"train": "\"REINDEER GAMES\" \nScreenplay by \nEhren Kruger \nFADE IN: \nFIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT \nlies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red. \nREVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nDark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead in the doorway. \nIt's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. His face is missing. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nMore snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened. \nA halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent. \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT \nA floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now. \nEXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT \nwhere the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed. \nHis burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN. \nHe opens his eyes. \nRUDY (V.O.) I never was much for the holidays. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nTHE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND \nrises, as a TITLE appears: \"SEVEN DAYS BEFORE...\" \nAnd then, to complete the sentence: \"...XMAS.\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY \nSnow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile. \nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY \nRudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted. \nThe sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day. \nHe turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful Dodger. \nA WALL CALENDAR \nShows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th. \nDecember 22nd is circled again and again. \nRudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. Turning back to the beds we reveal -- \nTHE LOWER BUNK \nwhere Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost a mural. \nAll of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy. \nRUDY \nstares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY \nThe two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick absently whistles some \"Silver Bells,\" then digs for a smoke. \nNICK What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do? \nRUDY Haven't thought about it. \nNICK Hell you haven't. \nRUDY Get to thinking about it, it won't happen. \nNICK We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do. \nRUDY Ain't there yet. \nNICK Three days, man. \nAnd the world goes dark. \nINT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT \nDarkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his head. The cell block silent for the first time. \nBootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with distinct pleasure. \nRUDY The man had two days... \nMEAN GUARD Well. Least he won't be coming back. \nThe guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him -- \n-- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps the cruel smile. \nMEAN GUARD You need company tonight, Rudy... you just give a holler. \nHe puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" Several shadowed VOICES request that he shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the row. \nRUDY \nturns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind. \nTHE PICTURES OF ASHLEY \nSmiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall. \nRUDY \ntakes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of it. \nRudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters. \nHe trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it. \nNICK (V.O.) Rudy, man, here we go, here, what she wrote here: \"The car's waiting. The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting. I've waited for so long. I'm burning for you, Nick. My whole body. My whole heart. I'm burning for you...\" \nRudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly. \nRUDY He was burning for you too... \nAnd puts the letter away. \nCLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT \nAs his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY \nSnow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered in snow. \nEXIT GUARD Your world and welcome to it, dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! We'll keep the lights on for ya! \nRudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in summer. \nSecondhand shoes. No possessions. \nHe clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the fenceway. \nBEYOND THE GATE \nThere are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them. \nThe released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free. \nThe ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade slaps on backs. Reunion time. \nThe snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he can't help himself -- he glances up -- \nTO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN \nbundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners. \nRUDY \ndrops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus. \nINT. BUS - CONTINUOUS \nRudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. Then the cons with relatives start to pile in. \nRudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it. \nHe rubs his window with his sleeve. \nOutside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing onto the bus with their loved ones. \nThe woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming. \nRudy watches her sadly. \nAboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's changed. \nThe woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball. \nRudy looks at the bikini picture again. \nThen at the shivering bundle. \nAshley gives a bashful smile, covers it. \nRUDY Do that again. \nASHLEY What. \nRUDY Smile. \nAshley smiles again, blushing now. \nASHLEY No -- \nRUDY One more. Smile. One more. \nASHLEY (trying not to) No, c'mon -- \nRUDY I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time. \nThey stare across the table, drifting into one another's eyes. \nASHLEY You're better than the picture in my mind, Nick... (softly) You're real. \nOutside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. INTERSTATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nAnd Rudy and Ashley SLAM inside, kissing passionately, limbs intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. Rudy kicks the door closed. Mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair. \nThey collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling onto the lumpy bed. Rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on, as Ashley's lips explore his neck and body. Writhing and wrestling and rolling off the bed. Bang. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER \nRudy and Ashley fuck like lovers in R-rated movies. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - LATER \nThe bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. Rudy and Ashley rest naked amidst them. Her pretty young head on his chest, all their inhibitions gone. Rudy strokes her arms. \nRUDY Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this? \nASHLEY Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean -- \nRUDY No, not that, no... (laughs, kisses her) I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. \nASHLEY Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to. \nRUDY Yeah. Me too. (considers) Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know? \nAshley studies his face, smiles in reflection. \nASHLEY I told you, Nick. Remember? \nRUDY Tell me again. \nASHLEY All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn. (beat) A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way. \nRUDY Had some bad relationships, didn't you. \nASHLEY Not bad. Just regular. (smiles) You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things. \nShe turns to him, kisses his chest -- \nRUDY Well, wasn't all me, y'know. \nASHLEY Yes it was all you -- \nRUDY Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him -- \nASHLEY I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words. \nRUDY Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too... \nASHLEY Then he shoulda signed his name. \nShe turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. Ready to make up for lost time. With a kiss: \nASHLEY And he'd be here right now. \nINT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY \nAshley runs through an Xmas-decorated megamall, dragging Rudy behind her. Both of them laughing, as she hauls him over to some cookie bakery company: \nRUDY Where the hell are you going? \nASHLEY Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions! (to cookie matron) What's good?! \nCOOKIE MATRON Oh my, we've got a special on our chocolate crunchie elves, they're shaped like little helpers -- \nASHLEY THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in two goddamn years! Get him two of everything! \nRUDY Ashley, Jesus -- \nASHLEY Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. (to cookie matron) Hurry up! \nRUDY Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate? \nASHLEY Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. (teasing smile) So don't talk to me about little white lies. \nINT. J.C. PENNEY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nRUDY I'll see what I can do. \nASHLEY No, lover. I'll see what you can do. \nShe smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their shopping score. Gifts and goodies. \nRUDY (sings, sotto) I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum- pum-pum. No treasures for the king, pa-rum-pum-pum-pum... \nLoaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nPitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in: \nRUDY ...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum... \nMERLIN (O.S.) Hi, Nick. \nRudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door shut -- \nRUDY What the fuck -- \n-- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again -- \n-- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a dresser. \nRudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests him to the ground. Grabs the bat -- \n-- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor -- \n-- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head! \nPug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing into one wall, then another, YELLING for help -- \nRUDY HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!! \n-- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun. \nRudy stops still. A lamp clicks on. \nStanding in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a sawed-off on him. \nGABRIEL Welcome home, Nick. \nAnother lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot of road. \nRudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne. \nPUG I owe ya a drink, ya fuck -- \n-- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door. \nGabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe. \nRUDY You... you don't know me -- \nGABRIEL Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well. \nRUDY No, you can't -- \nGABRIEL The hell I can't. \nAs the room's door gets kicked open -- \nASHLEY Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the fucking tree! \nand the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans -- \nRUDY ASHLEY! \nMerlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, followed by Ashley, face in branches -- \nASHLEY I'm telling you, we got the best one in the store... I don't know why people want their houses smelling like the stupid woods... \nShe's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground. \nRUDY NO! \nASHLEY NICK! \nRudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug have her held firmly. Her face to the wall -- \nGABRIEL (re: the silver tree) Hope her taste in men's better than her taste in Christmas. \nAshley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods. \nGABRIEL Hey, sis. Happy holidays. \nRudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel. \nAshley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her back against the wall for her trouble -- \nGABRIEL Jumpy, don't hurt her, now. \nGabriel steps to Rudy. Studies him. \nGABRIEL So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams. \nASHLEY Gabriel -- ! \nGABRIEL (unimpressed) Must have a way with stationery. \nMerlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns. \nRUDY About the Tomahawk! What the hell do you want to know! \nHis guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating. \nRUDY I spend six months writing poetry and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want me, you got me. Whaddya want to know. \nAshley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles. \nGABRIEL Everything. \nMerlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground: \nASHLEY I love you... Nick, I love you... \nRudy won't meet her eyes. \nGABRIEL Hey. She says she loves you, Nick. \nRUDY She says a lot of things. \nGABRIEL She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart. \nRUDY Wish I had a brother like you. \nGABRIEL A girl says she loves you, you say something. \nRudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness. \nRUDY I had better sex in prison. \nGABRIEL Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here. (to his boys) Get him back in the rig. \nMerlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes silent, casts her eyes to the snow. \nPUG (O.S.) He's not the guy, Monster. \nEveryone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw. \nIt hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls. \nPUG Whole time you were driving, he was telling her he's not the guy, he's not the guy. I know why he'd tell us he's not the guy. why's he telling her he's not the guy? What if he's not the guy? \nGabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy: \nGABRIEL The man who wrote those letters loved Ashley, boys. He lived for her love. (nods) Let's see him live for love. \nGabriel puts a gun under Rudy's chin. Rudy flinches. \nGABRIEL Where's she work? \nRUDY What? \nGABRIEL (forces gun harder) Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work? \nRUDY J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances. \nGABRIEL What's her middle name? \nRUDY (thinking hard) Samantha. \nGABRIEL What'd they call her in high school? \nRUDY Bam Bam. \nGABRIEL What'd they call her in college? \nRUDY What college. \nGABRIEL Where'd she drop her cherry? \nASHLEY Gabriel! \nRUDY Canada. \nGABRIEL Be more specific. \nRUDY A station wagon in Canada. \nGABRIEL What's her greatest fear? \nRUDY Her brother. \nGABRIEL Wrong, Nick. It's drowning. \nRUDY No. It's her brother. \nRudy stares him down. Gabriel shrugs. \nGABRIEL That's love. \nHe puts the gun away. Ashley regains her breath. \nGABRIEL Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- \nRUDY Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. \nGabriel gives a challenging stare. Rudy stares right back. \nIt's a showdown. \nMerlin exhales some smoke in Pug's face. Pug hacks, shoves him. \nGABRIEL And Nick? If you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? We go down... you go down... (lets it settle) Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards are there gonna be? \nRudy surveys the table. All five waiting for him. Sighs. \nRUDY Hell. Ten? \nGABRIEL And which of these doors here lead up to the security level? \nGabriel passes the map across the table. Rudy stares at it. \nMERLIN Start talking, Nick. \nRudy's still staring. \nPUG Start talkin \nRUDY Who the hell made this map. \nGABRIEL What? \nRUDY I said, who the hell made the map? \nGABRIEL I did. \nRUDY This isn't the Tomahawk. \nGABRIEL What the fuck are you talking about. \nRUDY This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around -- \nPUG That's what it looks like! \nRUDY Since when? What the hell is this room? \nMERLIN Buffet. Whaddya think it is? \nRUDY Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?! \nGabriel reaches across the booth, grabs Rudy's shirt, pulls his face to table level: \nGABRIEL We walked the place for a week. \nRUDY And I worked there. For a year. \nNeither man blinks. \nPUG Map is kinda dirty, Monster... \nRUDY They changed the layout. \nGABRIEL What? \nRudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon. \nRUDY They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it-- \nASHLEY Jack. Jack Bangs. \nRUDY Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. (pushes map away) I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where? \nGABRIEL They wouldn't have changed the security setup. \nRUDY When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... (stumbling) ...the Powwow Safe. \nJUMPY The Powwow Safe? \nRUDY His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed. \nGabriel stares at him, suspicious. \nGABRIEL So what the hell good are you... \nRUDY You'd have to get me inside. (carefully) Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map. \nGABRIEL Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you. \nPUG So what? \nGABRIEL They recognize him, they'll remember him after the job goes down. \nRUDY They won't recognize me. \nGABRIEL Why not. \nRUDY Trust me. They won't recognize me. \nGABRIEL We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not. \nRUDY 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. \nRudy locks eyes with Gabriel. \nRUDY I give you the wrong information, you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't know your damn map. So you can either find a way to get me in there... or you can shoot me right now. \nA WAITRESS comes over, drops their check on the table. It rests near Rudy. Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel. \nAnd pushes the check his way. \nEXT. SNOWY HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nASHLEY We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this... \nRUDY We? What \"we\"... \nRudy stares at her. The smile gone. \nRUDY Get your own room, Ashley. \nASHLEY Nick... \nRUDY Get your own room. \nAshley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way. \nASHLEY If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd have been gone. You'd have gotten on that bus and stayed on it. And if that's selfish, I am. If that's lying, I'm a liar. But I been dealing with fucked-up brother and his fucked-up friends for a long time, and I was stronger than him then and I'm stronger than him now. 'Cause he showed up for money. I showed up for love. (hard) And if you're so ready to make me your enemy... then what did you show up for, Nick. What did you really want... with me... \nWith a fiery look, she strides from the room. \nRudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards. \nOut his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking lot. \nRudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads \"Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long.\" \nRudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He turns back, surveys his new prison cell \nRUDY They've never done a robbery... (nods) Christmas is looking up. \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM - MORNING \nThe bed has been dragged to the door to the bathroom, the comforter and pillow are on the floor, \"Miracle on 34th St.\" is on the TV, and Rudy lies asleep on the ground, ankle still cuffed. \nTwo SHADOWS fall across him. \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nRudy is brusquely dragged out by Jumpy and Merlin, passing Ashley, who lies asleep in the hall, head on a pillow. \nMERLIN Having romance problems, Romeo? \nRUDY Not with you. \nThey march him onward. Rudy glances over his shoulder at Ashley. \nWho spent the night at his door. \nINT. GAME ROOM - MORNING \nA wood-panelled room adjacent to a small indoor pool, with arcade games and a dart board. Gabriel's with Pug, tossing darts, as Jumpy and a chain-smoking Merlin haul Rudy in. \nPUG Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke? \nMERLIN There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit? \nPUG Cancer-sucker. \nMERLIN Acid-chewer. \nGabriel THWAPS a dart into the board, to shut them up. \nGABRIEL Take a look what Pug's bought for ya. \nPug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine. Cowboy boots, spurs, a black cowboy hat, a black rhinestone jacket and a longhaired wig tumbles out. \nRUDY A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through? \nGABRIEL Put it on. \nMerlin and Jumpy shove Rudy toward the merchandise. Gabriel slams another dart into the board, then turns: \nGABRIEL You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps. \nRUDY What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots? \nGABRIEL You do. \nRUDY At least gimme video poker. \nGABRIEL Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place. \nRudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear. \nRUDY Do I get a country-western name? \nGABRIEL You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral. \nEXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY \nThe Chevy Nova crunches into the parking lot in the shadow of the gaudy neon axe. \nINT. NOVA - DAY \nRudy's in \"disguise\": paste-on goatee, tinted shades and black cowboy gear. Very Nashville Network. \nHe's wedged between Jumpy and Merlin, wearing handcuffs. Gabriel, Ashley and Pug in the back. \nRUDY Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to -- \nGABRIEL Get out. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \nYOUNG GOVERNOR We want you doing the job... that we brought you here to do. \nINT. TOMAHAWK - DAY \nRudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside: \nASHLEY So does it look a lot different? \nRUDY Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now. \nThey settle at a slot machine. Another SECURITY GUARD walks past them. Rudy turns his back. Ashley notices. \nASHLEY That guy knows you? \nRUDY Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike. \nAt the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the slots. \nRudy sees them. \nRUDY You start spending your brother's money. I'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. I'll snag us some drinks. \nAs he strides away -- \nASHLEY (sotto) Be careful, Nick... \nMOVING THROUGH THE CASINO \nwith Rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS. \nPassing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors turn their backs an him and storm out. \nARRIVING AT THE BAR \nRUDY Couple rum and Cokes, please. \nINDIAN BARTENDER You want that rum and Coke or rum and Pepsi? \nRudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy still scans the tables, settling on -- \nA BLACKJACK TABLE \nwhere a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. Rudy studies this kid for moment. \nJACK BANGS (O.S.) Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything. \nBACK AT THE BAR \nJack Bangs sidles up, distraught. The barkeep hands him a bottle. Bangs takes a swig. \nJACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I can't go back... \nBARTENDER What does the tribe want? \nJACK BANGS They want gold-paved roads is what they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin' Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the interstate. Nothing I can do about that, man, I didn't pick the spot for your reservation. \nBARTENDER Neither did we. \nJACK BANGS Yeah, yeah, whatever. \nRudy gets his drinks, as Jack Bangs turns his way: \nJACK BANGS Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run the place. Nice to have you in the Tomahawk. Tell me something... \nRudy winces, glancing to see Merlin and Jumpy watching him. Frowns on their faces. \nJACK BANGS ...does upstate Michigan need another roadside casino or does upstate Michigan need an international gaming destination? \nRUDY (wants outta here) Roadside casino? \nJack Bangs, smile falls flat. \nJACK BANGS Well, so how'd you hear about this place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass mailings? Cable TV? \nRUDY Prison. \nJACK BANGS Prison?! \nRudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before he can ask, the guy shakes his head -- \nFAT GUY I just stopped in to use the can. \nBangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands: \nJACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I can't... \nFrom the slots, we hear a JACKPOT PAYOFF. \nJACK BANGS Aw fuck. \nTHROUGH THE TABLES \nwalks Rudy, as Merlin sidles up next to him: \nMERLIN What the hell was that about -- \nRUDY He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me. \nMerlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. As he nears Ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where the College Kid has left... heading for the bathroom -- \nASHLEY Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents! \nRUDY MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM RARE??!! \n-- hands them the plate, hurries past them, and out the -- \nEXT. REAR OF CASINO - DAY \n-- to the back of the building. In his stolen clothes, he charges across the staff parking area and into the snowy expanse of meadow beyond. \nRunning for a thicket of winter woods. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nMerlin and Jumpy stride out to join Gabriel and Pug. Ashley follows, stumbling to keep up. \nGABRIEL Where the HELL did he go? \nMERLIN Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one. \nPUG That motherfucker -- \nMERLIN And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him. \nGabriel darkens. \nGABRIEL Get. Him. Back. \nEXT. SNOWY MEADOW - DAY \nRudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. He keeps struggling, losing his footing, fighting his way toward the cover of trees. From far away... \nASHLEY (O.S.) Nick! Run! RUN!!! \nRudy turns back to see Merlin, Jumpy and Pug round into view back at the parking lot. They see him. \nAnd charge into the snowfield. \nRudy breaks into the trees. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nGabriel pushes Ashley into the Nova and peals out of the parking lot. Onto reservation roads. \nEXT. WOODS - ON CHASE - DAY \nRudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper into snowdrifts, slowing him down. Stumbling forward, shivering, breath frosting -- \n-- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but struggling too. With guns held. \nRudy keeps battling through the drifts -- \n-- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest; the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him. \nRudy keeps running. \nINT. NOVA \nBouncing over a snowy dirt road, having found a shortcut into the woods. Gabriel searches the trees, Ashley too. \nEXT. WOODS \nMerlin, Jumpy and Pug keep up their steady march. Rudy's running figure now only fifty yards distant. \nMERLIN You keep running, Nick! Keep running now! Can't keep warm if you don't keep running! We'll just be right back here... keeping track of your trail. \nANGLE to show Merlin's striding right in Rudy's bootprints. Pug FIRES off two shots. \nThey KICK UP snow just behind Rudy, struggling, panting... \nMERLIN (O.S.) Wherever you run... we'll get there. Fast as you want... we'll be there. We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve, fifteen, twenty-hour days. \nRudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush away his footprints. Realizes it's useless. \nA BULLET whistles through the pine branches. \nMERLIN (O.S.) We got nothing but time. \nRudy takes a breath, crashes onward -- \n-- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder. Closer. It's a car's engine. \nRudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it. \nEXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY \nAs Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner comes a Chevy Nova -- \n-- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy. \nRudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded slope cradling a meadow and frozen river -- \nASHLEY No!!! \n-- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the other way. Gabriel fights her for control -- \n-- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow! \nOn the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road. \nAT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM \nRudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball. \n-- and Merlin slams the door in their face. Gabriel hurls another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board. \nGABRIEL A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain. \nRUDY (teeth chattering) ...never... tried... \nGABRIEL Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV. (beat) So we're gonna have a contest. \nGabriel strides back to him, with two darts. \nGABRIEL We're each going to get one of these. Whichever one of us hits closer to the bullseye... gets what he wants. (beat) You land closer, you get Ashley. And you guys get to go free. I land closer... and we start getting your help. \nHe lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to wedge it in. \nGABRIEL May the best sportsman win. \nGabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his dart. It thunks in the \"13\" wedge of the outermost ring. \nGABRIEL Damn. \nHe steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws -- \n-- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet. \nGabriel smiles, steps close. \nGABRIEL Got something to say to me, Nick? \nRUDY ...ttt..tt... two out of three? \nGabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. Rudy CRASHES into a chair, flanked by video games. \nGABRIEL What'd you tell that casino manager? \nRUDY Nnn... nothing... \nGABRIEL You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!? \nRUDY Nothing... I promise-nothing... \nGABRIEL MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY? \nRUDY NO! \nGabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the wall beside his ear. \nHe whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third HITS the wall by his chin. \nRUDY He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me! \nGABRIEL I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else... \nGabriel flings another dart. Just misses Rudy's other ear. \nGABRIEL ...Dispatcher's screaming for me to haul ass, he's got a load on the runback for me. Shipper's making me wait for the pickup, receiver's bitching 'bout the count... \nAnother dart NAILS the wall, right through Rudy's hair. \nGABRIEL ...Got the cops at the bottom of every mountain, got the DOT at the top. And every day, every day, I see all those faces in their little airbag Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam- faced kiddies, giving me that look to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway. Hey. They don't gotta get two thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come sunrise. \nGabriel strides to Rudy, sitting stock-still, his head ringed by darts. Stares him down. \nGABRIEL It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. (frightening calm) Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery? \nRUDY No, Gabriel... no... \nGabriel pulls the darts free. Backs away again. \nRUDY ...he... he asked me... how I'd heard about his place... he didn't know it was me... \nGABRIEL RAISES A DART TO THROW \nRUDY I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME! \n-- and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve, Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control. \nRUDY Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me... \nGABRIEL Nick. I been trying to hit you. \nGabriel rears back and WHISTLES another dart. It plugs into Rudy's chest. Rudy screams. Gabriel FIRES another, skewering him in the ribs. Then a third, fourth and fifth. \nRudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering and spreading rivulets of blood. \nGABRIEL Maybe that'll help sharpen your memory. \nGabriel stalks close. \nGABRIEL Tonight we're gonna take another look at that map. And this time you're gonna tell me what I need to know. \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM - DAY \nRudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits guard, watching \"How The Grinch Stole Christmas\" on TV. \nASHLEY Nick! Jesus, Nick -- \nShe falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out -- \nMERLIN Pug. \nPug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville. \nA medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at a booth, singing along to \"Good King Wencelas.\" \nIn the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court. Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing: \nPUG Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray. \nMERLIN That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue? \nThe Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad. \nPUG Hell. The guy from Joliet, those black-ass lungs were the least of his problems. Got so much smoke in him his lungs couldn't even hold it. Got into his system, man. Into his blood. Coming out his ears, man, coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking the row, smoke'd be puffing out his skin. \nThe Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs, takes another drag. \nMERLIN This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down. \nPUG My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers. \nMERLIN His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips? \nThe Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub: \nMERLIN (with disgust) Vegetarians... \nBehind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten, leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced. \nRudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. Gabriel throws down the casino map: \nGABRIEL Start singing. \nRUDY I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum \nGABRIEL Sing it in pictures, Nick. \nRudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge. For the first time, he's giving the orders: \nRUDY What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked. \nMERLIN How do we take them out? \nRUDY You gotta get someone upstairs. \nMERLIN How do we do that? \nRudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area: \nRUDY Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access. \nGABRIEL What's the code? \nRUDY Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. (beat) If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out. \nPUG Without having them hit the alarms. \nRUDY I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes. \nMERLIN What about the money? \nRUDY You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms. \nJUMPY What about the Powwow Safe? \nRUDY What? \nJUMPY The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money. \nRUDY Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. \nHis confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his eyes. Rudy quickly grabs the map again: \nRUDY So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. (beat) You need six. \nGABRIEL We got five. Putting Ashley outside. \nRUDY You need six. \nGabriel eyes him darkly. \nGABRIEL NO. \nRUDY You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six. (nods) Six is me. \nGABRIEL No. \nRUDY You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it. \nASHLEY Yeah. What're you gonna do about it. \nShe puts an arm around Rudy, smiles. That's her man. \nGABRIEL I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing. \nRUDY Six men means six guns. \nGABRIEL No way. \nRUDY I'm no threat without a gun. \nGABRIEL No, you're not. \nRUDY There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat. \nANGLE ON BEDFRAME \nAs two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle handcuff off the frame. \nANGLE ON CLOSET \nAs Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips the paper off, untwisting the wire. \nANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW \nAs Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside. \nEXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nLight snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer. \nAT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER \nRudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and gear boxes in the back seat. \nHe takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming it around until it trips the door lock. \nThe lock pops up; Rudy pops in -- \nINT. BLAZER \n-- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade. \nRUDY Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta be keeping a gun... \nHe rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing. \nSome HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nRudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing \nMERLIN AND JUMPY \nstride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear. \nON SCENE \nRudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side. Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him. \nRudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem to. They stand at the Nova, talking. \nRudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. He slips around the corner, out of sight. \nAROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL \nRudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving toward a side entry -- \n-- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER. \nAbove his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this wall. \nSounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES. \nRudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. Because his breathing has stopped. \nINT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT \nRudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads \"Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty.\" \nRudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view -- \nIt's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling and splashing someone offscreen -- \nASHLEY ...and he's saying \"We're not gonna help him just to walk away. If we're gonna help him... we're gonna get it all... \nShe splashes again. Taunting -- \nASHLEY ...he wants to help now, he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here, he'd go on and rob it by himself -- \nAs Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward her in the pool. \nGABRIEL He wants the money. \nASHLEY No, baby. He wants me. \nGabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles. \nASHLEY He wants... your \"sister\"... \nGABRIEL ...whoever she is. \nAnd they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. A steamy embrace. \nASHLEY Nick Mason's gonna help us more than we ever dreamed. \nANGLE ON RUDY \nin the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness. \nIN THE POOL \nGabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow. \nGABRIEL All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters... \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL \nMerlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the key. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nRudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front bumper. \nThe wheels start to move. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL \nMerlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key. \nMERLIN My room. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nThe Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up speed, rolling on its own. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL \nMerlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key. \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nThe Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof -- \n-- getting two roof-steps worth of running start -- \n-- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs -- \n-- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right through the window to his room -- \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM \n-- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet. \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL \nThe key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash -- \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM \n-- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. Spreading a deck of cards out before him. \nStarting a game of solitaire. He looks up. \nRUDY Hey. \nMerlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The window's open. Rudy continues his card game. \nMerlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut. \nOnce he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, heart pounding. The cards go flying. \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks outside... and stops still. In parking lot... \n...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's seat. It's Merlin. Now watching. \nRudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches the falling snow. Caged again, after all. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nPitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back in. \nSeeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him. \nASHLEY Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve... \nAshley closes her eyes. With a smile. \nA moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare... \nINT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY \nCLOSE ON DESK CLERK \nIn a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully: \nSMILING DESK CLERK Hello, gentlemen. And how can we help you on this holiday morning? \nCLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG \nThree grim faces. \nGABRIEL Checking out. \nEXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces overnight. \nGabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. Rudy hits the snow -- \nASHLEY Gabriel! \nGABRIEL That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. (then KICKS him) And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar. \nINT. TOMAHAWK - ON BLACKJACK \nRudy bolts up suddenly, sends chips and his chair to the carpet. \nPoints sternly at the Old Timer, slurring: \nRUDY Switch seats with me. \nOLD TIMER What? No... \nRUDY You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money -- \nOLD TIMER I'm ninety-two years old -- \nRUDY Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money! \nOLD TIMER There is no other table -- \nRUDY THEY'LL OPEN ONE! \nRudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his might, \nOVERTURNING IT, cards, chips, cash scattering -- \nAND EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE \nTwo SECURITY GUARDS at the door (?) rush for Rudy -- \nGabriel steps from the restroom, hall, moves toward the keypad door to the security level -- \nJumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage -- \nRudy tackles the Old Timer, fists and false teeth flying, as the Guards arrive, trying to wrench him off the poor guy -- \nRUDY (hard whisper) Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down! \nAs Gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door -- \nIN THE SECURITY LEVEL \nThe Security Boss grabs more men, while Jack Bangs merely smiles at the sight. Guards wrestling a drunken Santa: \nSECURITY BOSS Help them down there! HELP them! \nIN THE CASINO \nThree guards CHARGE out of the keypad door -- \n-- right past Gabriel, who slips deftly inside -- \nAND UP THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE \n-- opening his coat, pulling his assault rifle -- \nGABRIEL \nRight at the top of the stairs, right at the top of the stairs... \n-- charging to the top, starting right and running SMACK into a wall. \nHe spins, sees the doorway's on his left -- \nTO A PRIVATE HALLWAY \nwith three doors. Gabriel stops at the first, grips his gun -- \nGABRIEL Video room, video room -- \n-- and swings open a closet bathroom. He frowns, confused. Jumps to the second door -- \nGABRIEL Map said video room -- \n-- and swings open a storage closet. Gabriel grumbles, leaps to the third door and flings it open, \nGABRIEL Map said goddamn video room! \nTO REVEAL THE MAIN SECURITY AREA \n-- with two Guards sitting at their posts, and Jack Bangs, the Security Boss and the Video Guard in the doorway to the video room. Which is on the far opposite side of the space. \nAs they turn to see the furious Santa Claus with the AK-47 -- \nGABRIEL WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!! \n-- as he SPRAYS the ceiling with GUNFIRE. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR \nWhere the RIFLE sounds, just as Jumpy grips his bucket of quarters at the cashier's cage and wheels -- \n-- throwing a fragmentation grenade's worth of quarters at the two Cashiers! Bits Of metal flying between the bars. They SCREAM, stepping backwards in defense -- \n-- and Jumpy whips a sawed-off shotgun from his coat -- \nJUMPY Step BACK from the desks! \nAT THE BLACKJACK \nThe five guards wrestling Rudy spin and scramble, pulling pistols from shoulder holsters as -- \nMERLIN \nTHE CHEVY NOVA \nCRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen! \nThe car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray. \nAshley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care. \nASHLEY (wild-eyed) WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK! \nRUDY Yeah. That's love. \nShe storms on by. The slots pay off behind her. \nINT. COUNT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nJumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room. There are stacks and stacks of bills. \nAshley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks. \nASHLEY MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! \nMerlin, meanwhile, slams Rudy against the wall: \nMERLIN You knew there were guns in here! \nRUDY Merlin, I didn't know -- \nMERLIN You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free -- \nRUDY I promise you, I didn't know! \nAs Merlin puts a gun to Rudyls head -- \nGABRIEL (O.S.) (over casino speakers) Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa Claus... would you please bring our... mapmaker... to the security level? \nMerlin stares daggers at Rudy. Shoves the gun away. \nINT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - NIGHT \nGabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. The taped jingle of slots still plays. \nPoor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock: \nJACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas... I can't... go back... \nJUMPY (O.S.) What the hell is with this place? Thought the video room was back there -- \nMerlin and Jumpy lead Rudy in. Ashley follows. They carry bulging money sacks. Gabriel stares Rudy down. \nGABRIEL I told you not to fuck us with that map, Nick. I told you not to, and you did. How am I s'posed to keep my promises now? (Ashley joins him) How's she s'posed to keep hers? \nHe kisses her hard. Sloppy. Grins. \nThen points to Jack Bangs: \nGABRIEL He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe. \nJACK BANGS I don't know... what you're... \nGabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle. CRACK. \nGABRIEL THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE! \nJACK BANGS What... Powwow... \nGABRIEL The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians! \nJACK BANGS I don't steal any -- \nGabriel CRACKS him again. And again. Rudy winces. Gabriel grabs Rudy, pulls him over. \nGABRIEL We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you work! Because WE know who's worked for you! (smiles) Remember a guy named Nick Mason!?  A security guard named Nick Mason!? \nGabriel pushes Rudy's head toward the desk. Jack Bangs, drooling blood, eyes swollen, turns his face to see. \nJACK BANGS Nick... Mason... ? \nJack Bangs stares at Rudy. Rudy stares back. \nJACK BANGS ...so where is he? \nGABRIEL (laughs, mocking) Where is he?! Where is he?! \nJACK BANGS He's not Nick Mason... \nThe smile fades from Gabriel's face. \nJACK BANGS Nick Mason... worked for me two years ago. This man... (a spark of recognition) ...he's some cowboy... \nGabriel grabs Rudy, slams him against a wall. He glares at Ashley for answers. She stares in disbelief. \nRudy meets her eyes. \nRUDY Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley. (shrugs) Story of your life. \nBACK TO GABRIEL: \nRUDY I did time with Nick Mason, Monster. Told you that from the start. \nAshley's putting it all together... \nIN THE CASINO \nGabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward them, still FIRING and babbling. \nGabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, slamming it into reverse -- \n-- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight. \nJack Bangs stops shooting. \nHe staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, gun still raised. \nRudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, face. The uzi drops to the ground. \nA silence. Even the slots have stopped. \nRUDY I'm sorry. \nJack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor man's empire. And gives a small shrug. \nJACK BANGS That's why they call it gambling. \nHe slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nRudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He takes a few wary steps toward the road -- \n-- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head. \nASHLEY Your turn. \nRudy shuts his eyes for the end. \nEXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT \nThe Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab. \nEXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way. \nINT. GABRIEL'S RIG \nGabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks: \nGABRIEL With the wrong fucking guy! We took the place down with the wrong fucking guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is that Christmas?! \nHe grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back -- \nTO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT \nWhere Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt. \nGABRIEL God bless us every one... \nEXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT \nA winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been no traffic here for awhile. \nThe Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge. \nA hundred-foot drop into the ravine below. \nGabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer to five feet away from, the ravine drop. \nIN THE CAB \nGabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back -- \nTO THE RAVINE'S EDGE \n-- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with a can of gasoline. \nGABRIEL You almost got away with it, Santa. Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to Canada till you caught some ice in the road. By the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet.  Musta burned up all that money too. \nRudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls of bills into the car. \nGABRIEL Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End. \nRUDY Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers. \nGabriel smiles at him. \nGABRIEL She told me 'bout the convict magazines. Had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. With nobody to talk to. Nobody to listen. So we stocked up on stationery. \nAshley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her. \nGABRIEL Hard life being a trucker's girl. \nRudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back. \nRUDY I saved your life. \nASHLEY You shouldn't have. \nRUDY He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you. \nASHLEY Who wouldn't. \nSo cold. But Rudy doesn't pause. \nNICK Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley? \nRUDY And you set me up. \nNICK Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me. \nNick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer: \nNICK Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up... (notes cash-sacks) Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man. \nRUDY How'd you know I'd do it. \nNICK Do what? \nRUDY Walk outta there and tell her I was you. \nNick looks back at Ashley. \nNICK Because every time I read her letters, Rudy... you listened. (to Ashley) Keep your gun on him. \nNick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel. \nNICK Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll say. So we gotta have five Santas not walk out. Gotta have five... (working) This'll burn right away... in the fire... \nNick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs. \nNICK Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by -- \nRUDY Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember \nNICK Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough. \nNick slams the car door, locking Rudy in. \nNICK They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man. \nRUDY You gave them me. \nNICK I gave them me. (shrugs, smiles) Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. \nNick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car into \"Drive.\" Turns to Ashley: \nNICK Sweetness! Let's light up the tree! \nAshley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova. \nIN THE CAR \nRudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point -- \n-- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to his right wrist! \nRudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through the Santa belt -- \n-- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either Ashley or Nick to see -- \nIN THE TRAILER \nAshley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp -- \nNICK Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time with you! \nIN THE CAR \nThe belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free! \nAs Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy -- \n-- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate the right leads -- \nIN THE TRAILER \nAshley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the flaming car to the trailer's edge -- \n-- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead -- \n-- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire -- \nIN THE CAR \nRudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him -- \nRUDY LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE! \n-- and the ENGINE IGNITES! \nRudy slams the gearshift into \"Reverse\", grabs the wheel and looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him -- \nRUDY RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND THE WHEEL! \n-- and SLAMS the accelerator. \nON FULL SCENE \nAs the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back into the trailer -- \nTerrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go -- \n-- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's legs between metal and metal! \nASHLEY NOOOOOOO!!! \n", "test1_input": "There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING. Nick smiles, still staring at his girl. \nNICK Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be thinking about you. \nINT. MAIN PRISON FLOOR - DAY \nGUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the line. \nRUDY Shit. Alamo's back. \nAcross Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands are the size of a man's skull. \nNICK Don't look like he missed the sunlight. \nRUDY Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary. \nNICK Aw, Rudy. \nAt that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy swiftly looks away -- \nRUDY Count me outta mealtime -- \nHe slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell -- \nMEAN GUARD GET BACK IN LINE! \nRUDY I'm not hungry, I'm gonna -- \nMEAN GUARD SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET BACK IN FUCKING LINE! \nThe mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble. \nRudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy swallows, heads toward the mess hall. \nINT. MESS HALL - DAY \nA GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line. \nNICK What the fuck is this? \nUGLY STAFFER Holiday jello. \nNICK What's this shit in it? \nUGLY STAFFER Swallow and see. \nThe ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help: \nNICK Just so you know, this man and I are outta here in two days. So while we're inhaling London broil and lobster bisque, you're gonna still be standing here smelling up the mystery creamfuck. (nods) Who's in prison now? \nThe ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, taking his tray off the rail and turning -- \n-- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over. \nTHE ALAMO When you don't expect it. \nRUDY It wasn't me, Alamo -- \nTHE ALAMO That's when. \nThe Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help: \nNICK Two days. \nINT. MESS HALL - TABLES - DAY \nRudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks to no one, always has the shakes. \nNICK So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work. \nRUDY What, working security? \nNICK No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going. \nRUDY I don't know, I've seen the business world. \nNICK Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume. \nRudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned. \nNICK Ashley's talking about maybe we can start something up together... \nNext to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone, staring at his tray. \nNICK Whatsa matter, Zook? \nThey both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into his red-and-green jello with his bare hand. \nRUDY The hell you doing, Zookerman? \nGloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking. \nNICK Just a roach, Zook. \nRUDY Good for you. Protein. \nZOOK Monsters in the gelatin... \nNICK It's a roach, guy -- \nZOOK There are monsters... (voice rising) ...in the gelatin... \n", "test1_true": "Zook stands up, holding jello aloft: \nZOOK THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN! \nNICK (shakes his head) Fuckin, Zookerman -- \nZOOK THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! \nA GRUMBLING MURMUR sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates sift through their jello, searching for -- \nDISTANT INMATE Sonofabitch! \nHe pulls something bug-like out of his dessert, holds it aloft, and then HURLS it at the cafeteria line. A STAFFER ducks away. The inmates LAUGH and suddenly they're all on their feet -- \nZOOK THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! \n-- grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria line. Inmates get errantly SPLASHED, and respond by wheeling on their fellow inmates -- red and green globs flying to and fro! \nGUARDS SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN! \nAs GUARDS immediately rush in to restore order -- \nNICK Rudy, don't move -- \nRUDY Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing -- \nAn INMATE at the end of their table picks up their table and overturns it, sending food flying. Rudy and Nick stand back, hands raised in surrender. Jello HITS Rudy in the face. \nNICK Don't move, Rudy! \nRUDY Standing right here, man! \nZook is still SHOUTING until a GUARD clubs him senseless with a blackjack. WHISTLES are blowing. Guards SCREAM for order. \nNICK (as a GUARD eyes them) Ate the jello, jello was fine! \nThe guard leaves them alone, runs on. The melee's still out of control. As Rudy turns -- \n-- and suddenly sees The Alamo charging across the room, with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! Five feet away! \nNICK RUDY, LOOK OUT! \nNick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way -- \n-- and The Alamo's shank plunges deep into Nick's stomach burying between his ribs. Blood splashes. Nick slumps. \nRUDY NICK! \nThe Alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious YELL, pushes Nick to the floor and spins on Rudy! Rudy blocks with a chair, stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as The Alamo roars over him for the kill -- \n-- and two GUARDS tackle the big Indian out of nowhere! Knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. It takes another three guards to keep The Alamo down. \nRudy scrambles across the floor. Nick's on his back, blood pumping freely from his gut -- \nRUDY GUARD! GUARD! \nNICK (in shock) Alamo... \nRUDY GUARD!!! \nNo one's helping, the guards nearby all subduing The Alamo. Nick grabs Rudy's shirt, gasping to speak -- \nNICK Jesus, Rudy -- \nRUDY Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! \nNICK Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus... \nRUDY GUARD!!! \nNICK Ash... Ashley... \nRUDY No, man! No, no, no! \nNICK (choking) Tell her... I'll be there ... \nRUDY You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT! \nNICK Tell Ashley... I... \nRUDY YOU TELL HER! \nNICK ...be with her... \nBlood spills out Nick's mouth. His eyes go vacant. \nRUDY NO!!! \nNICK ...for Christmas... \nRUDY NICK!!! \nAnd Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing. \nGUARDS GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN! \nRUDY NICK!!! \nRudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor. \n", "test2_input": "Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile: \nGABRIEL I've read your letters, motherfucker. Don't play no reindeer games with me. \nEXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT \nAs we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, arcing into the blackness. \nCLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward, emblazoned with \"Great Lakes Trucking.\" There's an airbrush painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru a flaming radial tire, and the legend \"Motor City Monster.\" \nINT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT \nGabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies. A TRUCK passes; Gabriel waves. A moment later, the CB crackles: \nPASSING DRIVER (OVER CB) Hey there, Monster! What're you hauling this far north? \nGABRIEL Hell, Bugeye. How you doin'? Ain't hauling, man, I'm up for the holidays. Gonna have myself a holiday... for a goddamn change... \nINT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON RUDY \neyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. He winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches. \nASHLEY (O.S.) Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you now. You're okay... \nHer hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open. \nON FULL SCENE \nThey're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats, rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova. \nRudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze. \nIn a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on. Gives Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine. \nASHLEY I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore. \nRUDY Your brother... \nAshley nods. Rudy looks around, remembering. \nRUDY ...the truck driver... \nASHLEY He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not... \nFrom the corner, Pug spits some chaw. Ashley wheels. \nASHLEY You're not gonna hurt him anymore! \nPug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face: \nASHLEY Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job -- \nRUDY What the fuck is going on. \nASHLEY He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. \nRUDY What's going ON!!! \nThe truck shakes. \nASHLEY He knows you worked in that casino. \nRudy stares at her. She's scared \nRUDY You motherfucker. \nASHLEY Nick, no -- \nRUDY You sold him out. \nASHLEY Nick -- \nRUDY When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?! \nASHLEY Nick, what are you -- \nShe reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles against the opposite wall of the trailer. \nRUDY I'M NOT NICK! (raging) You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! \nASHLEY Nick, I love you -- \nRUDY JESUS CHRIST! \nPUG Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas. \nRUDY I'M NOT NICK! \nAshley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. He tries to fight her off. She won't let go. \nRUDY Get the hell off of me! \nASHLEY (hard whisper) Nick, it won't work. It won't work! \nRudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye. Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley turns them away from the little guy's view \nASHLEY He'll kill you. \nRUDY You're not hearing me here -- \n", "test2_true": "RUDY He didn't \"find\" Nick's letters, did he. \nASHLEY Nick, please, it's me -- \nRUDY You told him about Nick's letters. \nASHLEY No, Nick, no -- \nRUDY You're in on this. \nASHLEY I love you! \nRudy stares at her coldly. \nRUDY Y'know, in a way, I'm glad it's me. 'Cause you woulda broken his heart. \nAshley stares, panicked. Pug's still watching them. \nRUDY Your pen palls dead, lady. \nASHLEY If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work! \nRUDY Nick died for me.... \nASHLEY I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know! \nRUDY (ruefully) ...maybe I die for Nick... \nASHLEY Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this! \nRudy gives her a stone cold stare. Ashley crumbles, touching his face, shaking her head, tears. Devastated. \nASHLEY He found them... I swear, Nick... (helpless) ...he found them... \nThe truck shudders through downshifts, to a groaning stop. Ashley embraces Rudy fiercely, holding on for the last. \nThe trailer gate RATTLES open into the truck's roof. \nAshley shuts her eyes. \nEXT. REST STOP/INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CONTINUOUS \nThe rig all alone at a snowy rest area. Gabriel, Merlin and Jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. Gabriel surveys, then lifts a piece of paper: \nGABRIEL \"My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have been dreaming of you constantly, and knowing you are out there makes these walls not seem so close or so strong or so cold...\" (to Merlin/Jumpy) Women live for this stuff. (reads on) Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming 'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on me here, Nicky... where are we... oh, right, other side... (turns paper over) \"Someday I'm gonna take you up by Lake S. Before I went in, before goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my situation, I used to work up at this casino, working security. Used to watch for people stealing chips, counting cards, getting piss-drunk, that kinda shit. Indian place, they hired this reject outta Vegas to run it, got about as much business sense as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a fun place to run some numbers and play.\" \nGabriel puts the letter down. \nGABRIEL You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus. \nRUDY I never worked at no casino. \nASHLEY (hopeless) Nick... \nRudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward: \nRUDY That's the guy I was in with, I did my last ten months with him. He rode a two-year bit for manslaughter -- split a guy's skull open at a bar for harassing his girl. That's Nick Mason. He worked at that casino. He's the one who wrote her letters. Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job was a Quickie Lube, I did five for lifting cars. I don't know shit about blackjack, I don't know shit about Indians. I'm not him. \nGabriel stares at him. Then crumples the letter. \nGABRIEL Bury this guy. \nMerlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound. \nASHLEY Gabriel, you promised! \nGABRIEL I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play! \nMerlin and Jumpy drop to the snow, picking Rudy up. \nASHLEY You promised me! \nGABRIEL And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help! \nRudy meets eyes with Ashley. She's caught. \nGABRIEL He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. (to Merlin/Jumpy) Bury him all over the place. \nASHLEY NO! \nShe charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock. \nMerlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark and snowy woods ahead... \nMERLIN Beats prison, I guess. \nASHLEY (O.S.) NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!! \nRudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a handgun, as he muses for the very first time: \nJUMPY The problem with prison... is that it is founded on the fundamentally flawed perception of rehabilitation through punishment. A society can't hope to create a \"changed man\" by surrounding him with the worst in his fellow man; what it \"rehabilitates\" is solely a conviction that if he can survive the inhumanity of prison, what then, can he not withstand? He has seen man's darkest soul and kept his sight: what is left for such a man? What faith? What fear? \nAt the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin -- \nJUMPY Don't get no blood on my boots -- \nThe gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber. Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and -- \nRUDY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW! \n", "test3_input": "EXT.

Stairs to a camera catwalk that rings the casino. \nJack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the bottle for himself.

Merlin, Pug and Ashley inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy: \nGABRIEL Go. \nRudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out. \nGabriel's rig rumbles up the road. \n[NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end, are in their Santa Claus suits.] \nRUDY AND JUMPY \nmake their way across the lot, heading for the entrance. \nRUDY Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you something. You have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an Indian casino? \nThe Native American considers. As they walk: \nJUMPY Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. Stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment... they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. Still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any United States suburb, satellite city or industrial park. Destroying the Indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which I, it's true, am one -- \n-- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors -- \nINT.

Surveying the casino: \nRUDY Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody! \nRudy spreads his Santa arms wide and whoops. Jumpy laughs with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred: \nRUDY Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- MONEY! \nThe few gamblers inside look up at the commotion. Bear the Bartender. Two CASHIERS and one WAITRESS. Ed the Security Boss strides over, smiling tightly: \nSECURITY BOSS How you gentlemen doing tonight? \nRUDY We're out of work tonight, that's how! Christmas Eve! We're out of work! \nJUMPY (shakes his hand) Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season... \nRUDY We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations! \nRudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket, drops some to the floor. Jumpy retrieves them -- \nJUMPY ...bunch of us got together for the union party. Hey, how late are you open? \nSECURITY BOSS (eyes on the money) All night and all day. \nRUDY I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress Civil Defense Fund! Are there any representatives here present? \nA Waitress sidles close; checks with the Boss.

Got a buddy from Woolworth's out parking the sleigh. \nThe Security Boss stares him down. Then: \nSECURITY BOSS Good luck, gentlemen. \nHe steps aside and indicates the tables. Jumpy claps him on the back, pushes Rudy on through the slots. \nEXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT \nGabriel's truck at the roadside, hazards on, with signal triangles as if broken down. Gabriel places the last one, hurries back down the casino road. \nEXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA - NIGHT \nAshley sits between Merlin and Pug.

What can I get ya, Santa? \nJUMPY Jack and Coke. \nWAITRESS Want that Jack and Coke or Jack and Pepsi? \nBehind them, Gabriel SLAMS through the casino doors. \nJUMPY Woolworth's! \nGABRIEL Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart! \nJUMPY Saved you a seat, man. Get in on a hand here! \nGabriel sidles to the table, claps Rudy on the back. \nRUDY (re: Old Timer) Careful. Watch out for this guy. \nThey throw chips in. The Waitress circles around: \nWAITRESS What can I get ya, Santa? \nGABRIEL American beer. \nThe Old Timer hits and stays. Rudy hits and busts: \nRUDY POP! That was My card! \nOLD TIMER But... I had a five... \nRUDY You're hitting for MY cards! \nEXT. PARKING LOT \nAshley's eyes on her watch. Nods to Merlin and Pug: \nASHLEY Go. \nINT. TOMAHAWK \nJumpy has left the table, sidling to a change booth, glancing at his watch. Passes a $100 bill: \nJUMPY Could Fat-Man-With-Flying-Horse get some quarters, please? \nAT THE BLACKJACK \nGabriel slides off his stool, punches Rudy in the shoulder: \nGABRIEL Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank. \nRudy nods, slugging beer. He's becoming an unruly drinker. The Old Timer motions to hit; but before the Dealer can pull the card, Rudy slams the table, points to it: \nRUDY That is my card, guy. My card. \nDEALER He hit, mister. \nRUDY He didn't hit. (to Old Timer) You didn't hit. You're not hitting. \nOLD TIMER But you don't even know what it is! \nThe dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. Then hits Rudy and busts him. Rudy stares darkly. \nIN THE HALL TO THE BATHROOMS \nGabriel walks to the men's room door. Then stops. Adjusts the rifle under his red coat. And turns back. \nAT THE CHANGE BOOTH \nJumpy is handed a bucket of quarters. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - SAME \nMerlin and Pug march toward the entrance, hands in pockets. \nINT. SECURITY LEVEL \nThe Security Boss returns upstairs, beside Jack Bangs, who's watching the video monitors. On one screen, a parking lot cam shows Merlin and Pug approaching: \nVIDEO GUARD There's two more coming. \nJACK BANGS Hell, there we go. That's the spirit. \nHe drunkenly clinks his battle to the Security Boss, wassail. The Boss frowns. \nSECURITY BOSS Jack? Is there a union for department store Santas? \n"}

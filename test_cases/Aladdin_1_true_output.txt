(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.) 
GENIE:  (He can't believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  "I want the Nile."   Wish for the Nile.  Try that! ALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile. GENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin' the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I-- 
(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.) 
ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you. GENIE:  Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me. 
(They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.) 
SULTAN: That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the problem. JASMINE:    Father? SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy. JASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.) Him!  I choose...I choose you, Aladdin. ALADDIN:    Ha, ha.  Call me Al. 
(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.) 
GENIE:  Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug! Mind if I kiss the monkey?  (He kisses ABU.)  Ooh, hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye, you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care what I am--I'm free! 
(The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse) to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.) 
ALADDIN:    A whole new world JASMINE:        A whole new life BOTH:   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me! MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world! 
(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.)

In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back against the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and she can't stop screaming. 
POP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr. Brooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the wall. The screaming stops. 
The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the Girl. 
Mr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the scent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket. 
MARSHALL (O.S.) (barks) Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is this?!! 
Mr. Brooks snaps a look. 
The curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of an alley can see into this room. 
Most of their windows are dark. And there's no one looking out of the windows that are lit. 
MARSHALL These pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, Earl. This is a big mistake for you, Earl. 
MR. BROOKS (going to the window) Almost like I want to get caught, huh, Marshall? 
MARSHALL Well, don't fucking do that. I don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MR. BROOKS Yes, sir. 
He grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose. The attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with. 
INT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his murder clothes are being reduced to ash. 
Arranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in sexual positions. 
MR. BROOKS Please forgive me... Please forgive me... 
As we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed. 
One by one, Mr. Brooks picks up his souvenirs. He lingers over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge of a table: 
MARSHALL Don't even think about it. You know the rules. 
Reluctantly Mr. Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of the kiln. 
MARSHALL Now go up and make love to your beautiful wife. 
He leaves. In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame. 
EXT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ AFTERNOON 
The sunlight exposes its charm. 
If it weren't for the Police tape, the UNIFORMED OFFICERS, and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES, it looks like it would be a cool place to live. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
An OLDER DETECTIVE, an African-American, comes out on the porch and calls to two other DETECTIVES who are drinking coffee on the lawn: 
OLDER DETECTIVE Where the fuck is Atwood?! 
YOUNG DETECTIVE I called ten minutes ago, they said she was on her way. 
OLDER DETECTIVE She doesn't get here soon, these bodies won't even be dead anymore? 
A Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape: 
COP You looking for the lady Cop? 
OLDER DETECTIVE Yeah. 
COP She's here. She's been sitting in her car right over there for the last half hour. 
OLDER DETECTIVE Oh, Christ. 
EXT. ATWOOD'S CAR Ñ AFTERNOON 
Special Detective TRACY ATWOOD, somewhere in her 30's, is behind the wheel. The door is open. 
By the expression on her face we might guess that Detective Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car. 
On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune. The headline of a middle article on the first page reads: THE HANGMAN ESCAPES. 
Move up to Atwood's face. The Older Detective followed by the Younger Detective approaches. 
OLDER DETECTIVE You thinking of joining us anytime soon, Atwood? 
Atwood doesn't look at the Detectives for a long beat and when she does her expression is not friendly.

MICHAEL You're not going to use that gun, Johnny. 
JOHNNY BOY doesn't answer but holds the gun straight at MICHAEL'S face. MICHAEL turns to go, defying JOHNNY BOY. His friends follow. When he reaches the doorway, he turns. 
MICHAEL You don't have the guts to use that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony, and of course you John...be seeing you. 
They leave. 
JOHNNY BOY is still frozen with the gun in his hand, pointing it at mid-air. CHARLIE slams JOHNNY BOY across the face with his fist. TONY takes the gun from his hand. 
CHARLIE You stupid bastard! Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it. 
He hits JOHNNY BOY again. 
TONY (HOLDING GUN) ...No bullets in it. 
CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY again. 
TONY Get out of here before this really goes up. 
CHARLIE Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean? 
TONY (RELUCTANTLY) Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.

SCENE FROM "TOMB OF LIGEIA" 
A young girl is in her room with her maid. The maid is helping her dress. Eerie music creates a frightening atmosphere. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY watch nervously affected by the film's mood. The theatre is a 42nd street one with lots of sleeping drunks. 
Suddenly, the maid's face begins to contort as if she's seeing something horrible. The audience is on edge. The young girl sees the maid and shouts "What is it?" - but the maid only sneezes.

EXT. NIGHT - TONY'S CONVERTIBLE - BLACK AND WHITE 
CHARLIE is driving. JOHNNY BOY is beside him in the front seat. The top od the car is down and CHARLIE is driving with no particular destination in mind. 
JOHNNY BOY I think we should see your uncle. 
CHARLIE No. 
JOHNNY BOY This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame. 
CHARLIE Forget it. 
JOHNNY BOY What are you going to do? Hide me? 
CHARLIE Good idea. 
JOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock song. 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned...more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord? I know penance is penance but this is something else. 
JOHNNY BOY opens his eyes. 
JOHNNY BOY What are you talking to yourself??? 
He turns up the radio. 
CHARLIE (SARCASTIC) Go ahead! Play the radio...play music...you're going to a party... louder! Go ahead. Louder. A party. Lots of fun. 
A black sedan has been driving along parallel to CHARLIE'S car, unnoticed by CHARLIE. Otherwise the street is deserted. The car begins to drive CHARLIE off the road. 
CHARLIE Hey, what is this guy, crazy?

PETE (O.S.) Hello? Is anybody home? 
BILLY 
(SHOUTS) n here, Pete. Billy holds the tray of brownies to him. 
BILLY Want some? 
PETE _ I'm s'posed to be on a diet... He grabs a brownie. He notices Mogwai's case. 
PETE What's in there? Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback. 
PETE What is it? 
BILLY A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai. 
PETE It's neat. Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie and starts to eat. 
PETE Hey, Billy.. .You think I might be able to borrow it? Just for a night? 
BILLY I dunno, Pete... 
PETE C'mon...My Mom will never know. I'll hide it under my bed. Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily knocks over the water bottle. A few drops of water splash Mogwai. The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched scream. Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared. Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with water begin to bubble... .expand...' Billy can't believe his eyes. Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more, getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode. Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated. The spots burst. 
FOUR NEW CREATURES popout. Clones of Mogwai. The spots on Mogwai's body bond together and disappear, as if they were never there. There are now five identical creatures on the desktop. Billy and Pete share a shocked glance. Billy grabs the water bottle. He has to be certain that he wasn't halucinating. He splashes a little more water on one of the new creatures. The process begins again. The creature's body,contorts. A few lumps form. The lumps expand until...they burst.

THREE MORE CREATURES ARE BORN. Billy tries to make sense out of it all. EIGHT CREATURES stand on.the desk top, examining their new world. Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk on one of the crealtures. Nothing happens. 
BILLY They must only multiply with plain tap water. 
PETE 
(AMAZED) 
M Wow..â¢.thisâ¢is better than "Twilight Zone ( ) Pete looks at Billy. 
PETE Now can I have one? 
BILLY (still dazed) Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group. 
PETE 
(SCARED) Maybe I won't take one. The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the brownies to pieces, devouring them. They're giggling.

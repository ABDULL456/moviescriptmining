PILOT (to Yuri, anxious) I'm putting us down. 
YURI (incredulous) You land and we're all going away!  I don't have paperwork! 
PILOT (incredulous) We're in a flying fucking bomb!  They're firing bullets at our bullets!  Forget about going away!  They shoot again, we're going away for good!  I'm putting us down. 
YURI (knowing he's right) Okay!  Okay!--Fuck!! 
The pilot responds on the radio. 
PILOT (into radio) This is Charlie Echo India.  Descending on heading zero two nine. 
The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport.  Yuri surveys the terrain below, getting his head back in the game. 
YURI (pointing out a narrow highway) Not the airport.  There.  The highway.  It's our only fucking hope. 
PILOT (concerned) A pothole could set us off. 
YURI Don't underestimate yourself.  You're the best, Tony. 
The pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway. 
INT.  INTERPOL JET.  DAY. 
From his own wingseat, VALENTINE observes the Ilyushin's detour, landing on the highway. 
INTERPOL PILOT I can't land there. 
VALENTINE (to the pilot) He can't get far.  I want a truck waiting on the tarmac. 
EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY. 
A heavily-trafficked highway.  WOMEN carrying water jars on their heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling dry meat, CHILDREN playing war games. 
The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its final approach - they scatter. 
The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole. 
INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down. 
Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines shutting down.  YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window. 
Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side of the road. 
YURI (to the pilots, sizing up the locals) We're going to be okay. 
The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing supplies as they go. 
YURI (cont'd) (calling out from the window) Where are you going? 
PILOT As far from the evidence as I can. 
The pilots start running down the highway. 
YURI Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be any evidence!  Stay with the plane! 
The pilots ignore him - run for their lives. 
YURI is left alone.  He turns a lever marked, "CARGO BAY". 
EXT.  CARGO BAY.  DAY. 
The rear cargo bay opens.  YURI stands beside his incriminating merchandise. 
YURI (to the gathering locals) Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge. 
One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.  Yuri hands him an AK-47 and a box of shells. 
More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road, seemingly out of thin air. 
Yuri hands out more guns. 
YURI (cont'd) (to other locals) Take the whole crate. 
Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away. 
The other locals become bolder, then brazen. 
Soon it's a free-far-all.  Men, women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted down - also a lot that is. 
Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush. 
EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY. 
YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of grenades. 
He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos. 
Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses. 
YURI (muttering under his breath, shutting off the calculator in disgust) What a fucking disaster.

Who was it? \nWILL EMERSON Eric... \nERIC Was it Rogers? \nWILL EMERSON You know me. I'm not gonna say... \nERIC Robertson? \nWILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence. \nERIC (cont'd) That cunt. I knew it. I never should have gone to her last year. \nWILL EMERSON Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad luck.

While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. Alright? Good luck. \nERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs up the last of his things, which does not take long, then stands and gets ready to walk out. He looks around and heads out into the cubicle area. \nINT. OUTSIDE ERIC DALE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nOutside his office PETER and SETH are standing to say goodbye. \nPETER Eric, I am very sorry. \nSETH Yeah. Did they say what was going to happen with us? \nPETER Jesus Seth. \nSETH What? \nERIC No, it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine... \nSETH Well, take care, Eric. \nSeth exits. \nERIC Well, I'll be seeing you around. \n(CONTINUED) 4   CONTINUED:                                                        4 \nERIC turns and begins to walk out towards the elevator.

But they wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look. \nThe elevator doors open and ERIC gets into the elevator.

SAM ROGERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nSAM ROGERS, a 57 year old executive, is sitting behind his desk looking out the window. WILL EMERSON gently knocks on the door, enters then sits on the couch. \nWILL EMERSON Well, that was fucking hideous. \n(CONTINUED) 6   CONTINUED:                                                    6 \nSAM ROGERS It's gonna get worse before it gets better. \nWILL EMERSON Really? \nSAM ROGERS Much. \nWILL EMERSON Got any nicorettes? I'm out of nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill someone in about 10 minutes... You alright? \nSAM ROGERS My dog is dying. \nWILL EMERSON I'm sorry? \nSAM ROGERS Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive. \nWILL EMERSON Really? \nSAM ROGERS Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to do about it. \nThey both sit in silence and look out the window. \nWILL EMERSON Well they're all gone. \nSAM ROGERS How many do we have left? \nWILL EMERSON Thirty-three. \nSAM ROGERS Make sure everyone is out there, I need to say something. \nWILL EMERSON They are ready for you. \nWILL leaves SAM in his office. SAM looks as if he may not move, then snaps out of it. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR \nSAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people. Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then builds. \nSAM ROGERS You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work. \nHe looks out at them then turns and heads back into his office and closes the door. \nINT.

I wouldn't have called... \nSAM ROGERS What's the problem? \nWILL EMERSON I think you need to get down here. \nSAM ROGERS What? \nWILL EMERSON Sam... \nSAM ROGERS It's 11:00 o'clock. \nWILL EMERSON I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam. But you need to see this. \nSAM ROGERS See what? \nWILL EMERSON Well... \nSAM ROGERS Email it to me. \nWILL EMERSON I don't think that is a good idea. \nWILL'S last words hang in the air. \nSAM ROGERS I'm on my way. \nINT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR \nSETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be listening. \nSETH You want one? \nPETER No. \nPETER gives him a bit of a look. \nSETH What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about... (almost to himself) ... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something. \nPETER I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point. \nSETH I guess that's true. \nPETER looks out the window at all the people on the street enjoying the Thursday night. \nPETER Look at these people. \nSETH What? \nPETER We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming. \nSETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to project much in the way of stress. \nPETER (cont'd) Right? \nSETH I try not to let work get to me. \n(CONTINUED) 22   CONTINUED:                                                     22 \nPETER I've noticed that about you actually. \nSETH Look, we are twenty three years old... \n", "test2_true": "SETH Whatever, same thing, I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven. And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins. \nPETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH: \nPETER You do know it's a little more complicated than that? \nSETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the text. \nSETH It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him? What do I tell him. \nPETER Tell him that we haven't found him. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR \nSAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading floor.

They wait for who goes first. \nSAM ROGERS So? \nWILL EMERSON Eric Dale... \nSAM ROGERS Oh Jesus... \nWILL EMERSON Before he was escorted out of the building by security... \nSAM ROGERS I had nothing to do with that. \nWILL EMERSON I know. \nSAM ROGERS I'm sorry, go on. \nWILL EMERSON So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan... \nSAM ROGERS Who's Peter Sullivan again? \nWILL EMERSON One of Eric's guys. \nSAM ROGERS Right. \nWILL EMERSON ...and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. So he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'... \nSAM ROGERS Be careful? \n(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED: (2)                                                24 \nWILL EMERSON Yeah. \nSAM ROGERS Be careful? \nWILL EMERSON Yes. \nSAM ROGERS Why? \nWILL EMERSON Well... take a look. \nSAM ROGERS Speak, you know I can't read those fucking things they put together. \nWILL EMERSON Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it. \nSAM ROGERS Nailed it? \nWILL EMERSON The kid figured out what Eric was missing.

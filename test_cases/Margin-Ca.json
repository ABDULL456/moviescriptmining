Who was it? \nWILL EMERSON Eric... \nERIC Was it Rogers? \nWILL EMERSON You know me. I'm not gonna say... \nERIC Robertson? \nWILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence. \nERIC (cont'd) That cunt. I knew it. I never should have gone to her last year. \nWILL EMERSON Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad luck. Right....? \nERIC Yeah. \nWILL EMERSON Good luck. \nThey look at each other with respect but do not shake hands as WILL EMERSON starts to leave the office. \n(CONTINUED) 3   CONTINUED: (2)                                                3 \nERIC Will? \nWILL EMERSON Yeah. \nERIC You know I was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at. \nWILL EMERSON Eric, they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind. While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. Alright? Good luck. \nERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs up the last of his things, which does not take long, then stands and gets ready to walk out. He looks around and heads out into the cubicle area. \nINT. OUTSIDE ERIC DALE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nOutside his office PETER and SETH are standing to say goodbye. \nPETER Eric, I am very sorry. \nSETH Yeah. Did they say what was going to happen with us? \nPETER Jesus Seth. \nSETH What? \nERIC No, it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine... \nSETH Well, take care, Eric. \nSeth exits. \nERIC Well, I'll be seeing you around. \n(CONTINUED) 4   CONTINUED:                                                        4 \nERIC turns and begins to walk out towards the elevator. PETER walks out behind him. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK \nSAM falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated daze. His eyes no longer believe what he says. \nEXT. INVESTMENT BANK BUILDING PLAZA/STREET LEVEL - EVENING \nERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes. There are other people streaming out the door doing the same thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman, SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into the building. He can't help himself. \n(CONTINUED) 9    CONTINUED:                                                      9 \nERIC Robertson! \nSARAH does not respond. \nERIC (cont'd) Sarah Robertson! \nThis time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his personal belongings in it. \nERIC (cont'd) You shut off my phone??? \nSARAH ROBERTSON Eric... I didn't do anything. \nThey stare at each other. \nERIC Fuck you. \nThey look at each other for a longer beat, both a little shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the ground and walks away. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR - EVENING \nMost of the remaining traders are packing up and getting ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in his hand trying to decide whether to proceed. \nSETH You ok? \nPETER Yeah. Just a little freaked out. \nSETH You want to get a drink? \nPETER Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here. \nSETH Everyone is going out... come on. \n(CONTINUED) 10   CONTINUED:                                                    10 \nPETER Nah, I'm fine. \nSETH Well, give me a call if you change your mind. \nPETER I will. \nSETH Come on. \nPETER Where are you going? \nSETH The Grand. \nPETER I'll call you when I'm done. \nSETH Be glad, you're still alive. \nPETER I am. \nSETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He has four large screens in front of him and as he begins opening window upon window of mathematical models his face begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers flying by. \nHARD CUT: \nINT. VETERINARIANS OFFICE ANIMAL VISITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nSAM is sitting next to the exam table, his dog is on the table lying down very sedated. They both stare forward. \nINT. THE SOHO GRAND BAR - NIGHT \nIn a locked off shot SETH and WILL are sitting on a couch staring forward. Figures cross frame and occasionally another banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them. They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced. \nINT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - NIGHT \nPETER is still working on the numbers, although his face starts to carry a more serious look. He is now wearing glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them. The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes. \nSETH Hey. \nWILL is a bit drunk but SETH looks at PETER'S face and realizes something is up. \nSETH (cont'd) What's going on? \nPETER Look at this. \nSETH comes around and sits at PETER'S desk. \nPETER (cont'd) Eric gave me this file before he left. \nSETH Eric? \nPETER Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'. \nWILL EMERSON Be careful? \nPETER So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good. \n(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED:                                                      18 \nSETH looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the pages. \nSETH What is he doing here? \nPETER Go to model four, and it makes more sense. \nSETH Oh. \nWILL is now paying closer attention, standing over their shoulder. \nWILL EMERSON What is this? \nPETER This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model. \nWILL EMERSON What are those levels. \nPETER Well it's a fairly complicated... \nWILL EMERSON Simplify. \nPETER The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly. \nWILL EMERSON So what's happening? \nSETH We are starting to test those historic patterns. \nWILL EMERSON When? \nPETER starts scrolling back through the last couple weeks on his screen \n(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED: (2)                                                18 \nPETER Today. \nSETH Tuesday. \nPETER Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday. \nSETH Two Fridays ago. \nWILL EMERSON I get it. \nSETH scrolls the final page on the graph. \nSETH Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction... \nPETER Yeah... \nSETH It's huge. \nWILL EMERSON How huge? \nSETH The losses are greater than the current value of the company...? \nSAM ROGERS And? \nWILL gives him a long pause. \nWILL EMERSON ...it isn't good. \nWILL'S look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind WILL at his desk and look at the computer. \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) As far as I can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits... which I guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily... and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry. \nSAM ROGERS How ugly? \n(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED: (3)                                                24 \nWILL EMERSON Real ugly. \nSAM ROGERS And how close to those limits have we gotten? \nWILL EMERSON Oh we're beyond close... We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now... \nSAM ROGERS For now? \nWILL EMERSON Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it. \nSAM ROGERS What am I looking at? \nWILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole lot of zeroes after it. SAM'S look says it all. \nWILL EMERSON And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us... historically speaking. \nSAM ROGERS Is this right? \nWILL EMERSON I don't know. \nSAM ROGERS Where is Eric? \nWILL EMERSON We shut his phone off. \nSAM ROGERS Of course we did. \nWILL EMERSON And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to his wife. \nSAM ROGERS He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere. \n(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED: (4)                                              24 \nWILL EMERSON Or worse. \nSAM ROGERS Where's the kid who did this? \nWILL EMERSON Out looking for Eric. \nSAM ROGERS Do we think he knows what he's doing? \nWILL EMERSON I don't know. What do I know? \nSAM ROGERS Well get him back here. \nINT. UPSCALE CABARET CLUB ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE- CONTINUOUS 25 \nPETER and SETH are sitting at the bar each with a drink facing camera. There are women dancing in the background and one dancing in front of them, PETER and SETH look up occasionally. \nPETER What now? \nSETH We should probably tell Will he's not here. \nPETER Yeah. \nThey both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks. \nSETH What do you think this girl makes in a night? \nPETER Seth. \nSETH \nPETER That's fucked up. \nSETH Why? \nPETER Does that seem right to you? \n(CONTINUED) 27   CONTINUED: (2)                                              27 \nSETH Right? \nPETER Jesus. \nSETH So what do you think that means Rogers puts away? \nPETER I have no idea. \nThey both just look straight forward, SETH takes a big gulp of the beer. \nPETER (cont'd) This fucking traffic. We should have taken a the subway. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER \nThe doors of the elevator open and PETER and SETH look up as WILL EMERSON and SAM ROGERS are standing in front of them about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag. Will looks at it. They share a glancing smile. WILL and SAM step into the elevator keeping the guys in it. \nWILL EMERSON Gentlemen? \nSAM ROGERS You're coming with us. \nSETH Will. Mr. Rogers. \nWILL EMERSON Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan. \nSETH Sir. \nINT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nSAM ROGERS Guys. \n(CONTINUED) 29   CONTINUED:                                                     29 \nThey all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until: \nPETER Will? \nWILL EMERSON Yes? \nPETER Where are we going? \nSAM ROGERS Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter. \nPETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned. The doors open and they exit. \nINT. HALLWAY BY JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSETH looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn into a small conference room that has no windows. It is claustrophobic. \nINT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThere are four people sitting at the table. They stand. Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands. \nALL PRESENT Slight hellos, etc. \nThey all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43 year old, although carries himself with intense confidence. He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC. Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence. \nSETH COUGHS. \nALL PRESENT look down at him. \nJARED COHEN So Sam, what do you have for us? \n(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED:                                                       31 \nSAM ROGERS Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge. \nJARED COHEN Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then. \nJARED COHEN What time is it? \nRAMESH It's 2:15. \nSAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit. \nJARED COHEN What do you have in exposure right now, tonight? \nSAM ROGERS I don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly. \n(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (4)                                                31 \nRAMESH If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct... \nRAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through the numbers and takes a beat too long. \nPETER 1.215 Trillion. \nRAMESH checks his number. \nRAMESH Yes. \nJARED COHEN Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out? \nJARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to RAMESH. She looks back. \nSARAH ROBERTSON Look    we'd need a little more time to go over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know    what he's doing. And I don't have to tell    you that this is a problem. \nJARED COHEN Thank you for that. What time is it? \nRAMESH \nJARED COHEN Fuck me! \nJared stands up and walks around the small room. The rest of the room goes silent. Finally: \nJARED COHEN (cont'd) Sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books? \nSAM ROGERS What? \nJARED COHEN The 1.2 trillion. \nSAM ROGERS All of it? \n(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (5)                                                  31 \nJARED COHEN Yes. \nSAM ROGERS I don't know, a couple weeks? \nJARED COHEN Weeks? \nSAM ROGERS Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick. \nJARED COHEN I understand. \nSAM ROGERS Do you? \nJARED COHEN How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's? \nSAM ROGERS I don't know, sixty. \nRAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this conversation has been taking place. \nRAMESH Jared I've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off. \nJARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing. \nJARED COHEN Excuse me, I need to make a quick call. \nJARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat. \nJARED COHEN (cont'd) Please... \n(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (6)                                                31 \nINT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM \nSAM ROGERS Jared you can't do what you are thinking about doing. \nJARED COHEN What if we don't have a choice? \nSAM ROGERS What does that mean? Fuck you... you don't have a choice. \nJARED COHEN Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers Sam?? \nSAM ROGERS Yes, but what the hell do I know. \nJARED COHEN comes back over to the table and picks up the packet. \nJARED COHEN Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but to me these numbers don't add up. \nRAMESH If I may I'd like to take some time before we... \nSARAH ROBERTSON Jared we can't answer that yet. \nJARED COHEN Are you fucking kidding me... this is exactly what we've... \nSARAH now cuts him off abruptly. \n(CONTINUED) 33   CONTINUED:                                                       33 \nSARAH ROBERTSON We need a little time before we can give you our conclusion. \nSARAH closes the issue off with another look to JARED. \nJARED COHEN OK. We meet in 45 minutes. \nRAMESH Sam, do you have this file? \nSAM ROGERS Yes, here it is. \nSAM slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take a second to follow it. \nJARED COHEN And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand. \nSARAH and RAMESH leave the room as SAM is left alone with JARED. \nSAM ROGERS What are you going to do? \nJARED COHEN Not sure. \nSAM ROGERS Are you going to call him? \nThey both look at each other for a long beat. Finally. \nJARED COHEN I already did. \nSAM puts his hand on JARED'S shoulder briefly. They part. \n34   OMITTED                                                           34 \nOMITTED \nEXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS \nThey walk over towards the edge. It is a very clear night. \nSETH Jesus. \n(CONTINUED) 36   CONTINUED:                                                     36 \nPETER Wow. \nWILL EMERSON Yeah. \nSETH Shit, that's a long way down. \nWILL EMERSON Yeah, it is. \nThey sit down on a girder, then light up. WILL'S look and tone becomes a little darker as they all stare out into the night. Long Pause. \nSETH Two and a half million goes quickly? \nWILL EMERSON Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what?? \nPETER Eight hundred. \nWILL EMERSON I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day... \nSETH Smart. (smiles) \n(CONTINUED) 39   CONTINUED: (3)                                                39 \nWILL EMERSON And what's that? \nPETER 125 left. \nWILL EMERSON takes a long drag off his cigarette. \nWILL EMERSON I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores. \nPETER \nWILL EMERSON Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment. \nWith that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their heads. \nTHEY are now YELLING above the rotor noise. \nPETER                             SETH Whoa!                               Whoa! \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) What time is it? \nSETH \nWILL EMERSON Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there. \nINT. JARED COHEN'S CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nJARED and SAM are sitting in the office silently looking out the window. The office is very large and has a full sitting area with two couches. JARED is intensely going over the papers in front of him. SAM is just looking out the window. \nSAM ROGERS How old are you? \nJARED COHEN \n(CONTINUED) 40   CONTINUED:                                                       40 \nSAM ROGERS Jesus... \nJARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares out the window as well. \nJARED COHEN This is a very... very bad dream. \nSAM looks over at him directly. \nSAM ROGERS I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up. \nSARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door. SAM sits up. \nSARAH ROBERTSON Hello. \nJARED COHEN Come in. \nSAM ROGERS How do we look? \nHer look says it all. \nSAM ROGERS (cont'd) I should go. \nSARAH ROBERTSON No, you should stay. \nJARED COHEN So? \nSARAH ROBERTSON (dead calm delivery) It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless. \nThey all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost. \nHe continues on. \nINT. ELEVATOR BANK OUTSIDE JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe guys are taken aback because standing right outside the opening elevator door is a very well dressed page and a female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for the day ahead. \nASSISTANT Mr. Cohen? \nJARED COHEN Yes. \nASSISTANT This way. They are already in there waiting for you. \nJARED COHEN OK. \nINT. CEO'S EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThey come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with people along one side of the table. There are a team of five lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of the table is empty. \nThey all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence... waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head. He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up. \nJOHN TULD Please sit down. \nHe then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL, PETER, and finally SETH. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) Welcome everyone. I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what I've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 JOHN TULD (cont'd) but that is spilt milk under the bridge. So why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here? \nEveryone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks up. \nJARED COHEN Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout... \nHe cuts him off. \nJOHN TULD Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English? ... Actually I'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? Does he speak English? \nJARED COHEN Sir? \nJOHN TULD I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess. \nJARED COHEN Well, that's Peter Sullivan here. \nJARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look. \nPETER Sir. \nJOHN TULD Ah, there he is. \nPETER Yes sir. \nJOHN TULD How old are you Mr. Sullivan? \nPETER I'm twenty-seven sir. \nJOHN TULD Please call me John. \nPETER Yes sir. \n(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (2)                                                45 \nJOHN TULD So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that. \nPETER is very nervous. \nPETER Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS \nJOHN TULD Now you lost me at M... \nPETER Sorry... \nJOHN TULD I was joking Mr. Sullivan. \nPETER Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed. \nJOHN TULD I have. \nPETER Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint. \nThe room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the window. \nJARED COHEN Sell it all today... \nJOHN TULD smiles just a bit. Then turns. \nJOHN TULD Is that even possible Sam? \n(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (6)                                                 45 \nSAM looks across the room at JOHN TULD, they have known each other for 35 years. \nSAM ROGERS It is, but at what cost? \nJOHN TULD I'll pay. \nSAM ROGERS Really? \nJOHN and SAM look and read each other. \nJOHN TULD I think so. \nSAM ROGERS Almost a trillion bucks of paper? \nJOHN TULD Where does it come back to us? \nSAM ROGERS Everywhere. \nJOHN TULD Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if I made you... how would you do it? \nSAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat. \nSAM ROGERS You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down. \nJOHN TULD Ramesh? \nHe looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table. \n(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (7)                                                45 \nRAMESH They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you. \nSAM ROGERS John... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to? \nJOHN TULD The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it. \nThey look at each other to see if they understand each other. \nSAM ROGERS If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over. \nJOHN TULD (Nods.) \nSAM ROGERS And you are selling something you know has no value. \nJOHN TULD (cuts him off cold) We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that WE may survive, Sam. \nSAM ROGERS You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again. \nJOHN TULD I understand. \nSAM ROGERS Do you? \nJOHN TULD Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it! \nThe rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them go at it. Silence. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) It's 4:00...

He then calms. \nJOHN TULD If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking \nJOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM. \nSAM ROGERS Look, I obviously don't have all the information that you do.

CEO'S GREETING LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS \nSam heads into the hallway where everyone is mingling. He walks over to WILL, PETER, and SETH. \nWILL EMERSON How'd that go? \nSAM ROGERS This is a fucking shit show. \nWILL EMERSON They are going to do it? \nSAM ROGERS Probably. \nWILL EMERSON Jesus. \nSAM ROGERS Remember this day boys, remember this day. \nSAM walks out of the room. An assistant comes into the room. \nASSISTANT Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry. \nWILL looks at the guys. \nWILL EMERSON Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast. And let's face it, it's you. \nINT. CEO'S TOP FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK - CONTINUOUS \nJARED is waiting for the elevator again as SARAH walks up and waits with him in silence.

ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nSARAH ROBERTSON So what's the strategy here? \nJARED COHEN That's where I'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys. \nSARAH ROBERTSON No, you and I... with Tuld. \nJARED COHEN I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I've ever done this. \nSARAH ROBERTSON (with distinct sarcasm) Please. \nJARED COHEN He knows where we both have stood on this all along. There's nothing more to do. \nThis pushes a button with her. \nSARAH ROBERTSON That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him, I don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort. \nJARED COHEN I'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don't think there is one to be found. \nThe elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off. Sarah walks after her, but turns to Tuld first. \nSARAH ROBERTSON So again, what's the strategy here? \nSAM ROGERS Where's he live? \nWILL EMERSON The heights. \nSAM ROGERS looks at his watch. \n(CONTINUED) 50   CONTINUED: (2)                                               50 \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) Should we call Tuld's guy? \nSAM ROGERS No... it's Eric... the last thing we need is those guys going over there, you two go try to get him. \nSAM points to WILL and SETH. \nSAM ROGERS (cont'd) But you've got to be back here by 6:00. \nWILL EMERSON OK. \nINT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE \nSARAH is sitting behind her desk looking down at something. JOHN TULD comes to the door and knocks lightly. She looks up surprised to see him. \nJOHN TULD May I come in? \nSARAH ROBERTSON Please, sit. \nJOHN TULD closes the door and sits in front of her desk. Looks around, then looks right at her. \nJOHN TULD So... we are going to do this thing. \nSARAH ROBERTSON OK. \nJOHN TULD It's going to be tight. \nSARAH ROBERTSON Is Sam on board? \nJOHN TULD Not yet. \nTULD pauses. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) Sarah, I need a head to feed to these traders... and the board... this morning. \nSARAH looks up. \n(CONTINUED) 51   CONTINUED:                                                       51 \nSARAH ROBERTSON Is it me or Cohen? \nJOHN TULD It's you. \nThey stare at each other, she does not flinch. \nSARAH ROBERTSON Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this? \nJOHN TULD I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here... \nSARAH ROBERTSON (Nods) \nJOHN TULD Obviously it's quite complicated. \nSARAH ROBERTSON John I was told that in no uncertain terms... \nJOHN TULD It was all a very grey area. \nSARAH ROBERTSON It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen. \nJOHN TULD I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this... \nTULD pauses, they look at each other. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) We all fucked this one up pretty good... \nSARAH ROBERTSON Yes. \nJOHN TULD We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close. \nSAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror. The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to SAM. \nJOHN TULD There he is. \nSAM ROGERS John. \nSAM walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and face. Finally he looks up. \nSAM ROGERS (cont'd) So what's it look like John? \nThe line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD'S liking. \nJOHN TULD Cohen has done a nice job. It can work. \nSAM ROGERS What does that mean? \nJOHN TULD It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle. \nThey look directly at each other. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) Here. \nJOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper. SAM opens it and looks at it. \nSAM ROGERS That's very generous. \n(CONTINUED) 55   CONTINUED:                                                       55 \nJOHN TULD It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this. \nSAM ROGERS I'm with the firm John. \nJOHN TULD is now taking a far more forceful stance, almost blocking the doorway. \nJOHN TULD I won't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you... unless they believe in you completely. \nHe stares at SAM. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) Are you in? \nSAM ROGERS I told you I have my reservations. \nJOHN TULD Well you can't have any reservations. \nThey both stare at each other. \nJOHN TULD (cont'd) And I need to know now. \nSAM looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his hand, then long and hard at JOHN TULD. \nSAM ROGERS I'm with the firm completely John, as I always have been. Excuse me. \nSAM slightly moves JOHN out of the way and then he exits, the door closes. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING \nThere is a haunting blue light bouncing through the buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders around the almost completely empty city and the further he walks the less his face changes. \nEXT. CITY STREET - STREET CART - MORNING \nPETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart. He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The wind blows. \n(CONTINUED) 57   CONTINUED:                                                     57 \nCOFFEE GUY One fifty. \nPETER Thank you. \nPETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other squarely. \nLUCY Hey... \nPETER Hi. It's really good to see you. \nShe has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking. \nHe gets in his car and drives away. \nINT. WILL EMERSON'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY \nWILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan which spans up and out in front of them through the windshield. There is a long silence, and finally. \nSETH So, am I getting fired? \nWILL EMERSON I don't know. \nVery long pause, then he looks over at SETH and decides whether to tell the truth. \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) Probably...yes...almost definitely. \nSETH Are you? \nWILL EMERSON No. \nThis clearly hits SETH but he recovers quickly. \nSETH Oh. \nWILL EMERSON It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better. \n(CONTINUED) 61   CONTINUED:                                                       61 \nSETH I get it. \nSETH looks over at WILL and around at the interior of the luxury car and then back into the city. \nSETH (CONT'D) (cont'd) When did you know this is what you wanted to do? \nHe thinks that through. \nWILL EMERSON The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day. \nSETH Fuck me. \nWILL EMERSON It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming from three days away. I took my time. I was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it was beautiful. \nSETH How did you learn to do that? \nWILL EMERSON I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow. \nWILL looks out again at the city then to SETH. \nWILL EMERSON (CONT'D) (cont'd) Look man I'm sorry about this. \nSETH Don't be, you're not doing it to me. \nWILL EMERSON I know...but I'm still sorry. At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with. \nSETH Only if we can get this done, right? \nWILL EMERSON We'll get it done. \nSETH How? \n(CONTINUED) 61   CONTINUED: (2)                                                61 \nWILL EMERSON I'm trying to figure that out right now. \nSETH There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now. \nWILL EMERSON I'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I'll make them willing. \nThis line sits there for a minute and WILL looks out onto the city. \nSETH Are you ok with that? \nWILL EMERSON I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is. \nSETH I guess. And what about everyone else? \nWILL EMERSON Everyone else? \nPETER I don't really want to go back in there just yet. \nSAM ROGERS I understand that. \nLong beat. \nPETER I think I know your son. \nSAM ROGERS Really? \nPETER Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person. \nSAM ROGERS He is a nice person. \nA taxi honks and flies by. \nSAM ROGERS (cont'd) I guess you could say alot worse about a guy. \nPETER Have you told him what's about to happen? \nThey look at each other to check the nature of the question. \nSAM ROGERS What do you mean? \nPETER This whole thing. \nSAM ROGERS No... I hadn't even thought of it. \nPETER I guess it's illegal anyway? \n(CONTINUED) 62   CONTINUED: (3)                                              62 \nSAM ROGERS Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught. \nPETER He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help. \nSAM ROGERS laughs quietly. \nSAM ROGERS That's very true. \nPETER He works with a friend of mine. \nSAM ROGERS He's a hell of alot richer than me, I know that much. \nPETER But you are taller. \nLaughs again. \nSAM ROGERS That's true. It's not much... but it's something... What did your father do? \nPETER He's a doctor. \nSAM ROGERS Really? \nPETER Eyes. \nSAM ROGERS Now that's something. \nPETER Yeah... it is. \nSAM ROGERS Did he want you to do that? \nPETER No, never. \nSAM ROGERS Oh. \n(CONTINUED) 62   CONTINUED: (4)                                               62 \nPETER He was always a pretty miserable guy actually... \nAnother helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building. Peter looks up. \nPETER (cont'd) They're all coming in now. \nSAM ROGERS Yes they are. \nJARED COHEN I'm sorry... \nSETH This is all I've ever wanted to do. \nJARED COHEN Really? \nSETH Yes... \nThis hits JARED just a touch. \nJARED COHEN I am sorry. \nJARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the eye. Then walks out. \nINT. EXECUTIVE QUARANTINE ROOM - DAY \nSARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of fruit and cheese and pastries. She is not eating. She sits and stares. Eventually the door behind her opens, and a SECURITY GUY walks in with ERIC. \nSECURITY GUY They are almost ready for you Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes. \nSECURITY GUY leaves the room. ERIC looks over at SARAH then sits in the chair near her. Silence. \n(CONTINUED) 66   CONTINUED:                                                    66 \nERIC You as well? \nSARAH ROBERTSON Yes. \nERIC Jesus. \nSARAH ROBERTSON Yeah. \nERIC I'm sorry. \nSARAH ROBERTSON Thank you... Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well. \nERIC Really... and Cohen? \nSARAH ROBERTSON No... still here. \nERIC Of course... \nLong awkward pause. Eric looks around for something, anything to talk about. \nERIC (cont'd) Are you still dating that tall guy... from the Christmas thing? \nShe looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit for trying to break the ice. \nSARAH ROBERTSON No. \nERIC He was very tall. \nSARAH ROBERTSON \nERIC (quietly) Wow. \nSilence. \n(CONTINUED) 66   CONTINUED: (2)                                                66 \nSARAH ROBERTSON I did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know. \nERIC It doesn't matter. \nSARAH ROBERTSON It does. \nThe door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is overwhelming. \nSARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd) Thank you. \nThe caterer leaves. ERIC looks around. \nERIC Have they taken all the phones out of this room? \nSARAH nods yes. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR- 8:20 AM \nThere is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a general. \nJOHN TULD By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one... \nJOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then heads into his office. \nINT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nHe shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs begin to move. We just see the back of his head. \nINT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY \nSeveral actual individual trading sequences throughout the day. \nINT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - 4:02 PM \nThe market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers. There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway. \nJARED COHEN Well done. \nSAM ROGERS They did alright. \nJARED COHEN I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here. \nSAM ROGERS Now? \nJARED COHEN (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends. \nSAM ROGERS Of course. \nJARED COHEN For what it's worth, you're good... Guess somebody upstairs must really like you. \nSAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY \nHe heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator. \nINT. SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM    - MOMENTS LATER \nThe room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but waves him down. SAM approaches. \nJOHN TULD Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order. \nSAM ROGERS Our guys did what they could. \n(CONTINUED) 73   CONTINUED:                                                       73 \nJOHN TULD You did a hell of a job today, and I thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. Can I get you anything? \nSAM ROGERS No, no thanks. \nThey just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few more bites of his meal. \nTULD So what can I do for you? \nSAM ROGERS I want out. \nTULD I'm sorry? \nSAM ROGERS I'm done, I want out. \nTULD It's been a very difficult day, for everyone. \nSAM ROGERS I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out. \nTULD You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K? \nThey look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up. \nTULD (cont'd) For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. I'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing.

LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY \nThe frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27- year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens. \nAn elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his early twenties. \nSETH Is that them? \nPETER (nods yes) \nSETH Jesus Christ. \nThe HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as almost every person on the floor watches. \nSETH (cont'd) Are they going to do it right there? \nPETER Yeah. \nSETH Fuck me. \nWILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair. \nWILL EMERSON (whispered) Have you guys ever seen this before? \nSETH No. \nWILL EMERSON Best to just ignore it.

It is brutal. The camera follows one HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS then stops a bit down from them. \nHEATHER Timothy Singh? \nTIMOTHY Yes. \nHEATHER I'm afraid we have to speak with you. \nTIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen. \nThe sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked. \nHEATHER (cont'd) Eric Dale? \nPETER Excuse me? \nHEATHER Eric Dale? \nPETER No. \nHEATHER Sorry? \nPETER I'm not Eric Dale. \nHEATHER Oh.

I wouldn't have called... \nSAM ROGERS What's the problem? \nWILL EMERSON I think you need to get down here. \nSAM ROGERS What? \nWILL EMERSON Sam... \nSAM ROGERS It's 11:00 o'clock. \nWILL EMERSON I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam. But you need to see this. \nSAM ROGERS See what? \nWILL EMERSON Well... \nSAM ROGERS Email it to me. \nWILL EMERSON I don't think that is a good idea. \nWILL'S last words hang in the air. \nSAM ROGERS I'm on my way. \nINT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR \nSETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be listening. \nSETH You want one? \nPETER No. \nPETER gives him a bit of a look. \nSETH What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about... (almost to himself) ... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something. \nPETER I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point. \nSETH I guess that's true. \nPETER looks out the window at all the people on the street enjoying the Thursday night. \nPETER Look at these people. \nSETH What? \nPETER We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming. \nSETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to project much in the way of stress. \nPETER (cont'd) Right? \nSETH I try not to let work get to me. \n(CONTINUED) 22   CONTINUED:                                                     22 \nPETER I've noticed that about you actually. \nSETH Look, we are twenty three years old... \n", "test2_true": "SETH Whatever, same thing, I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven. And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins. \nPETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH: \nPETER You do know it's a little more complicated than that? \nSETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the text. \nSETH It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him? What do I tell him. \nPETER Tell him that we haven't found him. \nINT. TRADING FLOOR \nSAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading floor. He looks around, then heads over to WILL EMERSON'S office where the light is on. \nINT. WILL EMERSON'S OFFICE-CONTINUOUS \nSAM lightly knocks on the glass. \nSAM ROGERS Hey. \n(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED:                                                    24 \nWILL EMERSON Hey. \nSAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on, then eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair. They wait for who goes first. \nSAM ROGERS So? \nWILL EMERSON Eric Dale... \nSAM ROGERS Oh Jesus... \nWILL EMERSON Before he was escorted out of the building by security... \nSAM ROGERS I had nothing to do with that. \nWILL EMERSON I know. \nSAM ROGERS I'm sorry, go on. \nWILL EMERSON So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan... \nSAM ROGERS Who's Peter Sullivan again? \nWILL EMERSON One of Eric's guys. \nSAM ROGERS Right. \nWILL EMERSON ...and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. So he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'... \nSAM ROGERS Be careful? \n(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED: (2)                                                24 \nWILL EMERSON Yeah. \nSAM ROGERS Be careful? \nWILL EMERSON Yes. \nSAM ROGERS Why? \nWILL EMERSON Well... take a look. \nSAM ROGERS Speak, you know I can't read those fucking things they put together. \nWILL EMERSON Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it. \nSAM ROGERS Nailed it? \nWILL EMERSON The kid figured out what Eric was missing. And... \n", "test3_input": "WILL EMERSON Peter finished that model you were working on. \nERIC Really? \nWILL EMERSON It's created a bit of a shit storm. \nERIC Yeah, I bet. \nWILL EMERSON Do you want to see it... the model? \n(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED:                                                       60 \nERIC No. \nWILL EMERSON Really? \nERIC No. But I'm pretty sure what it says. \nWILL EMERSON Do you think he's right? \nERIC I'm sure he's right. \nThey both sit down on the stoop. \nWILL EMERSON Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight. John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position. \nERIC looks over at Will \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) Today. \nERIC'S face doesn't show much emotion. But he is surprised and sincere. \nERIC Well, I am very sorry to hear that. \nWILL EMERSON They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here. \nERIC (with pleasant disgust) Please. \nWILL EMERSON I'm just saying. \nERIC (cuts him off cold) Not a chance. \nWILL lets it sit for a few beats. \nWILL EMERSON This is serious shit Eric. \n(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED: (2)                                                60 \nERIC You don't think I know that. I've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March. \nWILL EMERSON Well... \nERIC Fuck her... Fuck her. \nWILL EMERSON Look... \nERIC I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've got nothing on me anymore. \nWILL EMERSON They'll pay... \nERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that they mean real money. \nERIC I've already been paid enough by them. \nERIC looks back out onto the empty street. \nERIC (cont'd) Did you know I built a bridge once? \nWILL EMERSON I'm sorry? \nERIC A bridge. \nWILL EMERSON No, I didn't. \nERIC I was an engineer by trade. \n", "test3_true": "ERIC It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river. Steel through arch design. 12,100 people a day use the thing. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED: (3)                                                60 ERIC (cont'd) It cut out 35 miles each way of extra driving to get from Wheeling to New Martinsville. That's a combined 847,000 miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000 miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a year saved. \nNow ERIC'S mind is racing and he is adding up numbers as he goes. \nERIC (cont'd) I completed that project in 1986... 22 years ago. Over the life of that one bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million... 240 thousand miles that haven't had to be driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020 days... so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 1531 years of their lives not wasted in the car... give or take. \nWILL EMERSON Jesus. \nERIC One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one years... \nWILL EMERSON Fuck... \nThey sit and let it sink in. \nERIC That's what I did. (beat) Look... you better get back over there. \nWILL EMERSON Yeah. \nERIC Crazy shit. \nWILL EMERSON True. Dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day. Fucked up. Well... alright. \nERIC Thanks for stopping by. \n(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED: (4)                                               60 \nWILL EMERSON No problem. \nWILL looks out down the street as a black towncar comes pulling up to the house. \nERIC Who the fuck is this? \nWILL EMERSON I'd guess it's the firm's people. \nERIC What? \nWILL EMERSON Tuld doesn't want any loose ends. \nERIC They fired me Will. Fuck em... Fuck em. \nWILL EMERSON Just come back with them, take the bonus, and you're home tonight by five. Either that or they are going to fight you on everything, the package, the options... \nERIC drops his head. \nWILL walks down the stairs as the town car stops in front of Eric's house. The windows are tinted, but they know who it is. WILL walks around to his car. \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) You're a better man than I. \nERIC Well that's always been true. \nWILL EMERSON Yes it has. \nERIC See ya. \nWILL is about to climb in his car. \nWILL EMERSON The house looks great by the way. \nERIC Thanks. \n(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED: (5)                                                   60 \nWILL EMERSON And Eric...don't beat yourself up too bad over this shit. \nERIC Yeah. \nWILL EMERSON Who the fuck knows. \nERIC nods. \nWILL EMERSON (cont'd) Some people like driving the long way home. \n"}

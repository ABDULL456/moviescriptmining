Karl hovers over McClane, who hasn't moved a muscle. 
KARL (quietly) We're both professionals.  But this is personal.  You...are done. 
WHAM!  McClane DRIVES his elbow into Karl's face.

Karl's weapon clatters on the floor.  McClane follows his first blow with another.  Karl recovers, and with a spinning karate kick SLAMS McClane back.

321     HOSTAGE FLOOR - NIGHT                                 321 
Eddie turns from a window, where the chopper lights loom closer. 
EDDIE They're coming. 
CAMERA PANS across the room to the doorway of the office, where Hans nods, stands. 
THORNBURG'S VOICE FROM TV -- I know you're proud of your daddy... 
322     CLOSEUP - HOLLY                                       322 
She's speechless, watching in shock as: 
323     THE PORTABLE TV                                       323 
shows Thornburg at Holly's house!  He's squatting down with his microphone to interview the children in their P.J.s.  His voice is soft, comforting. 
THORNBURG (to the children) ...because he's a very brave policeman. And your mom has shown just as much courage.  But is there something you would like to say to them if they're watching? 
John Jr. says nothing, but Lucy looks at the camera. 
LUCY Come home. 
324     HOLLY                                                 324 
She struggles to stay composed...can't.  She slowly turns her head, looks at Hans. 
325     HER P.O.V. - HANS                                     325 
He's looking away from us, at the picture of the children on her desk.  He turns back and looks at her.  He smiles. 
HANS Mrs. McClane.  How nice to make your acquaintance. 
He raises his weapon...but he only shoot it into the ceiling, making everyone jump! 
HANS (shouting) On your feet, everyone!  Upstairs, now! (quietly, to Uli) You'll lock them up there and come right down... 
Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs. Hans moves forward...grabs Holly himself.

326     THE MACHINE FLOOR                                     326 
McClane and Karl move towards each other, each sizing the other up, each looking over the terrain. 
MCCLANE Better this way, isn't it?  I mean, any faggot can shoot a gun. 
This time Karl doesn't take the bait.  Then, when he does charge, it's unexpected. 
The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street. 
327     NEW ANGLE                                             327 
MCCLANE You should've heard your brother scream when I broke his fucking neck... 
Karl steps in quickly with a deadly move.  McClane twists free, slams an elbow into Karl's kidney.  Karl backs off, circles McClane with new respect.

328     INSIDE AN FBI CHOPPER - IN FLIGHT                     328 
THROUGH THE CANOPY we SEE another flanking chopper.  Johnson and Johnson are here, helmets and mikes on.  Big Johnson checks aerial maps while Little Johnson checks ammo clips for his sniper scoped assault rifle. 
BIG JOHNSON (shouting, to the pilot) Stay low.  They're expecting transports, not gunships. 
LITTLE JOHNSON (shouting over the noise of the rotors) What do you figure on breakage? 
BIG JOHNSON I figure we take out all the terrorists, and lose 20 percent of the hostages... 25, tops. 
LITTLE JOHNSON I can live with those numbers.

Theo and Kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried all their gear when they entered.  As Hans and Eddie come in they look curiously at Holly.

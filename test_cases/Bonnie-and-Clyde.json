{"test1_input": "BONNIE Clyde... \nShe starts to panic and runs to the window. \nBONNIE (continuing) Clyde... \nAt another window CLYDE appears. \nCLYDE Hey, lady. \nBONNIE (chagrined at her fear) Where you been keeping yourself? \nCLYDE Slept out by the car. \nBONNIE Oh...These accommodations ain't particularly deluxe. \nCLYDE No...If they're after us, I want the first shot.  Come on, you got some work to do. \nBONNIE moves to the door and out of the house. \nEXT. FARM HOUSE.  FRONT YARD.  DAY. \nOn the door is a sign which reads: \nINSERT: \nPROPERTY OF MIDLOTHIAN CITIZENS BANK -- TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED. \nWide angle.  Across fence.  Day.  On the dilapidated picket fence six old bottles have been placed.  As BONNIE joins CLYDE he turns and fires six quick shots.  The bottles disappear. \nBONNIE You're good. \nCLYDE The best. \nBONNIE And modest... \nCLYDE Come on.  Got you all set up over here. \nWider angle.  They move around to the side of the building where CLYDE points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree. He means that to be BONNIE's target.  He hands her a gun. \nCLYDE Set her spinnin'. \nBONNIE fires.  She misses. \nCLYDE Again.  Come down slow with it... \nBONNIE fires again and hits the tire.  She smiles and blows the smoke from the barrel in pride and self-mockery. \nCLYDE Ain't you something?  I tell you I'm going to get you a Smith and Wesson, it'll be easier in your hand.  Now try it again once... \nBONNIE sights.  As she is about to fire, a man appears around the corner of the building.  A FARMER.  She fires and hits the tire. \nFARMER Heighdo. \nCLYDE whirls at the sound.  He grabs gun from BONNIE because his is empty.  He aims at FARMER. \nFARMER (frightened) No sir...no sir.  You all go right ahead. \nCLYDE watches him warily. \nFARMER (continuing) Used to be my place.  Not any more. Bank took it. \nCLYDE and BONNIE start to move toward the farmer.  All three move around to the front of the building.  At a distance we see an Okie car loaded with belongings.  A WOMAN with a BABY in arms sits in front.  A smaller BOY stands outside the car. \nFARMER Yessir, moved us off.  Now it belongs to them. (He points at the foreclosure sign.) \nBONNIE Well, that's a pitiful shame. \nCLYDE shakes his head sympathetically.  He loads the empty gun. \nFARMER (bitterly) You're damned right, ma'm. \nHe looks up to see an OLD NEGRO who has come from a distance shack and now stands near CLYDE's car. \nFARMER (nodding toward Negro) Me and him put in the years here. Yessir.  So you all go right ahead. We just come by for a last look. \n", "test1_true": "FARMER You all mind? \nBONNIE and CLYDE are puzzled. \nFARMER Hey, Davis!  Come on over here. \nThe NEGRO moves toward them.  Now BONNIE understands.  She takes the second gun from CLYDE and hands it to DAVIS. DAVIS looks from BONNIE to the FARMER and toward the house. The FARMER fires again.  This time at a window.  He nods to DAVIS.  DAVIS slowly raises the gun and fires at another window.  It shatters and they can't keep from laughing.  The FARMER returns the gun as does DAVIS. \nFARMER (continuing) Much obliged. \nHe extends his hand.  CLYDE shakes it. \nFARMER Otis Harrison.  And this here's Davis.  We worked this place. \nCLYDE (formally) Miss Bonnie Parker.  And I'm Clyde Barrow. \nAcross farmer's car.  Wide shot.  Day.  The FARMER turns and moves toward his people.  DAVIS moves toward his shack. CLYDE and BONNIE in the b.g. \nClose angle.  BONNIE and CLYDE. \nCLYDE (continuing) We rob banks. \nBONNIE turns quickly to look at CLYDE.  He smiles and nods. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN. \nEXT. A LONG, COUNTRY ROAD.  DAY. \nA car is driving down it.  It is the next day.  BONNIE is driving, CLYDE beside her. \nINT. CAR.  DAY. \nCLYDE You just stay in the car and watch and be ready. (he is playing it cool, knowing she is scared.  He thinks he's James Cagney) Okay now? (he hands her a gun from the glove compartment) You just be ready if I need you. \nBONNIE's hands are tense on the wheel.  Her face shows how nervous she is now that the time has come. \nCLYDE Scared? \nBONNIE No. \nThey drive in silence. \nCLYDE What are you thinkin' about? \nBONNIE Nothin'. \nEXT. BUSINESS STREET OF A LITTLE TOWN.  DAY. \nWe are still in the car.  BONNIE pulls over and stops by the bank.  CLYDE is frozen in his seat.  We can see that, for all his talk, he is scared, too. \nBONNIE What are you waitin' for? \nThat gets him.  CLYDE throws the door open and jumps, practically dives out the door.  The camera follows his motion right inside the bank, tracking very fast. \nINT. BANK #1.  DAY. \nSomething is very screwy here.  The bank is dark, the TELLER is half asleep over his books.  CLYDE approaches, thrusts the gun at him. \nCLYDE (with a swagger) This is a stickup.  Just take it easy and nothin' will happen to you. Gimme the money. \nTELLER (looking up with no fear, his voice calm and conversational) Heighdy. \nCLYDE (nonplussed at this) Gimme the money! \nTELLER What money?  There ain't no money here, mister. \nCLYDE (totally befuddled at the turn of events) What do you mean there ain't no money?  This here is a bank, ain't it? \nThe camera pans around the bank.  We see that it is empty, dusty and shuttered. \nTELLER This was a bank.  We failed three weeks ago. \n", "test1_id": 2391, "test2_input": "WOMAN TELLER Tsk, tsk. \nA photographer steps in. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Just look this way, Mr. Hawkins. \nThe bank guard hurriedly buttons up his collar and smiles as the flashbulb goes off. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GANG CAR. \nStill speeding along, the siren more distant. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK. \nThe bank president and a policeman are posing for that classic picture where both stand flanking a bullet hole in the wall and point proudly at it.  The flashbulb goes off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE CAR. \nTwo men in police uniforms following BONNIE and CLYDE. \nFIRST POLICEMAN Step on it, Randolph.  We gotta catch 'em 'fore they reach the state line! \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK. \nFARMER is describing BONNIE and CLYDE to passersby who dote on him as though he'd just had contact with a portion of the true cross.  FARMER is aware of his position. \nFARMER Clyde?...he looked like, well he looked real...clean...and Bonnie, she's too much a lady ever to be caught with a cigar in her mouth...I don't care what you heard before. I saw 'em right here, not twenty minutes ago... (gravely) --and all's I can say is, they did right by me, and I'm bringin' me a mess of flowers to their funeral. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GANG'S CAR. \nCar slows up perceptibly as CLYDE says: \nCLYDE Okay, relax.  We're in Oklahoma now. Slow down. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE CAR. \nFIRST POLICEMAN Turn around.  Don't waste no more gas. \nSECOND POLICEMAN (a young eager beaver type) Ain't we gone to catch 'em? \nFIRST POLICEMAN Hell, they're over the State line. That's out of our jurisdiction. \nSECOND POLICEMAN Why don't we get 'em anyway? \nFIRST POLICEMAN I ain't gone to risk my life in Oklahoma.  That's their problem. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAR. \nNow the gang's car is seen traveling down a long, narrow country road surrounded by cornfields. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROADSIDE BY WOODS.  DAY. \nThey get out, taking the various bags of money with them, and dump the lot on the hood.  There is not an impressive amount of money. \nCLYDE (disappointed) Hell.  That ain't much, is it? \nBUCK (commiseratingly) Times is hard, \nCLYDE Well, let's get to it. \n", "test2_true": "CLYDE This is Clyde Barrow. (lays down a bill) Buck Barrow... (lays down a bill) Bonnie Parker...C.W. (goes back to the first again and lays out another round) Clyde, Buck...Bonnie...C.W. Clyde, Clyde again...Buck...Bonnie...C.W. \nBUCK and BLANCHE stand watching.  BLANCHE looks fretful. She nudges BUCK and whispers to him. \nBUCK whispers something back to her.  Meanwhile, CLYDE's counting still goes on. \nCLYDE Bonnie...C.S....Clyde... \nBUCK (very ill at east in this position he has been forced into) Um...eh...Clyde? \nCLYDE Hah? \nBUCK is clearly embarrassed. \nBUCK Uh, Clyde...well...what about Blanche? \nEveryone reacts with stunned amazement at BLANCHE's nerve in wanting to get her cut. \nBONNIE (incredulous) WHAT? \nBLANCHE sees she has to rise to her own defense, and she rises to the occasion with spirit and verve. \nBLANCHE Well, why not?  Say I earned my share!  Same as everybody.  I coulda got killed same as everybody, and I'm wanted by the law same as everybody.  Besides I coulda got snake bit sleepin' in them woods every night! (building it up) I'm just a nervous wreck and that's the truth.  And I have to listen to sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time.  I deserve mine! \nClose.  BUCK.  Day--looking at CLYDE, his face full of weak smiles and embarrassment at his wife. \nCLYDE (with a sigh) Okay...okay...hold your horses, Blanche.  You'll get your share. \nBONNIE is livid but says nothing.  CLYDE, the leader has decided.  C.W. looks indignant, like a hog who's just been given a bath.  CLYDE begins counting all over again in near silence. \nBUCK Married a preacher's daughter and she still thinks she's takin' the collection. \nEveryone now laughs, but BLANCHE.  CLYDE continues counting. \nBUCK (to Blanche) Well, don't spend it all in one place now, hear? \nBONNIE She'll be doin' right well to spend it at all. \nBONNIE turns and ambles away from the car.  After a moment CLYDE stops counting and moves after her.  He's prepared for a fight, stands behind BONNIE's arched back trying to gauge the degree of hostility there. \nCLYDE Bonnie? \nNo answer. \nCLYDE (a little defensive) Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I guess I'll keep sayin' it before we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife and Buck is family. \nHe waits expectantly. \nBONNIE (finally, utterly without malice) --she's such a silly-Billy... \nBONNIE looks plaintively to CLYDE. \nBONNIE My family could use some of that money. \nCLYDE Them laws have been hangin' round your mamas house 'til all hours, Bonnie.  It's just too risky to go there. \nBONNIE (exploding) Well, where can we go?  We rob the damn banks, what else do we do? \nCLYDE cannot really answer.  Suddenly C.W. starts yelling: \nC.W. CLYDE!  CLYDE!  CLYDE! \nCLYDE flinches at the sound.  C.W. comes bounding over, as rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be. \nCLYDE (wincing as they are nose to nose) I hear you, C.W. \nC.W. This ol' heap's gushin' oil!  We got to swipe us another set of wheels right away, or we won't get anywhere.  Look here. \nHe reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces. \nC.W. See? \nCLYDE nods slowly.  He looks back to BONNIE.  He sees. \n", "test2_id": 2392, "test3_input": "MALCOLM hauls off and whacks C.W. across the top of his head with the flat of his hand, then momentarily holds his hand over C.W's mouth. \nMALCOLM (we can see his own fear) ...the law.  Just don't get back in that car. (eyeball to eyeball) And whatever you do, don't let onto them, hear? \nC.W. suddenly smiles, as if he knew something. \nC.W. (expletive) Whew!... You think them laws are gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town? \nC.W. returns to the ice cream carton--MALCOLM lets him, figuring he better find out what he can. \nMALCOLM What do you think, Clarence? \nC.W. (matter of fact) They ain't gonna catch 'em.  Don't matter whether I let on or not. \nMALCOLM (playing along) Mebbe.  Just you be off'n the streets of that town when they go to get in their car. \nC.W. (looking directly at Malcolm) Nobody catches Clyde.  Clyde's got a sense, don't you know that, Daddy? Nobody catches Clyde. \nMALCOLM knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his son, fearing that maybe C.W., for all his limitations, has a sense about CLYDE's sense.  C.W. has finished with the carton and crumples it, licking the last remnants of cream off his fingers. \nINT. BEDROOM.  MOSS FARM.  NIGHT. \nBONNIE and CLYDE's bedroom, the middle of that night.  Both are wide awake, lying on opposite sides of the double bed. Both are staring into the night, disquiet. \nCLYDE (suddenly) Bonnie?  Bonnie, will you marry me? \nThere is a silent gasp from BONNIE, a barely perceptible stiffening.  Then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still staring up at the ceiling. \nBONNIE How could I do that, Clyde?  You know it's impossible.  We'd have to go to a Justice of the Peace and the Justice of the Peace is a lawman.  We couldn't even take out a license. \nCLYDE (with a chuckle) Hey now, you sound like you been givin' it some thought on your own. \nBONNIE (with a grim irony, her voice getting more and more emotional) Oh no, I never gave it thought.  I haven't thought about it at least ten times a day, I haven't thought about it every minute of my life since I met you. (suddenly her voice cracks into tears) \nShe flings herself violently across the bed and buries herself into CLYDE's chest, her knees drawn up, her head tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs. \nCLYDE (a bit startled by this, attempting to hold her, awkwardly, and placate her.  He puts his arm around her) Bonnie...are you crying, honey? \nBONNIE nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears. \nBONNIE (her face still buried in CLYDE's chest, she whispers) Clyde, why do you want to marry me? \nCLYDE thinks a minute and then grins. \nCLYDE (in an attempt to be humorous) To make an honest woman out of you. \nBONNIE is silent. \nBONNIE (finally, in a voice charged with anticipation and dream) Clyde...what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us? \nCLYDE thinks about it a minute. \nCLYDE Well...I guess I'd do it all different.  First off, I wouldn't live in the same state where we pull our jobs.  We'd live in one state and stay clean there, and when we wanted to take a bank, we'd go to another state...and... \nSuddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he could have, that it was not the answer BONNIE wanted to hear. He looks down at her, his voice anxious. \nCLYDE (continuing) Bonnie? \nShe is silent. \nCLYDE Hey, Bonnie? \nBut she does not answer. \nEXT. ROADSIDE.  EARLY MORNING. \nWe see MALCOLM jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ARCADIA STREET.  MID-MORNING. \nA street in Arcadia.  The car is parked.  BONNIE and CLYDE walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and supplies and put them inside. \nCLYDE (looking around) What happened to C.W.? \n", "test3_true": "CLYDE opens the door of the driver's seat and sits down. \nINT. CAR.  ARCADIA STREET.  DAY. \nCLYDE Boy, my feet are sweatin'. \nHe takes off his shoes. \nBONNIE (kidding around) You plannin' to drive with your shoes off? \nCLYDE Sure, why not? \nHe reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses. As he goes to put them on, one of the lenses falls out. \nCLYDE Damn! \nHe puts them on. \nBONNIE (laughing) You gonna wear 'em? \nCLYDE Sure, drive with one eye shut. \nBONNIE gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper.  She unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it. It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her hand, worth about thirty cents. \nBONNIE (admiring it) Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon? Just look here, you can see every little fingernail on her hands. \nShe shows him. \nCLYDE It is a pretty thing, honey. \nCLYDE turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music. They are singing \"Little Church in the Valley.\"  He beats time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient. BONNIE puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the grocery sack. \nBONNIE We got any peaches?  I sure could go for a peach right now. \nShe burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach.  She takes a big bite.  The juice drips down the side of her mouth.  She looks beautiful. \nCLYDE (he stops drumming his fingers, suddenly has an idea) Whyn't we do it tomorrow? \nBONNIE Do what? \nCLYDE Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We could drive all night and be on that golf course tomorrow morning! \nBONNIE You sure you feel up to it? \nCLYDE (enthused) Yeah, why not? (now feeling anxious and excited, he is impatient to move) Where is that boy?  He's gone too long. \nBONNIE (humming to the radio) He'll be here. (holding the peach to him) You take a bite, hon. \nCLYDE (getting worried) No, it's takin' too long.  What if something happened? \nBONNIE Nothin' happened. \nCLYDE (more urgently) Go take a look, see what's keepin' him. \nNot too delighted with the chore, BONNIE goes off.  We remain with CLYDE, getting anxious.  The music plays on. BONNIE comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself. \nBONNIE He ain't there. \nCLYDE jumps into action, slams his door. \nCLYDE C'mon, let's go. \nBONNIE gets in.  They drive off. \nINT. STORE.  CLOSE-UP C.W.  DAY. \n--hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained window at them driving away.  His expression is disturbed; his face half in shadow. \nEXT. ROAD.  DAY. \nBONNIE and CLYDE's car coming down the road.  Camera sees from CLYDE's P.O.V.  MALCOLM standing in the road, waving him down.  The pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked beside him on a shoulder of the road. \nINT. CAR.  DAY. \n", "test3_id": 2393}

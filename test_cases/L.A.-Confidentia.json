{"train": "\"L.A. Confidential\", by Brian Helgeland \nL.A. CONFIDENTIAL \nby \nBrian Helgeland \nBased on the novel by James Ellroy \nNovember 16, 1995 Minor Revisions \nFADE IN: \nOVER the opening strains of \"I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA,\" a MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and live action.  Economy Booming!  Postwar Optimism!  L.A.: City of the Future!  But most prominent among them: GANGLAND!  Police photographers document crime scenes. The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where will it end? \nEXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET \nPalm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and forth. \nEXT. MANSION (HANCOCK PARK) - NIGHT \nThe KLEIG LIGHTS are out front.  Valets hurry to park a line of elegant cars. \nMAYOR (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the future of Los Angeles! \nINT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT \nThe MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss- crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM.  The CROWD oohs. A COUNCILMAN claps.  A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval. \nPIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side. A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes authority much more so than the Mayor does. \nMAYOR The Arroyo Seco freeway is just the beginning.  We're planning freeways from Downtown to Santa Monica, from the South Bay to the San Fernando Valley.  Twenty minutes to work or play is the longest you'll have to travel. \nMore applause.  One REPORTER asks a little too loudly... \nREPORTER How many bodies you think Mickey Cohen'll be able to hide in all that cement? \nThe Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it. \nINT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT \nA CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked \"Lindy Hop\" with THREE different GIRLS at once.  A fireplug of a man, he hardly seems a public menace.  Nearby is his bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO.  Over it all: \nHUDGEONS (V.O.) Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to his fans.  He's the big moocher, local L.A. color to the nth degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs dope, rackets and prostitution. He kills a dozen people a year. But who you may not know is bodyguard Johnny Stompanato. \nHis hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time. \nHUDGEONS (V.O.) Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the real attraction is below the belt. Second only to Steve Cochran, he's sometimes known as 'Oscar' because of his Academy Award-size appendage. \nMickey works a sweat on the dance floor.  A bottle of champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol from his shoulder holster.  As he laughs at himself... \nINT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY \nLurid page one headlines cover the wall where SID HUDGEONS types.  The essence of sleaze, Sid is the publisher-photographer-writer of Hush-Hush magazine and keeper of inside dirt supreme.  As he continues... \nHUDGEONS (V.O.) Remember, dear readers, you heard it here first, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush. \nINT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT \nThe party continues.  The Mayor has moved off to the side with the power brokers.  Patchett is a presence. \nMAYOR We're selling an image, gentlemen. Beautiful weather.  Affordable housing. (re:  model) Trouble-free transportation.  And the best police department in the world to keep it all running smoothly. \nEXT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT \nA dozen people watch a display windoe TELEVISION as it rolls the opening of the hit show \"Badge of Honor.\"  Over familiar THEME MUSIC, \"Sgt. Joe Reno\" (actor BRETT CHASE) walks the streets of Los Angeles. \nCHASE (V.O.) My name?  Joe Reno.  The city? Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of all sorts of people.  It's my job to help them.  I like what I do. I'm a cop. \nINT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT \nThe Mayor continues. \nMAYOR But with a second rate Al Capone out there, L.A. looks like Chicago in the '30s.  Something has to be done. \nAs Pierce Patchett nods sagely. \nINT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nWrestler GORGEOUS GEORGE primps and poses before flatten- ing an opponent with a drop kick. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nAn enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3-D glasses. \nEXT. COHEN MANSION (BEVERLY HILLS) - DAY \nIn monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.  The police are waiting.  REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop. \nPOLICE OFFICER Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest. \nCOHEN Bullshit.  What's the charge? \nPOLICE OFFICER Non-payment of federal income tax. \nCOHEN Bullshit. \nJACK Two sets. \nACTRESS I'll get my coat. \nThey're interrupted by Sid Hudgeons. \nHUDGEONS Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance? \nJACK Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine. \nACTRESS I know who he is. \nThe Actress storms off.  Jack looks to Sid. \nHUDGEONS We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned. \nJACK Is she? \nHUDGEONS Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner. \nJACK You lost me, Sid.  Who? \nHUDGEONS Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus? \nJACK I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. \nHUDGEONS Jack!  It's Christmas! \nJACK No.  It's felony possession of marijuana. \nEXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT \nWITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.  Jack and two uniformed patrolmen wait on the darkened street.  An arc light has been set up.  Hudgeons creeps back over from the house. \nHUDGEONS They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree. \nJACK Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns. \nHUDGEONS I like it!  I like it! \nINT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT \nThe arc light floods the living room about the same time that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush: Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN. \nJACK Police! \nEXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT \nJack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck. Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA. \nHUDGEONS Cut!  Wrap it! \nWindows light up.  Rubberneckers appear.  Jack hands the kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in tow. \nINT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT \nJack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A card falls out.  \"Fleur-de-Lis.  Whatever you desire...\" Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being loaded into a black and white.  They're both crying now. \nHUDGEONS (stantorian tone) It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy? \nJACK Yeah, it's subtle. \nSid hands him a President Grant 50. \nHUDGEONS Remember: you heard it first here, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT \nSuspects, mostly drunk and disorderly, are ushered through.  Sgt. ED EXLEY, 30, bespectacled, is at the desk with a YOUNG OFFICER.  Exley is an up-and-comer.  Burning with ambition.  The faster he rises through the ranks, the more resentment he leaves in his wake. \nEXLEY What's on the call sheet? \nYOUNG OFFICER A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself. \nEXLEY Decorated? \nYOUNG OFFICER With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir. \nEXLEY I get the idea.  You got a description? \nYOUNG OFFICER Of his penis, sir? \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT \nTinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN. \nLYNN A case each of gin, Scotch, and rum.  Everything top shelf.  None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn. \nOWNER (laughs) Sounds like a helluva party. \nHer hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a moment. \nOWNER You want it delivered? \nLYNN Before five tomorrow. \nThe Owner spots Bud.  A big smile turns to a frown. \nDudley's the last one out the door.  As he goes, he turns back to give the men a wink.  He's no sooner out the door when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in. \nINT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT \nEd Exley gets another report from the Young Officer. \nYOUNG OFFICER Two police officers were assaulted in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski. \nHe hands the report to Exley.  It's now that Dudley comes through on his press junket. \nDUDLEY This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of the legendary Preston Exley.  He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job. \nAs the photographer snaps Exley's picture... \nDUDLEY I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie.  It makes a man feel old.  That's a fact. (a beat) Feel free to get a feel for the place. \nAs the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns to Exley a bit more serious. \nDUDLEY A word with you, lad. \nINT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY \nDudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley. \nDUDLEY To the memory of your father. \nThey drink.  Exley looks to a photo on the wall. \nHimself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his father Preston, both in police uniform. \nDUDLEY The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time. \nRemembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast. \nEXLEY To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice. \nExley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him. \nDUDLEY That was his favorite toast. (a beat) I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three. \nEXLEY The youngest applicant by eight years. \nDUDLEY You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division? \nEXLEY I was thinking Detective Bureau. \nWe can see Dudley doesn't approve. \nDUDLEY You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach.  You're a political animal, Edmund. \nThe criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter. \nEXLEY You're wrong. \nDUDLEY Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment? \nEXLEY Dudley, we've been over this. \nDUDLEY Answer yes or no. \nEXLEY I... No. \nDUDLEY Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund. \nEXLEY No. \nDUDLEY Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? \nEXLEY No. \nDUDLEY Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance -- \nEXLEY No. \nDUDLEY Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau. \nEXLEY I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father. \nDUDLEY At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them. \nINT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT \nA large impromptu bar has been set-up.  The party is in full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues.  A PHONOGRAPH SPEWS DIRTY CHRISTMAS CAROLS. \nStensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler as Bud elbows his way in with another case. \nSTENSLAND Hey, partner.  Grab a cup. \nBUD I got to write my report first. \nPASSING COP #1 Hear about Helenowski and Brown? They got into a helluva scrap with six taco benders at some bar. Helenowski lost six pints of blood.  Brown's in a coma. \nPASSING COP #2 We ought to teach Paco and his friends a lesson. \nMore cops vocie their agreement.  Bottles are passed. Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest. \nINT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NARCO PEN - NIGHT \nEXLEY (V.O.) Let me out!  That's an order! \nCELL BLOCK \nThe Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black and white. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform. Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands across from them.  There to be judged. \nCHIEF Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board.  Indictments may be handed down.  Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image.  Will you testify? \nBud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief. \nBUD No, sir.  I won't. \nThe Chief sighs, looks to Loew. \nCHIEF District Attorney Loew. \nLoew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo.  The headline:  \"BLOODY CHRISTMAS.\" \nLOEW Bloody Christmas.  The press love to label.  You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct.  Stensland was already drunk.  Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself? \nBUD I won't do it. (staring at mirror) I won't testify against my partner or anyone else. \nLOEW This man is a disgrace. \nCHIEF Your badge and gun, Officer. \nBud sets them on The Chief's desk. \nCHIEF This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed. \nTurning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile. \nOTHER SIDE OF GLASS \nExley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on the other side of the glass. \nTHE CHIEF'S OFFICE \nDudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters. \nCHIEF Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation? \nEXLEY The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department. \nDudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him. \nDUDLEY Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer. \nEXLEY White's a mindless thug. \nDUDLEY No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time. \nThe Chief interrupts with his own concern. \nCHIEF I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire. \nEXLEY I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right. \nCHIEF And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately. \nExley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head. \nEXLEY Detective lieutenant. \nThe Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves. \nCHIEF Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33. \nEXLEY I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective. \nLOEW (interrupting) Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness. \nDUDLEY That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat. \nEXLEY Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him. \nCHIEF All right, Ed. (into desk intercom) Call Sergeant Vincennes. \nAs Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low. \nDUDLEY You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department? \nEXLEY Yes, Dudley.  I am. \nDUDLEY So be it. \nJACK VINCENNES \nLooking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the... \nCHIEF'S OFFICE \nBUD Captain, what do you want? \nDUDLEY Call me Dudley. \nBUD Dudley, what do you want? \nDUDLEY Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell? \nBUD (looks away) Yeah, I hate them. \nDUDLEY And for good reason judging from what I know of your background. \nBud looks back over.  Dudley's getting too personal. \nBUD What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  He's one year from his pension. \nDUDLEY It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell? \nBUD He helped me out once.  That's all. \nDUDLEY Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. \nBUD Him and me both.  Fucking Exley. \nDUDLEY Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself \nBUD What do you want? \nDUDLEY Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. \nBUD Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn? \nSmith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge & .38 Special.  Bud can't believe his eyes. \nDUDLEY They're yours.  Take them. \nBUD I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me? \nDUDLEY Four of the defendants recanted their testimony. \nBUD How? \nDudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand. \nDUDLEY I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide. \nBUD (excited) Homicide?  A detective? \nCHIEF Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.  It's a muscle job and shooting job.  You'll do what I say and not ask questions.  Do you follow my drift? \nBUD (disappointed) In Technicolor. \nDUDLEY Will you work for me? \nBUD Of course... But how? \nDUDLEY How what, Wendell? \nBUD How'd you get them to retract? \nDudley lays brass knuckles on the table.  They're chipped, caked with blood. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nL.A. MONTAGE \nOver the pop song \"STRANGER IN PARADISE.\" \nA)  EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - NIGHT \nFrank Sinatra at the premiere of From Here to Eternity. \nB)  INT. KLUB ZAMBOANGA - NIGHT \nCharlie \"Bird\" Parker makes magic before an appreciative, mostly black crowd. \nC)  TORCH SONG TAVERN (RIVERSIDE) - NIGHT \nNate Janklow exits with his latest flame.  A mob lieutenant, Nate was last seen with Mickey Cohen outside the Federal Courthouse in the opening montage.  A CAR SCREECHES up.  TWO GUNS aim and Nate and his date do down in a proverbial HAIL OF LEAD. \nD)  EXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nA groundbreaking.  The Mayor scrapes at the ground with a gold shovel.  Pierce Patchett is among the distinguished guests. \nEND OF MONTAGE \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nThe marquee gushes:  \"Today Sgt. Joe Reno:  Badge of Honor Star Brett Chase.\" \nINT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY \nA nerdy 14-YEAR-OLD asks Brett Chase: \n14-YEAR-OLD Why'd you become a policeman? \nCHASE I'm not a policeman.  I just play one on television.  But I think I can answer for them.  To help people.  That's why I do the show. \nVICE CAPTAIN They're yours.  Make a major case, Sergeant.  It's the only way you're getting out of here. \nExaggerated \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" from the men. \nVICE CAPTAIN Dismissed, gentlemen. \nAs they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  \"Fleur-de-Lis Whatever you desire.\"  Jack takes the matching business card from his wallet, the one he found on Christmas Eve. \nVICE CAPTAIN Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks. This is Ad Vice, not Narco. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - NARCO PEN - DAY \nJack Vincennes is at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number. \nINT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY \nSid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone. \nHUDGEONS Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T. \nJACK (V.O.) Sid, it's Vincennes. \nHUDGEONS Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy. \nINTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk: \nJACK No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice. \nHUDGEONS Something good? \nJACK Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something. \nHudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a magazine like the one Jack has. \nHUDGEONS Not a word. \nJACK What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.' \nHUDGEONS No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled \nThe LINE CLICKS off.  Jack hesitates a moment before cradling the receiver.  Something's not right here. \nEXT. HOLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT \nAs Exley pulls in, his two-way drones: \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) Park Rangers report three Negro youths discharging shotguns into the air in Griffith Park. Suspects are driving a late model purple Mercury Coupe. \nAs the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and gets out of his car. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT \nAccompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of his desk into a box.  Well-wishing cops pat him on the back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks like he's going to cry. \nIt's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them.  This is hatred. \nActing on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling. Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground. \nAs four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him. \nEXLEY (gasping) You're just a thug, White.  That's all you'll ever be. \nDudley steps into the fray.  He helps Exley to his feet. \nDUDLEY You should stay away from a man when his blood is up. \nEXLEY His blood's always up. \nFour cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back. Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration. \nDUDLEY Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nAccompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his box of stuff into the trunk.  Bud is moody, pensive. \nSTENSLAND Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good. \nBUD Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer? \nSTENSLAND Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight. \nBUD What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing? \nSTENSLAND No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming. \nBUD What are you talking about? \nSTENSLAND It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush. (smiles) I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it. \nStensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left alone. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT \nExley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his jacket.  2:00 A.M.  Finally, something to do.  He walks to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1. \nAs Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life. \nPatchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options. Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house. \nBODYGUARD Everything alright, Mr. Patchett? \nPATCHETT (waves him off) Fine, Philip.  Thank you. \nBUD Where's the other guy?  Buzz. \nPATCHETT He no longer works for me. (a beat) Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. Whatever you desire. \nIf only Jack had been around to hear that. \nBUD Thanks, but no thanks. \nPATCHETT Against your code? \nBUD I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come? \nPATCHETT Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder? \nBUD No. \nPATCHETT Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them? \nBUD That's right. \nPATCHETT Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling. \nBUD (ignores comment) Why were Lefferts' eyes black? \nPATCHETT I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan. \nBUD You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? \nPATCHETT Wait.  Our deal still holds? \nBud nods, his patience running thin. \nPATCHETT I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio. \nBUD What little studio? \nPATCHETT There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon. \nBUD That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ. \nPATCHETT No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but -- \nBUD I got her address. \nPATCHETT Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White? \nBud turns, heads down the walk.  Patchett hits his golf ball.  It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest. Ice. \nEXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM, LOS FELIZ (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nA modern-looking triplex.  A projector's flicker strobes against the closed curtains.  We hear a PHONE RING. \nINT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nThe film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake.  It's projected on a wall in front of which stands Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear. Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye.  She looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake.  The film flashes over them as they kiss. \nThe PHONE RINGS.  Lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it. \nLYNN Hello? \nOLDER GENTLEMAN (Alan Ladd) Is it the cops? \nShe waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the phone. \nEXT. 9781 SOUTH DUQUESNE - DAY \nA South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and Exley till they're almost on top of him. \nJACK Leonard Bidwell? \nThe Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.  Looking them over, he finally nods. \nJACK How's the left these days? \nBOXER What's it to you? \nJACK I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style. \nBOXER What do you want, Mr. Policeman? \nJACK You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there. \nBOXER Till 19-fucking-70. \nJACK How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A. \nExley nods, this is true.  The Boxer's still listening. \nJACK We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe. \nBOXER You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket? \nBUD You fuck for money. \nLYNN There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job? \nBUD Yeah. \nLYNN Do you enjoy it? \nBUD When they deserve it. \nLYNN Did they deserve it today? \nBUD I'm not sure. \nLYNN But you did it anyway. \nBUD Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today. \nLYNN (laughs again) Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute. \nBUD You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett. \nLYNN He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions? \nBUD He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake? \nLYNN No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print. \nLynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment, then follows.  She takes his glass at the door. \nLYNN It was nice meeting you, Officer. \nOut the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts: \nBUD Look.  I want to see you again. \nLYNN Are you asking me for a date or an appointment? \nBUD (suddenly unsure) I don't know. \nLYNN (another smile) If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I -- \nBUD (feeling foolish) Forget I asked.  It was a mistake. \nLynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away. He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off. A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car... \nEXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY \nAn L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb. He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the window at the two-way on the dash. \nEXLEY L.A.P.D. \nJACK Shit.  Someone beat us here. \nVOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper, the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams. Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand. \nCARPORT \nToting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel, Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury.  Jack and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns. \nJACK Hey. \nBreuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber.  He very nearly fires before he sees who it is. \nCARLISLE What the fuck are you guys doing here? \nEXLEY Think of us as back-up. \nJACK What do you got? \nAs Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window. \nBREUNING Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box of double-ought buck and cash. \nJack spots them.  Three shotguns on the passenger side floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills. \nJACK So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor, here I come. \nCARLISLE Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our collar. \nBreuning actually has to restrain his partner. \nEXLEY Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here. We go as a team.  End of story. \nINT. CORRIDOR - TEVERE HOTEL - DAY \nBreuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his pocket for something.  Not there. \nEXLEY Damnit... \nJACK What? \nEXLEY Glasses. \nJACK (chuckling) Just don't shoot me. \nThe door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant. The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple of flop mattresses. \nCOATES Man, what're you saying? \nEXLEY Ray, we got the shotguns. \nCOATES I don't own no shotguns. \nEXLEY Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator? \nCOATES (trembling) Say what? \nEXLEY You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  You were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good. \nCOATES I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge. \nEXLEY Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray? \nCOATES Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me. \nEXLEY Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one. \nCoates nods.  Exley flips up the toggles as he leans in. \nCOATES Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up for parole absconders and sells red devils. \nExley flips down the switches, stands. \nEXLEY I'm going to take a break. \nExley opens the door, looks back in afterthought. \nEXLEY You know, Ray, I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about.  You got a big guilty sign around your neck. \nExley exits. \nOBSERVATION ROOM \nExley enters. \nDUDLEY Masterful, Edmund.  Your father would've been proud. (pointing) This one's on the verge. \nExley looks through the glass into #2.  Larry Fontaine is weeping.  A piss puddle on the floor by his chair. \nEXLEY Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper.  I want him primed. \n#2 ROOM \nFontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters. \nEXLEY Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off.  He said the Nite Owl was your idea.  You want to tell me about it? \nNo answer. \nEXLEY I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk and I think I can save your life. \nNo answer. \nEXLEY Larry, this is a gas chamber job. If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months. \nNo answer. \nEXLEY Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay.  It can be you or it can be Ray. \nNo answer. \nEXLEY Larry, he called you queer.  He said at Casitas you took it up the ass.  He said -- \nFONTAINE I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY! \nThe voice is strong, full of conviction.  Exley glances at the mirror.  Then... \nEXLEY Why'd you burn the clothes? \nFONTAINE (sobbing) I just wanted to lose my cherry. I didn't mean to hurt her. \nExley can't hide his surprise at this. \nEXLEY Hurt who?  Was she a hooker? Hurt who? \nBut Fontaine is gone.  Head lolling, eyes squeezing out tears. \nOBSERVATION ROOM \nExley steps out of the interrogation room.  Dudley braces him. \nDUDLEY Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl. \nEXLEY She may still be alive, whoever she is. \nBud's all ears. \n#3 ROOM \nReading, Jones has his feet on the table.  Exley bursts in. \nJONES This newspaper shit ain't shit. \nEXLEY Where's the girl?  Did you kill her? \nIn the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends... \nINT. VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES - STAGE 4 - NIGHT \nA \"Badge of Honor\" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re- election cmpaign.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.  Fishbowls stuffed with cash.  Jack is here, returns a smile half- heartedly.  Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter as Brett \"Joe Reno\" Chase speaks. \nCHASE This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles. Ellis Loew represents that future. So dig deep and let's get a moral man re-elected. \nApplause.  Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile. \nJack scans the room.  An odd moment as Jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way.  He puts a hand to his face.  Is that him? \nHUDGEON (O.S.) Big V Jack Vincennes! \nJack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching. \nHUDGEONS You're back, boychick. \nJACK Sid, how are they hanging? \nHUDGEONS Down around my ankles. \nHudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out. \nHUDGEONS You remember Matt Reynolds? \nJack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack arrested on Christmas Eve. \nHUDGEONS The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm. \nJACK What's he doing here, Sid? \nHUDGEONS You tight with the D.A., trash? \nJACK Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke. \nHUDGEONS How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish? \nJACK And Reynolds? \nHUDGEONS He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks. (winks) That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career. \nEven Jack's not immune to a comment like that. \nHUDGEONS Matt!  Over here! \nAs Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out... \nHUDGEONS That's D.A. Loew right there. \nReynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.  Hudgeons realizes: \nHUDGEONS You need a drink, kid... Jack, look after him a minute.  Kid, this is Jack.  No secrets between me and him. \nHudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack. \nREYNOLDS Have we met before? \nJACK Yeah. \nJack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds' nerves won't let him stay quiet. \nREYNOLDS Was it a party? \nJACK Something like that. \nREYNOLDS (misreading) Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right? \nJack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth. \nJACK Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.' \nREYNOLDS Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all. \nJack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information. \nJACK Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back. \nREYNOLDS Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too. \nJACK Really?  How? \nREYNOLDS (shakes his head) You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up. \nJACK Yeah.  Me neither. \nReynolds looks like he's going to cry.  Hudgeons returns with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with sauerkraut.  He hands the drink to Matt. \nHUDGEONS Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up. \nReynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at Loew. \nREYNOLDS I don't know if I should do this. \nHUDGEONS Hey, it's not like you don't know how.  And Jack here has connections on 'Badge of Honor.' Pull this off and there'll be a part for you.  I smell a comeback. Don't you, Jack? \nReynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug. \nBUD What was that boyfriend's name? \nMRS. LEFFERTS We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something. \nBUD Stens?  Was it Stens? \nMRS. LEFFERTS Maybe.  I don't know. \nBUD Look at a picture for me. \nBud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana. Out of uniform.  She recognizes him. \nMRS. LEFFERTS That's him.  That's him. \nBUD You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside? \nMrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door. Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it. \nMRS. LEFFERTS I don't know.  You'll have to leave now, Officer. \nBud starts for the closed door. \nBUD What's through here? \nMRS. LEFFERTS No!  Please leave! \nBud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into... \nDEN \nInnocuous except for the smell.  It hits Bud right off. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl! \nBUD Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus. \nMRS. LEFFERTS I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house. \nAs Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door. \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY \nHolding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into... \nCRAWLSPACE \nBud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings. \nThere's a long burlap sack ahead.  It smells bad.  Bud rips burlap.  A rat's nest explodes.  Bud sweeps a forearm at them.  As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead. \nUndaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.  He pats the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.  Bud checks the ID.  \"Turner Meeks.\"  Bus knows him by that name and another. \nBUD Buzz Meeks... Holy shit. \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - DAY \nBud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air. Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Was it... a rat? \nBUD Yeah.  A great big one. \nBud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts. \nBUD Here.  Compliments of the Los Angeles Police Department. \nINT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY \nRay Pinker looks up from an autopsy as Exley enters. \nPINKER Hey, just in time for our stomach of the week.  Frankfurters with sauerkraut, French fries, Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm. Jesus, what a last supper. \nThe stiff is Matt Reynolds!  Pinker continues working away. \nEXLEY The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case? \nPINKER Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away. \nEXLEY What are you talking about? \nPINKER Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought. \nAs Exley's head swims... \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY \nMrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls up.  Exley gets up, starts toward her.  She drops the hose and runs for the front door  Exley cuts her off. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Let my Susie rest in peace! \nEXLEY Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions. \nMRS. LEFFERTS That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss. \nEXLEY Officer White? \nMRS. LEFFERTS A sweet man. \nJACK Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar. \nEXLEY A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White. \nEXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY \nA Packard pulls up out front.  Bud gets out, heads inside.  Another car pulls up across the street. \nCLOSE ON JACK \nWatching Bud.  Jack gets out, starts across the street. \nINT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY \nAt the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins him.  Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles anyway. \nSTOMPANATO Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano? \nBUD I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker. \nNervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer. \nSTOMPANATO What do you want, officer? \nBUD You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett. \nJohnny taps his ring harder.  The bottle almost tips. \nSTOMPANATO Should I? \nBUD His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill. \nSTOMPANATO Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared. \nBUD More. \nSTOMPANATO More's gonna cost you. \nBud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch. \nBUD How 'bout I give you your balls back? \nSTOMPANATO (in considerable pain) Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin. \nBUD Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin? \nSTOMPANATO Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing. \nBud loosens his grip.  Stompanato gasps for air. \nDOOR \nJack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato. Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out. \nBAR \nStompanato's recovering. \nSTOMPANATO Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now. \nBUD He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny? \nSTOMPANATO I don't know.  I swear it! \nBud starts to raise a hand.  Stompanato cringes, but Bud just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes. \nINT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY \nJack's on the phone to Exley. \nJACK He's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato. (sees Bud exit) Check that.  I gotta go. \nEXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nJack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door.  It opens and Bud steps in.  Jack doesn't see who opens it. \nEXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nLEAVES RUSTLE.  There's movement in the underbrush.  Jack appears, followed by Exley.  Jack pulls a gun as they near a window. \nEXLEY What's that for? \nJACK Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead. \nThey press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin. \nThe woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye. \nThey stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before... \nJACK Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all. \nEXLEY Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on? \nJACK Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again. \nEXLEY What's Fleur-de-Lis? \nJACK Guy's as cool as they come. \nA call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.  Exley picks up. \nEXLEY This is Exley. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) Ray Pinker wants to talk to you, Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D. \nEXLEY Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him. \nJACK What are you going to do? \nEXLEY I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car. \nJACK Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner. \nINT. LIBRARY (1184 GRETNA GREEN) - NIGHT \nWatching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett picks up the phone, dials. \nHUDGEONS (V.O.) (over phone) Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T. \nINT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nKNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley. \nEXLEY Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley. \nLYNN I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about. \nEXLEY Really?  What did White say? \nLYNN He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost. \nExley lets it pass.  As he enters... \nEXLEY Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down. \nLYNN He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink? \nExley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back. \nEXLEY Scotch. \nExley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks. \nLYNN I'm curious about you. \nEXLEY Why? \nShe hands him his drink. \nLYNN Because Bud hates you more than he loves me. \nExley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass. \nLYNN It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete. \nEXLEY Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken. \nLYNN The way you've underestimated Bud White? \nExley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes. \nAs they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror. \nREVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET \nTwo-way glass.  Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING pictures.  As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic lovemaking... \nINT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT \nRay Pinker rubs his tired eyes. \nPINKER God bless dental records.  Stiff used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks. \nJACK Buzz Meeks? \nPINKER You knew him? \nJACK Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg. \nPinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn... \nINT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT \nJack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940.  Reading one headed \"Meeks,\" Jack lets out a low whistle.  He's found something. \nINT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT \nJack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously. \nJACK Come on, Exley.  Where are you? \nINT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSpent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor. They're quiet.  Then, through a smile: \nJack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart. Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum. \nJack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words, but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him. \nJACK Have you a valediction, lad? \nDudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies... \nJACK Rollo Tomasi... \nDudley frowns in ignorance at the name. \nINT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY \nNothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their own.  Dudley is at the podium along with Exley.  Dozens of detectives take notes, including Bud White. \nDUDLEY Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning.  Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.  One of our own, gentlemen.  We cannot tolerate it.  Justice must be swift and merciless.  That's all. \nAs the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley. \nDUDLEY Edmund, a word with you.  We received a tip this morning.  Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi? \nExley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from the grave.  Screaming the name Dudley! \nEXLEY No... Where'd the tip come from? \nDUDLEY Anonymous.  Probably nothing. \nAs Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.  Scared. \nINT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BUD WHITE'S DESK - DAY \nBud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him. \nDUDLEY You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp. \nBUD What work? \nDUDLEY I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. (MORE) \nDUDLEY (CONT'D) Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad. \nBUD You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about. \nDUDLEY You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you? \nBUD Sure, boss.  Sure you can. \nINT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY \nPinker looks up as Exley enters. \nEXLEY I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night. Anything and everything.  Start with the I.D. on the corpse. \nA put-upon Pinker sighs. \nPINKER An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled his police academy photo. \nPinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of Meeks.  he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning. \nEXLEY We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops. \nPINKER I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general. \nEXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAY \nA RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath. As usual, a light burns in room six.  Bud White parks alongside the other cars already here.  He makes a dash for the door. \nINT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM SIX - DAY \nSid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat.  Dudley sits across from him.  Dudley's henchman Breuning looms.  Bud enters. \nDUDLEY This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell. \nHUDGEONS I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down. \nDUDLEY It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes? \nHUDGEONS Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios. \nBreuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head. \nHUDGEONS Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean. \nDUDLEY But you were business associates? \nHUDGEONS What does that have to do -- \nBreuning cuffs him again. \nHUDGEONS Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes! \nDUDLEY Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett. \nBud looks over at mention of the name. \nHUDGEONS You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced? \nMore lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad. \nLYNN Come in out of the rain, Bud. \nBUD You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley? \nLYNN We talked. \nBUD So tell me about it. \nLYNN (looking away) In the morning. \nBUD No.  Now. (a beat) You fucked him. \nToo tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods. \nLYNN I thought I was helping you.  I thought -- \nBud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically. She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain. \nINT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY \nDrawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor. \nTwo of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith! \nExley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat. \nBud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall. Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments. \nUntil Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead. Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his eyes. \nEXLEY Why? \nBUD Lynn. \nEXLEY She told you? \nBud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move. \nEXLEY Who told you?  Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out? \nBud hesitates, the answer obvious. \nEXLEY Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks. \nExley points out the academy photo on the floor. \nEXLEY Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way back.  Stensland, too. \nBud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away, drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor. \nEXLEY Think, goddamn you.  Think... \nExley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious. \nBUD I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them. \nEXLEY Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to? \nBUD Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot. \nEXLEY Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus. \nBUD Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. (a beat) The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down. \nEXLEY The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin. \nBUD Somebody got wind of it, killed them all. \nEXLEY It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl? \nBUD Dudley. \nEXLEY The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle. \nBUD Dudley's guys. \nEXLEY They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them. \nBUD It all keeps coming back to Dudley. \nEXLEY It's Dudley for the Nite Owl. \nThey just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in. \nEXLEY Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett. \nBUD Let's just kill them. \nEXLEY What? \nBUD For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice. \nEXLEY Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules. \nBUD There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down. \nA beat as Loew considers his options. \nLOEW It's okay.  These are police. (as she leaves) What do you want? \nEXLEY I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour. \nLOEW On what evidence? \nEXLEY None.  Call it a hunch. \nLOEW (incredulous) Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without -- \nEXLEY Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down? \nLOEW Do you have any proof? \nEXLEY The proof had his throat slit. (a beat) So far you're not denying it. \nLOEW I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for. \nLoew enters his bathroom.  Bud looks to Exley who nods: Go. \nOFFICE BATHROOM \nLoew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs. Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley. \nLOEW Unless you're here to wipe my ass, I think we're through. \nBud just glares at him.  Loew shakes his head. \nLOEW Don't try this good cop/bad cop with me.  I practically invented it.  And so what if some homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls, ten of them step off the bus to L.A. every day. \nThe MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it. Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his head in the toilet. \nHe holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then backhands:  one, two, three. \nBUD Dudley Smith.  Spill. \nLOEW Call him off, Exley! \nEXLEY I don't know how. \nMore backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck, Bud marches him past Exley and back into the... \nINNER OFFICE \nBud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through. \nOUTSIDE \nBud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street below. \nINNER OFFICE \nBud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time. \nEXLEY Bud... \nBUD If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all. \nOUTSIDE \nWe hear Loew's PANT LEG TEARING loose. \nLOEW Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds. \nEXLEY What's Dudley's scheme? \nMore TEARING.  Loew's life may depend on the answer. \nLOEW Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets, his own hand-picked cops'll be the new franchise holders.  Because of those pictures I won't be able to prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up! \nINNER OFFICE \nExley helps pull Loew back inside.  Bud dumps him on the floor.  Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley. \nLOEW Dudley's got everyone under his thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief of Police, the lieutenant governor, everybody! \nExley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's neck. \nEXLEY Not everybody.  You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time. \nLoew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess. \nEXT. CITY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nExley and Bud exit.  Bud's wheels are turning. \nBUD They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two. \nEXLEY We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn. \nBud just stares at him a beat. \nEXLEY You want to talk to her? \nBud looks away, shakes his head \"no.\"  Finally... \nBud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP. A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails him. \nBud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window. \nEXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT \nBud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then... \nBud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM \nINT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT \nExley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down. \nThe door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in. Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard. They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they approach:  \"Dead meat.\"  \"Be careful.\"  Kicks in the side.  The men look at each other, sneer. \nExley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload. \nBud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet. \nEXLEY I'm thinking we might walk away from this. \nAt that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door. He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground. \nThe SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes. Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat. He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest. \nBud falls hard. \nDudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen moment. \nDUDLEY I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund. \nEXLEY Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland. \nDUDLEY Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history. \nEXLEY Why? \nDUDLEY A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. \nEXLEY And now you'll provide them. \nDUDLEY Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people. \nDudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear DISTANT POLICE SIRENS. \nDUDLEY This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over... \nDudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket. \nDUDLEY Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective. \nIt's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses... \nDudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE. \nEXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT \nDudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The two of them are bleached white by headlights. \nDudley raises his badge over his head. \nDUDLEY We're policemen! (winks) Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives. \nExley steps ahead to block his way. \nEXLEY No. \nDUDLEY Why not, lad?  Absolute justice? \nEXLEY Something like that. \nDUDLEY Really?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis? \nExley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles. \nDUDLEY Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? \nExley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward the gathering policemen. \nDUDLEY Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll -- \nThe SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his head. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nL.A. MONTAGE \n\"RAGS TO RICHES\" PLAYS. \nEXT. ROSE BOWL PARADE - DAY \nRiding in a convertible, waving to the crowds is the Grand Marshal -- the new Vice President, a young Richard Nixon. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nA midnight assembly.  The Chief, D.A. Loew and several high ranking brass.  Their attention riveted THROUGH the one-way glass into... \n", "test1_input": "Dudley turns to Exley. \nDUDLEY Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco.  He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city.  An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society. \nUncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists.  Wary.  As Breuning steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table. \nFLATNOSE Motherfuckers! \nExley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand there.  Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley. \nDUDLEY It's part of the play, Edmund.  A sincerity test. \nFlatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the TRIGGER.  CLICK CLICK.  No bullets. \nDUDLEY (to Breuning) Sit him back down. \nCLICK, CLICK.  They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat. Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet. \nDUDLEY Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business.  I'll finish up here. \nINT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - DAY \nThey drive in silence.  No love lost here.  Finally. \nBUD Where are we going? \nEXLEY It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White? \nEXT. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY \nExley pulls up.  Bud looks to him.  Really curious now. \nINT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY \nExley and Bud walk.  An orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall.  Bud's spooked.  The orderly wheels the body in to the examination room. \nAs Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet, is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite see. \nCORONER Call me crazy, but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth. \nMORGUE MEAT LOCKER \nExley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a coroner's assistant waits. \nEXLEY We need you to I.D. the body. There's no next of kin and you knew him best.  So tell me... \nThe assistant pulls open drawer 12.  A naked man. \nA tag on his toe and half his face blown off. \nEXLEY Is that Dick Stensland? \nStunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner. \nBUD Yeah, that's Stens. \nEXLEY Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence. \nBud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out why Stensland is dead.  He squeezes out the words. \nBUD What happened? \nEXLEY Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people. \nThen, from the hall... \nWOMAN (O.S.) Not my baby!  Not my little girl! \nINT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY \nHILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the body of her daughter, Susan. \nThere's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders, but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she does look like Rita hayworth. \nAs Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused. \nCORONER Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts? \nMRS. LEFFERTS I -- I don't know. \nEXLEY We know this is difficult.  Just take your time and look again. \nExley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased. \nMRS. LEFFERTS It seems like my Susan, but... \nEXLEY When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts? \nMRS. LEFFERTS At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip. \nThe Coroner lifts the sheet.  Mrs. Lefferts gasps. \nMRS. LEFFERTS It's her.  My baby.  Dear God... \nAs Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up. \nINT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY \n", "test1_true": "DUDLEY 'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution. The public will demand it and this department will provide it.  Six victims.  One of them, one of our own -- Dick Stensland. (as the cops react) As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular.  In the wrong place at the wrong time. \nBud White listens, not too sure.  Stensland said he had something big going on... \nDUDLEY Robbery looks like the motive.  We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen.  We do have one hot lead, so listen well.  Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park. A park ranger I.D.ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color.  An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 3:00 A.M. \nThe room goes loud, a big rumbling.  Dudley holds up a list. \nDUDLEY The D.M.V. worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142 registered to Negroes in L.A. County.  Fifty two-man teams will shake three names apiece.  Hot suspects you'll bring here. Interrogation rooms have been set up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad. \nCatcalls.  Boos.  The Chief steps to the mike. \nCHIEF Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just go out and get them.  Use all necessary force.  The people of Los Angeles demand it. \nThe men exchange knowing looks.  The real message:  kill them clean.  Exley doesn't approve.  As the men hurry out... \nEXLEY He might as well have put a bounty on them. \nINT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nDetectives pairing up and moving out.  Scanning his three name list, Bud joins his PARTNER for the day. \nBUD Can you take them?  I got I got something I gotta do. \nPARTNER Christ, I don't know.  What if one of these names... \nBUD What I gotta do is for Stensland. My partner. \nThe guy looks at him a beat, nods.  As Bud heads off... \nEXLEY \nwatches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for for the day. \nJACK AND REDNECK \nRedneck chews tobacco, has a Texas drawl. \nREDNECK Where to, Trash? \nJACK If we go by the list, we have about zero chance of making the collar.  But I know a guy who knows what's going on south of Jefferson.  I'm betting he could put us at 50/50. \nREDNECK I don't know... \nAs Redneck thinks, Exley steps up.  He's overheard. \nEXLEY I'll take those odds. (to Redneck) Take off.  We got it from here. \nJack stares.  Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a cup. \nREDNECK Between the two of you guys, you should bring along a photographer. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - DAY \nLast time we saw the Owner was Christmas Eve.  He looks up from a customer as Bud strides in, badge out front. \nBUD I need an address on a customer of yours.  Her name was Lynn. \nOWNER That's all I have to go on? \nBUD Yeah.  And I think you already know who I mean, so cough it up. \nOWNER Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing address and a delivery address. \nBUD Give me both.  Billing first. \nEXT. 1184 GRETNA GREEN, BRENTWOOD (PATCHETT'S) - DAY \nA big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile.  Also last seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a koi pond.  They land in a tight grouping.  As he tees up: \nBUD (O.S.) You must slay 'em at the country club. \nBud's halfway up the walk.  Patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt.  Patchett is cool as can be. \nBUD Are you Pierce Patchett? \nPATCHETT I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office. \nBUD I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night? \nPATCHETT I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help? \nBUD Richard Stensland. \nPATCHETT I don't know him.  Mr... \nBUD Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her? \nPATCHETT (sighs, concedes) You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me? \nBUD We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.

Justice. \nEXLEY You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard. \nBud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart. Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble on Bud. \nAnd as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.)

Coates on the floor.  Jones by the window.  Exley squints. \nEXLEY Nobody move! \nFontaine and Navarette raise their hands.  A jostled BEER BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor.  Reacting, Carlisle JERKS the TRIGGER.  Fontaine goes down. \nNavarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the chest.  Exley BLASTS Navarette. \nScreaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt.

The Chief hangs a gold medallion around his neck.  Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands. \nExley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm. Dudley lifts the medal from his chest. \nDUDLEY Your father would've been proud. \nExley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley. \nEXLEY There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I -- \nDUDLEY There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter. \nEXLEY Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy? \nDudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as more bulbs flash. \nDUDLEY Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt? It's natural.

Let me get my camera. \nHudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him. \nJACK Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure? \nHUDGEONS I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis. \nJack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night. \nHUDGEONS Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my camera!  Where are you going?! \nINT. AFTER HOURS CLUB - NIGHT \nThe BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives. \nBARTENDER What'll it be, Jack? \nJACK (pulls out wallet) A bottle of Scotch. \nAs the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's hand. \nJack grabs the bottle and starts out. \nBARTENDER Hey!  Your change! \nINT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSpent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling. \nBUD Who was that guy who was here earlier? \nLynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small white scar. \nLYNN It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... (re: scar) Where'd this come from? \nBUD When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way. \nLYNN So you saved her. \nBUD Yeah.  But not for long. \nBud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it. \nLYNN Do you like being a cop, Bud? \nBUD I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective... \nLynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up. \nBUD There's something wrong with the Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot the wrong guys.  But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there. \nFrustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest. \nBUD In here I know it.  But I can't prove it.  I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough.  I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless. \nBud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her. \nLYNN You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want. \nBUD That simple, huh? \nLynn nods.  That simple. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - EXLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "CLERK I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean. \nEXLEY Clean? \nCLERK More or less. \nEXLEY Until he gunned down six people. \nEXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY \nExley stands in the trees as a PARK RANGER approaches. \nPARK RANGER I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns. \nEXLEY Then who phoned in the report? \nPARK RANGER Not us. \nINT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY \nRay Pinker looks up from his microscope as Bud enters. \nPINKER Bud White, what brings you down to the basement? \nBUD I got a few Nite Owl questions. \nPINKER I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed. \nBUD I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes. \nPINKER What do you want to know? \nBUD Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense. \nPINKER You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything. \nPinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall.  Bud pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table. We see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor. \nBUD Whose shoe? \nPINKER Susan Lefferts. \nBUD (pointing) If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood? \nPINKER It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away. \nBUD But she's moving away from the door. (thinks; points) Who was sitting at this table? \nPINKER Dick Stensland. (a beat) Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right? \nBud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place. Pinker remembers something. \nPINKER You know, there is one thing. \nPinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands Bud.  Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls. \nPINKER Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door. \nBUD Ear plugs. \nPINKER Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears. \nBUD It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic. \nPINKER What do you mean? \nBUD It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in... \nPINKER Yeah, so... \nBud just stares at the picture of Susan Lefferts. \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY \nA shingle shack dump.  Bud walks the front steps, RINGS the BELL.  Hilda Lefferts answers.  She doesn't look so good. \nBUD Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Let my daughter rest in peace. \nBUD Five minutes.  That's all. \nINT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nPictures of Susan smile down from four walls.  Vamp poses on a nightclub floor.  Mrs. Lefferts is all twitchy and nervous, her eyes darting to a closed door. \nBUD Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue. \nMRS. LEFFERTS First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died. \nBUD Ma'am, I'm sure she was. \nMrs. Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus. \n", "test3_id": 1916}

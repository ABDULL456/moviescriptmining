{"test1_input": "Patchett studies Bud a beat, weighing his options. Patchett's burly BODYGUARD starts over from the house. \nBODYGUARD Everything alright, Mr. Patchett? \nPATCHETT (waves him off) Fine, Philip.  Thank you. \nBUD Where's the other guy?  Buzz. \nPATCHETT He no longer works for me. (a beat) Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. Whatever you desire. \nIf only Jack had been around to hear that. \nBUD Thanks, but no thanks. \nPATCHETT Against your code? \nBUD I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come? \nPATCHETT Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder? \nBUD No. \nPATCHETT Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them? \nBUD That's right. \nPATCHETT Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling. \nBUD (ignores comment) Why were Lefferts' eyes black? \nPATCHETT I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan. \nBUD You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially? \nPATCHETT Wait.  Our deal still holds? \nBud nods, his patience running thin. \nPATCHETT I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio. \nBUD What little studio? \nPATCHETT There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon. \nBUD That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ. \nPATCHETT No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but -- \nBUD I got her address. \nPATCHETT Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White? \nBud turns, heads down the walk.  Patchett hits his golf ball.  It lands just past the koi pond, with the rest. Ice. \nEXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM, LOS FELIZ (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nA modern-looking triplex.  A projector's flicker strobes against the closed curtains.  We hear a PHONE RING. \nINT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nThe film is This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake.  It's projected on a wall in front of which stands Lynn Bracken and an OLDER GENTLEMAN, in his underwear. Lynn's long, blonde hair hangs down over one eye.  She looks more like Veronica Lake than Veronica Lake.  The film flashes over them as they kiss. \nThe PHONE RINGS.  Lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it. \nLYNN Hello? \nOLDER GENTLEMAN (Alan Ladd) Is it the cops? \nShe waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the phone. \nEXT. 9781 SOUTH DUQUESNE - DAY \nA South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and Exley till they're almost on top of him. \nJACK Leonard Bidwell? \nThe Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.  Looking them over, he finally nods. \nJACK How's the left these days? \nBOXER What's it to you? \nJACK I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style. \nBOXER What do you want, Mr. Policeman? \nJACK You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there. \nBOXER Till 19-fucking-70. \nJACK How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A. \nExley nods, this is true.  The Boxer's still listening. \nJACK We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe. \nBOXER You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket? \n", "test1_true": "Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it off. \nBOXER He's bad, so I'll just tell you. Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49 coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.  He is righteous trash. \nJack and Exley scan the list.  Jack's finger stabs down on, \"Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414.\" \nJACK That's five minutes from here. \nEXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nLynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled Older Gentleman out the door. \nOLDER GENTLEMAN I don't understand, doll, we just got started. \nLYNN I'm sorry, but I'll make it up to you.  I promise. \nOLDER GENTLEMAN Gosh, kitten, I don't know... \nAs he begins to mash up against her... \nBUD (O.S.) Hit the road, gramps. \nBud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.  The Older Gentleman strikes a pose.  He still thinks he's Alan Ladd. \nOLDER GENTLEMAN Alright.  This time I'll go, but next time -- \nBUD (flips badge) L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck out of here or I'll call your wife to come get you. \nSputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with Lynn then hurries away, giving Bud a wide berth. \nLYNN I've been expecting you.  Pierce called.  Told me what happened to Sue. \nINT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY \nA nice breezy feel.  The perfect place to shack up. \nLYNN It's Officer White, isn't it? \nBud nods, eyeballs the place. \nLYNN Can I get you a drink? \nBUD Yeah, plain scotch. \nBud watches her move to the bar.  God, she's beautiful. \nLYNN I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean? \nBUD Are you sorry she's dead? \nLYNN Of course I am.  What kind of question is that? \nShe steps back with a scotch for both of them. \nBUD Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland? \nLYNN No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you? \nBUD You use words like that, you might make me mad. \nLYNN Yes.  But do you know? \nBUD Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention. \nLYNN That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating. \nBUD Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl? \nLYNN I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today. \nBUD Did Lefferts have a boyfriend? \nLYNN Like I said we were friendly, not friends. \nBUD How'd she meet Patchett? \nLYNN Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little. \nBUD Tell me about Patchett. \nLYNN He's waiting for you to mention mention. \nBUD You want some advice, Miss Bracken? \nLYNN It's Lynn. \nBUD Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears. \nLynn smiles again.  She likes Bud.  A beat. \nLYNN I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White? \nBUD Maybe I'm just fucking curious. \nLYNN You say 'fuck' a lot. \n", "test1_id": 1914, "test2_input": "Bud starts away, but Exley gets right in his face.  Other cops begin to take notice.  The ambulance pulls out. \nEXLEY How's it going to look on your report? \nBUD It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  Justice. \nEXLEY You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard. \nBud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart. Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble on Bud. \nAnd as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) Repeat, three suspects escaped from the Hall of Justice jail. The Nite Owl killers:  Raymond Coates, Tyrone Jones and Larry Fontaine.  They are considered armed and extremely dangerous. Descriptions are as follows... \nINT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY \nElectrified, \"Nite Owl Killers\" on everyone's lips. Exley strides through with purpose, beelines to a filing cabinet.

Lives on Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for parole absconders.' \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY \nPolice rush back and forth.  Exley hurries over to the desk, but he's not there. \nEXLEY Anyone seen Jack Vincennes? \nA few cops mumble they haven't.

STAIRWELL - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY \nExley and Carlisle take the steps two at a time. \nINT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY - VICTORIAN BUILDING - DAY \nExley squints, reaches to a pocket.  No glasses.  He passes an elevator, rounds a corner.  There's 408.  Exley pumps the shotgun, nods to Carlisle who kicks the door in. \nNAVARETTE LIVING ROOM \nExley and Carlisle burst in on four men eating sandwiches. Fontaine and Caucasian NAVARETTE at a table.  Coates on the floor.  Jones by the window.  Exley squints. \nEXLEY Nobody move! \nFontaine and Navarette raise their hands.  A jostled BEER BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor.  Reacting, Carlisle JERKS the TRIGGER.  Fontaine goes down. \nNavarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the chest.  Exley BLASTS Navarette. \nScreaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt.  Exley FIRES, blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW. \nCoates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it.  A bad pull takes out half a back wall.  Coates is out the door. \nELEVATOR \nCoates makes it inside, frantically pushes buttons. \nHALLWAY \nHere comes Exley.  Stumbling, wiping Navarette's blood out of his eyes, he closes on the... \nELEVATOR \nCoates watches as the elevator doors begin closing. \nHALLWAY \nExley charging. \nELEVATOR \nThe shotgun barrel juts through.  The doors bang against it.  BLAM! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nL.A. MONTAGE \nTONY BENNETT belts \"BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS.\" \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DAY \nExley returns to grudging respect.  His white shirt flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley who dubs him \"Shotgun Ed.\"  Exley doesn't enjoy it.  He's numb, stumbling along.  As he notices the blood on his hands... \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER HEADLINE \nNITE OWL HERO!  Over a photo of Exley. \nEXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE - DAY \nA coffin is lowered into the ground.  A WIDOW leans on the Chief's arm, accepts a tri-folded American flag from Dudley Smith.  Exley drops a handful of earth on the casket, has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands. \nCHIEF We mourn the passing of a good man.  The loss of Sgt. William Carlisle is the loss of his wife, his family and the entire Los Angeles Police Department... \nA sea of dress blues.  Jack looks bored, dressed too flashy for a funeral.  Bud looks grim, rain dripping off the brim of his cap.  As a TWENTY-ONE GUN salute is FIRED... \n", "test2_true": "Larry Fontaine's mother mourns alone as her son is buried. \nINT. CITY OF ANGELS HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nExley talks with a tough, starchy NURSE. \nEXLEY I need the girl to give me a chronology of events.  No details. Just times. \nNURSE Absolutely not.  She barely remembers her own name. \nEXLEY But -- \nNURSE I was told the case was closed. Should I call your superior to double-check? \nEXLEY No.  that won't be necessary. \nThe Nurse turns, marches away.  Exley is left with a nagging doubt. \nEXT. ORANGE GROVE (ANAHEIM) - DAY \nPeople cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees.  A banner heralds the future:  \"On this site:  The World's Biggest Amusement Park.\"  Cartoon characters dance among the fallen trees. \nINT. STATE ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nSitting behind a desk is the Older Gentleman last seen doing his best Alan Ladd impersonation at Lynn Bracken's. \nHe stares emphatically at the SMARMY LAWYER who stands before him holding a manila folder. \nOLDER GENTLEMAN You tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote. \nThe Lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs.  From Lynn Bracken's apartment.  The first is the Older Gentleman naked except for his socks and garters. \nINT. STATE ASSEMBLY - CHAMBER - DAY \nThe Older Gentleman rises for an assembly vote. \nOLDER GENTLEMAN It may surprise some, but a mature man, enlightened by the facts, can change him mind... \nEXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - NIGHT \nRain.  A limo disgorges a heavy-set man who climbs steps, knocks on the door.  Lynn answers in an evening gown.  He gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her. Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street. \nBud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel.  Smiling a bit sadly to herself, Lynn disappears inside. \nThis is no stake-out.  Bud watches after her with yearning. \nINT. TROCADERO CLUB - NIGHT \nCigarette girls and club photographer make the rounds. Johnny Stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show. \nEXT.

MIDDLE CLASS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA father holds out his hand, counts along as Jack slaps $100 bills into his palm.  Maybe four thousand dollars. \nJack says something about \"We appreciate your understanding during this difficult time.\"  As \"Badge of Honor\" comes on the TV, the father responds with \"Goddamn actors.\" \nLeading, Jack looks through an open door where Brett Chase's high school \"Sweater Girl\" is being comforted by her mother.  As she locks eyes with him an instant... \nINT. PIERCE PATCHETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe monied johns watch horny as hell as \"Ginger Rogers\" twirls around the room with a female \"Fred Astaire.\" Clothes fly as they spin.  Still, most eyes turn to Lynn Bracken as she enters oozing that cat-girl grace. \nEXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nReporters scribble as the Chief speaks.  Uniforms everywhere along with Exley and Loew.  Bus sits in the back. \nCHIEF Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.  It is my honor to present him with our highest honor, the Medal of Valor. \nExley steps up.  The Chief hangs a gold medallion around his neck.  Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands. \nExley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm. Dudley lifts the medal from his chest. \nDUDLEY Your father would've been proud. \nExley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley. \nEXLEY There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I -- \nDUDLEY There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter. \nEXLEY Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy? \nDudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as more bulbs flash. \nDUDLEY Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt? It's natural.  Just keep it inside.  Between you and you. \nExley considers his medal.  It is an appealing thing. \n", "test2_id": 1915, "test3_input": "BUD What was that boyfriend's name? \nMRS. LEFFERTS We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something. \nBUD Stens?  Was it Stens? \nMRS. LEFFERTS Maybe.  I don't know. \nBUD Look at a picture for me. \nBud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana. Out of uniform.  She recognizes him. \nMRS. LEFFERTS That's him.  That's him. \nBUD You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside? \nMrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door. Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it. \nMRS. LEFFERTS I don't know.  You'll have to leave now, Officer. \nBud starts for the closed door. \nBUD What's through here? \nMRS. LEFFERTS No!  Please leave! \nBud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into... \nDEN \nInnocuous except for the smell.  It hits Bud right off. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl! \nBUD Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus. \nMRS. LEFFERTS I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house. \nAs Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door. \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY \nHolding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into... \nCRAWLSPACE \nBud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings. \nThere's a long burlap sack ahead.  It smells bad.  Bud rips burlap.  A rat's nest explodes.  Bud sweeps a forearm at them.  As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead. \nUndaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.  He pats the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.  Bud checks the ID.  \"Turner Meeks.\"  Bus knows him by that name and another. \nBUD Buzz Meeks... Holy shit. \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE - DAY \nBud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air. Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Was it... a rat? \nBUD Yeah.

FORENSICS LAB - DAY \nRay Pinker looks up from an autopsy as Exley enters. \nPINKER Hey, just in time for our stomach of the week.  Frankfurters with sauerkraut, French fries, Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm. Jesus, what a last supper. \nThe stiff is Matt Reynolds!  Pinker continues working away. \nEXLEY The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case? \nPINKER Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away. \nEXLEY What are you talking about? \nPINKER Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought. \nAs Exley's head swims... \nEXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY \nMrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls up.  Exley gets up, starts toward her.  She drops the hose and runs for the front door  Exley cuts her off. \nMRS. LEFFERTS Let my Susie rest in peace! \nEXLEY Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions. \nMRS. LEFFERTS That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss. \nEXLEY Officer White? \nMRS. LEFFERTS A sweet man. \n", "test3_true": "MRS. LEFFERTS All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there. \nExley spots the entrance to the crawlspace.  He hurries over, enters nearly flat on his belly.

HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY \nJack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch bottle on the desk.  He considers a framed \"Badge of Honor\" photo:  Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner \"To Protect and Serve.\"  Jack punches a fist through it. \nINT. LAPD - FORENSICS LAB - DAY \nExley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the lab atop a gurney.  Pinker steps over. \nEXLEY I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk only to me on this one. \nINT. JACK'S DESK - DAY \nSitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962.  He flips one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp.  Jack remembers something Matt Reynolds told him.  He dials the phone. \nJACK Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Please hold, Sergeant... \nAs Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him. \nEXLEY I need to speak to you. \nJACK Give me a minute, will ya? \nExley clicks off the phone. \nJACK Damnit... What? \nEXLEY I want you to follow Bud White. \nJACK Even I'm not that crazy. \nEXLEY It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently. \nJACK Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor. \nEXLEY Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night? \nJACK Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone. \nEXLEY You make a mistake? \nJACK Yeah.  My whole life. \nJack stands, heads out.  Exley follows; he needs help. \nEXLEY Listen, I think I made a mistake, too. \nJACK I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession. \nEXLEY Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings? \nJACK What? \nEXLEY It's a simple question. \nJACK You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant. \nExley watches as Jack continues down a hall.  Then: \nEXLEY Rollo Tomasi. \nJack stops, looks back at him. \nJACK Is there more to that, or do I have to guess? \nEXLEY Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality. \nJACK So what's the point? \nEXLEY Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop? \nJack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead. \nJACK I don't remember... \nBoth men are quiet a moment. \nJACK I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one. \nEXLEY I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing. \nJACK The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant. \nEXLEY I want to do it right. \nSo does Jack. \n", "test3_id": 1916}

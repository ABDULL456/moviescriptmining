BABY OK. 
JERRY I'll go. It's my fault. 
MARY You said it, not me. 
BILL Forget it. I'll just go. 
MARY Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself. 
BILL Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched. 
JERRY I agree. 
BABY Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down. 
Baby jumps up and gets out of the car. 
BILL Don't worry, I'll be right back. 
BABY Come on. 
JERRY Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there. 
BILL Thanks. 
JERRY No problem. 
Bill kisses Mary good-bye and EXITS. 
Mary watches Baby and Bill head off into the WOODS. Baby turns and makes a kissy face at Mary. 
EXT. MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE - DAY 
A hand painted tin sign surrounded by flashing lights which reads MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE hangs over the entrance to a small garage. 
Movie star portraits of JEAN HARLOW, W.C. FIELDS and CLARK GABLE adorn the walls of the garage. 
An over the hill ex-glamour girl, MISS BUNNY, 55, comes into frame. She's dressed in a sparkling red gown with feathers in her hair. 
MISS BUNNY (bad Marilyn Monroe imitation) Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my Hollywood Revue... (she giggles) ...where the stars shine forever. 
INT. MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE - DAY 
Tinseltown lives. Tin foil is wrapped around everything, the walls, doors and ceiling. Fake cement handprints of movie greats cover the tiny floor. Badly sculpted statues of MARILYN MONROE, GROUCHO MARX and JOHN WAYNE stand in the corners. 
Dead center is a small puppet show stage. 
MISS BUNNY Hi, this is the place where the magic happens. 
CLOSE UP - SQUIRREL 
A stuffed squirrel dressed in a gray skirt and jacket, a tilted hat sits atop its head. 
MISS BUNNY (holding up squirrel) This is Jenny, she is our resident Ingrid Bergman. 
Miss Bunny picks up a stuffed white cat wearing a brown trenchcoat. 
MISS BUNNY This is Ronald J. Perrywinckle... our Humphrey Bogart... today we'll be doing a scene from Casablanca. 
Miss Bunny begins to make the dead animal puppets interact. She provides their voices. 
HUMPHREY CAT If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him you'll regret it... maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life. 
INGRID SQUIRREL But what about us? 
HUMPHREY CAT We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we lost it... until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. 
INGRID SQUIRREL When I said I would never leave you. 
HUMPHREY CAT And you never will. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
A single flashlight beam cuts through the darkness of the dense woods. Bill stumbles behind Baby, she is clearly in her element.

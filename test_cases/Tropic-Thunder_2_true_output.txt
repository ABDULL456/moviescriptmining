CUT TO: 
INT. AGENCY OFFICE -- L.A. - DAY 
RICK PECK, head of the Peck Agency, sits in his office, overlooking. Los Angeles. He has a headset on. 
PECK. Guess what I'm staring at right now? 
WE INTERCUT BETWEEN SPEEDMAN AND PECK 
SPEEDMAN What? 
PECK I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville. It's insane. 
I Tropic Thunder 25. We see Pedk is holding a Vanity Fair with an ad on the back: it is a picture of Speedman looking earnest, holding two baby PANDAS. The caption reads: 
"PANDAS...THEIR SURVIVAL IS NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE" 
PECK The credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless, and strangely, if' you see this picture, what really strikes me is the credibility that you give them. I've been getting psychotic feedback all day. Hey did you get the basket I sent? WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage backpack, There's a satellite phone, camouflage sunblock, etc. 
SPEEDMAN Yeah. Thanks. 
PECK You sad? What's wrong? 
SPEEDMAN No I'm fine. I've just been having a tough time over here. They still havn't got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already -- 
PECK Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk Lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black, of course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to what I am telling you. He is clinically mentally not right. 
SPEEDMAN Yeah but the way they talk about him. I mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't even get a nomination. I don't know, I mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your exact words. 
Tropic Thunder 26. 
PECK I don't believe those were my exact words but let's get beyond that to the root of this. Remember the moment you chose to do, this', and I wanted you to do the ESP robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I said stay home be happy and you said "no, Rick I need to play a real human being" and I said "okay" and then I said "are you sure?" and you said that you needed this-for your soul? 
SPEEDMAN Yes but -- 
PECK Which I totally respected and now you're doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move on me,..which I love by the-way-- but-you said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul And-that's why I hate you.. Because you were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long fucking Delta,. in the real mud, with- leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil es from Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would wager, forcing everyone around you to rise to your level. Am I right? I mean you are over there forcing a bunch of PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and. become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I right? Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this 
SPEEDMAN Yeah. You are right. 
PECK Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get to work genius soldier. I'll handle the .TiVo. Peck hangs up abruptly. 
ON SPEEDMAN Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts. it down. He ponders Rick's words as he gets caught up watching the end scene of "SIMPLE JACK" on his TV. He has forgotten Damien is on the other line. 
Tropic Thunder 27. 
EXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY 
Damien stands holding the phone, still on hold. Through the glass, we see the entire crew waiting silently behind him. 
SPEEDMAN ON TV (O.S.) (as Simple Jack)' Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain't it? 
DAMIEN Chris? You there? Hello? Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien explodes. He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up and down on it. He notices the crew staring at him. He tries to look as if that just didn't happen. He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the door. He continues walking through his office, out into the main offices. He motions for his assistant to join him. 
VOICE OF TODD Damien? This is not going to go away! I'm going to be on my cell all day -- I'm going to a funeral but I'm keeping it on. That's Where we're at with this! 
OUTSIDE OF DAMIEN'S OFFICE He walks with purpose, followed by his assistant. 
DAMIEN Get everyone together! We are having a cast meeting" tonight! No choice! Everyone must attend. I am putting my foot down! 
HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT Oh... I don't think I can do that, Damien. Chris is having that "End of First Week" party at his place tonight. Everybody's going. Damien's eyes twitch oddly.

Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy. 
ERIC Don't waste my time. 
SKULL COWBOY Very well, it's your ass. 
And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully. 
ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT) 
As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to disassemble him.  The fire in his eye sockets goes out.  His hat flies off an is pulverized by the wind.  The garments begin to disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in mid-air. 
ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected development.  A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face and transmutes to dust! 
RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT) 
Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS 
As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass mentor CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND 
Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's heart would have been. 
TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS 
He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too, renders down to nothingness,  leaving a vague green glow that dies.  And as he looks to the sky -- 
UP ANGLE - THE CROW 
flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.  Eric is astonished. 
ERIC But why are you still here? 
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW 
No answer in the crow's eyes. 
RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC 
That's good enough for Eric.  He marches to the double doors and shoves them back. 
INT. CHURCH - AS ERIC COMES THROUGH THE DOORS - NIGHT 
The high breeze blows in with him, disturbing dust in the disused Gothic dark.  Hollow cathedral ECHOES to sounds.  A giant 27" TV positioned on the alter, broadcasting static. 
LONG SHOT - ERIC AS HE APPROACHES THE ALTER - ("CROWVISION") 
Leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places. 
ANGLE - THE TV - AS ERIC ENTERS FRAME 
Onscreen:  Elly, gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron ring bolted to a flagstone wall.  Could be anywhere inside the church. 
LAO (O.S./FILTERED) I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow. (beat) Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up. ERIC I can see her. 
LAO Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light. 
LAO (CONT'D; O.S./FILTERED) Don't permit your rage to cloud the issue.  I believe in barter. I propose a simple trade. 
Grange sights his weapon. 
CROSSHAIR POV - ERIC AT THE ALTER 
Bluring as Grange resights.  Eric is not the target.  Blur FINDS the crow at the far end of the nave, perched in front of a giant stained glass window. 
NEW ANGLE - GRANGE -- squeezing off two quick, SILENCED shots. 
ANGLE - STAINED GLASS WINDOW -- the first shot blows a hole in some pastoral religious presentation.  TINKLE of glass. 
ANGLE - ERIC -- Spinning at the quiet !pfut! sound, to witness. 
ANGLE - INCOMING DART - ("CROWVISION") 
SPinning and hissing venomously. 
ANGLE - ERIC DUCKS 
As before, but the crow is not as fast. 
TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW 
As it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers. 
LOW ANGLE - ERIC AT ALTER - INCLUDE TV 
His knees buckle.  Sympathetic PAIN from the hit.

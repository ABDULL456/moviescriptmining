Same time. 
Simon comes in, furious and throws open the fridge. He finds nothing to eat or drink. He slams the door, then hears the water running in the bathroom upstairs. He stops and listens. 
The bathroom door; the water heard running steadily. 
Simon turns away then sees... 
The poem notebooks face down on the table. 
He thinks. 
The bathroom door; the water heard running... 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Moments later. 
Henry comes into his house, hot and bothered, cradling his six-pack. But he stops, listens, then steps through the kitchen towards the living-room. He stops in the entrance and sees... 
Fay on the floor of the living-room, reading his 'Confession', her mouth hung open in an astonished 'O'. 
He drops his six-pack and... 
She spins around, caught in the act. 
Henry stands in the doorway, pent up, sweating and with perverse things on his mind. 
Fay, her hands palm down on the floor behind her, bites her lip, coquettishly. 
Henry looks her over like she was something good to eat. 
She feels his gaze all over her and twists to one side with a breathless little shudder. 
He steps nearer, stands over her and she looks up at him. 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon climbs the stairs to the bathroom... 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Same time. 
Henry and Fay kissing passionately... 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon knocks on the bathroom door. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Same time. 
Henry and Fay groping and shoving one another as they stagger from room to room. 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon bangs on the bathroom door. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Same time. 
Fay falls to the couch... 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon crashes through the door and finds... 
Mary, kneeling over the edge of the tub, her wrists slit and the blood running down the drain, the shower raining down over her back. 
Simon looks on in horror. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Same time. 
Henry tears open his trousers... 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon lifts Mary from the bathtub. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Same time. 
Henry and Fay clutch and grind and heave... 
INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Same time. 
Simon drags his mother from the bathroom and down the stairs.

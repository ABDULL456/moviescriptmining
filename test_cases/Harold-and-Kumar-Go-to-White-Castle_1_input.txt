HAROLD How the hell should I know? 
KUMAR (O.C.) This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE 
VENTILATION SHAFT BREAKS OFF THE CEILING AND KUMAR FALLS OUT 
ONTO THE GROUND... 
HAROLD Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head. 
KUMAR Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell. 
KUMAR You sure you don't want to get out? 
HAROLD And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop. 
KUMAR So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. (beat) Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second. 
HAROLD Fine.    Hurry up. Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key.

KUMAR Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will... 
HAROLD Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something... 
KUMAR What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk. 
HAROLD Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED...

TOO COLD. HE SPITS IT OUT AND SLAPS THE BAG OF WEED... 
DEPRESSED, THE BAG OF WEED WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE... KUMAR hears THE BAG OF WEED crying from the other room.   He obviously feels guilty...

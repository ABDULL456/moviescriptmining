GRACE Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I married him!... I married him...okay? 
She looks at Bobby, forces him to look at her. Finally: 
BOBBY Why? 
GRACE I don't know why! 
She drops back in her seat. Tears come. 
GRACE All I wanted was to be a kid... He took that from me... They all did... (very quietly, dangerously) They treated me like meat. A piece of meat. Fuck me. Blow me. Bend over. Stick their fingers up my ass... Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They deserved to die! 
A pause. 
BOBBY And us Grace? What do we deserve? 
GRACE (crying quietly to herself) "Nin chonk, nin chonk," my Mama used to say in Apache. "Your worst is doing this to you," she said, "your worst has killed you." And "Be go tsee" -- "you will find out the result of what you have done..." Just when you think it's over, when you've gotten away, it begins. Cause you never get away. 
Bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road. Can he still love her? She seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said she could. 
GRACE It's easy to judge someone else when you don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache, Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't see what I see. Don't judge me. 
A silence. Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night. 
BOBBY I don't want to think anymore. 
GRACE (quietly) Then drive... 
The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness. 
THE SUN COMES UP: 
EXT. CANYON - END SPOT - DAWN 
In the vast reaches of a deserted canyon, where VULTURES circle in a hot white sky, we find the MUSTANG parked at the edge of a drop. We hear the SOUND of a body being dragged. 
D.J. (V.O.) ...Nobody's sure where it was heading so fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't be getting home now! Hey area weather is gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold! Cold! Just like yesterday. Just like every day. Some surprise, huh? So if you're planning on anything, don't. You don't like the weather, just wait one minute. Got any brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself some trailer park where you don't see no desert for miles and miles... 
BOBBY (over) Right there... Drop it there. I got it. 
BOBBY is giving GRACE instructions as they drop SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER'S corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below. 
GRACE See ya, Virgil. God bless. 
Bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting. The body crashes below. It's hard work. They head back for the Mustang, to retrieve JAKE'S body in the popped trunk. But Grace notices Bobby glancing at the Baretta now tucked in her waist. 
The silence is tense between them, the rocks and gravel crunching under their shoes as they walk. 
GRACE (indicates the gun) Is this what's bothering you Bobby? 
BOBBY No Grace, my hand's bothering me. 
GRACE You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop! 
She pulls an imaginary trigger on Bobby, mimicking the recoil of a gun. Bobby is nervous. 
GRACE Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby? 
BOBBY You could give me my gun back. 
Grace smiles. 
GRACE Why don't we just finish what we started. 
She stares down at Jake. She can't help feeling some old feelings. As Bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off the annoying radio. He watches as she softly prays over Jake, whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled. 
GRACE (after a moment with Jake) What do you think happens to someone's spirit when they die? 
BOBBY I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it. 
GRACE You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby? 
BOBBY I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else. (lifting Jake by the shoulder) Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds. 
Grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his move, quickly, closing on her when she's off guard. He slams her hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground, dazed. 
He steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist, checks it. 
She puts her hand to her mouth, feels the blood on her finger tips. She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts into Bobby like a knife. 
GRACE You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach you anything...?

Blips appear on the display... in the observation room... in the Habitat Area and in one of the corridors. \nLINDA I've got movement in Corridor Six. \nMATT That's him. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nA shadow edges down the tunnel. It settles for a moment, disappearing completely, then is back on the move. At the tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing passes by. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM \nCarter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a locker. \nMATT Got 'em. \nMatt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies. He tosses one to Linda. \nLINDA (into walkie) Check. Check. \nHer voice echoes from the other unit. \nLINDA (cont'd) Be careful. \nMATT Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, ready? \nCARTER Let's do it. \nMatt and Carter exit. Linda locks the door behind them. \nINT. TUNNEL \nMatt and Carter trot toward corridor six. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nLinda huddles over the display, tracking the two. \nLINDA (into Walkie) Take a right at the next accessway. He's working his way back to the offices. \nWe see Matt and Carter on one of the working video screens as they push down the tunnel. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nMatt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound. \nMATT (Walkie - sotto) If we split up, can we trap him on corridor eight? \nLINDA (V.0.) If he keeps heading in that direction. \nMatt nods to Carter. The pair splits, heading down separate accessways. \nMATT Going Thermal. \nMatt pulls the visor down over his eyes. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nLinda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian in a pincer move. \nSuddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda grabs the walkie. \nLINDA I lost him. Matt, I lost him. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nMatt makes his way forward. \nMATT He probably just stopped moving. \nBut Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly ... approaching a corner... \nHe rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far end of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire. \nCARTER It's me. \nMatt pulls off his goggles. \nMATT Do you have anything? \nCARTER Nothing. \nMATT How did he get by us? \nCARTER He couldn't. \n", "test1_true": "No response. They both don their visors and move forward slightly. Carter holds up his hand. \nCARTER There. Behind those pipes. He's not moving. \nCarter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat signature clings to the wall. \nCARTER (cont'd) Doctor Caine? (beat) Can you hear me? \nNo response. \nMATT (into walkie) We see him. But he's not responding. The heat signature doesn't move. \nMatt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer gun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat signature huddles behind pipes. \nMATT C'mon... C'mon... \nThe two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear shot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too. \nCARTER Covered. \nMatt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off the wall ... Nothing there. \nMATT What the... \nHe crosses to the heat signature. \nMATT (cont'd) Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent \nLINDA (V.0.) He was there. \nMATT Looks like... looks like we're pumping out heat... \nSuddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the air, kicking wildly. SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR BY HIS NECK. He gasps for air. \nLINDA (V.0.) I got movement again! He's right on top of you! \nMATT No fucking shit! \nMatt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the ceiling until he spends his dart rounds. \nMATT (cont'd) Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go. \nCARTER (choking) H...Help... MMmmphg \nCarter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack, he's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up across his head and his body goes limp. \nMATT (into walkie) Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!? \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nLinda huddles over the display. \nLINDA Right on top of you. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nMatt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down from the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves through the cloud of steam. \nAround the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his tranquilizer. \nLINDA (V.0.) What's going on? Are you okay? \nMATT Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from a head wound. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLinda watches the screen. Two blips, one traveling quickly. \nLINDA Matt, he's coming toward you. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nMatt takes a few steps back. \nMATT Shit. \nLINDA Got outta there. \nMatt breaks into a run. \nINT.

Sounds of footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast doors begin to close. \nMATT Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's shutting me in. \nMatt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt turns and pulls on his thermals. \nMATT (cont'd) Where is he? \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLinda huddled over the screen. Tense. \nLINDA He's coming right at you! \nThen checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature dot the tunnel. \nMATT Where? \nLINDA Twenty, maybe thirty feet. \nMATT Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must be ghosts. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nLinda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the room. Sees a heating vent in the corner. \nBeat. \nShe grabs the walkie. \nLINDA Those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents. \nThrough the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red. \nMATT I'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals. \nLINDA Get out of there! \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM \nFRANK If the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good. \nLinda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. \nLINDA I'm going! \nFRANK Linda...it's not safe. \nLINDA That's why I'm going. (to Frank and Sarah) Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to the lab. We'll meet you there. \nFRANK But... \nLINDA Do it. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nMatt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him sweeping the hallway. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo... \nHis voice keeps shifting. Matt fires. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Not even close. \nMatt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty. \nSEBASTIAN So... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend. \nMATT Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You aren't thinking rationally. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she? \nMATT Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk this through. It's not too late. \nThe Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him. \nMATT (CONT'D) C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm your friend. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm sorry, but I just feel that our friendship is holding me back. I'm sure you understand. \nTHE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She pulls him to his feet and through the door. \n", "test2_true": "Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down the corridor. \nSARAH This way. \nThey shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his pulse while Frank takes a protective position. \nSARAH (cont'd) Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow. \nFRANK He'll be okay. \nSARAH It's pretty severe. We have to get him to the lab. \nFRANK He's got to be okay. \nFrank stands frozen. \nSARAH For godsakes, help me. \nFrank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up and carry him down the hallway. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM \nLinda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them. \nMATT He was going to kill me. \nLinda pulls him close. \nLINDA I know. He's gone. \nMATT We've got to got out of here. \nLinda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter headed toward the Laboratory. \nMATT (cont'd) Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? \nIsolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip. \nLINDA Habitats. \nMATT Oh god. That's right between us and the lab. \nINT. LABORATORY \nFrank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table. \nSARAH His pulse is faint. \nSarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and presses it against the head wound. \nSARAH (cont'd) He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold this. \nShe guides Frank's hands to the wound. \nSARAH (cont'd) Keep applying pressure. \nSarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to find a vein. \nSARAH (cont'd) Don't move your hand until I got back. \nSarah heads to the door. \nFRANK Where are you going? \nSARAH This'll hold him but he needs blood. \nFRANK But... \nSARAH Supply is right down the hall. I'll be two seconds. \nFRANK Sarah, wait for the others \nSARAH If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on the wound. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nSarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end of the cramped tunnel is the supply room. \nShe swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while glancing side-to-side and behind her. \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM \nSpooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts through blood bags. \n", "test2_id": 2461, "test3_input": "MATT Where? \nLINDA Sebastian! \nSilence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door of the Chamber. \nLINDA (cont'd) Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me. \nNo response. They all their tranq pistols level waiting for some sign. Hearing each other breathe. They slowly move outside the Chamber into the corridor. \nLINDA (CONT1D) I don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. This isn't who you are. \nA beat. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE I would say that what I am experiencing is psychological awareness. I like you being in complete and absolute control. \nThey identify the general area the voice is coming from: Back inside the Chamber! They slowly move toward the Chamber door. With lightning speed they slam the door shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber. \nLINDA You goddamn bastard! You goddamn bastard. You're gonna pay for this. I'm going to bring you back to visibility and then I'm going throw your ass in jail. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE You're never gonna bring me back Linda. I never want to come back. \nLINDA Fuck you! \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time for old times sake. \nLinda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber. \nMATT Don't listen to him. It's not worth it. \nFRANK Come on, Matt. Let's go get the elevator back on-line so we can got out of this hell hole. \nMatt gives Linda a kiss... \nMATT He does anything, anything at all, come get us. I'll be back to check on you in five. \nMatt and Frank head off down the corridor. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE Imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose. Out of curiosity, what did he give you that I couldn't? \nLINDA Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man than you'll ever be. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If that's what you want... \nSebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the observation room door swings open slightly. \nINT. CHAMBER \nLinda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ... stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead Sarah. \nThen she sees it. The little red light on the intercom. Its on. \nLINDA Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No... \nLinda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running. \nLINDA (cont'd) Matt! Frank! \nTracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall. \nLINDA (cont'd) Matt! Matt! Frank! \nINT. LABORATORY - DAY \nLinda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood, his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab wounds with an extension cord around his neck being pulled tight. \nLINDA Jesus! \nLinda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the ground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps back and her lips erupt with blood. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE Figured it out? You were always so clever. \nMatt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda watches him being pulled away. \nLINDA No! \nShe clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to her. \nLINDA (cont'd) Hang on! \nMATT Get out of here! \n", "test3_true": "LINDA (yelling) You won't get away with this. They'll find out about you. They'll hunt you down. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE The villagers with their torches? Lock up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's not gonna happen that way. \nLinda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark. \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) See, I've spent all my time down here thinking up this plan. When they find you, they'll find a pile of charred corpses. The result of a terrible accident, I'm afraid. \nLinda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack of light at the front door. \nLINDA How can you be so brutal? \nSEBASTIAN'S VOICE I guess because I don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore (beat) Remember that first night I was out? I did something bad, just to see if I could get away with it. And when I did, I realized I could have it all. I can kill in broad daylight. And nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost. Anything I desire I can make happen, but not if people know. \nLinda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She pushes through it and slams it behind her. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nLinda pulls Matt along. \nMATT I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs. \nLINDA Just keep going. I'll fix you later. \nINT. CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY \nThe doors explode open. \nINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY \nLinda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier. \nLinda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place. \nLinda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground. \nLINDA Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. \nLinda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and deep. \nMATT He surprised us. We weren't expecting... \nLINDA Shhh. Don't talk. \nBAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks around the room and sees the storage freezer. \nLINDA (cont'd) We gotta move. Hang on. \nLinda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer. \nINT. STORAGE FREEZER \nLinda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks on the door and the jam. \nBAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down next to Matt. \nMATT Lin... \nHe entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having trouble breathing. \nMATT (cont'd) I can't feel anything. \nLinda picks up his hand. Grips it tight. \nLINDA You feel that? \nMatt smiles. \nMATT A little... \nShe rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then probes the wound. \nLINDA Your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals. \nShe looks around. \nLINDA (cont'd) Sutures and thread. \nShe rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. Then she hears the click of the door locking. \nOUTSIDE THE FREEZER \nCLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five degrees, down to negative twenty. \n", "test3_id": 2462}

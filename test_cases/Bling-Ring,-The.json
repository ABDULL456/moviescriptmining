Hurry up. \nThey come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the bottom of the chain link fence. \nShe rolls under, and the others follow. \nA loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house. \nThey've done this before, they have it down. \nOne checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back window open. \nA guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as she climbs inside into a laundry room. \nShe runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they slip inside. Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area. She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is totally cool and composed. \nShe looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye- brow. \nREBECCA Let's go shopping! \nAnd she pulls open the closet door. \nCLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags. \nA drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a Louis Vuitton duffle bag. \n(CONTINUED) 1    CONTINUED:                                                    1 \nAn underwear drawer is opened, and picked through. \nA medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of prescription pills and dumps them in a bag. \nWe see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags. \nRebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a mirror posing, then gets back to it. \nCUT TO: \n2    EXT.

169 INT. HUMMER - DAY 169 
Bryan watches the desert fly outside the window. Nasir stares ahead. The Hummer slows. Bryan sees a vast FLOCK OF SHEEP moving diagonally across the desert in front of them, blocking the road. 
170 EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 170 
In the middle of thousands of sheep, shepherds on camels, and SPRINKLER TRUCKS misting water over the flock moving with ancient slowness across the road.

171 INT. FOUR SEASONS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT 171 
Mr. Janus in the comfy chair. Bennett perches on the edge of the couch. Sydney is next to him. 
BENNETT The lawyers are saying, hey, if you can't trust a Big Five accounting firm. And the accountants are saying, hey, we're not lawyers. Legal didn't understand. Accounting didn't understand. Nobody understood anything. The regulatory bodies had to scratch their heads for a minute that nobody at Connex or Killeen was at fault, but this merger is so balance-positive for American consumers that ultimately Justice wants it, the Federal court wants it. Everybody wants it. Our real client is US, the American people, and we're building our presence in Kazakhstan, so we had to give them a little something meaningful and they got out of our way. Mr. Janus glances at the TV where a pro golfer sinks a long, undulating putt. 
(CONTINUED) 
171 CONTINUED: 171 He looks back at Bennett, just a glance, but it's clear he recognizes in Bennett someone who understands the way the world works and the pressures that he, Mr. Janus, is under. 
MR. JANUS Something besides Dalton? 
BENNETT Unfortunately, yes. And the best option seemed to be a secret deal for excess Iranian pipeline capacity that I uncovered during the diligence, a side deal benefiting the lead lawyer involved in the Connex-Killeen merger approval process. A slow dawning on Sydney's face -- 
SYDNEY What do you think you're doing? 
BENNETT Of course, it's illegal for an American to control these rights -- 
SYDNEY Stop. Right. Now. Bennett and Mr. Janus look at Sydney. 
MR. JANUS Is there something you want to tell me, Syd?

FUNCTIONARY Each container holds over 20 million U.S. dollars of fuel, that's 100 million in total, quite a haul... A wide of the beautiful harbor. Fire boats spray water. And far away, a FLOTILLA of native fishing boats, dhows and sambuks and boums, makes its way out to sea.

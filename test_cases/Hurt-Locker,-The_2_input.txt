--Down the road, sprinting now. Rifle flapping. 
DOWNRANGE 
Sanborn skids to a halt, hands James the cutters. 
James hands his gun to Sanborn, who holds it on the man's forehead. 
James sets to work, applying the cutters to the thick metal holding the bomb to his chest. 
The man is crying now. 
Sanborn sees the Casio. It reads 4:00 
SANBORN Holy shit. You weren't kidding. 
JAMES Nope. 
James works the cutter blade. 
CU: Bolt Cutter. It SCRAPS futilely against the metal. 
JAMES (SOTTO) What is this made out of? 
BLACK SUIT Please. Please. 
SANBORN Case hardened steel. 
James doubles his effort. 
CU: Bolt Cutter. The blade bites the steel, but it doesn't give. 
James squeezes with all his might. 
JAMES Motherfucker. What's our time? 
Sanborn looks at the Casio. 
SANBORN Three minutes. 
JAMES Shit. Ok. Let me think. 
He puts the bolt cutter down on the ground. 
JAMES We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly. 
SANBORN I don't think we have one of those in the truck. 
CU: Casio Watch 2:30. 
JAMES Let's try the back of it. 
Sanborn nods. Keeps the gun on the man's head. His hand is starting to shake. 
James goes behind the man, and rips open the back of his shirt, revealing the back of the bomb. Here too it is a welded band, but the metal looks thinner. Weaker. 
James works it with the cutter. 
CU: Casio Watch 1:30. 
SANBORN We have to bail. 
JAMES Go. I got the suit. 
Sanborn looks at the guy. 
SANBORN What do you want me to do with the pistol? 
JAMES Take it with you, that's a good pistol. 
SANBORN When do you leave? 
JAMES In forty five seconds. 
Sanborn turns, and begins running uprange. 
SANBORN (shouting to soldiers) Get back! Get back! 
The soldiers turn and run. 
James tries and tries to clip the metal. It's a no go. He comes around to face the man. 
JAMES I'm sorry. 
BLACK SUIT Please, please. 
JAMES The metal is too thick. 
BLACK SUIT Help me. Help me! 
James drops the bolt cutter, kneels down in front of the man, and shakes his head. That's it. 
The man understands James' gesture. He reaches forward, grabbing James' suit. 
BLACK SUIT No! No! 
James clubs his hand away. 
JAMES Sorry.

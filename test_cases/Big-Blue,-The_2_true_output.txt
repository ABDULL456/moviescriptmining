He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo. 
JOHANA You look adorable. 
JACQUES Thank you... 
JOHANA (smiling) ... Especially the sneakers. 
JACQUES looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make of her comment.  JOHANA sits down beside him and pours herself a drink.  They touch glasses. 
EXT.  ON PODIUM - NIGHT 
On the podium, NOVELLI, the organizer of the championship, stands in his tuxedo, talking into a microphone.  An older man in a worn out suit, stands next to him. 
NOVELLI Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention, please.  Mr. Andre Bonnet, President of the International Diving Championship Committee, is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving.  This afternoon, our new champion descended to the remarkable depth of 280 feet. 
The audience applauds. 
NOVELLI This young man Tia... 
NOVELLI can't quite read his notes. 
NOVELLI Tiraro... Tirao-re... Moa... 
ANDRE BONNET takes his turn to read the note.  A young Tahitian jumps up, heads for the podium. 
TAHITIAN Tiraero Moameora. 
NOVELLI hesitates to repeat the name. 
NOVELLI ... Let's all give him a big hand. 
The audience cheers and applauds the new champion.  ENZO sits at a table, watching the ceremony. 
ENZO (very sarcastic) A one day hero! 
He gets up and walks out of the room. 
INT.  BAR - NIGHT 
JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting at the bar.  The whiskeys have gone to their heads.  ENZO walks over to them. 
ENZO A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! (to Johana) You ever been to Tahiti? 
JOHANA No. 
ENZO I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees. 
JOHANA smiles and shakes her head. 
JOHANA You forgot the Hula! 
ENZO Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula! 
JOHANA You'll be lovely, but no thanks. (to Jacques) Jacques, would you do a native dance for me? 
JACQUES I don't know how... Excuse me. 
JACQUES leaves the bar.  JOHANA watches him go.  ENZO notices her way of watching him.  He's a little jealous. 
ENZO He looks strange, doesn't he?  Like a baby that just learned to walk. 
JOHANA Have you known him long? 
ENZO Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids. 
JOHANA What was he like, when he was little? 
ENZO Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me. 
JOHANA (amused) I get it, Enzo you were a superior child. 
ENZO Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?! 
She doesn't answer. 
ENZO Forget it, don't think of Jacques as a human being.  He's from another world. 
She smiles. 
JOHANA And just where are you from? 
ENZO Italy! 
EXT.  TERRACE OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT 
ENZO sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace. Beethoven was always a favorite of his. 
JACQUES, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each hand.  He hands ENZO a glass, then takes off his tennis shoes and sits them neatly on the piano. 
ENZO There is nothing like music.  It speaks from the heart.  Can you tell me why we bother diving in the dark, the cold, without ever taking the time to breathe?  Huh?  Can you tell me why we do it?

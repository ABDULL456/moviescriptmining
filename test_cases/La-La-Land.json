It's a CELL PHONE ring. \nMia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench. Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell. \nMIA (CONT'D) Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon... \nShe hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. An awkward silence. Finally -- she presses her fob again. Puts it under her chin this time. A BEEP can be heard.

Remember? \nMANAGER Do I look like I care? Reschedule it. \nMIA But you said -- \nMANAGER And fix your apron. \nWith that, the Manager walks off.

Greg. \nSEBASTIAN How long have...? \nMIA We've been seeing each other for a few months. \nAn awkward beat. They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN is being shot.

I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club. \nMIA Oh yeah? \nSEBASTIAN It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. (then,) It's a samba-tapas place now. \nMIA A what? \nSEBASTIAN Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history. \nMia laughs. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything and they value nothing. \nThey reach a patch of green. Another shoot. A P.A. yells out: \nP.A. Clear the frame! \nMIA (to Sebastian) We need to wait here. \nSEBASTIAN I know. They shoot movies on my street. \"C-stands.\" \"Apple box.\" \"Don't forget to sign out.\" \nMia laughs. A beat. \nA.D. (O.S.) Quiet on set! \nMia and Sebastian watch the cameras roll. Then, in a whisper -- \nSEBASTIAN How'd you get into all this? Revision                          26. \nMIA Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. (a beat; then,) I never knew the world was so big. \nDIRECTOR (O.S.) Cut! \nMia and Sebastian resume walking. Now, at full volume -- \nMIA I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. \nSEBASTIAN Who would you invite to watch? Your parents? \nMIA God no -- I didn't invite anyone.

He's the only musician we can see. The floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people. \nAmong them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. Sebastian sees her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. Mia grins right back, heart swelling... \nA SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. He SINGS. He has a beautiful voice. Mia bobs her head. It's just Keith and Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune... \nAnd then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and -- \nBOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full- fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track. \nMia is taken aback. But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the crowd around her GOES CRAZY... \nKeith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth sounds. We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been transformed beyond recognition. Not a hint of jazz... \nKeith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS are revealed stage-left. The band surges into the song's bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily- clad. \nAnd then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through the dark. The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists... \nMia looks at Sebastian. He's not fighting any of this. He sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her expression... \nShe looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits.

Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice. Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail. She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights and into shadow... \nThe final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. We linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY -- ending the song just as we SMASH CUT TO A TITLE CARD OVER BLACK: \nFALL \nSilence. \nWe take a moment to collect ourselves before -- \n92   OMIT \n93   EXT. / INT.

JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS \nInside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans, older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles. \nMia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar.

Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the bandstand... \nThe combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises from the keys, waves \"thanks\". \nAnd -- just then -- Sebastian appears. Mia looks at him, frozen. \nSEBASTIAN (taking the microphone) Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. (more applause) I don't know, I told him to play \"Jingle Bells\". \nThe crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them -- \n-- and sees Mia. \nShock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first time they've seen each other in years. \nA prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless. \nThen -- forcing himself to keep on a face -- \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Seb's. \nMore applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys. \nHe seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys -- \n-- and finally starts playing. Revision                         82. \nA quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize... \nIt's Mia and Sebastian's song. \nMia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys. This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded. \nWe MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon... \n144   ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time... \nWithin this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece. We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him.

STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY / NIGHT \nMia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all.. \nThis, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted- backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when parking on the lot... \nThe old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss- covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio- backdrop imagination.

We chart the journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old- Hollywood-movie way... \nFinally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacr\u00e9-Coeur and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching before us... And then a sign -- \"CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE\"... \nC148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club. Sebastian plays, on cloud nine... \nC148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes, decked in movie-movie glow. \nWe're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell -- \nD148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another... \nAnd -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like all the stars of the galaxy... \n...they DANCE.

Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than a real romance could ever be... \nWe DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam... \n16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together -- and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as we move in closer on the imagery: \n149   The first home... (16mm) \n150   Mia's pregnancy... (16mm) \n151   The newborn child... (16mm) \n152   The child's first birthday... (16mm) \n153   The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm) \nEverything here glows with the warmth of old home movies... These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE continuing to sway and taking us right up to... \n154   Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother, hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets slightly, everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple hit the road... \n155   ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take a side route, winding up in another part of L.A... \n156   ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo playing somewhere... \n157   ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's club... They sit down to listen... \nAnd then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody... \n...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it. \n", "test3_id": 2606}

{"train": "LA LA LAND \nWritten by \nDamien Chazelle \nFADE IN... \nA sun-blasted sky. We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... \nWe're -- \n1    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY \nCars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam. \nMorning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the distance. \nWe DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after another... \nOne driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO, until finally we begin to hear... \n...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN] \nWe settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing. The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on her radio -- then starts SINGING. \nThen -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. \nOne by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL- FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER... \nDrivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts. We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars, taking the magic in... \nFinally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles -- and the song comes to a dramatic stop. \nFlash title card: \nWINTER \nA1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's \"Japanese Folk Song\". But he keeps stopping it, over and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot. Revision                           2. \nB1   OMIT \nC1   We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green 2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of \"no\" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. Fast, fiery, full of energy -- \nMIA ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. \nMia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: \"Insanity\"... Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. It's a SCRIPT. \nMIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... \nJust then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's too focused on her lines to notice. \nThen -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. \nMia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives... \n2    OMIT \n3    OMIT \n4    INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nMia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as -- \nCUSTOMER #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. \nMIA Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it -- \nCUSTOMER #1 Can I see the carton? \n8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. She hums to herself. \nThe mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the lights. Looks... \nWith the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes her hair... \nThen -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. \nTRACY Holy Mother of God. \nMia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27. \nTRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? \nMIA I wanted to give you an entrance. \nALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? \nMIA Eh... \nALEXIS Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel? \nMIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. \nALEXIS They're the worst. \nMIA I don't know if they were there. \nAs Mia slips away -- \nALEXIS I bet they were. Revision                           6. \nCAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? \nTRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? \nWE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- \nMIA Can't. Working. \nTRACY (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say \"working\"? \nA8   We follow Mia INSIDE her room. She closes the door. Takes a moment. You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on the town is the last thing she wants to do now. \nB8   WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. \nMIA (opening up) Yes? \nTRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming. \nC8   With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- \nTRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. \nMIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. \nTRACY Exactly. Fun. \nShe pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in -- \nTRACY (CONT'D)                        MIA This looks familiar.             I was going to give it back! \nAlexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as she grabs it -- Revision                           7. \nALEXIS Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood clich\u00e9 crammed into a single home? \nTRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest. \nMia rolls her eyes -- and, with that -- \n16    OMIT \n17    OMIT \nA17   OMIT \nB17   OMIT \n18    OMIT \n19    EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT \nMia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. \nA19   And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... \nWithout being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from... \nShe reaches out -- and slowly opens a door... \nAND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO: \n20    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING \nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began with. This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker. \nHe passes Mia's car. She gives him the finger. He drives on, shaking his head... \n21    OMIT \n22    EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER \nSebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. A sign above the door: \"VAN BEEK\". A newer sub-heading below: \"TAPAS & TUNES\". Revision                          10. \nThe door opens. Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. The employees notice him. Recognize him. What is it with that guy...? \n23A   OMIT \n23    INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nSebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. \nSEBASTIAN You gotta stop breaking into my home. \nShe looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister. \nLAURA You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? \nSeeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- \nSEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. \nLAURA Are you serious? \nSEBASTIAN Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. \nLAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. It's a throw rug. \nSEBASTIAN Don't need it. \nLAURA Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? \nSEBASTIAN That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? Revision                        11. \nShe shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side. \nLAURA When are you going to unpack these boxes? \nSEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. \nHe keeps playing, louder now, and we're -- \nB23   OMIT \n24    OMIT \n25    OMIT \n26    OMIT \n27    INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA red-booth bar-and-restaurant. Christmas decorations all over. Sebastian steps in. Immediately beelining over -- \nBOSS Seb. \nSEBASTIAN (putting on a smile) Bill. Thanks for having me back. \nBOSS Your welcome. Stick to the set list. Revision                       14. \nSEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. \nBOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. \nSEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal. \nSebastian sits down at the keys. A WAITRESS passes by. \nWAITRESS Well... Welcome back. \nSEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. \nWith that -- he starts playing \"Jingle Bells\". \n28   INT. RESTAURANT - LATER \nThe restaurant's demographic has changed. It's now younger stragglers wandering in. Sebastian looks beyond bored. He finishes \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\". Zero applause. \nHe begins a new chart: \"Deck the Halls\". But something seems to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... \nAnd then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... \nThe door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the piano. Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND SEBASTIAN'S THEME] \nGradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. We drift away from reality. Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... He concludes his piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz now, as we pull back to real life... \n...and see the Boss looking on in scorn. Revision                        15. \nSebastian finishes. Silence. Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. Sebastian looks up for a second -- and sees her. They look at one another. Just a moment. \nThen -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. Then, we get closer -- and realize: \nBOSS ...every goddamned night. \nSebastian is silent. Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- \nSEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- \nBOSS Too late. You're done. \nSEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. You know that. \nBOSS (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? \nWith that, the Boss walks off. We linger on Sebastian. Anger giving way -- to hurt. He starts hurrying toward the door. \nBACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. She watches Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and -- \nMIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- \nSebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at each other. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights stretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- share a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW... \nMia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Mia shakes her head: \"Nope\". They make the road their own, growing more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find -- \n...that they can really dance together. \nJust as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer and closer, looking at each other almost giddily... \n...a sound cuts through. It's a CELL PHONE ring. \nMia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench. Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell. \nMIA (CONT'D) Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah, I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon... \nShe hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. An awkward silence. Finally -- she presses her fob again. Puts it under her chin this time. A BEEP can be heard. They see her Prius. \nMIA (CONT'D) Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride to your car? \nSEBASTIAN No, that's fine... Thanks... \nMIA ...Ok... \nNot sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. Waves. \nMIA (CONT'D) Night. \nSebastian waves back. Mia drives off. Fast. Silence... Revision                        23. \nLooking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be, Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down. \nA37   Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera -- right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. He pulls out his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all. \n38    OMIT \n39    INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nCLOSE on -- \nCUSTOMER Are these pastries gluten-free? \nMia's at work. A typically chaotic day. \nMIA No... \nCUSTOMER What?? I want a refund. \nMia nods, heads to the Manager -- \nMANAGER You're closing up Friday. \nMIA I have an audition. Remember? \nMANAGER Do I look like I care? Reschedule it. \nMIA But you said -- \nMANAGER And fix your apron. \nWith that, the Manager walks off. Mia is silent for a moment -- wants to talk back but needs this job -- then turns -- and sees Sebastian at the counter. \nMIA ...Hi. (then) What are you doing here? \nSEBASTIAN Meetings. Studio heads. Revision                       24. \nMIA Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot? \nSEBASTIAN Piece of cake. \nMia looks at him. He's sweating through his shirt. A beat. \nMIA (CONT'D) Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things. \nShe and Sebastian stop. Peer inside the stage. \nMIA (CONT'D) I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. Revision                        27. \nThey resume walking. \nD40   CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the bright blue sky. \nSEBASTIAN ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. \nMIA Well it doesn't need more actresses. \nSEBASTIAN You're not just an actress. \nMIA What do you mean, \"just an actress\"? \nSEBASTIAN You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. \nMIA That is not what I said. \nSEBASTIAN You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are. \nMIA Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible. \nSEBASTIAN All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history. \nMIA Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. \nSebastian laughs. \nMIA (CONT'D) Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you... \nSEBASTIAN Yeah? Revision                       28. \nMIA I hate jazz. \nSebastian stops. Turns to her. \nSEBASTIAN What does that mean? \"I hate jazz\"? \nMIA It means when I listen to it I don't like it. \nSEBASTIAN But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying \"I hate animals\". \nMIA I do hate some animals. \nSEBASTIAN Do you need to be anywhere right now? \nMia looks at him. We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. And we're in -- \n41   INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - DAY \n-- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET... \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other. \nMIA I thought it was just Kenny G. \nSEBASTIAN ...What? \nMia looks at him. Already knows just how to get to him. \nMIA I associate it with facials. It's relaxing. \nSEBASTIAN It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision                           29. \nMIA (laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. \n...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. The feeling that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love... \nHe gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. Dances with an OLD COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a dream. There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure if this dream will sustain. But for now, it's a beautiful feeling... \nThe MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT. \n45   EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY \nA Pasadena building. As Mia approaches the door, another cell ring. It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call: \nMIA (CONT'D) Hi, Mom! \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) Hi, sweetie. How are you? \nMIA Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oh my God! You're going to be on TV?? \nMIA Well -- it's not picked up yet. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) Not picked up? \nMIA First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision                           32. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) And you're in the pilot? \nMIA Well, no, I have a call-back. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week? \nMIA It's another audition. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV... \nMIA ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. What channel? ABC? HBO? \nMIA Oxygen. \nMIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oxygen? \nMIA You know what, I have to go. I love you. \nShe hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Enters the building. \n46   INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMia sits, starts reviewing her script. \nLooks around her -- the room is filled with ACTRESSES silently MOUTHING THEIR LINES. It's a bizarre sight: a dozen women moving their mouths, with no sound coming out at all. \nWhat's more, they're all in variations of the same type of costume: Michelle Pfeiffer's leather jacket from Dangerous Minds. \nA few stare at Mia, sizing her up. In the corner, another one of them GRUNTS while performing stretches. Then -- a DOOR to the side opens, and Mia can hear -- \nDIRECTOR (O.S.) ...We'll be seeing you very soon. Revision                        33. \nAn ACTRESS exits. Absolutely beaming. And then, a bored voice -- \nASSISTANT Mia Dolan? \n47   INT. AUDITION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMia steps in. The pilot's DIRECTOR is seated at a table, looking in his folder at Mia's head-shot. He looks up at Mia. \nDIRECTOR Whenever you're ready. \nMia breathes in. Heart pounding. Sweat percolating. Has been practicing this for days now. \nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. \nHONKING outside the nearest window. It's a honk we recognize: \nTRACY ...Is that gonna happen every time? \nMIA (glowing) I think so. \nA60   OMIT \n61    EXT. MIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nMia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his arms. They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been separated for years. Sebastian drives off -- when -- \nMIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! \nThe car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the opposite direction. Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks up laughing. A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on: Revision                          40. \nSUMMER \nThe MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES: \n62    -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in BUNKER HILL... \n63    -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT- ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms... \n65    -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the \"TAPAS & TUNES\" sign. Excitedly tries to deface it. Mia, aghast, pulls him back... \n66    -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at the tiny forest... \nA66   -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... \n67    OMIT \n64    -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food... \n68    -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into a tipsy, love-soaked dance... \n69    OMIT \nInterspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES: \n1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old lamps and Art Deco hotels. It's a gorgeous city, and the music only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to... \n70    INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT \nA Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a blast. The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her heart out. She shoots looks at Sebastian. He laughs, plays out for her. The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure, unadulterated JOY... \nThe song ends. Sebastian rises, joins Mia. They sit down as the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss. \nKEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? \nMia and Sebastian look up, startled. A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. Tall, fierce eyes. This is KEITH. \nSEBASTIAN Keith? Revision                       41. \nKEITH Holy shit. Come here, man. \nSebastian gets up. Gives him a hug. But Mia can sense an unease in Sebastian's eyes. It's a strained hug. \nSEBASTIAN This is Mia. Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together. \nKEITH                           MIA Hey, Mia.                         Hey... \nSebastian sits back down. Wants to end the conversation. \nKEITH So how've you been? \nSEBASTIAN Great. You? \nSEBASTIAN You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name \"Bird\" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. \"Chicken on a Stick\". \nMIA No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places. \nSEBASTIAN It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history. \nMIA Make your own history. \nSebastian looks at her. Appreciates that line. A beat. Then -- \nSEBASTIAN Your play's incredible. \nMia smiles. He approaches her, sits by her side. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision                    44. \nMIA I'm doing that. \nThey laugh. \nMIA (CONT'D) So who was that guy at the Lighthouse? \nSEBASTIAN ...Which guy? \nMIA The one who offered you a gig. \nSEBASTIAN You mean Keith? He's the worst. \nMIA Why was it weird between you two? \nSEBASTIAN It's always weird with him. \nMIA He did offer you a job. \nSEBASTIAN Right... \nMIA Are you going to call him? \nSEBASTIAN No. \nA beat. \nMIA Ok... \nA moment passes. They lie down, side by side. \nSEBASTIAN Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- (Mia rolls her eyes) -- and your play is going to be a triumph. \nShe looks at him. He looks at her. A shared smile. \nAnd on that -- Revision                       45. \n72   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nThe next morning. Sebastian is in bed. Hears snatches of Mia's voice -- she's on her phone in the other room: \nMIA (O.S.) ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... (then,) He's great... He's going to open his own jazz club. It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... He's figuring it out... Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately... \nSebastian listens. Takes it in. \nMIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's Dad? \nOn Sebastian. He thinks... \n73   INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY \nSebastian enters. Keith's combo is assembled. \nIt's a sign-up practice room in the West Valley. There's a drummer, electric bassist, and trumpeter: COLE, MALCOLM and TOM. They're more polished in their looks than Sebastian. Well-groomed beards, tighter jeans. \n77   OMIT Revision                      48. \n77pt   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nThe door opens. Mia enters. Takes a deep breath. Hears piano. Steps forward and sees Sebastian at his piano -- playing a melody we've heard before. [CITY OF STARS AS DUET] \nShe smiles. Sebastian begins to SING. Mia sits down beside him and begins to SING as well. They share a duet -- simple, unaffected, hopeful -- the music just perhaps suggesting their uncertainty about what they might be about to do... \nAs the vocals give way to instrumentation, we're -- \nA77    OMIT \nB77    OMIT \nC77    OMIT \n78     INT. DINER - DAY \nSebastian and Keith hunched over paperwork. Sebastian signs... \nA78    INT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY \nMia handing the Manager her apron. She's done with the job... \n80     INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY \nThe band rehearsing in their new PRACTICE SPACE. We see Sebastian play, see Keith sing this time... \n79     INT. CAFE - DAY \nMia hunched over her script, obsessively fine-tuning it... \n81     OMIT \n82     OMIT \n83     INT. DESIGNER CLOTHING STORE - DAY \nSebastian gets dressed up in a new suit... \n84     INT. BLACK-BOX THEATER - DAY \nWe follow Mia through a BLACK-BOX THEATER in North Hollywood. The space is small, simple -- but perfect. We see her haggle with the OWNER -- and then light up. They shake hands... \n85     INT. GREEN ROOM - EVENING \nSebastian and the band in a green room, waiting. Sebastian's wearing the new suit. Looking sharper... Revision                          49. \n86    INT. VINTAGE SHOP - DAY \nMia looking for PROPS. Another wild assortment -- a TOP HAT, a CANE, a DIORAMA of London, rolled-up MAPS, an old GLOBE... \n87    OMIT \n88    INT. APARTMENT - DAY \nWe MOVE IN on a laptop. On it a YOUTUBE video plays -- an interview with Sebastian, Keith and the rest of the band... \n89    EXT. RIALTO - DAY \nMia drives by the Rialto theater. It's now CLOSED... \n90    INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMia sits on the floor, penciling out drawings for her play. Costume and poster sketches scattered by her feet. She's tired. The clock on the wall reads: 10:54pm. \nA90   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMia gets into bed. Checks her phone. Turns off the light. \nCLOSE on Mia. She looks tired. A bit weathered. She's nursing a green tea across from Laura. They've finished eating. \nLAURA Look at him -- watch -- \nMia glances out the window. A MAN in his early 40's has just parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed. \nMia smiles. The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and kisses Laura. This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend. \nHARRY Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything? \nMIA Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision                       52. \nLAURA Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car. \nHarry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. Laura looks at Mia. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now? \nMIA I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure... \nA moment passes. \nLAURA You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter? \nMIA Nothing... \nLAURA You miss him. \nMIA I guess. I'm adapting. \nLAURA (nods; then,) I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other. \nMIA He told me. \nLAURA I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. You know that? \nLaura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned... \nMIA Do you think he's happy? \nLAURA Is he happy? \nMIA I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision                        53. \nLaura shrugs. \nLAURA Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him. \nShe notices Harry through the window, returning. Her thoughts drift. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Dreams change. \nA beat. She looks back at Mia. Sees her worry. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon. \nHarry rejoins the table. Hands Laura a sponge cake. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I told you not to get me anything! \nHARRY Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess. \nLAURA No -- I changed my mind. \nThey laugh. Kiss. Tender. Loving. Mia watches... \n94   INT. DINER - NIGHT \nMIA To Boise? Revision                     56. \nSEBASTIAN Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. \nMia laughs. \nMIA Wish I could. \nA beat. \nSEBASTIAN Why can't you? \nMIA Come to Boise? \nSEBASTIAN Yeah. \nMIA Because I have to rehearse. \nSEBASTIAN Can't you rehearse anywhere? \nShe looks at him. \nMIA You mean anywhere you are? \nSEBASTIAN ...I -- I guess... \nMIA Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... \nSEBASTIAN Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other. \nMIA I know, but when are you done? \nSEBASTIAN ...What do you mean? \nMIA When are you done with the tour? Revision                   57. \nSEBASTIAN But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. \nMia looks at him. Doesn't seem to understand. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record. \nBeat. Mia takes this in. \nMIA So it's...the long haul? \nSEBASTIAN ...What does that mean? \nMIA I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. \nSEBASTIAN What did you think I was going to do? \nMIA I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- \nSEBASTIAN You didn't think we'd be successful. \nMIA No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? \nSEBASTIAN Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. \nBeat. \nMIA Do you like the music you're playing? \nSEBASTIAN I don't know how that matters. \nMIA It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision                    58. \nSEBASTIAN Do you like the music I'm playing? \nSebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia grabbing her things. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Wait -- \nBut she's out the door. It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the burnt apple pie from the oven. \nAnd on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO -- \n97   OMIT \n98   EXT. THEATER - DAY \nA poster, placed on the front of the theater we saw before. A title. A name below it: \"MIA DOLAN.\" And a word: \"TONIGHT.\" \nWe spot Mia, carrying a box of props. She enters the theater. And we're -- \n99   INT. THEATER - DAY \nThe empty theater. Dark. Silent. Then -- a light turns on. Mia steps in. We stay WIDE. She seems small from this vantage point, surrounded by her props and backdrops. She takes a moment. Looks at all the empty seats. Revision                       61. \nTakes a deep breath. Nervous. And then, nodding to herself -- you can do this -- she starts setting up... \n100   INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY \nA BLAST of music. The Messengers have just finished a rehearsal. Sebastian packs his stuff, heads toward the exit, nodding to the others -- \nSEBASTIAN                          COLE See you tomorrow.                 See ya. \n-- when -- \nKEITH You good for tonight, right? \nSebastian stops. Looks at Keith. \nSEBASTIAN ...Tonight? \nKEITH Seven. The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. \nA beat. Sebastian is confused. \nSEBASTIAN I thought that was next Thursday. \nKEITH No. It's tonight. \nWe linger on Sebastian for a moment... \nKEITH (CONT'D) Is that ok? \n101   EXT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY \nSebastian stands out front. Checks his watch. Thinks... \n102   OMIT \n103   INT. THEATER / INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nPeople are shuffling into the theater. We DRIFT BACKSTAGE. Mia, now in a male suit and tie, watches behind a curtain. Checks her phone. 7:04. Breathes in. Nervous, and alone... \nShe turns. Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. He heads to a switch, and the lights GO DOWN. Revision                        62. \nYou can hear the murmurs beyond the curtain. The audience, expecting. Mia tries to get her nerves under control. She can do this... Sets her phone aside -- one last breath -- \n-- and walks out. \n104   OMIT \n105   OMIT \n106   INT. PHOTO STUDIO - NIGHT \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry -- \n-- and KISSES her. The kind of kiss that might once have swept her off her feet. He starts to move with her... \n...starts to DANCE -- but -- \nMIA Stop -- \nShe pulls away. Steps back. Sebastian looks at her. Unmoored. \nSEBASTIAN I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- \nMIA It's over. \nShe doesn't say the words with any anger. Just acceptance. \nSEBASTIAN (a beat; then --) ...What do you mean? \nMIA I'm done embarrassing myself. \nSEBASTIAN You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision                     65. \nMIA No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. \nShe says this as though just realizing it. Sebastian looks at her. A moment passes. He doesn't know what to say now. \nMIA (CONT'D) I'm gonna go home for a while. \nSEBASTIAN ...This is home. \nMIA Not anymore. \nSebastian is silent now. A tear in his eye. He clenches his jaw. Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and drives off. \nSebastian lingers. Doesn't move. Silence. Then, music. Soft, melancholy, just piano, as... \n111    OMIT \nA111   OMIT \n...WE DISSOLVE TO: \n112    OMIT \n113    EXT. MIA'S CAR - DAY \nMia drives, boxes stacked in the back. \nA113   She gets on the 405... Heading out of the city... \n114    EXT. / INT. MIA'S HOUSE - NEVADA - DUSK \nMia steps inside a modest house. Her MOM is by the door. Hugs her. Her DAD stands by the hallway. \n115    INT. MIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DUSK \nMia enters her old bedroom. Slides in a suitcase. Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. Looks around. Old photos. Old soccer trophies. She sits down on the bed. Takes a breath. And, finally, we're... \n116    EXT. ORANGE GROVE - DAY \nLaura and Harry's ENGAGEMENT PARTY. We're outside, in a sun- dappled grove. A small gathering. Revision                       66. \nSebastian plays a baby grand piano -- the source, we realize, of the music we've been hearing... \nAs he watches   Laura dance with her new fianc\u00e9 -- this woman he has known for   so many years as a romantic cynic, now once again full of   all the youthful innocence of first love -- his thoughts seem   to drift. The music comes to a close and... \n117   LATER: Sebastian with Laura, by the orange trees... \nLAURA You remember the McKenzies? \nMIA I'm ok. \nMIA'S DAD You look hungry. \nMIA I'm good... \nA moment. Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits back down across from her. \nMIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten. \nMia laughs. A moment. \nMIA You took down the swing. \nMIA'S DAD She made me. \nA smile. \nMIA'S DAD (CONT'D) I've still got all your old tapes. \nMIA Oh God. Throw those away. \nMIA'S DAD Never. \nJust then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up, eyebrow raised. Mia turns, hearing it as well. The HONKING is nearby -- just outside... \nMia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. Ears perk up. She's heard the honking before: Revision                         69. \nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. \nMIA'S DAD (CONT'D) What the hell...? \nDisbelief on Mia's face. It can't be. She heads to the nearest window. There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR. \nA NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. Sebastian sees Mia. They lock eyes. And on that -- \n120   EXT. MIA'S HOME / SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nMia and Sebastian stand next to his car. \nMIA Why did you come here? \nSEBASTIAN Because I have good news. \nMIA Ok... \nSEBASTIAN Amy Brandt. The casting director. \nMIA I know who she is. \nSEBASTIAN She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. \nHe's brimming over with excitement. But Mia just shakes her head. \nMIA I'm not going. \nSEBASTIAN ...Excuse me? \nMIA I'm -- no... That will kill me. \nSEBASTIAN That's it? \nMIA Yes. Revision                    70. \nSEBASTIAN So you're happy here? \nMIA I'm happier. \nSEBASTIAN Why won't you come? \n128   EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY \nWe're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. A new title card: \nFive years later... \nWe TILT down to the studio's entryway. A CAR enters. \nA WOMAN steps out. We don't see her face. We FOLLOW her from behind. She walks elegantly, poised. The wind picks up a strand of her hair. She makes her way down side-streets we've seen before, past Parisian-style fa\u00e7ades. Then enters a COFFEE SHOP we recognize... \n129   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nThe eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. She reaches the counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE: \nMIA Hi... Iced coffee, please. \nMIA looks different. Different haircut, different way of handling herself. \nThe BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee -- Revision                      77. \nNEW MANAGER On us. \nMIA No, no, that's fine. \nMia hands over a few dollar bills. Then drops another bill into the tip jar. The Barista smiles. \n130   EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER \nMia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away... \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories. We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in... \n131   INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY \n...a small jazz club. Simple, tasteful, cool. Stone arches in 1940's style. The seats close to the band, the piano in the center. The club has the same old-school character as the Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. It's polished, inviting. \nThe place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the lowest keys once more, then the highest. Then turns and -- \nSEBASTIAN Alright, I'm done. (gets up) Harris did a nice job with it. \nEMPLOYEE Took him long enough. \nSebastian smiles. \nSEBASTIAN No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. \nEMPLOYEE I got a check for you to sign. \nSEBASTIAN How'd we do last month? \nEMPLOYEE Not too bad. Revision                          78. \nSEBASTIAN (as he signs the check) Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight. \nEMPLOYEE See you tonight. \n132   EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY \nMia pulls into the driveway. \n133   INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY \nShe steps inside. Flowers and cards. We glimpse cursive \"CONGRATULATIONS\" written on a few of them. A stack of scripts on a nearby table. Her name visible. She drops her things, spots someone, goes in to kiss him. A long, tender, loving embrace, as we pull back... \n...and see that it's not Sebastian. \nIt's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. He and Mia kiss again. And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg, is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL... \nThen -- David's ears perk up. He hears something. MUSIC... \nHe looks around. Doesn't see the source. Heads to the end of the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a building. Seems to be where the music's coming from... \nMia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door... \n...and then FREEZES. \nThe sign on the door reads: \"SEB'S\". It's written the way she drew it for Sebastian, years ago... \nComing up to her side, oblivious -- \nDAVID (CONT'D) This looks fun. \nDavid edges past Mia. Glimpses the bar inside. Turns to her, inviting -- \nDAVID (CONT'D) Come on... \nMia doesn't know what to say. She follows David... Revision                          81. \n143   INT. JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS \nInside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans, older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles. \nMia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. Recognizes a stool by the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's... \nDAVID (CONT'D) Mia? \nShe turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the bandstand... \nThe combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises from the keys, waves \"thanks\". \nAnd -- just then -- Sebastian appears. Mia looks at him, frozen. \nSEBASTIAN (taking the microphone) Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. (more applause) I don't know, I told him to play \"Jingle Bells\". \nThe crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them -- \n-- and sees Mia. \nShock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first time they've seen each other in years. \nA prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless. \nThen -- forcing himself to keep on a face -- \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Welcome to Seb's. \nMore applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys. \nHe seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys -- \n-- and finally starts playing. Revision                         82. \nA quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize... \nIt's Mia and Sebastian's song. \nMia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys. This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded. \nWe MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon... \n144   ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time... \nWithin this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece. We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and -- \nMIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- \n-- but instead of brushing past her -- \n", "test1_input": "MIA \"Curt\"? \nSEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision                       18. \nMIA Ok. \nSEBASTIAN But requesting \"I Ran\" from a serious musician -- it's too far. \nMIA My God. Did you just call yourself \"a serious musician\"? \nSEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. \nMIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? \nSEBASTIAN Why? \nMIA Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. \nSEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything? \nMIA Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. \nSEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. \nSINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. Second set. \nSebastian looks at Mia. She smirks. Pleased. The Singer walks off. \nSEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. \nMIA He just told you what to do. \nSEBASTIAN I let him. Revision                          19. \nA beat. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? \nMIA Mia. \nSEBASTIAN Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. \nHe heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: \nSINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... \n36   EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT \nThe party's finished. Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys, as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in the back, waiting, is Mia. She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- \nCARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. \nMia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. \nCARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded. \nMIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! \nSebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised. \nSEBASTIAN You again. \nMIA Did you just get your keys? \nSebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off -- \nSEBASTIAN ...Yeah. Revision                       20. \nMIA Can you grab mine? \n", "test1_true": "MIA The Prius. \nA beat. Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. Motions to the Valet: Sorry. One second. Looks. All the keys are Prius keys. \nMIA (CONT'D) The one with the green ribbon. \nAnother beat. Sebastian finds it. Grabs it. \n37   EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. Mia aims her key fob. No beep. Sebastian points his own keys, also aiming for a beep. Silence. They've been at this for a while. \nMIA (CONT'D) (almost tripping in her heels) Shit... \nSEBASTIAN Those look comfortable. \nMIA They are...n't. \nA beat. She aims again. No beep. \nMIA (CONT'D) Thank you for saving the day back there. \nSEBASTIAN You didn't give me much of a choice. \nMIA Strange that we keep running into each other. \nSEBASTIAN It is strange. Maybe it means something. \nMIA I doubt it. \nSEBASTIAN Yeah I don't think so either. Revision                        21. \nOn that, Mia aims again. As always -- no beep. Noticing -- \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Put the clicker under your chin. \nMIA What? \nSebastian demonstrates with his fob. He looks idiotic. \nSEBASTIAN It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. \nMIA Uh-huh. \nSEBASTIAN You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. \nMIA Oh my God. \nJust then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you can see. It's the most romantic sight imaginable. They look at each other. A beat. And then -- \nMIA (CONT'D) Eh. \nThey walk on, the lights shimmering behind. \nSEBASTIAN Not much to look at. \nMIA Agreed. I've seen better. \nAnd on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT] \nMia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's \"no big deal\", nothing they haven't seen or felt before -- because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them... \nOf course, the music, swelling and building, suggests otherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes for flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as she slips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious... Revision                        22. \nHe moves his foot. She moves hers. They look at each other again. Still suspicious... \nHe moves again. She moves again. They seem to be moving in sync -- without their even wanting to... \nAnd -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE... \n", "test1_id": 2604, "test2_input": "FIANCEE Probably work. \nJOSH Yeah, I'll have to call you back. (closes and pockets his phone) So, yeah, we love it. \nAwkward silence. Mia hasn't spoken a word. \n52   EXT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nSebastian paces. People shuffle in. He looks. No sign of Mia. \n53   INT. JAR - NIGHT \nMidway through the meal. \nMia is bored, restless, uneasy. \nJOSH (CONT'D) One word for you. Nicaragua. \nGREG I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing? Revision                          36. \nJOSH Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable. \nMia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her fading away. And then she hears it -- coming from the restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody we now know so well... Her and Sebastian's song. \nShe FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her... \nA few seconds pass. And then she can't deny it any longer. It's clear as day to her now. She rises from her seat -- \nGREG Mia? \n-- looks at Greg -- \nMIA I'm sorry. \n-- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in -- \n-- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can. \n54   EXT. JAR - NIGHT \nThe MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting Mia's spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress, for once absolutely sure of what she's doing... \n55   INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nInside the Rialto, Sebastian settling into his seat, the show about to begin. He's visibly disappointed that he's alone. The lights dim. Projector light cuts through the darkness. And then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle... \nHe looks. The figure turns. Looks at him. It's Mia. \nAnd, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector   light, her green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen   behind her like a great piece of back-projection, she looks   more beautiful than ever right now. A true old-fashioned screen   siren. \nSebastian's eyes go wide. He's surprised. And thrilled. He waves. Mia hurries toward him. Takes the seat next to his, as Rebel Without a Cause begins... Revision                           37. \n56    INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - LATER \nHalf an hour has passed. The movie plays, lights flickering on Mia and Sebastian's darkened faces. \nHe puts his arm on the armrest, she moves hers nervously. \nHe scoots to his right, she scoots back. \nShe edges her elbow onto the armrest, he moves his arm. \nInch by inch, their bodies grow closer. Hands approaching, breaths quickening, hearts pounding... \n...until finally their hands touch... \nAnd then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem about to kiss -- \n-- burn marks streak their way across the image. \n", "test2_true": "Silence. The lights go on. Mia and Sebastian turn around. AUDIENCE MEMBERS start murmuring. Sebastian can barely believe his bad luck. \nBut then Mia turns to him. Energized. \nMIA (CONT'D) I have an idea. \n57    EXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nSebastian's car, traveling up a winding road, stars glittering above it, the lights of Los Angeles glittering below it. The sky is a deep, painted blue. Music plays... [PLANETARIUM] \nThe car is bending around the turns, making its way up to... \nA57   ...the real Griffith Observatory. There, our MUSIC crests. Our two characters get out of the car and wander, searching for an open entrance. They find one -- and sneak in... \n58    INT. GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS \nThey ascend a staircase. Make their way past the exhibits -- the Tesla coil shooting off electric bolts. \nThey reach the pendulum, gaze up at the mural above it, look at one another. Circle the pendulum, and then -- so tenderly, so nervously... Revision                          38. \n...they begin to DANCE. \nThis is a dance that fulfills all the promise in their earlier duet. They circle the floor, gently and gracefully. The music BUILDS, and they drift into... \nA58   ...the PLANETARIUM. It's darkened, empty. Mia removes her shoes, feels the soft carpet under her feet. Turns on the projector. The screen STARTS TO GLOW. She and Sebastian take in the sight -- the STARS and GALAXIES... \nEnchanted, they look at one another, the lights from the screen reflected on their faces. They approach, as though about to kiss... When -- \n-- Mia's shoes LIFT UP. Float toward the ceiling -- toward the star-filled screen. She and Sebastian trade looks. Realize. And then they too begin to FLOAT... \n...RISING from the floor, nothing stopping them. SOARING past the views of comets and moons and nebulae. Eyes wide, their emotions seized, as they HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT... \nAnd so unspools a gravity-free dance. \nMia and Sebastian SPIN and TWIRL through the planetarium as though they themselves were in outer space, flying through the cosmos. The music carries them higher and higher, and their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until, finally... \n...the music SOFTENS. \nMia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. They land on a pair of seats. \nThere, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they turn and look into each other's eyes. The music picks back up for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie- movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion -- \n-- LOCK LIPS. \nIt's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first blush. A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory. \nOn this triumphant moment... \n...we IRIS FADE OUT. Revision                      39. \n59    OMIT \n60    INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMia's scribbling in a notebook. It's dialogue. We see character headings, scene headings. Seems to be some kind of a script... \nTRACY (O.S.) What's that? \nMia turns. Tracy has wandered in -- pajamas, eating cereal. \nTRACY (CONT'D) Is that a script? \nMIA It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself. \nALEXIS (O.S.) (chiming in from her bedroom) A play? You better give us roles! \nMIA Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... \nA beat -- and then -- \n", "test2_id": 2605, "test3_input": "125   INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY \nMia and Sebastian are seated. Waiting. The DOOR opens. An ACTRESS exits. A second later -- \nASSISTANT #2 Mia? \nMia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in. \n126   INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY \nIn the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. Seated behind her is the director, FRANK. \nAMY BRANDT                       MIA Hi, Mia.                        Hi. \nAMY BRANDT I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you. \nMia nods. Smiles. A moment. \nAMY BRANDT (CONT'D) The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script. Revision                        73. \nFRANK We want to build the character with you. It's a process. Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot. \nMIA ...Ok. \nAMY BRANDT So why don't you just tell us a story? \nMIA ...About...? \nAMY BRANDT About anything. \nMia nods again. A moment. \nAMY BRANDT (CONT'D) Whenever you're ready. \nMia thinks. She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. It seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to choke the audition. We fear she may botch this completely... \nA126   WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. On edge... Worried... \nB126   WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... Brandt and Frank waiting... \nMIA My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... \nShe pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION] \nYes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch to song signals just that. Mia's nerves fade away -- all the accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful... \nShe uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion -- all the so-called \"fools\" who take the plunge. She sings about them and for them. This is why Mia does what she does -- why she simply has no choice... \nThe song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then... Revision                     74. \n...WE DISSOLVE TO: \n127   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY \nMia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched behind them. The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk. \nSebastian looks at Mia. A moment passes. \nSEBASTIAN When do you find out? \nMIA They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out. \nSEBASTIAN You're going to get it. \nMIA No, I'm not. \nSEBASTIAN You are. I know these things. \nA beat. \n", "test3_true": "Sebastian looks at her. \nSEBASTIAN Griffith Park. \nMIA I mean -- where are we? \nSEBASTIAN I know... (beat) I don't know. \nMIA What do we do? \nSEBASTIAN I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this -- \nMIA If I get this -- Revision                           75. \nSEBASTIAN When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got. \nBeat. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) It's your dream. \nMIA What are you going to do? \nSEBASTIAN I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know... \nA moment. Mia nods. Sebastian looks at her again. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now. \nMia smiles. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Right? \nMIA Right. \nAnother moment. And then, finally -- \nSEBASTIAN I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. \nMia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. She nods. \nMIA You know I'm always going to love you. \nSEBASTIAN I'm always going to love you too. \nBeat. Sebastian looks up at the Observatory. \nSEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Look at this view. \nMIA (playfully) I've seen better.

Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. We linger here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond. \nAnd then, ever so slowly... \n...we FADE TO: \nWINTER \nA palm tree, a cloudless sky. We PULL BACK -- to reveal it's all painted... \n", "test3_id": 2606}

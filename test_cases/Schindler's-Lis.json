{"test1_input": "INT. FACTORY - DAY \nAnother machine starts up. Another. Another. \nEXT. PEACE SQUARE - DAY \nStern with a woman at the head of a line. The clerk affixes the all-important blue sticker to her work card. \nINT. FACTORY DAY - DAY \nThree hundred Jewish laborers, men and women, work at the long tables, at the presses, the latches, the furnaces, turning out field kitchenware and mess kits. \nFew glance up from their work at Schindler, the big gold party pin stuck into his lapel, as he moves through the place, his place, his factory, in full operation. \nHe climbs the stairs to the offices where several secretaries process Armaments orders. He gestures to Stern, at a desk covered with ledgers, to join him in his office. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe accountant follows Schindler into the office. \nSCHINDLER Sit down. \nSchindler goes to the wall of windows, his favorite place in the world, and looks down at all the activity below. He pours two drinks from a decanter and, turning back, holds one out to Stern. Stern, of course, declines. Schinder groans. \nSCHINDLER Oh, come on. \nHe comes over and puts the drink in Stern's hand, moves behind his desk and sits. \nSCHINDLER My father was fond of saying you need three things in life. A good doctor, a forgiving priest and a clever accountant. The first two... \nHe dismisses them with a shrug; he's never had much use for either. But the third -- he raises his glass to the accountant. Stern's glass stays in his lap. \nSCHINDLER (long sufferingly) Just pretend for Christ's sake. \nStern slowly raises his glass. \nSCHINDLER Thank you. \nSchindler drinks; Stern doesn't. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nKlonowska, wearing a man's silk robe, traipses past the remains of a party to the front door. Opening it reveals a nice looking, nicely dressed woman. \nKLONOWSKA Yes? \nA series of realizations is made by each of them, quickly, silently, ending up with Klonowska looking ill. \nSCHINDLER (O.S.) Who is it? \nINT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nSchindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his wife. \nBehind him, through a doorway, Klonowska can be seen hurriedly gathering her things. \nSCHINDLER She's so embarrassed -- look at her -- \nEmilie begrudges him a glance to the bedroom, catching the girl just as she looks up -- embarrassed. \nSCHINDLER You know what, you'd like her. \nEMILIE Oskar, please -- \nSCHINDLER What -- \nEMILIE I don't have to like her just because you do. It doesn't work that way. \nSCHINDLER You would, though. That's what I'm saying. \nHis face is complete innocence. It's the first thing she fell in love with; and perhaps the thing that keeps her from killing him now. Klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly self-conscious. \nKLONOWSKA Goodbye. It was a pleasure meeting you. \nShe shakes Emilie's limp hand. Schindler sees her to the door, lets her out and returns to the table, smiling to himself. Emilie's glancing around at the place. \nEMILIE You've done well here. \nHe nods; he's proud of it. He studies her. \nSCHINDLER You look great. \nEXT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThey emerge from the building in formal clothes, both of them looking great. It's wet and slick; the doorman offers Emilie his arm. \nDOORMAN Careful of the pavement -- \nSCHINDLER -- Mrs. Schindler. \nThe doorman shoots a glance to Schindler that asks, clearly, Really? Schindler opens the passenger door of the Mercedes for his wife, and the doorman helps her in. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "SCHINDLER Mrs. Schindler. \nThe maitre 'd tries to bury his surprise. He's almost successful. \nINT. RESTAURANT - LATER - NIGHT \nNo fewer than four waiters attend them -- refilling a glass, sliding pastries onto china, lighting Schindler's cigarette, raking crumbs from the table with little combs. \nEMILIE It's not a charade, all this? \nSCHINDLER A charade? How could it be a charade? \nShe doesn't know, but she does know him. And all these signs of apparent success just don't fit his profile. Schindler lets her in on a discovery. \nSCHINDLER There's no way I could have known this before, but there was always something missing. In every business I tried, I see now it wasn't me that was failing, it was this thing, this missing thing. Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it, because you can't create this sort of thing. And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure. \nHe waits for her to guess what the thing is. His looks says, It's so simple, how can you not know? \nEMILIE Luck. \nSCHINDLER War. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \n\"Gloomy Sunday\" from a combo on a stage. Schindler and Emilie dancing. Pressed against her -- both have had a few -- he can feel her laugh to herself. \nSCHINDLER What? \nEMILIE I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good. \nHe smiles, even as his eyes roam the room and find and meet the eyes of a German girl dancing with another man. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT \nSchindler and Emilie lounging in bed, champagne bottle on the nightstand. Long silence before -- \nEMILIE Should I stay? \nSCHINDLER (pause) It's a beautiful city. \nThat's not the answer she's looking for and he knows it. \nEMILIE Should I stay? \nSCHINDLER (pause) It's up to you. \nThat's not it either. \nEMILIE No, it's up to you. \nSchindler stares out at the lights of the city. They look like jewels. \nEMILIE Promise me no doorman or maitre 'd will presume I am anyone other than Mrs. Schindler... and I'll stay. \nHe promises her nothing. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY \nEmilie waves goodbye to him from a first-class compartment window. Down on the platform, he waves goodbye to her. as the train pulls away, he turns away, and the platform of the next track is revealed -- soldiers and clerks supervising the boarding of hundreds of people onto another train -- the image turning BLACK AND WHITE. \nCLERKS Your luggage will follow you. Make sure it's clearly labeled. Leave your luggage on the platform. \nEXT. D.E.F. LOADING DOCK - DAY \nAs workers load crates of enamelware onto trucks -- back to COLOR -- Stern and Schindler and the dock foreman confer over an invoice. \nMore to Stern -- \nFOREMAN Every other time it's been all right. This time when I weigh the truck, I see he's heavy, he's loaded too much. I point this out to him, I tell him to wait, he tells me he's got a new arrangement with Mr. Schindler -- (to Schindler) -- that you know all about it and it's okay with you. \nSCHINDLER It's \"okay\" with me? \nOn the surface, Schindler remains calm; underneath, he's livid. Clearly it's not \"okay\" with him. \nSTERN How heavy was he? \nFOREMAN Not that much, just too much for it to be a mistake -- 200 kilos. \nStern and Schindler exchange a glance. Then -- \nSCHINDLER (pause) You're sure. \nThe foreman nods. \nINT. GHETTO STOREFRONT - DAY \nPfefferberg and Schindler bang in through the front door, startling a woman at a desk. \nWOMAN AT DESK Can I help you? \nThey move past her without a word and into the back of the place, into a storeroom. They stride past long racks full of enamelware and other goods. \n", "test1_id": 3003, "test2_input": "Stern's look is all innocence, but Schindler knows better. \nSCHINDLER You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know. \nSTERN (with concern) Are you losing money? \nSCHINDLER No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point. \nSTERN What other point is -- \nSCHINDLER (interrupts; yells) It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally. \nSilence. Schindler tries to settle down. Then -- \nSCHINDLER You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people -- he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right. There'd be just the good aspects of him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money... \nSTERN And killing. \nSCHINDLER I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. (pause) All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it? \nSTERN There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office. \nBut it isn't Stern who needs convincing; it's Schindler himself. It's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear to Stern. Schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, or at the fact that he's allowed Stern to place him right in the middle of it. He turns to leave, hesitates. He conducts a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it: \nSCHINDLER Perlman, husband and wife. \nHe unstraps his watch, hands it to Stern. \nSCHINDLER Give it to Goldberg, have him send them over. \nHe leaves. \nEXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT \nDistant music, Brahms' lullaby, from the Rosner Brothers way down by the women's barracks calming the inhabitants. Up here on the balcony, Schindler and Goeth, the latter so drunk he can barely stand up, stare out over Goeth's dark kingdom. \nSCHINDLER They don't fear us because we have the power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him killed, we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. That's not power, though, that's justice. That's different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill -- and we don't. That's power. That's what the emperors had. A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die... and the emperor pardons him. This worthless man. He lets him go. That's power. That's power. \nIt seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the merciful emperor, holds some appeal to Goeth. Perhaps, as he stares out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering what the power Schindler describes might feel like. \nEventually, he glances over drunkenly, and almost smiles. \nSCHINDLER Amon the Good. \nEXT. STABLES - PLASZOW - DAY \nA stable boy works to ready Goeth's horse before he arrives. \nHe sticks a bridle into its mouth, throws a riding blanket onto its back, drags out the saddle Schindler bought Goeth. \nBefore he can finish, though, Goeth is there. The boy tries to hide his panic; he knows others have been shot for less. \nSTABLE BOY I'm sorry, sir, I'm almost done. \nGOETH Oh, that's all right. \nAs Goeth waits, patiently it seems, whistling to himself, the stable boy tries to mask his confusion. \nEXT. PLASZOW - DAY \nGoeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high in the saddle. But everywhere he looks, it seems, he's confronted with stoop-shouldered sloth. He forces himself to smile benevolently. \nINT. GOETH'S VILLA - DAY \nGoeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride. A worker with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway. \nMORE TO THE FLOOR -- \nWORKER I have to report, sir, I've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub. \nGoeth steps past him to take a look. The worker is almost shaking, he's so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects to receive. \nGOETH What are you using? \nWORKER Soap, sir. \nGOETH (incredulous) Soap? Not lye? \nThe worker hasn't a defense for himself. Goeth's hand drifts down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster. He stares at the worker. He so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand it, right here, right in the bathroom, put some more stains on the porcelain. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. \nThen gestures grandly. \nGOETH Go ahead, go on, leave. I pardon you. \nThe worker hurries out with his pail and cloth. Goeth just stands there for several moments -- trying to feel the power of emperors he's supposed to be feeling. But he doesn't feel it. All he feels is stupid. \nEXT. GOETH'S VILLA - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nThe worker hurries across the dying lawn outside the villa. \nHe dares a glance back, and at that moment, a hand with a gun appears out the bathroom window and fires. \nEXT. BARRACKS, PLASZOW - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "STERN If he didn't steal so much, I could hide it. If he's steal with some discretion... \nCUT TO: \nSTERN'S OFFICE, PLASZOW - DAY \nGoldberg delivers a stack of requisitions and invoices, and leaves without a word. Behind his desk, Stern takes a cursory look at them and shakes his head in dismay. \nINT. GOLDBERG'S OFFICE, PLASZOW - MINUTES LATER - DAY \nStern comes in with the requisitions. Now it's Goldberg's turn to shake his head in dismay; he doesn't want to hear it -- \nSTERN There are fifteen thousand people here -- \nGOLDBERG Goeth says there's twenty-five. \nSTERN There are fifteen. He wants to say sixteen, seventeen, all right, maybe he can get away with it, but ten thousand over? It's stupid. \nGOLDBERG Stern, do me a favor, get out of here. You want to argue about it, go tell Goeth. \nLOADING DOCK, PLASZOW - DAY \nStern watches truck being unloaded of bags of flour, rice and other supplies. Goeth nods to Hujar. Hujar calls a halt. \nThe workers climb down, close up the trucks. And, still half full, the trucks rumble off. \nSTERN (V.O.) The SS auditors keep coming around, looking over the books -- Goeth knows this -- \nEXT. CRACOW - DAY \nThe trucks at the loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse. \nPolish workers, under Hujar's supervision, throwing down the \"surplus\" bags of flour and rice -- the supplies for the phantom 10,000 prisoners. \nSTERN (V.O.) -- you'd think he'd have the common sense to see what's coming. No, he steals with complete impunity. \nCUT BACK TO: \nBARRACKS - CONTINUED - NIGHT \nThey can see Goeth's villa up on the hill; figures moving around behind the windows. There's another party going on up there. Down here, as he nurses a drink from his flask, Schindler thinks about what Stern has told him, and eventually shrugs, Fine, fuck him. \nSCHINDLER So you'll be rid of him. \nBut Stern slowly shakes his head 'no.' \nSTERN If Plaszow is closed, they'll have to send us somewhere else. Where -- who knows? Gross-Rosen maybe. Maybe Auschwitz. \nThere's the irony -- bad as it is, evil as Goeth is, it could get worse. Schindler understands. \nSCHINDLER I'll talk to him. \nSTERN I think it's too late. \nSCHINDLER Well, I'll talk to somebody. I'll take care of it. \nHe hands over to Stern some negotiable items and leaves. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW - NIGHT \nSchindler and Senior SS Officers Toffel and Scherner share a table in same smoke-filled nightclub they met in. \nSCHINDLER What's he done that's so bad -- take money? That's a crime? Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war? We're here to make money, all of us. \nTOFFEL There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that. He's taking money. \nSCHERNER The place produces nothing. I shouldn't say that -- nothing it produces reaches the Army. That's not all right. \nSCHINDLER So I'll talk to him about it. \nSCHERNER He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though -- has he ever once shown you his appreciation? I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy. Never a thank you note. He forgets my wife at Christmas time -- \nSCHINDLER He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it? \nTOFFEL He's stealing from you, Oskar. \nSCHINDLER Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together. What is this? I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad. We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy. \nSCHERNER Not like him. \nSchindler glances away to the floor show, nods to himself. \nGlancing back again, he considers the SS men with great sobriety. \nSCHINDLER Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn't matter the amount we steal, it's that we do it. Each of us sitting at this table. \nHis thinly veiled threat of exposure escapes neither SS man. \nThe air seems thicker suddenly. \nSCHERNER He doesn't deserve your loyalty. More important, he's not worth you making threats against us. \n", "test2_id": 3004, "test3_input": "SCHINDLER You can finish that page. \nStern resumes where he left off, but then hesitates again. \nThere's something he doesn't understand. \nSTERN What did Goeth say? You just told him how many you needed? \nIt doesn't sound right. And Schindler doesn't answer. He's avoided telling Stern the details of the deal struck with Goeth, and balks telling him now. Finally awkwardly -- \nSCHINDLER I'm buying them. I'm paying him. I give him money, he gives me the people. (pause) If you were still working for me I'd expect you to talk me out of it, it's costing me a fortune. \nStern had no idea. And has no idea now what to say. \nSchindler shrugs like it's no big deal, but Stern knows it is. \nSCHINDLER Give him the list, he'll sign it, he'll get the people ready. I have to go back to Brinnlitz, to take care of things on that end, I'll see you there. \nStern is really overcome by what this man is doing. What he can't figure out is why. Silence. And then -- \nSCHINDLER Finish the page. \nStern turns back, does as he's told. Schindler drinks. \nNothing but the sound of the typewriter keys. And then nothing at all. The page is done. The rest will die. \nINT. TOWN COUNCIL HALL - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nSchindler in front of a large assembly, party pin in his lapel, as usual, imposing SS guards on either side of him. \nSCHINDLER This is my home. \nHe looks out over his audience, the citizens of Brinnlitz, local government officials, many of them appearing bewildered by him or the \"situation\" that has arisen. \nSCHINDLER I was born here, my wife was born here, my mother is buried here, this is my home. \nHis estranged wife is there. So are the guys he was drinking with. \nSCHINDLER Do you really think I'd bring a thousand Jewish criminals into my home? \nEveryone seems to breathe sighs of relief as if they've been waiting for him to say this, to dispel the disturbing rumors they've heard. \nSCHINDLER These are skilled munitions workers -- they are essential to the war effort -- \nThe noise begins, his audience's angry reaction. Raising pitch of his own voice -- \nSCHINDLER -- It is my duty to supervise them -- and it is your duty to allow me -- \nHe barely gets it all out before the protests drown him out. \nThe uproar reaches such a clamoring level there's no point in his continuing. \nGOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY \nGoeth, at his writing desk, endures the bureaucratic tedium of signing memoranda, transport orders, requisitions. He comes to Schindler's list, initials each page and signs the last with no more interest than the others. He hands the whole stack of paperwork to Marcel Goldberg, Personnel Clerk, Executor of Lists, Gangster. \nINT. OFFICE, ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - PLASZOW - DAY \nGoldberg has the signature page of the list in a typewriter. \nHe carefully aligns it and types his own name in a space allowed by the bottom margin. \nEXT. SCHINDLER'S BRINNLITZ FACTORY SITE - DAY \nAt a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs his name to Reich Main Office directives, Evacuation Board and Department of Economy form, Armaments contracts. \nAround him, the new camp is taking shape: Electric fences are going up, watchtowers, barracks; shipments of heavy equipment, huge Hilo machines, are being off-loaded from flatbed train cars; SS engineers stand around frowning at the lay of the land, some drainage problem no doubt. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY \nA train full of people destined for Auschwitz pulls away from the platform. As Goldberg gathers his paperwork, a prisoner approaches him. \nPRISONER Am I on the list? \nGOLDBERG What list is that? \nHe knows what the prisoner means and the prisoner knows he knows. He means Schindler's List. \nGOLDBERG The good list? Well, that depends, doesn't it? \nThe prisoner knows that, too, and discreetly turns over to Goldberg a couple of diamonds from the lining of his coat. \nINT. GOLDBERG'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - NIGHT \nNames on a notepad, the first few crossed out. Goldberg types the next name onto a page of The List, squeezing it into the upper margin, and crosses that one out on the pad. \nHe rolls the page down, types another name, tires of the exacting task, tears the handwritten page of names from the notepad, crumples it and throws it away. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nSchindler, on his way back to his hotel after a night of drinking, is jumped by three guys, wrestled to the ground and brutally kicked. \nAs the forms of his attackers move away, he catches a glimpse of one of them -- his \"friend\" who admired his car when he first arrived back in town. \n", "test3_true": "Pfefferberg, his head under the hood of a German staff car, adjusting the carburetor. Goldberg comes in. \nGOLDBERG Hey, Poldek, how's it going? (Pfefferberg ignores him) You know about the list? You're on it. \nPFEFFERBERG Of course I'm on it. \nGOLDBERG You want to stay on it? What do you got for me? \nPfefferberg glances up from his work and studies the blackmailing collaborator for a long moment. \nPFEFFERBERG What do I got for you? \nGOLDBERG Takes diamonds to stay on this list. \nPfefferberg suddenly attacks him with the wrench in his hand, beating him across the shoulders and head with it. \nPFEFFERBERG I'll kill you, that's what I got for you. \nGoldberg goes down, tries to scramble away on his knees, the blows coming down hard on his back. \nGOLDBERG All right, all right, all right. \nHe makes it outside the garage and runs. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY \nA cattle car is coupled to another, the pin dropped into place. On the platform, clerks at folding tables shuffle paper while others mill around with clipboards, calling out names. \nThousands of prisoners on the platform, some climbing onto strings of slatted cars on opposing tracks. Some already in them, most standing in lines, changing lines, the end of one virtually indistinguishable from the beginning of another. \nPaperwork. Lists of names. Pens in hands checking them off. \nSome bound for Brinnlitz, the rest for Auschwitz, if they can be properly sorted from one another. \nA boy is allowed to remain in a line with his father; his mother is taken to another line composed of women and girls. \nThis segregation is the only recognizable process going on; the others, if they exist, are apparent only to the clerks and guards, and maybe not even to them. It is chaos. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT \nA train snakes across the dark landscape. \nINT. CATTLE CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nStern, wedged into a corner of an impossibly crowded car. \nThis train may be headed for Schindler's hometown, but it is no more comfortable than the others on their way to Auschwitz -- Birkenau. \nEXT. CROSSING - POLAND - DAY \nThe train idles at a crossing in the middle of nowhere. \nMoving across the faces peering out from between the slats, it becomes apparent there are only male prisoners aboard. \nBelow, on a dirt road, a lone Polish boy stands watching. \nJust before an empty train roars past from the other direction obscuring him, his hand comes up and across his neck making the gesture of a throat being slit. \nEXT. DEPOT - BRINNLITZ - DAY \nThe train pulls into the small quiet Brinnlitz station. The doors are opened and the prisoners begin climbing down. At the far end of the platform, flanked by several SS guards, stands Schindler. To his customary elegant attire he has added a careless accouterment, a Tyrolean hat. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY \nLeading a procession of nine hundred male Jewish \"criminals\" through the center of town, Schindler ignores the angry taunts and denouncements and the occasional rock hurled by the good citizens of Brinnlitz lining the streets. \nINT. BRINNLITZ MUNITIONS FACTORY - DAY \nUnder the towering Hilo machines, a meal of soup and bread awaits the workers. As they're sitting down to it, Schindler addresses them -- \nSCHINDLER You'll be interested to know I received a cable this morning from the Personnel Office, Plaszow. The women have left. They should be arriving here sometime tomorrow. \nHe sees Stern among the workers, smiles almost imperceptibly, turns and walks away. \nEXT. RURAL POLAND - DAY \nA train backs slowly along the tracks toward an arched gatehouse. The women inside the cattle cars don't need a sign to tell them where they are, they've seen this place in nightmares. Pillars of dark smoke rise from the stacks into the sky. \nIt's Auschwitz. \nEXT. AUSCHWITZ - DAY \nThe stunned women climb down from the railcars onto an immense concourse bisecting the already infamous camp. As they're marched across the muddy yard by guards carrying truncheons, Mila Pfefferberg stares at the place. It' so big, like a city, only one in which the inhabitants reside strictly temporarily. To Mila, under her breath -- \nWOMAN Where are the clerks? \nSo often terrified by the sight of a clerk with a clipboard, it is the absence of clerks which unsettles the woman now, as though there remains no further reason to record their names. \nMila's eyes return to the constant smoke rising beyond the birch trees at the settlement's western end. \nINT.

{"train": "SCHINDLER'S LIST \n\"SCHINDLER'S LIST\" \nBY \nSteven Zaillian \nFinal Draft \nIN BLACK AND WHITE: \nTRAIN WHEELS grinding against track, slowing. FOLDING TABLE LEGS scissoring open. The LEVER of a train door being pulled. NAMES on lists on clipboards held by clerks moving alongside the tracks. \nCLERKS (V.O.) ...Rossen... Lieberman... Wachsberg... \nBEWILDERED RURAL FACES coming down off the passenger train. \nFORMS being set out on the folding tables. HANDS straightening pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps. \nCLERKS (V.O.) ...When your name is called go over there... take this over to that table... \nTYPEWRITER KEYS rapping a name onto a list. A FACE. KEYS typing another name. Another FACE. \nCLERKS (V.O.) ...you\u0092re in the wrong line, wait over there... you, come over here... \nA MAN is taken from one long line and led to the back of another. A HAND hammers a rubber stamp at a form. Tight on a FACE. KEYS type another NAME. Another FACE. Another NAME. \nCLERKS (V.O.) ...Biberman... Steinberg... Chilowitz... \nAs a hand comes down stamping a GRAY STRIPE across a registration card, there is absolute silence... then MUSIC, the Hungarian love song, \"Gloomy Sunday,\" distant... and the stripe bleeds into COLOR, into BRIGHT YELLOW INK. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT \nThe song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink. \nThe light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap. The curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling... but the clothes laid out across the single bed are beautiful. \nThe hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks. He slips into the double-breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, all with great deliberation. \nA bureau. Some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport. And an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or swastika) which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner jacket. \nHe steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror. He likes what he sees: Oskar Schindler -- salesman from Zwittau -- looking almost reputable in his one nice suit. \nEven in this awful room. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT \nA spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings. \nIt\u0092s September, 1939. General Sigmund List's armored divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, have taken Cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, conducting business, is a strange clientele: SS officers and Polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown together by the circumstance of war. \nOskar Schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the faces, stripping away all that\u0092s unimportant to him, settling only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand. \nWAITER SETS DOWN DRINKS \nin front of the SS officer who took the money. A lieutenant, he\u0092s at a table with his girlfriend and a lower-ranking officer. \nWAITER From the gentleman. \nThe waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where Schindler, seemingly unaware of the SS men, drinks with the best-looking woman in the place. \nLIEUTENANT Do I know him? \nHis sergeant doesn\u0092t. His girlfriend doesn't. \nLIEUTENANT Find out who he is. \nThe sergeant makes his way over to Schindler's table. \nThere's a handshake and introductions before -- and the lieutenant, watching, can't believe it -- his guy accepts the chair Schindler's dragging over. \nThe lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's forgotten already he went there for a reason. Finally, and it irritates the SS man, he has to get up and go over there. \nLIEUTENANT Stay here. \nHis girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindler's table. \nBefore he even arrives, Schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide some tables together. \nWAITERS ARRIVE WITH PLATES OF CAVIAR \nand another round of drinks. The lieutenant makes a halfhearted move for his wallet. \nLIEUTENANT Let me get this one. \nSCHINDLER No, put it away, put it away. \nSchindler's already got his money out. Even as he's paying, his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a girl is declining the advances of two more high-ranking SS men. \nA TABLECLOTH BILLOWS \nas a waiter lays it down on another table that's been added to the others. Schindler seats the SS officers on either side of his own \"date\" -- \nMax admits it with a shrug. \nMAX REDLICHT I've done some things... but I won't do this. \nSilence. The Einsatz NCO glances away to the others, amused. \nEINSATZ NCO What does this mean? Of all of you, there's only one who has the guts to say no? One? And he doesn't even believe? (no one, of course answer him) I come in here, I ask you to do something no one should ever ask. And you do it? (pause) What won't you do? \nNobody answers. He turns to Max. \nEINSATZ NCO You, sir, I respect. \nHe pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head. He's dead before he hits the floor. \nEINSATZ NCO The rest of you... ...are beneath his contempt. \nHe turns and walks away. The other Einsatz Boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire. \nEXT. CRACOW - DAY \nIn BLACK AND WHITE and absolute silence, a suitcase thrown \nfrom a second story window arcs slowly through the air. As it hits the pavement, spilling open -- SOUND ON -- and, returning to COLOR -- \nThousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of Kazimierz, dragging mattresses over the bridge at Podgorze, carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced exodus into the ghetto. \nCrowds of Poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade route. Some wave. Some take it more soberly, as if sensing they may be next. \nPOLISH GIRL Goodbye, Jews. \nEXT. GHETTO GATE - DAY \nThe little folding tables have been dragged out and set up again, and at them sit the clerks. \nGoldberg, of all people, has somehow managed to elevate himself to a station of some authority. Armed with something more frightening than a gun -- a clipboard -- he abets the Gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the ghetto gate and who detours to the train station. \nPFEFFERBERG What's this? \nPfefferberg, with his wife Mila, at the head of a line that seems to stretch back forever, flicks at Goldberg's OD armband with disgust. \nGOLDBERG Ghetto Police. I'm a policeman now, can you believe it? \nPFEFFERBERG Yeah, I can. \nThey consider each other for a long moment before Pfefferberg leads his wife past Goldberg and into the ghetto. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING, GHETTO - NIGHT \nDismayed by each others' close proximity, Orthodox and liberal Jews wait to use the floor's single bathroom. \nINT. GHETTO APARTMENT - NIGHT \nFrom the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor. In this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of it, sit some non-Orthodox businessmen, Stern and Schindler. \nSCHINDLER For each thousand you invest, you take from the loading dock five hundred kilos of product a month -- to begin in July and to continue for one year -- after which time, we're even. (he shrugs) That's it. \nHe lets them think about it, pours a shot of cognac from his flask, offers it to Stern, who brought this group together and now sits at Schindler's side. The accountant declines. \nINVESTOR 1 Not good enough. \nSCHINDLER Not good enough? Look where you're living. Look where you've been put. \"Not good enough.\" (he almost laughs at the squalor) A couple of months ago, you'd be right. Not anymore. \nINVESTOR 1 Money's still money. \nSCHINDLER No, it isn't, that's why we're here. \nSchindler lights a cigarette and waits for their answer. It doesn't come. Just a silence. Which irritates him. \nSCHINDLER Did I call this meeting? You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me. I'm here. Now you want to negotiate? The offer's withdrawn. \nHe caps his flask, pockets it, reaches for his top coat. \nINVESTOR 2 How do we know you'll do what you say? \nSCHINDLER Because I said I would. What do you want, a contract? To be filed where? (he slips into his coat) I said what I'll do, that's our contract. \nThe investors study him. This is not a manageable German. \nWhether he's honest or not is impossible to say. Their glances to Stern don't help them; he doesn't know either. \nThe silence in the room is filled by the muffled singing next door. One of the men eventually nods, He's in. Then another. And another. \nINT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY \nA red power button is pushed, starting the motor of a huge metal press. The machine whirs, louder, louder. \nINT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY \nSchindler, at a wall of a windows, is peering down at the lone technician making adjustments to the machine. \nSTERN The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled labor is seven Marks a day, five for unskilled and women. This is what you pay the Economic Office, the laborers themselves receive nothing. Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more. Are you listening? \nSchindler turns from the wall of glass to face his new accountant. \nINT. FACTORY - DAY \nAnother machine starts up. Another. Another. \nEXT. PEACE SQUARE - DAY \nStern with a woman at the head of a line. The clerk affixes the all-important blue sticker to her work card. \nINT. FACTORY DAY - DAY \nThree hundred Jewish laborers, men and women, work at the long tables, at the presses, the latches, the furnaces, turning out field kitchenware and mess kits. \nFew glance up from their work at Schindler, the big gold party pin stuck into his lapel, as he moves through the place, his place, his factory, in full operation. \nHe climbs the stairs to the offices where several secretaries process Armaments orders. He gestures to Stern, at a desk covered with ledgers, to join him in his office. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe accountant follows Schindler into the office. \nSCHINDLER Sit down. \nSchindler goes to the wall of windows, his favorite place in the world, and looks down at all the activity below. He pours two drinks from a decanter and, turning back, holds one out to Stern. Stern, of course, declines. Schinder groans. \nSCHINDLER Oh, come on. \nHe comes over and puts the drink in Stern's hand, moves behind his desk and sits. \nSCHINDLER My father was fond of saying you need three things in life. A good doctor, a forgiving priest and a clever accountant. The first two... \nHe dismisses them with a shrug; he's never had much use for either. But the third -- he raises his glass to the accountant. Stern's glass stays in his lap. \nSCHINDLER (long sufferingly) Just pretend for Christ's sake. \nStern slowly raises his glass. \nSCHINDLER Thank you. \nSchindler drinks; Stern doesn't. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nKlonowska, wearing a man's silk robe, traipses past the remains of a party to the front door. Opening it reveals a nice looking, nicely dressed woman. \nKLONOWSKA Yes? \nA series of realizations is made by each of them, quickly, silently, ending up with Klonowska looking ill. \nSCHINDLER (O.S.) Who is it? \nINT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nSchindler sets a cup of coffee down in front of his wife. \nBehind him, through a doorway, Klonowska can be seen hurriedly gathering her things. \nSCHINDLER She's so embarrassed -- look at her -- \nEmilie begrudges him a glance to the bedroom, catching the girl just as she looks up -- embarrassed. \nSCHINDLER You know what, you'd like her. \nEMILIE Oskar, please -- \nSCHINDLER What -- \nEMILIE I don't have to like her just because you do. It doesn't work that way. \nSCHINDLER You would, though. That's what I'm saying. \nHis face is complete innocence. It's the first thing she fell in love with; and perhaps the thing that keeps her from killing him now. Klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly self-conscious. \nKLONOWSKA Goodbye. It was a pleasure meeting you. \nShe shakes Emilie's limp hand. Schindler sees her to the door, lets her out and returns to the table, smiling to himself. Emilie's glancing around at the place. \nEMILIE You've done well here. \nHe nods; he's proud of it. He studies her. \nSCHINDLER You look great. \nEXT. SCHINDLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThey emerge from the building in formal clothes, both of them looking great. It's wet and slick; the doorman offers Emilie his arm. \nDOORMAN Careful of the pavement -- \nSCHINDLER -- Mrs. Schindler. \nThe doorman shoots a glance to Schindler that asks, clearly, Really? Schindler opens the passenger door of the Mercedes for his wife, and the doorman helps her in. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA man glances up, sees them coming. He's one of Schindler's investors, the one who questioned the German's word. The man's teenage sons rush to their father's defense, but Pfefferberg grabs him and locks an arm tightly around his neck. \nSilence. Then, calmly -- \nSCHINDLER If you or anyone acting as an agent for you comes to my factory again, I'll have you arrested. \nINVESTOR It was a mistake. \nSCHINDLER It was a mistake? What was a mistake? How do you know what I'm talking about? \nINVESTOR All right, it wasn't a mistake, but it was one time. \nSCHINDLER We had a deal, you broke it. One phone call and your whole family is dead. \nHe turns and walks away. Pfefferberg lets the guy go and follows. The investor's sons help their father up off the floor. Gasping, he yells. \nINVESTOR I gave you money. \n-- but Schindler and Pfefferberg are already gone, coming through the front office and out the front door -- \nEXT. STOREFRONT - CONTINUOUS - DAY \n-- to the street. Pfefferberg looks a little shaken from the experience. Schindler straightens his friend's clothes. \nSCHINDLER How you feeling, all right? \nPFEFFERBERG Yeah. \nSCHINDLER What's the matter, everything all right at home? (Pfefferberg nods) Mila's okay? \nPFEFFERBERG She's good. \nWell, then, Schindler can't imagine what could be wrong. He pats Pfefferberg on the shoulder and leads him away. \nSCHINDLER Good. \nINT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY \nThe long tables accommodate most of workers. The rest eat their lunch on the floor. Soup and bread. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY \nAn elegant place setting for one. Meat, vegetables, glass of wine, all untouched. Schindler leafing through pages of a report Stern has prepared for him. \nSCHINDLER I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot. We're doing well? \nSTERN Yes. \nSCHINDLER Better this month than last? \nSTERN Yes. \nSCHINDLER Any reason to think next month will be worse? \nSTERN The war could end. \nNo chance of that. Satisfied, Schindler returns the report to his accountant and starts to eat. Stern knows he is excused, but looks like he wants to say something more; he just doesn't know how to say it. \nSCHINDLER (impatient) What? \nSTERN (pause) There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job. \nSchindler gives his accountant a long-suffering look. \nSTERN He asks every day. It'll just take a minute. He's very grateful. \nSchindler's silence says, Is this really necessary? Stern pretends it's a tacit okay, goes to the door and pokes his head out. \nSTERN Mr. Lowenstein? \nAn old man with one arm appears in the doorway and Schindler glances to the ceiling, to heaven. As the man slowly makes his way into the room, Schindler sees the bruises on his face. And when he speaks, only half his mouth moves; the other half is paralyzed. \nLOWENSTEIN I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work. \nSCHINDLER You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job. \nSchindler shakes the man's hand perfunctorily and tells Stern with a look, okay, that's enough, get him out of here. \nLOWENSTEIN The SS beat me up. They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you. \nSCHINDLER That's great. \nLOWENSTEIN I work hard for you. I'll continue to work hard for you. \nSCHINDLER That's great, thanks. \nLOWENSTEIN God bless you, sir. \nSCHINDLER Yeah, okay. \nLOWENSTEIN You're a good man. \nSchindler is dying, and telling Stern with his eyes, Get this guy out of here. Stern takes the man's arm. \nNobody is kidding. \nKUHNPAST (pause) Thanks for the drink. \nHe sets it down, gets up. Hohne gets up. They return the documents to Stern and turn to leave. They aren't quite out the door when Schindler wonders out loud to Stern: \nSCHINDLER You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door; I've never understood that. What's next? \nSTERN Christmas presents. \nSCHINDLER Ah, yes. \nThe businessmen slow, but don't look back into the room. \nEXT. SCHERNER'S RESIDENCE - CRACOW - MORNING \nPfefferberg wipes a smudge from the hood of an otherwise pristine BMW Cabriolet. As Scherner and his wife emerge from their house in robes, Scherner whispers to himself -- \nSCHERNER Oskar... \nEXT. KUHNPAST'S RADIATOR FACTORY - DAY \nWorkers high on the side of the building toss down the letters of the radiator sign as others hoist up a big \"D.\" Under armed guard, others unload a metal press machine from a truck. \nINT. RADIATOR FACTORY / DEF ANNEX - DAY \nTechnicians make adjustments to presses already in place. \nOthers test the new firing ovens. Kuhnpast is being forcibly removed from the premises. \nINT. GHETTO EMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY \nCrowded beyond belief, the place is like a post office gone mad. Stern, moving along one of the impossibly crowded lines, pauses to speak with an elderly couple. \nEXT. PEACE SQUARE - DAY \nA hand slaps a blue sticker on a work card. Slap, another. \nAnd another. And another. \nINT. D.E.F. FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nChristmas decorations. Klonowska at her desk, her eyes closed tight. \nSCHINDLER All right. \nShe opens her eyes and smiles. Schindler is holding a poodle in his arms. She comes around to kiss him. He sets the dog on the desk. Stern, across the room, watches blank-faced. \nGESTAPO (O.S.) Oskar Schindler? \nSchindler, Stern and Klonowska turn to the voice. Two Gestapo men have entered unannounced. \nGESTAPO We have a warrant to take your company's business records with us. And another to take you. \nSchindler stares at them in disbelief. Stern quietly slips one of the ledgers on his desk into a drawer. \nSCHINDLER Am I permitted to have my secretary cancel my appointments for the day? \nHe doesn't wait for their approval. He scribbles down some names -- Toffel, Czurda, Reeder, Scherner. Underlining Scherner, he glances to Klonowska. She understands. \nINT. OFFICE, SS HEADQUARTERS, CRACOW - DAY \nA humorless middle-level bureaucrat sits behind a desk and D.E.F.'s ledgers and cashbooks. \nGESTAPO CLERK You live very well. \nThe man slowly shakes his head 'no' to Schindler's offer of a cigarette. Schindler tamps it against the crystal of his gold watch. \nGESTAPO CLERK This standard of living comes entirely from legitimate sources, I take it? \nSchindler lights the cigarette and drags on it, all but ignoring the man. \nGESTAPO CLERK As an SS supplier, you have a moral obligation to desist from blackmarket dealings. You're in business to support the war effort, not to fatten -- \nSCHINDLER (interrupting) You know? When my friends ask, I'd love to be able to tell them you treated me with the utmost courtesy and respect. \nThe quiet matter-of-fact tone, more than the comment itself, throws the bureaucrat off his rhythm. His eyes narrow slightly. There's a long silence. \nINT. HALLWAY/ROOM - SS HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nThe two who arrested him lead Schindler down a long hallway. \nThey reach a door, have him step inside and close the door after him. \nINT. SS \"CELL\" - EVENING \nSchindler knocks on the inside of the door. A Waffen SS man opens it. The \"prisoner\" peels several bills from a thick wad. \nSCHINDLER Chances of getting a bottle of vodka pretty good? \nHe hands the young guard five times the going price. \nWAFFEN GUARD Yes, sir. \nThe sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes, at the pin, at the man wearing them. \nSERGEANT (to the clerk) Is he on the list? \nCLERK Yes, sir. \nSERGEANT (to Schindler) The list is correct, sir. There's nothing I can do. \nSCHINDLER May as well get your name while you're here. \nSERGEANT My name? My name is Kunder. Sergeant Kunder. What's yours? \nSCHINDLER Schindler. \nThe sergeant takes out a pad. Now all three of them have lists. He jots down Schindler's name. Schindler jots down his and flips the pad closed. \nSCHINDLER Sergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very much. I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in Southern Russia before the end of the month. Good evening. \nHe walks away, back toward his car. The clerk and sergeant smile. But slowly, slowly, the smiles sour at the possibility that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow arrange such a fate... \nALL THREE OF THEM -- \n-- Schindler, the clerk and the sergeant -- stride along the side of the cars. Two of them are calling out loudly -- \nCLERK & SERGEANT Stern! Itzhak Stern! \nSoon it seems as if everybody except Schindler is yelling out the name. As they reach the last few cars, the accountant's face appears through the slats. \nSCHINDLER There he is. \nSERGEANT Open it. \nGuards yank at a lever, slide the gate open. Stern climbs down. The clerk draws a line through his name on the list and hands the clipboard to Schindler. \nCLERK Initial it, please. (Schindler initials the change) And this... \nAs Schindler signs three or four forms, the guards slide the carriage gate closed. Those left inside seem grateful for the extra space. \nCLERK It makes no difference to us, you understand -- this one, that one. It's the inconvenience to the list. It's the paperwork. \nSchindler returns the clipboard. The sergeant motions to another who motions to the engineer. As the train pulls out, Stern tries to keep up with Schindler who's striding away. \nSTERN I somehow left my work card at home. I tried to tell them it was a mistake, but they -- \nSchindler silences him with a look. He's livid. Stern glances down at the ground. \nSTERN I'm sorry. It was stupid. (contrite) Thank you. \nSchindler turns away and heads for the car. Stern hurries after him. They pass an area where all the luggage, carefully tagged, has been left -- the image becoming BLACK and WHITE. \nEXT./INT. MECHANICS GARAGE - NIGHT \nMechanics' hood-lamps throw down pools of light through which me wheel handcarts piled high with suitcases, briefcases, steamer trunks -- BLACK and WHITE. \nMoving along with one of the handcarts into a huge garage past racks of clothes, each item tagged, past musical instruments, furniture, paintings, against one wall -- children's toys, sorted by size. \nThe cart stops. A valise is handed to someone who dumps and sorts the contents on a greasy table. The jewelry is taken to another area, to a pit, one of two deep lubrication bays filled with watches, bracelets, necklaces, candelabra, Passover platters, gold in one, silver the other, and tossed in. \nAt workbenches, four Jewish jewelers under SS guard sift and sort and weigh and grade diamonds, pearls, pendants, brooches children's rings -- faltering only once, when a uniformed figure upends a box, spilling out gold teeth smeared with blood -- the image saturating with COLOR. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nFractured gravestones like broken teeth jut from the earth of a neglected Jewish cemetery outside of town. Down the road that runs alongside it comes a German staff car. \nINT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY \nIn the backseat, Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth pulls on a flask of schnapps. His age and build are about that of Schindler's; his face open and pleasant. \nGOETH Make a nice driveway. \nThe other SS officers in the car -- Knude, Haase and Hujar -- aren't sure what he means. He's peering out the window at the tombstones. \nEXT. GHETTO - DAY \nThe staff car passes through the portals of the ghetto and down the trolley lines of Lwowska Street. \nINT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY \nAs the car slowly cruises through the ghetto, Knude, like a tour guide, briefs the new man, Goeth -- \nKNUDE This street divides the ghetto just about in half. On the right -- Ghetto A: civil employees, industry workers, so on. On the left, Ghetto B: surplus labor, the elderly mostly. Which is where you'll probably want to start. \nThe look Goeth gives Knude tells him to refrain, if he would, from offering tactical opinions. \nKNUDE Of course that's entirely up to you. \nEXT. PLASZOW FORCED LABOR SITE - DAY \nOutside of town, a previously abandoned limestone quarry lies nestled between two hills. The stone and brick buildings look like they've been here forever; the wooden structures, those that are up, are built of freshly-cut lumber. \nThere's a great deal of activity. New construction and renovation -- foundations being poured, rail tracks being laid, fences and watchtowers going up, heavy segments of huts -- wall panels, eaves sections -- being dragged uphill by teams of bescarved women like some ancient Egyptian industry. \nGoeth surveys the site from a knoll, clearly pleased with it. \nHis voice echoes into silence. An acquiescent shrug from Goeth finally. And a nod; Schindler's right. \nSCHINDLER Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money -- I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -- \nGOETH We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -- \nSCHINDLER (cutting him off) It's bad business. \nGOETH (shrugs) Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done. (pause) Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that's good business. \nSchindler pours himself another shot from the bottle, nurses it. He's in a foul mood. They study each other, trying to determine perhaps who's more powerful. Eventually -- \nGOETH Scherner told me something else about you. \nSCHINDLER Yeah, what's that? \nGOETH That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys. \nSCHINDLER True. \nGoeth tries to put the situation in perspective: \nGOETH You want to stay where you are. You got things going on the side, things are good, you don't want anybody telling you what to do -- I can understand all that. (pause) What you want is your own sub-camp. \nSchindler admits it by not disagreeing. Goeth thinks about it, nods to himself again, then frowns. \nGOETH Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone? Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy. Then the engineers show up. They stand around and they argue about drainage -- I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know. \nSCHINDLER Well, you've been through it. You know. You could make things easier for me. \nGoeth mulls it over, his shrug saying \"maybe, maybe not.\" A silence before -- \nSCHINDLER I'd be grateful. \nThere's the word Goeth was waiting to hear. \nEXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP SITE - DAY \nAn SS surveyor, with even paces, measures a distance of the bare field adjacent to the factory. He sticks a little flag into the ground. \nEXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP SITE - DAY \nA watchtower, half-erected, the little flag still in the ground. Laborers hammer at it while others roll out barbed wire fencing. A surveyor supervises the placement of a post and carefully measures its heights; it has to be nine feet, exactly. \nAt a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs checks made out to the Construction Office, Plaszow -- requisitioning more lumber, cement and hardware. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION OFFICE, PLASZOW - DAY \nPlaszow prisoners load the requisitioned building supplies -- the lumber, cement and hardware -- onto trucks. \nEXT/INT. WAREHOUSE, CRACOW - DAY \nThe trucks parked not at Schindler's sub-camp, but at the loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse in Cracow. Inside the building can be glimpsed all kinds of Plaszow goods: clothes, food, construction equipment, furniture. \nCheckbook laid out on the hood of his Mercedes, Schindler pays for the requested materials a second time -- this time with a check made out to Amon Goeth personally -- and hands it over to his bagman, Hujar. \nEXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP FIELD - DAY \nSome SS architects groan over a set of blueprints. Schindler and an SS officer walk by. \nSS OFFICER You have the Poles beat the Czechs, you have the Czechs beat the Poles, that way everybody stays in line. \nSCHINDLER All I have is Jews. \nHe shrugs, Too bad, what're you going to do? The SS guy has to think. Yeah, that's a problem. Two huge leashed dogs yank another SS man across their path. \nEXT. D.E.F. - DAY \nAs five hundred Plaszow prisoners are marched back onto the grounds of D.E.F., any hope they may have had of a more lenient environment is quickly dashed. The place -- completed -- looks like a fortress: barbed-wire, towers, SS guards and dogs. \nINT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY \nWhere once they glimpsed the not too threatening figure of Oskar Schindler strolling through the factory, the workers who dare glance up now find armed guards moving past. And further up, behind the wall of windows, Schindler moving around, entertaining SS officer. \nINT. GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT \nThe Rosner brothers in evening clothes, Leo on accordion, Henry on violin, playing a Strauss melody, trying to keep it muted, inoffensive. Few of the guests pay attention, which is fine with them. An SS officer chats with Schindler. \nLEO JOHN -- she's seventy years old, she's been there forever -- they bomb her house. Everything's gone. The furniture, everything. \nSCHINDLER (well aware the man is lying) Thank God she wasn't there. \nSchindler, with yet another girl on his arm, endures the officer's lies while sweeping the room with his eyes. \nLEO JOHN I was thinking maybe you could help her out. Some plates and mugs, some stew pots, I don't know. Say half a gross of everything? \nSchindler looks at him for the first time, knowingly. \nSCHINDLER She run an orphanage, your aunt? \nLEO JOHN She's old. What she can't use maybe she can sell. \nSchindler's girl excuses herself to get a drink. \nNot daring to look up, all the worker sees of Goeth is the starched cuff of his shirt. \nLEVARTOV Hinges, sir. \nThe rabbi-turned-metalworker gestures with his head to a pile of hinges on the floor. Goeth nods. And in a tone more like a friend than anything else -- \nGOETH I got some workers coming in tomorrow... Where the hell they from again? \nGOLDBERG Yugoslavia. \nGOETH Yugoslavia. I got to make room. \nHe shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch. \nGOETH Make me a hinge. \nAs Goeth times him, Rabbi Levartov works at making a hinge as though his life depended on it -- which it does -- cutting the pieces, wrenching them together, smoothing the edges, all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking away. \nHe finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the floor. \nForty seconds. \nGOETH Another. \nAgain the rabbi works feverishly -- cutting, crimping, sanding, hearing the seconds ticking in his head -- and finishing in thirty-five. Goeth nods, impressed. \nGOETH That's very good. What I don't understand, though, is -- you've been working since what, about six this morning? Yet such a small pile of hinges? \nHe understands perfectly. So does Levartov; he has just crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds. Goeth stands him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders. He pulls out his pistol, puts it to the rabbi's head and pulls the trigger... click. \nGOETH (mumble) Christ -- \nAnnoyed, Goeth extracts the bullet-magazine, slaps it back in and puts the barrel back to the man's head. He pulls the trigger again... and again there's a click. \nGOETH God damn it -- \nHe slams the weapon across Levartov's face and the rabbi slumps dazed to the floor. Looking up into Goeth's face, he knows it's not over. As Goeth walks away -- \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. BARRACKS - CONTINUED - NIGHT \nTight on Schindler, a pensive nod, then a shrug. \nSCHINDLER The guy can turn out a hinge in less than a minute? Why the long story? \nINT. D.E.F. - DAY \nRabbi Levartov, brought over to D.E.F., works at a table with several others. As Schindler strolls by, the rabbi dares to speak -- \nLEVARTOV Thank you, sir. \nSchindler has to think a moment before he can figure out who the grateful man is. \nSCHINDLER Oh, yeah. You're welcome. \nEXT. PLASZOW - DAY \nA dead chicken dangling from Hujar's hand, evidence of some kind. Goeth slowly pacing before a work detail of twenty or so men standing still, silent, in a row. \nGOETH Nobody knows who stole the chicken. A man walks around with a chicken, nobody notices this. \nNo one confesses. Goeth nods, All right, takes a rifle from a guard and shoots one of the workers at random. With this added incentive, he waits for someone to tell him who stole the chicken. No one does. \nGOETH Still nobody knows. \nHe shrugs, Okay, points the rifle at another worker -- and a boy of fourteen, shuddering and weeping, steps out of line. \nGOETH There we go. \nGoeth goes over to the boy, and, like a distant relative to a small child, tries to get him to look at his face. \nGOETH It was you? You committed this crime? \nBOY No, sir. \nGOETH You know who, though. \nThe boy nods, weeps, screams -- \nBOY Him! \nHe's pointing at the dead man. And Goeth astonishes the entire assembly of workers and guards by believing the boy. \nHe returns the rifle to the guard and walks away. Hujar stares after him, then knowingly at the boy. \nEXT. PLASZOW - DAY \nA truck being loaded with supplies. Schindler signs for it and, appearing as rushed as he always does, returns the clipboard to Stern. \nSCHINDLER Yeah, sure, bring him over. \nINT. D.E.F. - DAY \nStern's look is all innocence, but Schindler knows better. \nSCHINDLER You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time? I know. \nSTERN (with concern) Are you losing money? \nSCHINDLER No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point. \nSTERN What other point is -- \nSCHINDLER (interrupts; yells) It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally. \nSilence. Schindler tries to settle down. Then -- \nSCHINDLER You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people -- he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right. There'd be just the good aspects of him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money... \nSTERN And killing. \nSCHINDLER I'll admit it's a weakness. I don't think he enjoys it. (pause) All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it? \nSTERN There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office. \nBut it isn't Stern who needs convincing; it's Schindler himself. It's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear to Stern. Schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, or at the fact that he's allowed Stern to place him right in the middle of it. He turns to leave, hesitates. He conducts a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it: \nSCHINDLER Perlman, husband and wife. \nHe unstraps his watch, hands it to Stern. \nSCHINDLER Give it to Goldberg, have him send them over. \nHe leaves. \nEXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT \nDistant music, Brahms' lullaby, from the Rosner Brothers way down by the women's barracks calming the inhabitants. Up here on the balcony, Schindler and Goeth, the latter so drunk he can barely stand up, stare out over Goeth's dark kingdom. \nSCHINDLER They don't fear us because we have the power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him killed, we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. That's not power, though, that's justice. That's different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill -- and we don't. That's power. That's what the emperors had. A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die... and the emperor pardons him. This worthless man. He lets him go. That's power. That's power. \nIt seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the merciful emperor, holds some appeal to Goeth. Perhaps, as he stares out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering what the power Schindler describes might feel like. \nEventually, he glances over drunkenly, and almost smiles. \nSCHINDLER Amon the Good. \nEXT. STABLES - PLASZOW - DAY \nA stable boy works to ready Goeth's horse before he arrives. \nHe sticks a bridle into its mouth, throws a riding blanket onto its back, drags out the saddle Schindler bought Goeth. \nBefore he can finish, though, Goeth is there. The boy tries to hide his panic; he knows others have been shot for less. \nSTABLE BOY I'm sorry, sir, I'm almost done. \nGOETH Oh, that's all right. \nAs Goeth waits, patiently it seems, whistling to himself, the stable boy tries to mask his confusion. \nEXT. PLASZOW - DAY \nGoeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high in the saddle. But everywhere he looks, it seems, he's confronted with stoop-shouldered sloth. He forces himself to smile benevolently. \nINT. GOETH'S VILLA - DAY \nGoeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride. A worker with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway. \nMORE TO THE FLOOR -- \nWORKER I have to report, sir, I've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub. \nGoeth steps past him to take a look. The worker is almost shaking, he's so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects to receive. \nGOETH What are you using? \nWORKER Soap, sir. \nGOETH (incredulous) Soap? Not lye? \nThe worker hasn't a defense for himself. Goeth's hand drifts down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster. He stares at the worker. He so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand it, right here, right in the bathroom, put some more stains on the porcelain. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. \nThen gestures grandly. \nGOETH Go ahead, go on, leave. I pardon you. \nThe worker hurries out with his pail and cloth. Goeth just stands there for several moments -- trying to feel the power of emperors he's supposed to be feeling. But he doesn't feel it. All he feels is stupid. \nEXT. GOETH'S VILLA - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nThe worker hurries across the dying lawn outside the villa. \nHe dares a glance back, and at that moment, a hand with a gun appears out the bathroom window and fires. \nEXT. BARRACKS, PLASZOW - NIGHT \nSCHINDLER I'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might. I want you to be aware of that. \nGESTAPO 1 We'll risk it. \nSchindler glances beyond them to a point outside his office, to Klonowska. She nods, she knows what to do, she'll make the phone calls, call in the favors. \nSCHINDLER All right, sure, it's a nice day, I'll go for a drive with you guys. \nHe snuffs out his cigarette. \nINT. GESTAPO CAR - MOVING - DAY \nSettled comfortably in the backseat, Schindler glances idly out the window. As the car makes a turn, though, he looks back. Apparently he expected it to turn the other way. \nSCHINDLER Where are we going? \nThe guys up front don't answer. Concern, for the first time, registers on Schindler's face. The car approaches a building block long with an ominous sameness to the windows. \nINT. MONTELUPICH PRISON - CRACOW - DAY \nSchindler is made to empty his pockets, his money, cigarettes, everything. Around him clerks speak in whispers, as if raised voices might set off head-splitting echoes along the narrow monotonous corridors. \nINT. MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY \nHe's led down a flight of stairs into a claustrophobic tunnel. He's taken past darkened cells. Past shadowy figures crouched in corners and on the floor. \nINT. CELL, MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY \nA water bucket. A waste bucket. No windows. This is not a cell for dignitaries; this arrest is different. \nSchindler, incongruous with the dank surroundings in his double-breasted suit, slowly paces back and forth before his cellmate, a soldier who looks like he's been here forever, his greatcoat pulled up around his ears for warmth. \nSCHINDLER I violated the Race and Resettlement Act. Though I doubt they can point out the actual provision to me. (pause) I kissed a Jewish girl. \nSchindler forces a smile. His cellmate just stares. Now there's a crime; much more impressive, much more serious, than his own. \nINT. OFFICE - MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY \nIn a stiff-backed chair sits a very unlikely defender of racial improprieties -- Amon Goeth. To an impassive SS colonel behind a desk, Goeth tries to highlight extenuating circumstances: \nGOETH He likes women. He likes good-looking women. He sees a good-looking woman, he doesn't think. This guy has so many women. They love him. He's married, he's got all these women. All right, she was Jewish, he shouldn't have done it. But you didn't see this girl. I saw this girl. This girl was very good-looking. \nGoeth tries to read the guy behind the desk, but his face is like a wall. \nGOETH They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews. You work closely with them like I do, you see this. They have this power, it's like a virus. Some of my men are infected with this virus. They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment, because this is as real as typhus. I see this all the time. \nGoeth shifts in his chair; he knows he's not getting anywhere with this guy. He switches tacts: \nGOETH It's a matter of money? We can discuss that. That'd be all right with me. \nIn the silence that follows, Goeth realizes he has made a serious error in judgment. This man sitting soberly before him is one of that rare breed -- the unbribable official. \nSS COLONEL You're offering me a bribe? \nGOETH A \"bribe?\" No, no, please come on... a gratuity. \nSuddenly the man stands up and salutes, which thoroughly confuses Goeth since Goeth is his inferior in rank. But he isn't saluting Goeth, he's saluting the officer who has just stepped into the room behind him. \nSCHERNER Sit down. \nThe colonel sits back down. Scherner pulls up a chair next to Goeth. \nSCHERNER Hello, Amon. \nGOETH Sir. \nScherner smiles and allows Goeth to shake his hand, but it's clear, even to Goeth himself, that he has fallen from grace. \nINT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - NIGHT \nA tall, thin, gray Waffen SS officer has a request for the Rosner brothers. \nSS OFFICER I want to hear \"Gloomy Sunday\" again. \nHe's drunk, morose; it seems unlikely he'll be on his feet much longer. Indeed, as Henry and Leo Rosner begin the son -- an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits suicide for love -- the field officer staggers over to a chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it. \nSCHERNER We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar, you should kiss us, not them. \nGoeth laughs too loud, drawing a weary glance from Scherner. \nSchindler smiles good-naturedly. He's out, a little worse for wear perhaps, a little more subdued than usual. Taking him away from the others, taking him into his confidence -- \nGOETH God forbid you ever get a real taste for Jewish skirt. There's no future in it. No future. They don't have a future. And that's not just good old- fashioned Jew-hating talk. It's policy now. \nTHE THIN GRAY SS OFFICER is back in front of the musicians, swaying precariously, a drink in his hand -- \nSS OFFICER \"Gloomy Sunday\" again. \nAgain they play the song. Again he staggers across the crowded room to his chair in the corner, paying no attention to the visiting Commandant from Treblinka or anybody else -- \nTREBLINKA GUY -- We can process at Treblinka, if everything is working? I don't know, maybe two thousand units a day. \nHe shrugs like it's nothing, or with modesty, it's unclear. \nExcept for the clothes of the working class clientele, the scene is reminiscent of the SS nightclub in Cracow: \nSchindler, the great entertainer, working his way around the tables making sure everybody's got enough to drink, making sure everybody's happy. A guy at a table with a girl gestures him over. \nBRINNLITZ GUY 2 Oskar - my friend Lena. \nSCHINDLER How do you do? (to them both) What can I get you, what're you drinking? \nBRINNLITZ GUY 2 Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it? \nSCHINDLER Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good. \nBRINNLITZ GUY 2 Now you're back. \nSCHINDLER Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you. \nHe gestures to the bartender to refill his friend's and his date's drinks, pats the guy on the shoulder and wanders over to the next table. \nGIRL Who is he? \nThe guy has to think; not because he doesn't know, but because his old friend Oskar is so many things it's hard to know which description to use. Finally -- \nBRINNLITZ GUY 2 He's a salesman. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nA woman asleep in the bed. The girl from the bar. In his robe, at the window, Schindler calmly smokes as he stares out at the NIGHT \nEXT. BRINNLITZ - DAWN \nThe town, off in the distance, nestled against the mountains. \nThe sun, just coming up. Closer, here, ramshackle structures, a long abandoned factory of some kind. \nSchindler, in leather riding gear, climbs down off a Moto- Guzzi motorcycle. He slowly wanders around, peers in through broken windows, wanders around some more. \nTight on his face, torn between conflicting choices, or realizing there's no choice, or only one choice, and hating it. \nSCHINDLER Goddamn it. \nEXT. BALCONY, GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY \nSchindler and Goeth on the balcony of the villa, drinking. \nGOETH You want these people. \nSCHINDLER These people, my people, I want my people. \nGoeth considers his friend, greatly puzzled. Below them lies the camp, still operating, at least for now, until the shipments can be arranged. \nGOETH What are you, Moses? What is this? Where's the money in this? What's the scam? \nSCHINDLER It's good business. \nGOETH Oh, this is \"good business\" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make any sense. \nSCHINDLER Look -- \nGOETH You're not telling me something. \nSCHINDLER It's good for me -- I know them, I'm familiar with them. It's good for you -- you'll be compensated. It's good for the Army. You know what I'm going to make? \nSCHINDLER Artillery shells. Tank shells. They need that. Everybody's happy. \nGOETH Yeah, sure. \nGoeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to believe. He's sure Schindler's got something else going on here he's not telling him. \nGOETH You're probably scamming me somehow. If I'm making a hundred, you got to be making three. \nSchindler admits it with a shrug. \nGOETH If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually. But how? \nSCHINDLER I just told you. \nGOETH You did, but you didn't. \nGoeth studies him, searching for the real answer in his face. \nHe can't find it. \nGOETH Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out. \nSCHINDLER All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you. What's a person worth to you. \nGoeth thinks about it in the silence. Then a slow nod to himself. He's going to make some money out of this even if he can't figure it out. He smiles. \nGOETH What's one worth to you? That's the question. \nHARD CUT TO: \nTHE KEYS OF A TYPEWRITER slapping a name onto a list -- 184 184 LEVARTOV -- the letters the size of buildings, the sound as \nSCHINDLER You can finish that page. \nStern resumes where he left off, but then hesitates again. \nThere's something he doesn't understand. \nSTERN What did Goeth say? You just told him how many you needed? \nIt doesn't sound right. And Schindler doesn't answer. He's avoided telling Stern the details of the deal struck with Goeth, and balks telling him now. Finally awkwardly -- \nSCHINDLER I'm buying them. I'm paying him. I give him money, he gives me the people. (pause) If you were still working for me I'd expect you to talk me out of it, it's costing me a fortune. \nStern had no idea. And has no idea now what to say. \nSchindler shrugs like it's no big deal, but Stern knows it is. \nSCHINDLER Give him the list, he'll sign it, he'll get the people ready. I have to go back to Brinnlitz, to take care of things on that end, I'll see you there. \nStern is really overcome by what this man is doing. What he can't figure out is why. Silence. And then -- \nSCHINDLER Finish the page. \nStern turns back, does as he's told. Schindler drinks. \nNothing but the sound of the typewriter keys. And then nothing at all. The page is done. The rest will die. \nINT. TOWN COUNCIL HALL - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nSchindler in front of a large assembly, party pin in his lapel, as usual, imposing SS guards on either side of him. \nSCHINDLER This is my home. \nHe looks out over his audience, the citizens of Brinnlitz, local government officials, many of them appearing bewildered by him or the \"situation\" that has arisen. \nSCHINDLER I was born here, my wife was born here, my mother is buried here, this is my home. \nHis estranged wife is there. So are the guys he was drinking with. \nSCHINDLER Do you really think I'd bring a thousand Jewish criminals into my home? \nEveryone seems to breathe sighs of relief as if they've been waiting for him to say this, to dispel the disturbing rumors they've heard. \nSCHINDLER These are skilled munitions workers -- they are essential to the war effort -- \nThe noise begins, his audience's angry reaction. Raising pitch of his own voice -- \nSCHINDLER -- It is my duty to supervise them -- and it is your duty to allow me -- \nHe barely gets it all out before the protests drown him out. \nThe uproar reaches such a clamoring level there's no point in his continuing. \nGOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY \nGoeth, at his writing desk, endures the bureaucratic tedium of signing memoranda, transport orders, requisitions. He comes to Schindler's list, initials each page and signs the last with no more interest than the others. He hands the whole stack of paperwork to Marcel Goldberg, Personnel Clerk, Executor of Lists, Gangster. \nINT. OFFICE, ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - PLASZOW - DAY \nGoldberg has the signature page of the list in a typewriter. \nHe carefully aligns it and types his own name in a space allowed by the bottom margin. \nEXT. SCHINDLER'S BRINNLITZ FACTORY SITE - DAY \nAt a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler signs his name to Reich Main Office directives, Evacuation Board and Department of Economy form, Armaments contracts. \nAround him, the new camp is taking shape: Electric fences are going up, watchtowers, barracks; shipments of heavy equipment, huge Hilo machines, are being off-loaded from flatbed train cars; SS engineers stand around frowning at the lay of the land, some drainage problem no doubt. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY \nA train full of people destined for Auschwitz pulls away from the platform. As Goldberg gathers his paperwork, a prisoner approaches him. \nPRISONER Am I on the list? \nGOLDBERG What list is that? \nHe knows what the prisoner means and the prisoner knows he knows. He means Schindler's List. \nGOLDBERG The good list? Well, that depends, doesn't it? \nThe prisoner knows that, too, and discreetly turns over to Goldberg a couple of diamonds from the lining of his coat. \nINT. GOLDBERG'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - NIGHT \nNames on a notepad, the first few crossed out. Goldberg types the next name onto a page of The List, squeezing it into the upper margin, and crosses that one out on the pad. \nHe rolls the page down, types another name, tires of the exacting task, tears the handwritten page of names from the notepad, crumples it and throws it away. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nSchindler, on his way back to his hotel after a night of drinking, is jumped by three guys, wrestled to the ground and brutally kicked. \nAs the forms of his attackers move away, he catches a glimpse of one of them -- his \"friend\" who admired his car when he first arrived back in town. \nSchindler comes out of his office and, passing Stern's desk, mumbles -- \nSCHINDLER They're in Auschwitz. \nBefore Stern can react, Schindler is out the door. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nAs he strides across the factory courtyard toward his motorcycle, Schindler is intercepted by some Gestapo men who have just emerged from their car. \nGESTAPO Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested. \nSCHINDLER (pause) I'm sorry to hear that. \nGESTAPO There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk. \nSCHINDLER I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back. I have to leave. \nThe looks on their faces tell him he's not going anywhere. \nSCHINDLER All right, okay, let's talk. \nGESTAPO In Breslau. \nSCHINDLER Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now. \nThese guys are serious. \nEXT. AUSCHWITZ - DAY \nA young silver-haired doctor moves slowly along rows of Schindler's women, considering each with a pleasant smile even as he makes his selections, with tiny gestures, for the death chambers. He pauses in front of one. \nYOUNG DOCTOR How old are you, Mother? \nShe could lie, and he'd have killed her for it. She could tell the truth, and he'd have her killed for that, too. \nWOMAN (pause) Sir, a mistake's been made. We're not supposed to be here, we work for Oskar Schindler. We're Schindler Jews. \nThe doctor nods pensively, understandingly, it seems. Then -- \nYOUNG DOCTOR And who on earth is Oskar Schindler? \nHe glances around hopelessly. One of the SS guards who accompanied the women from Plaszow speaks up -- \nPLASZOW GUARD He had a factory in Cracow. Enamelware. \nThe doctor nods again as if the information were valuable, as if it meant something to him. It doesn't. \nYOUNG DOCTOR A potmaker? \nHe smiles to himself and gets on with the \"examination,\" this woman to this line, this other one to that. \nINT. CELL - SS PRISON, BRESLAU - DAY \nIn a dank cell, in uniform, Amon Goeth waits. Schindler is on his way, hopefully. Maybe he's already here. Schindler will vouch for him. Schindler will straighten this out. \nINT. SS PRISON, BRESLAU - DAY \nIn a large room, Schindler sits before a panel of twelve sober Bureau V investigators and a judge of the SS court. \nINVESTIGATOR Everything you say will be held in confidence. You are not under investigation. You are not under investigation. Mr. Goeth is. He is being held on charges of embezzlement and racketeering. You're here at his request to corroborate his denials. Our information onto his financial speculations comes from many sources. On his behalf there is only you. We know you are close friends. We know this is hard for you. But we must ask you -- \nSCHINDLER He stole our country blind. \nINT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nIn Schindler's absence, the workers attempt to operate the unfamiliar machines, to figure out the unfamiliar process of manufacturing artillery shells. There's movement, there's noise, the machines are running, but little is being produced. \nUntersturmfuhrer Jose Liepold, the Commandant of Schindler's new subcamp, moves through the factory conducting an impromptu inspection. He points out to a guard a kid no more nine, sorting casings at a work table, and another boy, ten or eleven, carrying a box. \nEXT. BARRACKS - AUSCHWITZ - NIGHT \nMila and another woman cross back toward their barracks carrying a large heavy pot of broth. Not more than a hundred meters away stand the birch trees and crematoria, the smoke pluming even now, at NIGHT out of the darkness appear \"apparitions,\" skeletal figures which surround the two women, or rather the soup pot between them, dipping little metal cups into it, over and over. \nToo startled to speak, Mila can only stare. The apparitions clamor around the pot a moment more, than furtively slip back into the same darkness from which they came. Mila and the other woman exchange a glance. The pot is empty. \nMILA Where's Schindler now? \nINT. HOSS' HOUSE - AUSCHWITZ - NIGHT \nIn his en, over cognac, Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Hoss considers the documents Schindler has brought: the list, the travel papers, the Evacuation Board authorization. Hoss nods at them, then at Schindler. \nHOSS You're right, a clerical error has bee made. (pause) Let me offer you this in apology for the inconvenience. I have a shipment coming in tomorrow, I'll cut you three hundred from it. New ones. These are fresh. \nSchindler seems to think about the offer as he nurses his drink. It's \"tempting.\" \nHOSS The train comes, we turn it around, it's yours. \nSCHINDLER I appreciate it. I want these. \nThe ones on the list in Hoss' hand. Silence. Then: \nHOSS You shouldn't get stuck on names. \nLEVARTOV Good, sir. \nSchindler nods, watches him work, eventually glances away. \nSCHINDLER Sun's going down. \nLevartov, following Schindler's gaze, nods uncertainly. \nSCHINDLER It is Friday, isn't it? \nLEVARTOV Is it? \nSCHINDLER You should be preparing for the Sabbath, shouldn't you? What are you doing here? \nLevartov just stares. It's been years since he's been allowed, indeed inclined, to perform Sabbath rites. \nSCHINDLER I've got some wine in my office. Why don't we go over there, I'll give it to you. Come on, let's go. \nSchindler heads off. The rabbi keeps staring. Schindler gestures back to him, offering casually -- \nSCHINDLER Come on. \nLevartov looks around. Finally, he hangs up his goggles and follows after Schindler. \nINT. WORKERS BARRACKS - NIGHT \nUnder the shadow of a watchtower, among the roof-high tiers of bunks strung with laundry, Levartov recites Kiddush over a cup of wine to workers gathered around him. \nINT. GUARDS BARRACKS - NIGHT \nOn their bunks, the guards relax with schnapps, cards and magazines. One of them becomes distracted by a distant sound. Some of the others begin to hear it. \nGUARD What is that? \nConversations cease. The barracks gradually becomes quiet, silent, all the guards straining to hear. It sounds like... singing. It sounds like Yiddish singing. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHT \nOn a watchtower, a night sentry, unsure where it's coming from, listens to the distant singing. It seems like it's emanating from the surrounding hills, from the trees. \nINT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - SAME TIME - NIGHT \nAt his small desk, Liepold is typing a letter, denouncing Schindler most likely. The pounding keys bury all other sounds but when he pauses to reread what he's typed, he hears it, the singing, faint, far away. He goes to his window, peers out, listens for a moment more, then hears nothing. \nOnly the night creatures. \nINT. APATMENT BUILDING - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nThe door to an apartment opens from the inside revealing Emilie Schindler. She coolly considers the visitor on her doorstep, her estranged husband, looking great as usual, bottle of wine in his hand, smiling as if nothing is wrong between them, as if nothing is wrong in the entire world. \nINT. EMILIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe two of them at the kitchen table in a modest apartment, drinking, at least he is. He's trying to ask her something, but he's not sure how to put it, he wants to get it right. \nFinally the words just tumble out -- \nSCHINDLER I want you to come work for me. \nThere, he's said it. But the bewildered look on Emilie's face wonders, That's what was hard for you to say? \nSCHINDLER You don't have to live with me, I wouldn't ask that. (pause) It's a nice place. You'd like it. It looks awful. You get used to that. \nShe's the only woman he's even known who could make him nervous just sitting across a table from him, saying nothing. \nSCHINDLER All right -- (now he'll be honest) We can spend time together that way. We can see each other, see how it goes -- without the strain of -- whatever you want to call it when a man, a husband and a wife go out to dinner, go have a drink, go to a party, you know. This way we'll see each other at work, there we are, same place, we see how it goes... \nHis voice trails off. A shrug adds, What do you think? She doesn't answer, but she does love him. He loves her, too. \nIt really is a shame they're not right for each other and never will be. \nINT. OFFICES - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nStern glances up from his work; Schindler and Emilie have come in and are walking toward the accountant's desk. He gets up. \nSCHINDLER Itzhak Stern, Emilie Schindler. My wife. \nLike the doormen and waiters of Cracow, Stern too never imagined Schindler was married and has trouble hiding his astonishment now. He extends his hand to her. \nSTERN How do you do? \nEMILIE How do you do? \nSTERN Stern is my accountant and friend. \nIt sounds strange to Stern hearing Schindler actually say it. \nHe's never said it before. \nSCHINDLER Emilie's offered to work in the clinic. To... work there. \nHe's not sure what she's going to do there, she's not a nurse or a doctor. \nSTERN (to her) That's very generous of you. \nLIEPOLD Department W does not forbid my presence on the factory floor. That is a lie. \nHe waves a document at Schindler, throws it at him. \nSchindler doesn't bother picking it up. Instead, pointing at the boy, he yells to Liepold -- \nSCHINDLER Shoot him. Shoot him! \nLiepold is so startled by the command, he doesn't shoot. He doesn't lower the gun, though, either. \nSCHINDLER Shoot him without a hearing. Come on. \nHis finger is on the trigger, Liepold is torn, frustrated, hating the situation he has created. As the moments without a blast stretch out, both and Schindler begin to settle down. \nLIEPOLD He sabotaged the machine. \nSchindler glances to the boy. Then at the silent Hilo beside him. Part of it is blackened from an electrical fire. To the boy, concerned -- \nSCHINDLER The machine's broken? \nThe boy, too terrified to speak, nods. \nLIEPOLD The prisoner is under the jurisdiction of Section D. I'll preside over the hearing. \nSCHINDLER But the machine. \nLiepold glances to him. He seems almost distraught by the destruction of the machine, Schindler. \nSCHINDLER The machine is under the authorization of the Armaments Inspectorate. I will preside over the hearing. \nLiepold isn't sure that's correct, but he has no documentation, at least not on him, to refute it. \nINT. FACTORY - NIGHT \nIn the machine-tool section, a \"judicial table\" has been set up. At it sit Schindler, Liepold, two other SS officers, and an attractive German girl, a stenographer. The \"saboteur,\" the boy, Janek, stands before the court. \nJANEK I'm unfamiliar with the Hilo machines. I don't know why I was assigned there. \nCommandant Liepold was watching me trying to figure it out. I switched it on and it blew up. I didn't do anything. All I did was turn it on. \nGone tonight is Schindler's usual shop-floor familiarity. He studies the boy solemn-faced. \nSCHINDLER If you're not skilled at armaments work, you shouldn't be here. \nJANEK I'm a lathe operator. \nSchindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his hand and gets up. He comes around and paces slowly before the boy. Eventually, Janek dares to speak again -- \nJANEK Sir? \nSchindler glances up at him distractedly. \nJANEK I did adjust the pressure controls. \nSchindler stops, looks to the panel, and back to the boy. \nSCHINDLER What? \nJANEK I know that much about them. Somebody had set the pressure controls wrong. I had to adjust -- \nSchindler slams the back of his hand so hard across Janek's face, the boy almost falls. He's stunned. So are the others at the table. They've never seen such violence from the Direktor. He roars -- \nSCHINDLER The stupidity of these people. I wish they were capable of sabotaging a machine. \nSchindler's hand comes up again and Janek recoils, expecting another blow. Schindler manages to hold it. \nSCHINDLER Get him out of my sight. \nA guard escorts the prisoner away. The panel members glance among themselves. Is that it? Schindler faces them and groans in dismay. \nINT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nLiepold at his desk, typing again. This time there is no doubt he is composing a letter denouncing Schindler. \nINT. HOUSE - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nSchindler and Emilie, her arm in his, stand around like unwanted guests at the party. They probably are. Him anyway. The other guests include local politicians who fought and failed to keep his camp out of Brinnlitz. \nWhenever his glance meets one of theirs, they smile tightly. \nSCHINDLER (to Emilie) Isn't this nice. \nIt's not at all nice. He feels out of place, a feeling he's not accustomed to. Fortunately, a man in uniform, someone Schindler can relate to, approaches cheerfully, his hand outstretched. \nRASCH Oskar, good of you to come. \nSCHINDLER Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie. \nRASCH How do you do? \nEMILIE You have a lovely home. It is nice. Big. \nThe man lives well. \nAround the abandoned boxcar, in the gruesome cold, stand Schindler, Emilie, a doctor, some workers and some SS guards, watching, waiting. \nPfefferberg steps back. Sledge hammers pound at locks. \nHands pull at levers. The doors begin to slide. \nOut of darkness, from inside the boxcar as the doors slide open, Schindler's face is revealed, tight. He stares for an interminable moment before walking slowly away. \nInside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs, a pyramid of corpses, frozen white. \nFrom a distance, a tableau: the boxcar, the workers and guards and Emilie outside it, Schindler, off to himself several steps away, all of them still as statues. \nEXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - OUTSIDE BRINNLITZ - DAY \nBeyond a country church, among the stone markers of a small cemetery, walk Schindler and a priest. \nSCHINDLER It's been suggested I cremate them in my furnaces. As a Catholic I will not. As a human being I will not. \nThe priest nods; he seems relatively empathic. He offers an alternative -- \nPRIEST There's an area beyond the church reserved for the burial of suicides. Maybe I can convince the parish council to allow them to be buried there. \nSCHINDLER These aren't suicides. \nThe priest knows that. But he also knows that the provisions of Canon Law regarding who can and cannot be buried in consecrated ground are narrow. \nSCHINDLER These are victims of a great murder. \nINT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nIn a corner of the factory, workers hammer at pine lumber. \nThey are building coffins. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nAs workers harness horses to carts, others hoist the coffins into them. Schindler is there, watching. He glances up at one of the guard towers, expecting, perhaps, to be felled by a bullet. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nBeyond the wire, Rabbi Levartov leads the horse-drawn carts. \nAround him walk a minyan -- a quorum of ten males necessary for the rite. A few guards lag behind. \nINT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - SAME TIME - DAY \nWork continues, but it's apparent in their eyes they are only physically here; in spirit they are all walking alongside the carts, one great moral force. \nThe roar of a machine suddenly, inexplicably, dies. Then another. And another. Schindler, standing at the main power panel, pulls the last of the switches, and the factory plunges into absolute silence. \nEXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY \nJust beyond the perimeter of the Catholic cemetery, the minyan quickly and quietly recites Kaddish over the dead as their coffins are lowered into individual graves. \nThen, there is only a low breathing of wind. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - ANOTHER DAY \nAmon Goeth, in civilian clothes, emerges from a car. His eyes, sallow from inadequate sleep, sweep across the fortified compound with envy. It's a nice place Oskar's got here. \nINT. OFFICE - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - SAME TIME - DAY \nStern, at a window, stares down at Goeth beside his car. Softly, gravely -- \nSTERN What's he doing here? \nSchindler appears beside Stern, glances down. He's lost weight, Goeth. The old suit he wears seems too big for him. \nAlone down there he seems disoriented. \nSCHINDLER Probably looking for a handout. \nINT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nWorkers glance up at a horrible apparition from the pit of their foulest dreams -- Amon Goeth crossing through the factory. \nSchindler, his arm around the killer's shoulder as if he were a long lost brother, leads him across the shop-floor, proudly pointing out to him the huge thundering Hilo machines. \nINT. OFFICES, BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nSchindler takes an old suitcase from his office closet, sets it on his desk, snaps it open revealing clothes, Goeth's uniforms, his medals. The ex-Oberstrumfuhrer touches the fabric gently, then glances up gratefully to his friend. \nGOETH Thank you. \nINT. OUTER OFFICES - BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nBeyond the frosted glass of Schindler's office door, Stern can see the wavering forms of the two Nazi Party members sharing cognac and stories. \nINT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY \nWarmed by cognac and friendship, Goeth comes through the factory again carrying the suitcase, Schindler at his side, steering him to some degree. \nGoeth's hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a bothersome fly. But it isn't a fly. One of the workers has spit on him. He turns in disbelief. \nLEVARTOV We've written a letter trying to explain things. In case you're captured. Every worker has signed it. \nSchindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the typewritten text and continuing for several pages. He pockets it, this new list of names. \nSCHINDLER Thank you. \nStern steps forward and places a ring in Schindler's hand. \nIt's a gold band, like a wedding ring. Schindler notices an inscription inside it. \nSTERN It's Hebrew. It says, 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world.' \nSchindler slips the ring onto a finger, admires it a moment, nods his thanks, then seems to withdraw. \nSCHINDLER (to himself) I could've got more out... \nStern isn't sure he heard right. Schindler steps away from him, from his wife, from the car, from the workers. \nSCHINDLER (to himself) I could've got more... if I'd just... I don't know, if I'd just... I could've got more... \nSTERN Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you. Look at them. \nHe can't. \nSCHINDLER If I'd made more money... I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just... \nSTERN There will be generations because of what you did. \nSCHINDLER I didn't do enough. \nSTERN You did so much. \nSchindler starts to lose it, the tears coming. Stern, too. \nThe look on Schindler's face as his eyes sweep across the faces of the workers is one of apology, begging them to forgive him for not doing more. \nSCHINDLER This car. Goeth would've bought this car. Why did I keep the car? Ten people, right there, ten more I could've got. (looking around) This pin -- \nHe rips the elaborate Hakenkreus, the swastika, from his lapel and holds it out to Stern pathetically. \nSCHINDLER Two people. This is gold. Two more people. He would've given me two for it. At least one. He would've given me one. One more. One more person. A person, Stern. For this. One more. I could've gotten one more person I didn't. \nHe completely breaks down, weeping convulsively, the emotion he's been holding in for years spilling out, the guilt consuming him. \nSCHINDLER They killed so many people... (Stern, weeping too, embraces him) They killed so many people... \nFrom above, from a watchtower, Stern can be seen down below, trying to comfort Schindler. Eventually, they separate, and Schindler and Emilie climb into the Mercedes. It slowly pulls out through the gates of the camp. And drives away. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ - NIGHT \nA panzer emerges from the treeline well beyond the wire of the camp and just sits there growling like a beast. Suddenly it fires a shell at nothing in particular, at the night -- an exhibition of random spite -- then turns around and rolls back into the forest. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHT \nFrom a watchtower, a couple of workers, having witnessed the tank's display of impotent might, can make little sense of it. Below, many of the workers mill around the yard, waiting to be liberated. No one seems to know what else to do. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY \nSome Czech partisans emerge from the forest. They come down \nthe hill and casually approach the camp. Reaching the wire, they're met by Pfefferberg and some other workers, rifles slung over their shoulders. Through the fence -- \nPARTISAN It's all over. \nPFEFFERBERG We know. \nPARTISAN (pause) So what are you doing? You're free to go home. \nPFEFFERBERG When the Russians arrive. Until then we're staying here. \nThe partisan shrugs, Suit yourself, and wanders back toward the trees with his friends. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT \nFive headlights appear out of the night, five motorcycles marked with the SS Death's-head insignia. They turn onto the road leading to the camp gate and park, the riders shutting off the engines. \nSS NCO Hello? \nShapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp. \nSeveral armed and dangerous Jews. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - LATER - NIGHT \nAs the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed from the camp, the workers keep their rifles pointed at them. The NCO in charge lines the gas cans neatly back up against the wire. \nNCO IN CHARGE Thank you very much. \nHe climbs onto his motorcycle. The others climb onto theirs. \nAnd drive away. \nEXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAWN \n", "test1_input": "STERN Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well. In fact the worse things get the better you'll do. It was a \"pleasure.\" \nSCHINDLER The contracts? That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard. \nHe laughs loudly, uproariously. But then, just as abruptly as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside -- \nSCHINDLER You know anybody? \nStern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog. \nSCHINDLER Jews, yeah. Investors. \nSTERN (pause) Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale. \nSCHINDLER Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product. They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy. \nHe shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him. But not to Stern. \nSTERN Pots and pans. \nSCHINDLER (nodding) Something they can hold in their hands. \nStern studies him. This man is nothing more than a salesman with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most. \nSTERN I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that. \nSCHINDLER (a slow knowing nod) They should be. \nSilence. \nEXT. CRACOW - NIGHT \nA mason trowels mortar onto a brick. As he taps it into a place and scrapes off the excess cement, the image DRAINS OF COLOR. \nUnder lights, a crew of brick-layers is erecting a ten-foot wall where a street once ran unimpeded. \nEXT. STREET - CRACOW - DAY \nA young man emerges from an alley pocketing his Jewish armband. He crosses a street past German soldiers and trucks and climbs the steps of St. Mary's cathedral. \nINT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY \nA dark and cavernous place. A priest performing Mass to scattered parishioners. Lots of empty pews. \nThe young Polish Jew from the street, Poldek Pfefferberg, kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young man, Goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad inside a missal. Pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe polish he takes from his pocket. Whispered, bored -- \nGOLDBERG What's that? \nPFEFFERBERG You don't recognize it? Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for. \nGOLDBERG You asked for shoe polish. \nPFEFFERBERG My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army. But by the time it got there -- because of the cold -- it broke, the whole truckload. \nGOLDBERG (pause) So I'm responsible for the weather? \nPFEFFERBERG I asked for metal, you gave me glass. \nGOLDBERG This is not my problem. \nPFEFFERBERG Look it up. \nGoldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring Pfefferberg. \nPFEFFERBERG This is not your problem? Everybody wants to know who I got it from, and I'm going to tell them. \nGoldberg glances to Pfefferberg for the first time, and, greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and makes a notation in it. \nGOLDBERG Metal. \nHe flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he gets up, and leaves. \nINT. HOTEL - DAY \nPfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another black market middleman, the desk clerk. Both are wearing their armbands. Pfefferberg underlines figures on a little notepad of his own -- \nPFEFFERBERG Let's say this is what you give me. These are fees I have to pay some guys. This is my commission. This is what I bring you back in Occupation currency. \nThe clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over to Pfefferberg some outlawed Polish notes from an envelope when Schindler comes in from the street. The clerk puts the money away, gets Schindler his room key, waits for him to leave so he can finish his business with Pfefferberg... but Schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at Pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar. \nPFEFFERBERG That's a nice shirt. \nPfefferberg nods, Yeah, thanks, and waits for Schindler to leave; but he doesn't. Nor does he appear to hear the short burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the street. \nSCHINDLER You don't know where I could find a shirt like that. \nPfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of it. It's not wise doing business with a German who could have you arrested for no reason whatsoever. But there's something guileless about it. \nPFEFFERBERG Like this? \nSCHINDLER (nodding) There's nothing in the stores. \nThe clerk tries to discourage Pfefferberg from pursuing this transaction with just a look. Pfefferberg ignores it. \n", "test1_true": "SCHINDLER Nice things cost money. \nThe clerk tries to tell Pfefferberg again with a look that this isn't smart. \nPFEFFERBERG How many? \nSCHINDLER I don't know, ten or twelve. That's a good color. Dark blues, grays. \nSchindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, waiting for Pfefferberg to nod when it's enough. He's being overcharged, and he knows it, but Pfefferberg keeps pushing it, more. The look Schindler gives him lets him know that he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance at least, he'll let it go. He hands over the money and Pfefferberg hands over his notepad. \nPFEFFERBERG Write down your measurements. \nAs he writes down the information, Pfefferberg glances to the desk clerk and offers a shrug. As he writes -- \nSCHINDLER I'm going to need some other things. As things come up. \nEXT. GARDEN - SCHERNER'S RESIDENCE - CRACOW - DAY \nAs Oberfuhrer Scherner and his daughter, in a wedding gown, dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand, the reception guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive lawn. \nCZURDA The SS doesn't own the trains, somebody's got to pay. Whether it's a passenger car or a livestock car, it doesn't matter -- which, by the way, you have to see. You have to set aside an afternoon, go down to the station and see this. \nOther SS and Army officers share the table with Czurda. \nSchindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and affections are directed to the blonde next to him, Ingrid. \nCZURDA So you got thousands of fares that have to be paid. Since it's the SS that's reserved the trains, logically they should pay. But this is a lot of money. (pause) The Jews. They're the ones riding the trains, they should pay. So you got Jews paying their own fares to ride on cattle cars to God knows where. They pay the SS full fare, the SS turns around, pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare, and pockets the difference. \nHe shrugs, There you have it. Brilliant. He glances off, sees something odd across the yard. Two horses, saddled-up, being led into the garden by a stable boy. \nSCHINDLER (to Ingrid) Excuse me. \nSchindler gets up from the table. Scherner, his wife and daughter and son-in-law stare at the horses; they're beautiful. \nSchindler appears, takes the reins from the stable boy, hands one set to the bride and the other to the groom. \nSCHINDLER There's nothing more sacred than marriage. No happier an occasion than one's wedding day. I wish you all the best. \nScherner hails a photographer. As the guy comes over with his camera, so does just about everybody else. Scherner insists Schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom. \nBig smiles. Flash. \nINT. STOREFRONT - CRACOW - DAY \nA neighborhood place. Bread, pastries, couple of tables. At one sits owner and a well-dressed man in his seventies, Max Redlicht. \nOWNER I go to the bank, I go in, they tell me my account's been placed in Trust. In Trust? What are they talking about, whose Trust? The Germans'. I look around. Now I see that everybody's arguing, they can't get to their money either. \nMAX REDLICHT This is true? \nOWNER I'll take you there. \nMax looks at the man not without sympathy. He's never heard of such a thing. It's really a bad deal. But then -- \nMAX REDLICHT Let me understand. The Nazis have taken your money. So because they've done this to you, you expect me to go unpaid. That's what you're saying. \nThe owner of the place just stares at Redlicht. \nMAX REDLICHT That makes sense to you? \nThe man doesn't answer. He watches Max get up and cross to the front door where he says something to two of his guys and leaves. The guys come in and start carting out anything of any value: cash register, a chair, a loaf of bread... \nEXT. CRACOW STREET - DAY \nMax strolls along the sidewalk, browsing in store windows. \nPeople inside and out nod hello, but they despise him, they fear him. \nJust as he's passing a synagogue, some men in long overcoats cross the street. Einsatzgruppen, they are an elite and wild bunch, one of six Special Chivalrous Duty squads assigned to Cracow. \nINT. STARAR BOZNICA SYNAGOGUE - SAME TIME - DAY \nThe Sabbath prayers of a congregation of Orthodox Jews are interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple. \nSeveral non-Orthodox Jews from the street, including Max Redlicht, are being herded inside by the Einsatz Boys. \nThey're made to stand before the Ark in two lines: Orthodox and non. One of the Einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment Torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly: \nEINSATZ NCO I want you to spit on it. I want you to walk past, spit on it, and stand over there. \nNo one does anything for a moment. The liberals from the street seem to say with their eyes, Come on, we're all too sophisticated for this; the others, with the beards and sidelocks, silently check with their rabbi. \nOne by one then they file past and spit on the scroll. The last two, the rabbi and Max Redlicht hesitate. They exchange a glance. The rabbi finally does it; the gangster doesn't. \nAfter a long tense silence. \nMAX REDLICHT I haven't been to temple must be fifty years. (to the rabbi) Nor have I been invited. \nThe Einsatz NCO glances from Max to the rabbi and smiles to himself. This is unexpected, this rift. \nMAX REDLICHT (to the rabbi) You don't approve of the way I make my living? I'm a bad man, I do bad things? \n", "test1_id": 3003, "test2_input": "EXT. GHETTO - DAY \nThe wheels of the last truck clear the portals at Lwowska Street and the Sonderkommandos jump down. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDINGS - DAWN \nFamilies are routed from their apartments. An appeal to be allowed to pack is answered with a rifle butt; an unannounced move to a desk drawer is countered with a shot. \nEXT. STREETS, GHETTO - DAWN \nSpilling out of the buildings, they're herded into lines without regard to family consideration; some other unfathomable system is at work here. The wailing protests of a woman to join her husband's line are abruptly cut off by a short burst of gunfire. \nEXT. HILLTOP - DAWN \nFrom here, the action down below seems staged, unreal; the rifle bursts no louder than caps. Dismounting, Schindler moves closer to the edge of the hill, curious. \nHis attention is drawn to a small distant figure, all in red, at the rear of one of the many columns. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nSmall red shoes against a forest of gleaming black boots. A Waffen SS man occasionally corrects the little girl's drift, fraternally it seems, nudging her gently back in line with the barrel of his rifle. A volley of shots echoes from up the street. \nEXT. HILLTOP - DAWN \nSchindler watches as the girl slowly wanders away unnoticed by the SS. Against the grays of the buildings and street she's like a moving red target. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nA truck thundering down the street obscures her for a moment. \nThen she's moving past a pile of bodies, old people executed in the street. \nEXT. HILLTOP - DAWN \nSchindler watches: she's so conspicuous, yet she keeps moving -- past crowds, past dogs, past trucks -- as though she were invisible. \nEXT. STREET - DAWN \nPatients in white gowns, and doctors and nurses in white, are herded out the doors of a convalescent hospital. The small figure in red moves past them. Shots explode behind her. \nEXT. HILLTOP - DAWN \nShort bursts of light flash throughout the ghetto like stars. \nSchindler, fixated on the figure in red, loses sight of her as she turns a corner. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN \nShe climbs the stairs. The building is empty. She steps inside an apartment and moves through it. It's been ransacked. As she crawls under the bed, the scene DRAINS of COLOR. \nThe gunfire outside sounds like firecrackers. \nEXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT \nNIGHT Silence. Schindler and Ingrid are gone. \nBelow, the ghetto lies like a void within the city, its perimeter and interior clearly distinguishable by darkness. \nOutside it, the lights of the rest of Cracow glimmer. \nINT. D.E.F. FACTORY - NIGHT \nTables and tools and enamelware scrap. The metal presses and lathes, still. The firing ovens, cold. The gauges at zero. \nAgainst the wall of windows overlooking the empty factory floor stands a figure, Schindler, in silhouette against the glass, black against white, not moving, just staring down. \nEXT. FOREST - PLASZOW - MORNING \nBloody wheelbarrows, stark against the tree line of a forest above the completed forced labor camp, PLASZOW. \nEXT. PLASZOW FORCED LABOR CAMP - MORNING \nNames on lists. Names called out. Tight on faces. \nGoldberg at one of several folding tables. The gangsterturned -- ghetto-cop is now the Lord of Lists inside Plaszow. \nHe and other listmakers call out names, accounting for those thousands who survived the liquidation of the ghetto and now stand before them in long straight rows. \nINT. GOETH'S BEDROOM, PLASZOW - MORNING \nAmon Goeth stirs, wakes, glances at the woman asleep beside him. Hungover, he drags himself slowly out of bed. \nEXT. GOETH'S BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING \nGoeth steps out onto the balcony in his undershirt and shorts and peers out across the labor camp, his labor camp, his kingdom. Satisfied with it, even amazed, he's reminiscent of Schindler looking down on his kingdom, his factory, as he loves to do, from his wall of glass. \nLife is great. Goeth reaches for a rifle. \nEXT. PLASZOW SAME TIME - MORNING \nWorkers loading quarry rock onto trolleys under Ukrainian guard and a low morning sun. Every so often, one glances with anticipation to the balcony of Goeth's \"villa\" -- which is in fact nothing more than a two-story stone house perched on a slight rise in the dry landscape. \nEXT. GOETH'S BALCONY - CONTINUED - MORNING \n", "test2_true": "at the quarry -- at this worker, at that one -- indiscriminately, inscrutably. He fires a shot and a distant figure falls. \nINT. GOETH'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MORNING \nThe woman in bed groans at the echoing shot. She's used to it but she still hates it; it's such an awful way to be woken. \nMAJOLA (mutters) Amon... Christ... \nShe buries her head under a pillow. Goeth reappears. He pads to his bathroom, goes inside and urinates. \nEXT. PLASZOW - DAY \nSchindler's Mercedes winds through the camp, past warehouses and workshops, trucks full of furs and furniture, work details, barracks, guard blocks. A man standing alone wears a sign around his neck -- \"I am a potato thief.\" \nEXT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY \nThe Mercedes pulls in next to some other nice cars parked on a driveway made of tombstones from the Jewish cemetery. \nEXT. PATIO, GOETH'S VILLA - DAY \nA patio table set with crystal, china, silver. Goeth and Hujar are there, in pressed SS uniforms, and two industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch. One chair is empty. \nHUJAR Your machinery will be moved and installed by the SS at no cost to you. You will pay no rent, no maintenance -- \nHujar glances off, interrupted by Schindler's arrival. \nAlthough he's never been here, the industrialist comes in like he owns the place. All but Goeth rise. \nSCHINDLER No, no, come on, sit -- \nHe works his way around the table, patting Bosch and Madritsch on the back -- he knows them -- shaking Hujar's hand, who he doesn't know. He reaches Goeth. \nSCHINDLER How you doing? \nGoeth takes a good long look at the handsomely dressed entrepreneur and allows him to shake his hand. \nGOETH We started without you. \nSCHINDLER Good. \nSchindler takes a seat, shakes a napkin onto his lap, nods to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to him. \nSCHINDLER Please. \nGoeth watches him. The others watch Goeth. \nSCHINDLER I miss anything important? \nHUJAR I was explaining to Mr. Bosch and Mr. Madritsch some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow. \nSCHINDLER Oh, good, yeah. \nSchindler clearly doesn't care, but nods as though he did. \nHe drinks. Goeth just watches him with what seems to be growing amusement. He nods to Hujar to continue. \nHUJAR Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times. You can work them all night if you want. Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past, they'll continue to be, they'll be respected -- \nSchindler laughs out loud, cutting Hujar off. Hujar glances over to Goeth nonplussed. \nSCHINDLER I'm sorry. \nHe's not sorry at all, and starts in on the plate of food that's set down in front of him. \nGOETH You know, they told me you were going to be trouble -- Czurda and Scherner. \nSCHINDLER You're kidding. \nGoeth slowly shakes his head no... then smiles. \nGOETH He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know -- where do you get a suit like that? what is that, silk? (Schindler nods) It's great. \nSCHINDLER I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know. \nHe shrugs like, those are the breaks, too bad. Goeth just smiles. The others watch the two of them, unsure how they're supposed to react. \nINT. GOETH'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY \nThe others have gone. It's just Goeth and Schindler now. \nGoeth pours glasses of cognac. \nGOETH Something wonderful's happened, do you know what it is? Without planning it, we've reached that happy point in our careers where duty and financial opportunity meet. \nSchindler nods pensively, perhaps in agreement, perhaps at some other thought. There's a silence, broken finally by -- \nSCHINDLER I go to work the other day, there's nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -- \nGOETH They're not gone, they're here. \nSCHINDLER They're mine! \n", "test2_id": 3004, "test3_input": "SCHINDLER Did I threaten anybody here? I stated a simple fact. \nThe threat still stands, despite Schindler's assurance otherwise, and they all know it. So does Scherner's threat back to him, and they all know that, too. But Schindler just grins, and, glancing away -- \nSCHINDLER Come on, let's watch the girls. \nINT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY \nIn addition to the mid-day soup and break, there are bowls of fruit on the long work tables. At one of them, several workers are debating which of them will go upstairs to thank Schindler. \nINT. UPSTAIRS OFFICES, D.E.F. - SAME TIME - DAY \nIn honor of Schindler's birthday, Goeth has brought over Stern and the Rosners -- the musicians, at the moment, accompanying the best baritone in the Ukrainian garrison. \nSurrounded by his friends and lovers, Schindler cuts a cake. \nHe receives congratulations from the many SS men present and the embraces, in turn, of Ingrid and Klonowska and Goeth. \nFrom Stern he gets a handshake. \nA Jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly approaches the drunken group around Schindler. The SS men consider her as a curiosity; Schindler, as he would any beautiful girl. The music breaks and out of the silence comes a small nervous voice: \nFACTORY GIRL ...On behalf of the workers... sir... I wish you a happy birthday... \nShe hesitates. She's surrounded by SS uniforms and swastikas and holstered guns. Schindler smiles; this is a beautiful girl. \nSCHINDLER Thank you. \nHe kisses her on the mouth. The smiles on the faces around them strain. Stern glances to heaven. Amon cocks his head like a confused dog. The kiss is broken, finally, and Schindler smiles again with impunity. \nSCHINDLER Thank them for me. \nThe girl backs away nodding anxiously; all she wants now is out before someone -- her, Schindler, both of them -- gets shot. Henry Rosner nudges Leo and they begin another song. \nAnd the party tries to resume. \nEXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAWN \nWere they not asleep in their barracks, the prisoners would no doubt shudder at the sight: the clerks are setting up their folding tables. \nOther figures move around the parade ground in the murky dawn light: these raising a banner, those wheeling filing cabinets across the Appellplatz, this one wiring a phonograph, that one saturating a pad with ink from a bottle. \nGoldberg, Lord of Lists, moves from table to table handing out carbons of lists and sharing morning pleasantries with the clerks. \nSome men in white appear like ghosts. A doctor's kid is opened, a stethoscope removed. Another cleans the lenses of his glasses. Someone sharpens a pencil. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAWN \nA trainman waving a lantern guides an engineer who's slowly backing an empty cattle car along the tracks. It couples to another empty slatted car with a harsh clank. \nEXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY \nThe needle of the phonograph is set down on a pocked 78. The first scratchy note of a Strauss waltz blare from the camp speakers. \nEXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - DAY \nIn his undershirt and shorts Goeth calmly smokes his first cigarette of the morning as he listens to the music wafting up from down below. \nDown there on the Appellplatz, the entire population of the camp has been concentrated, some fifteen thousand prisoners. \nEXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY \nThough the music and banners struggle to evoke a country fair, the presence of the doctors belie it. A sorting out process is going on here, the healthy from the unhealthy. \nA physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several prisoners run back and forth, naked, before him. He makes his selections quickly: this one into this line, that one into that, and Goldberg moves them recording the names. \nOther groups of people run naked in front of other doctors and clerks. Notations are made and lines are formed. The sun beats down and the music lies. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY \nSome still pulling their clothes back on, the first wave of the \"unfit\" is marched onto the platform. A guard slides open the gate of a cattle car and this first unlucky group climbs aboard. \nEXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY \nBehind the camouflage of other women prisoners, Mila Pfefferberg rubs a beet against her cheeks in desperate hope of adding a little color to her skin. \nAmon Goeth, his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up, chats with one of the doctors as another group strips. \nWhether the topic is this Health Aktion or the unseasonable weather is unclear, but he nods approvingly. \nPFEFFERBERG (O.S.) Commandant, sir. \nGoeth glances up, finds Poldek among the group taking off their clothes. Pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that asks, Do I really have to go through this, and Goeth turns to a clerk. \nGOETH My mechanic. \nPfefferberg is motioned away from the others; he's okay, he doesn't have to be put through this indignity. He calls out to the Commandant again -- \nPFEFFERBERG What about my wife? \nGoeth thinks about it a moment before he nods, Yeah, okay, sure. A clerk accompanies Pfefferberg and, making a notation on the way, finds Mila. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY \n", "test3_true": "EXT. PLASZOW - LATER - DAY \nThe needle of the phonograph is set down on another record, a children's song, \"Mammi, kauf mir ein Pferdchen\" (Mommy, buy me a pony). \nChildren are yanked from the arms of their parents. Wailing protests quickly escalate to brawls with the guards. \nRevolvers and rifles aim at the sun and fire. Music, shots, wails. \nINT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY \nGuards traipse through a deserted barracks peering up at the rafters, pulling planks from the floor, upending cots, looking for some children. \nEXT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY \nA small figure in red sprints across to another barracks, past it, to a crude wooden structure beyond it. \nINT. MEN'S LATRINES - SAME TIME - DAY \nAn arm held out to either side, the small girl lowers herself into a pit into which men have defecated. She works her way slowly down, trying to find knee and toeholds on the foul walls, ignoring the flies invading her ears, her nostrils. \nReaching the surface of the muck she lets her feet submerge, then her ankles, her shins, her knees, before finally \ntouching harder ground. As she struggles to slow her breathing, her racing heart, she hears a hallucinatory murmur -- \nBOY'S VOICE This is our place. \nShe sees eyes in the darkness; five other children are already there. \nEXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY \nWaves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle cars. Inside, those who \"failed\" the medical exams bake as they wait for the last cars to be filled. \nSchindler's Mercedes pulls up. He climbs out and stares transfixed. He notices Goeth then, standing with the other industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch, and strolls over to them. \nGOETH I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought. Have a drink. \nSCHINDLER What's going on? \nGOETH I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them. It's always something. \nHe glances away at the train. The idling engine only partially covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the slatted cars. \nGOETH They're complaining now? They don't know what complaining is. \nHe grins. Schindler watches as another car is loaded. It's like they're climbing into an oven. \nSCHINDLER What do you say we get your fire brigade out here and hose down the cars? \nGoeth stares at him blankly, then with a What-will-you-think- of-next? kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls over to Hujar -- \nGOETH Bring the fire trucks! \nHUJAR What? \nHujar heard him, he just doesn't get it. Finally he turns to another guy and tells him to do it. \nSTREAM OF WATER CASCADE onto the scalding rooftops. The fire trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude. \nGOETH This is really cruel, Oskar, you're giving them hope. You shouldn't do that, that's cruel. \nAnd amusing, not just to Goeth, but to the other SS officers standing around as well. Oskar moves away to talk with one of the firemen. At full extension, apparently the hoses still only reach halfway down the long line of cars. He returns to Goeth. \nSCHINDLER I've got some 200-meter hoses back at D.E.F., we can reach the cars down at the end. \nGoeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers -- \nGOETH Hujar! \nTHE D.E.F. HOSES have arrived and are being coupled to Plaszow's. As the water drenches the cars further back, the people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and officers outside grin at the spectacle. \nGUARD What does he think he's saving them from? \nThe joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the D.E.F. trucks, boxes of food are unloaded. Accompanied by the laughter of the SS, Schindler moves along the string of cars pushing sausages through the slats. \nGOETH Oh, my God. \nGoeth is almost hysterical. But slowly then, slowly, the amusement on his face fades. His friend moving along the cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless SS men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly here, it's as though he were possessed. \nThe water rains down on the last car. \nEXT. D.E.F. - DAY \nA German staff car pulls in across the factory gate, blocking it. Two Gestapo men climb out. \nINT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY \nThe girl who brought Schindler best wishes on his birthday glances up from her work to the Gestapo crossing through the factory. They climb the stairs to the upstairs offices and, moments later, appear behind Schindler's wall of glass. \nINT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - DAY \nSchindler leaning against his desk, drink in his hand, calmly tries to assess his humorless arresters. \n", "test3_id": 3005}

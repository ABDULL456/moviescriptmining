Screenplay by

RADIO 
On a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an electric humming begins. The eerie light glows brighter and illuminates a single huge number--11. We hear static and a large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the screen. 
Pulling back slowly, we watch the glowing band traverse back and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing-- 70... 90... 110... 130. And we begin to hear voices--strange songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting with static. 
Pulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the indicator stops. There's a pause...and suddenly we are hit by a blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking and Rolling, turn-up- the-volume, pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music was better. 
And now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking and growling while the music pumps and grinds... 
WOLFMAN Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay! I got a oldie for ya--gonna knock ya right on de flowa--baay-haay-hee-baay! 
The Wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as "Rock Around the Clock" blasts forth. 
MEL'S DRIVE-IN--DUSK 
A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill. A large neon sign buzzes in the foreground... MEL'S DRIVE-IN, while in the background, "Rock Around The Clock" blares from the radio of a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck- and-rolled '58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-in. Main titles appear over action. Steve Bolander stops the elegant machine and gets out. He looks around, then walks to the front of the car and leans against the flame-covered hood. Steve is eighteen, good-looking in a conservative, button-down, short-sleeved shirt. Most likely to succeed, president of his graduating class. He looks around the empty drive-in, then hears a funny little horn. 
A Vespa scooter bumps into the lot. A young kid waves at him-- and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly topples. Terry Fields ("The Toad") maneuvers the scooter next to Steve's Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the trash can before stopping. Terry grins sheepishly. He's seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white bucks. He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's projecting an air of supercool. 
Steve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead. He unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to look tough. 
Terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating Steve who pays him no mind. In the background, we hear the Wolfman howling with the music. The record ends and a barrage of humor begins from Wolfman Jack. The Wolfman is an unseen companion to all the kids. Witty and knowledgeable about the trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and guardian angel. 
Now, a grey, insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters into the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot. Steve and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out. 
Curt stands by his little car. He's seventeen, a curly bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer-grown moustache and a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts. Curt thinks of himself as the town cynic. In reality, he's a hopeless romantic. He starts over to his buddies. 
TERRY Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night in town, you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave? 
STEVE The Moose have been lookin' for you all day, man. 
Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope without saying anything. Curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check. 
CURT (sarcastic) Oh great... 
TERRY Whadaya got, whadaya got? Wow--two thousand dollars. Two thousand doll-- 
Steve looks at Curt suspiciously; Curt seems somehow guilty. 
STEVE Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you. He said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you. 
Curt hands the envelope back to Steve. 
CURT Well... ah... why don't you hold onto it for a while? 
STEVE What's with you? It's yours! Take it! I don't want it. 
TERRY I'll take it. 
CURT Steve... Ah, I think we'd better have a talk. I've gotten- 
Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn. Laurie Henderson pulls into the drive-in and waves to them. She is driving the family's '58 Edsel. 
STEVE Your sister calls. I'll talk to you later. 
CURT Now, Steve! Let her wait. 
STEVE Okay, make it short and sweet. 
CURT Yeah, well... Listen... (clearing his throat) I... I don't think I'm going tomorrow. 
STEVE What! Come on, what are you talking about? 
CURT I don't know. I was thinking I might wait for a year... go to city-- 
Laurie honks the horn a couple of times. Steve ignores her. There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable. 
STEVE You chicken fink. 
CURT Wait, let me explain-- 
STEVE You can't back out now! After all we went through to get accepted. We're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look, I gotta talk to Laurie. (he hands the check back to Curt) Now take it. We're leaving in the morning. Okay? 
Suddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot. The low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in.

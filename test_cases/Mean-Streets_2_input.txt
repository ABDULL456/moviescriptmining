CHARLIE Don't be smart. 
JOHNNY BOY I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember? 
TERESA is crying. 
JOHNNY BOY Don't be upset Teresa. You have to understand Charlie, here...he gives of himself to help others... 
TERESA I'm going to go home. 
JOHNNY BOY No, you stay. 
CHARLIE Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this... 
JOHNNY BOY (ANGRY) Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie... 
TERESA makes it to the door and opens it quickly. JOHNNY BOY grabs her to keep her from leaving. CHARLIE rushes towards them and pulls JOHNNY BOY away. By now, they are halfway down the hall. 
JOHNNY BOY (SHOUTING) Charlie...I always wondered about her...what happens when she comes? Does she get one of those fits? Eh? That would be something to see... 
JOHNNY BOY is interrupted by CHARLIE'S fist as it lands a solid punch on the right side of his hand. TERESA screams and rushes to separate them. 
JOHNNY BOY You rat bastard!! Don't hit me again!! 
CHARLIE stops. 
JOHNNY BOY I think I will fuckin go see your uncle right now...he'd be interested. 
CHARLIE rushes JOHNNY BOY towards the stairs. They bump into TERESA, slamming her against the wall. 
CHARLIE Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see what happens to you without me. 
TERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to CHARLIE'S uncle. 
TERESA No...no...don't. 
TERESA falls, hitting the stairs with a thud. She lies there moaning and tossing her head. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY go to help her. 
CHARLIE What do I do? You know anything about this? 
JOHNNY BOY steps over TERESA to go down the stairs. He turns. 
JOHNNY BOY I don't know...she's your girl...I gotta go. 
CHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is getting worse. 
JOHNNY BOY Hate to miss the floor show, though. 
CHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY. 
The neighbors take over. One woman appears to know how to administer aid to TERESA. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLIE'S BUILDING - STAIRS 
JOHNNY BOY is halfway down the stairs by now. The neighbor takes care of TERESA. While CHARLIE dashes down the stairs, CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY in the ground floor hallway. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE 
In the deserted factory section of Manhattan, JOHNNY BOY and CHARLIE stand next to a corregated metal garage door. CHARLIE smashes JOHNNY BOY against the door sending resounding echoes into the street. 
CHARLIE You crazy bastard! What are you trying to do, ruin me? 
JOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door again--again the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street. 
CHARLIE You...

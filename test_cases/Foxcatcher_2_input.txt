MARK Were you in the Big House yesterday? 
DAVE For a little while. 
MARK In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. (THEN) What were you doing there? 
DAVE I'm a coach here. I get paid by John. I was meeting with John. 
MARK About what? 
DAVE Mark. Get dressed. 
MARK He's weakening me. 
DAVE What are you talking about? 
MARK I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall - 
DAVE - Mark - 
MARK - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend - 
DAVE - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. Not - 
MARK - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning - 
DAVE - Don't do this. Don't do it. Stay clear about what we're working for. 
MARK - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it - 
DAVE - It's not the time, Mark - 
MARK - John's killing me here - 
DAVE - He's not killing you - 
MARK - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after - 
DAVE - Stop. Stop it! 
Long beat as Dave looks at Mark. As gently as he can: 
DAVE (CONT'D) I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of. 
Mark's looking at his brother, something dawning on him for the first time. 
MARK You're not thinking of staying here...? 
DAVE I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in... 
Mark's at a complete loss. Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again. 
DAVE (CONT'D) If you win next month you're in a class by yourself, you write your own ticket. You live your own life however you want. Focus on that. 
MARK (QUIETLY) My own life. 
DAVE That's right. 
MARK And you'll be here. 
DAVE I'll be here. Whenever you need me. 
Mark seems lost. Dave pats him on the shoulder and turns to walk toward his office. Mark watches him walk away, then - 
MARK What's on your forehead? 
DAVE What? 
MARK It says kids. 
DAVE To remind me to pick up the kids from school. 
MARK What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead? 
DAVE I don't have to. You just told me. 
On Mark, PRELAP: 
CORPORAL Here we go, sir. Five tons of fun.

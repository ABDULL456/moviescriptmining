AGU (V.O.) Bullet is just eating everything, leaf, tree, ground, person -- eating them -- just making person to bleed everywhere... so much blood. 
They pick through the useful gear and begin to move out. 
Preacher whispers a prayer to himself as Commandant pulls Tripod's Two-I-C jacket off and places it on Preacher, unceremoniously as the men move out. 
EXT. JUNGLE - DUSK 
Agu collapses with Strika at their next bivouac. The men say nothing, they are all too exhausted. 
GUN FIRE ECHOES in the distance. Everyone is silent looking at Commandant for guidance, waiting. 
Commandant signals, move down the line..."move out." 
Agu puts his pack on and starts to leave when he sees Strika is immovable, lizard licking his chapped lips. 
AGU (WHISPERING) Strika? Strika! We are having to go or they will be leaving us. 
Strika shakes his head. 
AGU (CONT'D) Let's go. 
Agu watches as the others disappear into the bush without them. He turns back to Strika. 
AGU (CONT'D) Strika! We have to be going. Stand up and let's go! 
Strika shakes his head, sadly. 
AGU (CONT'D) What is wrong with you? 
Agu goes to Strika. 
AGU (CONT'D) What is wrong? 
Strika looks at Agu, wheezing. He shows Agu a small shrapnel wound in his side. 
Worried but with no other choice, Agu picks Strika up and throws him onto his back. 
EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
Agu notices a cricket on a leaf. He snatches it quickly, bites half of it, then gives the other half to Strika, who lets it sit in his mouth with out swallowing. 
AGU (V.O.) I am wanting to say to Strika, I am tired too. 
GUN FIRE ECHOES again in the distance. Quietly, they move out again. 
AGU (V.O.) I am tired, and so the words are not coming out of my mouth. 
Agu picks up Strika to carry him. 
AGU (V.O.) I will be an old man before this war is over... 
A SONG. 
Agu hears it and sits up quickly. It's the song his mother used to sing to him in the kitchen hut. 
AGU Enh... Strika, a song. Music. Like my mother sings... 
He looks around, trying to find its ephemeral source. But it goes silent. He tries to see if Strika is listening, his head resting on Agu's shoulder. 
AGU (CONT'D) Strika? 
He shakes Strika. But Strika doesn't respond. 
AGU (CONT'D) Strika? 
Realizing he is dead, Agu lays him down and cries. 
EXT. JUNGLE - LATER 
Agu covers Strika with leaves. 
Commandant looks at him, pitifully. Then leads the men on.

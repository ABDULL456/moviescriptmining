RUFUS 
Shut up. 
(to Bethany) 
Do you know what the Apocryphal books are? 
Bethany shakes her head no. 
RUFUS 
Most of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls - ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago. And when the Sanskrit was translated, they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church officials had already established as the basis of their religion. They couldn't refute centuries of dogma, so they thought it best to leave certain passages out - sometimes whole books. Those books make up the Apocrypha. 
BETHANY 
What's this have to do with me? 
RUFUS 
You've never gotten the complete picture. If they had compiled the material together like they were supposed to, you'd get the whole story. But by leaving text out, the church has presented you people with an extremely sterile and unmoving account of religious history. The Creation. the entire Old Testament, the history of Christ... 
(let's her take it in) 
Forget about my whole black angle for a minute... 
JAY 
We might if you'd quit bringing it up. 
Rufus backhands Jay. Silent Bob holds jay back. Rufus continues, oblivous to Jay. 
RUFUS 
He goes from twelve years old to thirty. Whole volumes of text about the eighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance of it were thown out, forever lost to the faithful. 
BETHANY 
I don't buy it. Integral material like that would give people a better understanding of the nature of God. Why leave it out? 
RUFUS 
Because it was all closely tied in with His family. 
BETHANY 
His mother and father? 
RUFUS 
His brothers and sisters. 
BETHANY 
(beat) 
Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn't have any brothers or sisters. Mary was a virgin - that's why it's called the Immaculate Conception. 
RUFUS 
Mary gave birth to Christ without having known a man's touch - that's true. But she did have a husband. And do you really think he'd have stayed married to her all those years if he wasn't getting laid? The nature of God and the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife never humped her husband - that's just gullibility. 
BETHANY 
(sudden realization) 
MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX?!? 
RUFUS 
All the time, from what I understand. Jesus used to tell me stories about hearing them through the walls when He was a kid. 
(beat) 
So you ask why you got tapped. I'll tell you why: a Christ was the salvation of this world once before. And you're the closest thing to a Christ that still walks. 
BETHANY 
Meaning? 
RUFUS 
The blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the genetic level with the man you call Jesus. 
(hand on her shoulder) 
You're His great-grand-niece. 
Bethany's jaw drops. A high-pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips. 
JAY 
(takes a hit from his joint) 
So... that would make Bethany part black. 
(to Silent Bob) 
Man, this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father. 
RUFUS 
I just wish I knew what the hell we're supposed to do now? 
OC VOICE 
You must go to the Dagobah system and find Yoda - the Jedi Master who instructed me. 
Everyone turns around. Metatron leans against a tree. 
METATRON 
God. l've always wanted to say that. 
RUFUS 
The voice. 
NIETATRON 
(mimicking his shock) 
The Apostle! 
(sits down with them) 
BETHANY 
Now you show up! Where were you when that psychotic bastard had a knife to my throat? 
METATRON 
I told you you'd be in capable hands - you're not dead are you? 
RUFUS 
What are you doing here anyw'ay? 
METATRON 
I felt left out. Everyone's sitting around coming clean, I thought I'd join in with a confession of mine own. 
JAY 
Now who's this mother fucker? 
RUFUS 
This is the Voice of God - show some respect. 
JAY 
The Voice of God? Where's the rest of Him? 
METATRON 
Funny you should mention that - we're not sure. 
BETHANY 
Excuse me? 
METATRON 
Didn't it ever occur to you that this Bartleby/Loki situation was well within the realm of His control? 
RUFUS 
If that's the case, then why was Bethany tapped? 
METATRON 
You know those constitutionals He likes to take? 
BETHANY 
Constitutionals?

The TIGER'S, eyes burn with fury as he wheels in a circle, lunging at one dog clawing at another, keeping them all at bay. \nSuddenly, the TIGER leaps over the dogs and transforms into a WHITE BIRD, soaring majestically into the sky. \nTHE FACE OF A JAPANESE MAN \nSits up into frame, sweating, waking from a dream. He is KATSUMOTO. We will come to know him later. \nFade to black. CREDITS OVER. \nThe faint SOUND of a BRASS BAND. \nWINCHESTER REP (V.O.) the leader in all forms of armament used by the United States Army. When you need a friend, Winchester is by your side.         . \nTHE FACE OF AN AMERICAN MAN \nAs he smokes a cigar, barely listening. CAPTAIN _NATHAN ALGREN, U.S. Army, ret, 36 years old and looking every da y of it. His eyes are lined and saddened. He takes a swig from a flask. He is BACKSTAGE at: \nINT. CONVENTION HALL              SAN FRANCISCO          DAY \nWhere a trade show is in progress. Scantily clad lovelies in red-white-and- blue undies demonstrate the nation's most important new export: arms. Every weapon imaginable is on display: rifles, pistols, even howitzers. Banners declaim the virtues of Winchester and Springfield. Of Colt and Remington and Smith & Wesson. Crowds mill around a stage. where: \nWINCHESTER REP Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Winchester Corporation is proud to bring to you... a true American hero. A patriot who has proven his gallantry time and again on the field of battle. \nLITTLE TIN SOLDIERS are all lined up. A mass of grey. Rebel troops surrounding a band of blue Union cavalry. A large, metal diorama. \nWINCHESTER REP I hope you will join us in welcoming ...Late of the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill ... Captain Nathan Algren! \nA last swig. Algren steels himself, then strides onstage as we reveal a banner: \nWINCHESTER PRESENTS: THE MIRACLE AT SUTTER'S HILL! \nGarish limelight from a row of foot lights illuminates Algren. \nALGREN My thanks, Mr. McCabe... Ladies and Gents. \nHe looks down at the little metal soldiers and begins to tell the story of the battle that made him famous. His narration is halting, unsteady: \nALGREN ... On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in a spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter's Hill, nothing but grey as far as the eye could see: Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down into the, um, mael... mael... (squints to see better) -maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up. \nWe realize he is reading from cue cards. The little Rebel soldiers begin sliding up the metal hill. \nALGREN I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth of the enemy or we would all be buried... buried ... (loses his place, under his breath) Shit... (finds it again) ...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready gone to Merciful Heaven... \nA sudden flash: \nAlgren's mind. The real battle of Sutter's Hill. The grim reality is ver y different from the dashing tale. Union soldiers scream in agony. Those horses still alive buck and froth at their tether.                      . \nAlgren, a lieutenant then, moves among the panicked, bloody men. He stops beside a PRIVATE, his brother, DAVID ALGREN, 19, blonde, not much more than a boy. \nDAVEY They're coming, Nate. \nHe looks over the wall. Rebel troops are moving up the hill. \nALGREN Keep your head down. \nDAVEY (smiling) Papa alwa ys said we should've joined the navy. \nALGREN What'd he know? (looks fondly at his brother) You watch me now. Do whatever I say. . \nDAVEY Aye-a ye, lieutenant. \nAlgren punches his shoulder and moves on down the line. Nearby, Algren's friend, SERGEANT ZEBULAH GANT, though severel y wounded, reloads his revolver with the last of his ammunition. \nGANT How're the horses? \nALGREN Better than you. Smell better, too. (looks at him) Can you hold on, Zeb? \nGANT (fighting the pain) I got I choice? \nAlgren smiles sadly. His mend will die loon without medical attention. \nAlgren moves down the line, bullets whizzing overhead. He kneels beside COLONEL BAGLEY, his commanding officer. \nBAGLEY (panicking) We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white flag! \nALGREN What are you talking about?! \nBAGLEY Surrender, damn it! That's an order! \nBack to the convention hall: \nALGREN No thought of surrender among those boy. Better to die as God made us, we thought, as soldiers... So I gave the order. Mister Bugler, sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare arms. There were only thirty of us, but we had fire in us yet. I looked down the hill at the destiny ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister Bugler, charge! \nThe little Union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill. \nOn Sutter's Hill: \nAlgren sits alone on the bed. He takes out a leather-bound journal and begins to write. \nALGREN (V.O.) June 17th, 1876. The dead are with me tonight. They return each time I am obliged to tell their story. \nINT.            SQUALID BAR                NIGHT \nAlgren sips absinthe. He stares at the milky, green liquid before him. \nALGREN (V.O.) I can almost see them in the shadows, their bodies whole and beautiful once more. Sometimes it's as if they call to me in a sweet invitation -- \nEXT.                   GAS-LIT STREET              NIGHT \nAlgren walks in the fog. Sputtering gas lamps give an unearthly glow. \nALGREN (V.O.) \"We are dead,\" they whisper, \"and we are happy.\" \nINT.           SEEDY HOTEL ROOM                     NIGHT \nAlgren is back in the hotel room. From his small suitcase, he takes the Medal of Honor, looks at it for a long moment. \nALGREN (V.O.) \"Do not be afraid,\" they whisper. \"You have been dead, too.\" \nA sudden flash: \nWe are back on Sutter's Hill. Algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody ground, dead to the last man. A rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at each body before it is loaded onto a wagon. \nAlgren's turn is no different than the others. He is declared dead and hoisted unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses. \nBack in the. hotel room.: \nAlgren sits, staring into the middle distance. \nALGREN (V.O.) Is this why they gave their lives? So that I might disgrace their memory? \nHe reaches into the suitcase and takes out a Colt revol ver. Stares at it, cracks the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. His finger wraps around the trigger, the barrel makes its wa y toward his head. \nAnd then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing. \nALGREN (V.O.) And why, after taking so many lives, do I find myself incapable of taking just one more? \nA KNOCK on the door. Algren shuts his eyes, then calls out. \nALGREN Go awa y. \nGANT (V .O.) Not exactly the greeting I imagined. \nAlgren looks up. He knows that voice. He carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before opening the door. \nGANT Thought you'd seen the last of me, I expect. \nAlgren is filled with emotion, which he tries to hide. \nALGREN Zeb... \nThey embrace. \nALGREN \nSit. Please. \nGant moves to the proffered chair with a pronounced limp. \nGANT ... Saw your little melodrama         toda y. Very inspiring... . \nALGREN Given up soldiering to become a critic? \nGant smiles and shakes his head. \nGANT Got a job for you, unless you're running for office... \nALGREN I have I job. \nGANT I mean a real job. Back in uniform. \nALGREN I' m retired. \nGANT I don't mean a U.S. uniform. \nAlgren looks at him. Curious despite himself. \nINT.           RESTAURANT                  NIGHT \nGant leads Algren into a lush San Francisco restaurant. Flickering gaslight and trays of lobster. COLONEL BENJAMIN BAGLEY (whom we saw in flashback) sits with the three Japanese men. Bagley's hair has greyed. He \nhas his eye on a political future. \nBAGLEY Nathan, good to see you. \nALGREN (stunned) Colonel Bagley... \nBAGLEY Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don't have names... \nOMURA 40, is a handsome and intelligent man. He watches Algren closel y as Algren pours a glass or whiskey from a decanter. \nBAGLEY They're looking to hire real American soldiers to create the first Japanese Imperial Army. \nAlgren looks at him. \nBAGLEY Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country and they're willing to spend what it takes to hire white experts to do the job right. \nAlgren takes a slow lip of whiskey. \nBAGLEY Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve. You would be m y second-in-command. \nALGREN We both know why you helped me, Colonel. Don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude. \nBAGLEY I expect you to do your job. Save the self-pity for your own time. \nHe turns and walks out, leaving Algren to stare at the empty glass. \nEXT.                 SHIP                       DAY \nAlgren and Gant stand at the rail. \nGANT Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail he wouldn't have created infantry. \nALGREN How many rimes you puke today? \nGANT I'm down to two. \nOmura comes up next to them. OMURA I understand you are a scholar, Captain Algren. (to Gant) Have you read his book., Mr. Gant? \nGANT Can't say I have. \nOMURA An analysis of the triumph of weapons technology over antiquated military tactics. \nALGREN (wr y) A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies. \nOMURA Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading military history. I spent two years studying English at Princeton University. \nALGREN And where did you learn to speak Japanese? \nOmura is perplexed by Algren's remark, then realizes he is being kidded. He laughs heartily. Algren laughs with him. A connection is made. \nOMURA Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven words for \"war.\" I will be impressed if you learn only half of them. . \nHe walks away. Algren watches him go. His face darkens. \nALGREN I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux, Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language when it comes to war. \nEXT.               YOKOHAMA HARBOR                           DAY \nLike all Japan, Yokohama is at the cusp of a new era. \nAncient sampans and wooden schooners beside freighters and steamships. \nEXT.                YOKOHAMA \u00ad DOCK                            DAY \nAfter 23 days at sea, they are all glad to climb down the gangplank. The Yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks and smells and sounds. Japanese competes with German and English and French and Russian. Warehouses fl y the flags of a dozen countries. \nOne striking Japanese character dominates: the symbol for, Omura. It is seen on buildings, warehouses, and the headbands of scores of laborers. \nA series of palanquins, litters carried by bearers, await our voyagers. \nAs does SIMON GRAHAM, a dissipated Englishman who has lived in Japan for many yean. Slender and pale, with an occasional consumptive cough, in his 50's, he wears a white linen suit, a bit worse for wear. \nOMURA Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He will be your translator. \nGRAHAM Pleasure, Captain. \nBAGLEY You'll be quartered at the Embassy for now. \nOMURA The Emperor will summon you at his pleasure. \nGraham ushers Algren and Gant into their own less-ornate version. \nGRAHAM If you please, Captain... \nALGREN They're gonna carry us? \nGRAHAM You're guests of the Emperor. You cannot walk. \nAlgren notes the hoods covering the faces of the palanquin bearers. \nALGREN Why the hoods? \nGRAHAM So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they're servants now. (coughs, wipes a bit of blood) This wa y, gentlemen... \nINT /EXT            PALANQUIN - YOKOHAMA STREETS                             DAY \nTheir bearers maneuver them through the bustling streets of Yokohama. White face painted geishas walk alongside bearded Russians. Traditional Japanese kimonos alongside European suits and hats, schizophrenic world of ancient Japan versus modern commercialism. \nGRAHAM Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y little port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and changed all that. \nALGREN All this in twenty years? \nGRAHAM Japan has...embraced... Western wa ys. Hired lawyers from France, doctors from Germany, naval architects from Britain, civil engineers, railway designers, scientists, teachers. And, of course, warriors from the United States. \nALGREN Buying the future. \nGRAHAM Or selling the past... \nINT.            GUEST QUARTERS                       DAY \nA shoji screen is opened by a bowing servant to reveal the clean, classic lines of a Japanese room. Algren is about to enter when Graham stops him, indicating for Algren to remove his boots. \nAlgren scowls, confused, and struggles to pull off the high, filthy boots. He takes in the foreigness of the room, an arrangement of fl owers on a low table. \nALGREN No chairs? . . \nGRAHAM Correct. And this-- (points to a mat) ..is your bed. \nALGREN And this? \nHe points to a block of wood. \nGRAHAM Your pillow. \nAlgren glances to General Yoshitaka, who looks back wr yl y. \nALGREN Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to attention. \nGANT Imperial Army, Atten-tion! \nGraham translates, rather mildly. \nALGREN For God's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in charge here ... Mr. Gant. \nGANT (roars) ALL RIGHT YOU SLANTY-EYED LITTLE BASTARDS STAND UP STRAIGHT OR I WILL SHIT-KICK EVERY ONE OF YOU COCKSUCKERS!! \nAs the soldiers immediately stand to attention, we begin a montage of the training of the first Imperial Army: \nWe see Gant drilling the men. Shouting at his translator. Trying to get them to march in formation. Algren is nearby, watching. \nALGREN (V.O.) August 4,1876. As I watch this new army train, I cannot help but think of those who rode with me in me 23rd cavalry. \nAlgren sits in his tent, writing in his journal. Outside, the Japanese are being taught the basics of firing tactics. \nALGREN (V.O.) For four years they had survived, never once shrinking from the fire. And so, when given my order to charge the advancing rebel infantry, they never hesitated. ...And they all died. \nWe see Algren showing the Japanese how to fire in formation. The old single-shot rifles they carry make reloading a painfully slow process. \nALGREN (V .O.) Now I am training another army. In another civil war. \nAlgren and Gant spar with sabers - Algren's expertise far exceeds Gant's, a fact which Gant accepts with good humor. \nALGREN (V.O.) Is this why I was spared? Once again to lead men to their death? \nIt is sunset Algren, Graham, and General Yoshitaka watch the training. General Yoshitaka speaks. \nYOSHlTAKA/ GRAHAM ... the problem is they're peasants. They have never had this sort of responsibility or power. \nAlgren watches Gant march beside the Japanese. They are illuminated by the majestic red sunset \nALGREN (to Graham) Ask him if they have a flag. \nGraham translates. Genera1 Yoshitaka responds. \nGRAHAM No flag. \nALGREN They need a flag. \nEXT.                TOKYO \u00ad STREET                           EVENING \nTokyo is a city in chaos. Everything seems out of balance. Dystopic. A collision of Eastern and Western. Algren and Gant watch as Graham prepares to take a photograph of an old merchant in front of his store. \nGRAHAM ... I've been doing this for years. Trying to capture it before it's all gone. Afraid I'm losing the battle. \nAlgren silently watches the passers-by. Something draws his attention: \nAcross the street. a man is striding down the crowded sidewalk. His martial bearings, two swords, traditional dress and unique top knot of hair instantly identify him to us as a samurai.                                       . \nWe will meet him again later, he is UJIO. A terse, grim man in his 40's. His proud gait and rigid, imperious manner intrigue Algren. \nMost of the people on the sidewalk instantly step out of the wa y, bowing in deference. But two young Japanese in Western dress do not. \nUjio stands before them, waiting for them to move. They don't. Tense words are exchanged. Ujio glares at them. Algren watches. \nALGREN Mr. Graham... \nGRAHAM Ah... now this should be interesting... He's waiting for them to show deference. \nAcross the street, Uji o barks out some harsh commands to the two Japanese men. They laugh in response. Then one of the men raises a hand and barks some clearly disrespectful words back-- \nLike lightning-- Ujio pulls out his long samurai sword - it flashes -- \nCleanly beheading the disrespectful Japanese man -- \nThe beheaded corpse begins to fall-- \nIn one smooth motion, Ujio wipes his blade clean of the corpse as it falls and sweeps it back into its scabbard. The other man immediately drops to his belly, prostrating himself. \nWithout another glance, Ujio walks awa y. His face is completely impassive. \nGANT What the hell was that? \nGRAHAM That...is a samurai. \nINT.          RESTAURANT                         NIGHT \nSergeant Gant gazes unhappily at his dinner: glistening raw fish; tepid beancurds; boiled rice. Algren, Gant, Graham, and General Yoshitaka sit cross-legged on the floor. Gant finds this extremely uncomfortable. \nGRAHAM ... Before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate himself in the presence of a samurai. \nALGREN What edicts are those? \nGRAHAM The Council of State has been passing a series of laws designed to eliminate the samurai. \nGANT Why? \nGRAHAM Because you are here now, Sergeant... For the last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai. \nThe next course arrives. Thick, black eel. Gant groans. \nGRAHAM Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of State -- led by your friend Omura - decided the whole class had to go ... (munching eel) ... Most of the samurai accepted the new laws. But some didn't. Or couldn't. Like Katsumoto. \nGeneral Yoshitaka speaks up. Graham translates: \nGRAHAM General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that the word samurai means \"one who serves.\" Their whole existence is based on serving their country as warriors. \nGraham finishes translating, then continues on his own: \nThe training continues. We see Gant, now sporting a black eye. Algren walks with General Yoshitaka and Graham. Graham translates: \nYOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM The General wishes to know if you bad a pleasant evening? \nAlgren looks at Yoshitaka, who gives him. wry look.. \nALGREN It was... educational (Yoshitaka nods) Would the General mind telling me more about our common enemy? \nYoshitaka looks at him. Has Algren deliberately used the word, \"enemy,\" knowing that Yoshitaka, too, is a samurai? Algren gives nothing awa y. \nYOSHITAKA/GRAHAM ... Mori Katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader. To those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. His force is estimated at about five hundred and growing by the day. All samurai. \nALGREN What kind of man is be? \nGraham translates. General Yoshitaka considers his words. \nYOSHITAKA/GRAHAM Katsumoto has no fear. He has no pity. He is kotsutai-- the soul of old Japan ... He is my honored kinsman. \nALGREN Kinsman? \nYOSHITAKA/GRAHAM We grew up together in Yoshino. Marched together and fought together. He is Kaishaku the brother of my spirit. \nAlgren considers this as they observe rifle practice. Erratic but improving. Algren notes Yoshitaka's reaction. The rifles seem to make him unhappy. \nALGREN Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has. \nGRAHAM The samurai don't use guns. \nALGREN No, ask him what kind of firearms they have. \nGraham obliges. Yoshitaka responds, with disdain: \nYOSHITAKA/GRAHAM The samurai no longer dishonor themselves by touching firearms. \nAlgren is surprised at this bit of information. A servant approaches, bows. \nGRAHAM Colonel Bagley requires you. \nINT.               TENT              DAY \nColonel Bagley and Algren stand at a map. Omura sits. \nALGREN They're not a fighting unit yet \nBAGLEY We have no choice. (refers to the map) --the railroad has been stopped here. Just as it entered Yoshino, Katsumoto's province. \nOMURA Captain, we     cannot govern a country in which we cannot tr    avel freel y. ... Katsumoto's provocation     is strategic. His defeat will demonstrate     to the other disloyal samurai that resistance is   an act devoid of honor. \nBAGLEY The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're savages with bows and arrows. You get up there and show 'em how it', done. \nALGREN With respect, sir, I need more time. \nOMURA With all due respect. this railroad cannot wait. \nHe bows and leaves them alone. Bagley spins on A1gren. \nBAGLEY You think we're the only country interested in Japan?! You don't think the Germans and the French would like to oversee the new army? \nALGREN Colonel-- \nBAGLEY (brutally) Why do you think we're here, Captain? Because Remington and Colt and Winchester have powerful allies in Washington. We're here to sell a shitload of American guns...and steel...and timber. That shouldn't be bud for a Winchester whore like you to understand. \nAlgren looks at him, murderously. \nALGREN Yes, air. \nEXT.                    RUINED VILLAGE                               DAY \nA STEAM ENGINE lends plumes of smoke into the air as it waits. Algren, Bagley, and General Yoshitaka ride along the railroad line. \nThe Imperial Army follows, with Sergeant Gant, on foot. \nA traditional Japanese village is being torn aside to make room for the railroad line. Houses are being leveled and black smoke drifts up. The displaced villagers gather belongings. Omura guards herd them about rather bruta1ly. \nRailroad workers are laying a new spur, building a brick station. A1gren notes the by now familiar Omura symbol on the new water tower and on the headbands of the guards and workers. \nALGREN What is that sign? \nGRAHAM It's the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu. \nALGREN Zaibatsu? \nGRAHAM Old family businesses that own ever ything worth owning. The molt powerful is the Omura Zaibatsu. That's your friend, Omura. \nALGREN They own all of this? \nGRAHAM They do now. \nSEVERED HEADS on pikes line the road, a warning to those who continue to resist \nALGREN (V.O.) October 24,1876. Today we entered Kansai province. Here the local warlords have all been convinced to accept the emperor's rule. \nThey pass a particularly wrenching sight. Villagers kneeling outside what used to be a Shinto temple. The railroad tracks cut straight through it. \nALGREN (V.O.) Our destination is Yoshino, home of the rebel Katsumoto. Protected by high mountain passes, it can be reached only during the summer months, and even then with great difficulty. \nThe Army moves on. Ahead are towering mountains. \nEXT.                    MOUNTAIN PASS                          DAY \nThe Imperial Army winds its way up I steep mountain pass. \nALGREN (V.O.) A long march. And then a battle. A new enemy, but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one, in the cornfield at Antietam -- men will die here, today, and will I be among them? \nPanic and chaos-- \nALGREN Hold the line! \nToo late-- the samurai are on them-- \nThey attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese soldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered-- run through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata. \nThose soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly mowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows, fired by mounted Samurai. \nALGREN Sound fall back! Sound fall back! \nA bugler sounds the order. The Army begins to retreat. \nBut suddenly they are attacked from behind as well! Arrows shoot from the fog and more mounted samurai appear. \nThey are surrounded. \nAlgren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself-- \nThe battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by lances, run down and trampled by horses. \nEach samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle flags sweep through the fog. \nGant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing-- \nAlgren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past -- \nBut one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground. \nAlgren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another rider heads toward him carrying a lance. \nAlgren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the lance from his grip and running him through. \nIn the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK. \nThe MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight. \nAlgren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down. \nThe Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing. He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after Those around him have fled. \nThen a blaze of bright yellow \u00ad a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding. \nWe will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai. \nYoritomo fires arrow upon arrow \u00ad the speed is breathtaking \u00ad Two arrows slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground. \nThe battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey. \nLeft alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru \u00ad samurai foot soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other \nsamurai wielding katana \u00ad the lethal long sword. \nBut rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance. \nIn agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried deep in his chest, and fights on. \nHe manages to parry a blow \u00ad which SLICES into his side. The next blow takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes. \nAlgren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still dangling from the end. \nThe MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN, whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger holding the dogs at bay. \nIn SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his katana. Algren seems spent \u00ad he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing consciousness. But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his attacker. \nAs the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off. \nA harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks. \nThe Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    . \nHe looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet. \nAnd we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an imposing man of about Algren's years. \nSensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto. With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard. \nAlgren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO. \nKatsumoto looks down at Algren. \nThen Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his rifle, urgently trying to save Algren-- \nUjio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to protect his Lord. His sword flashes-- \nGant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror. \nA dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he sinks to his knees. \nKatsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off. \nAlgren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant, blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder. \nGant is dead. \nAlgren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled. Or are surrendering, injured or dead. \nAnd he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse, head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt. \nKatsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems to agree to something. \nBoth men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who holds it out firmly. \nYoritomo leads Algren to a large, wooden bathing tub in I secluded part of the village. A banked fire smolders beneath it. \nEmbarrassed, Yoritomo indicates to Algren that be needs to bathe. Algren strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water. \nYoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to Western privacy, he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man. \nYoritomo, unconcerned, climbs into the tub. He chats pleasantly as they bathe, showing off his old battle wounds. \nAlgren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother appears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub! \nAlgren sinks a little lower into the water. The old grandmother smiles at him with her toothless grin. \nEXT.            VILLAGE                          DAY \nAlgren. feeling self-conscious in the clean kimono he's wearing for the first time, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords. \nNearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly, murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking about. \nHigen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren, who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren. \nAlgren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish -- causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on the attack. \nAlgren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer. \nSuddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns. \nUjio is standing behind him, arms folded. \nUjio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword. It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing. \nUjio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually, only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment. \nUjio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his kneels. \nSatisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the bystanders cause him to turn back: . \nAlgren is standing again, and again holding the sword. \nWith grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose. \nAgain Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose. \nUjio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away. \nAgain, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him. \nBut Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren in the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken, Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away. \nThe ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet. This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then finally the head. \nAlgren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword. Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee. \nINT.              YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                   EVENING \nAlgren lies painfully on a mat, his eyes unfocused. \nA sudden flash of memory: \nThe lovel y blond woman, tears in her eyes, looks up to Algren's shining face, the epaulets on his crisp officer's, uniform gleaming gold in the sun. \nThe reverie is broken. \nAs Taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face. He stares at her darkly. \nALGREN Who are you people anywa y? \nShe makes no attempt to understand or respond. \nALGREN You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't even have any fucking walls. Your walls are made of paper, what's the matter with you? \nShe pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck. \nALGREN This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house. What is wrong with you? \nThis last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl of soup she had brought for him, and bringing it to his lips... \nALGREN Do you have a soul at all? \nHe stares at her for a moment, then knocks the soup out of her blinds. \nHer eyes FLASH for one moment, before resuming their usual mildness. But that flash is enough to satisfy him, and he calms down. She walks away. He sighs, exhausted, only to see her approach again with a new bowl. Their eyes meet, and hold for a moment. She does have a soul. He takes a sip. \nINT.                 SHINTO SHRINE                        DAY \nAlgren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine. Katsumoto kneels before a small altar. He doesn't seem aware that Algren is present. \nKATSUMOTO Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword. \nALGREN Is that what he's doing? \nKATSUMOTO At what age did you become I soldier? \nALGREN Nineteen. \nKA TSUMOTO To fight in your American civil war. \nALGREN Yes. \nKA TSUMOTO Tell me about that war'. \nALGREN What about it? \nKATSUMOTO Everything. \nKA TSUMOTO The wa y you look at the cherry blossoms. \nALGREN (reluctantly) We lived in a place called Connecticut. My...brother and I climbed the maple trees. \nKA TSUMOTO Were they beautiful? \nALGREN Yes. \nKATSUMOTO And you were sad to see them die in the winter. \nA beat. Something flickers in Algren's eyes. \nKATSUMOTO You were something before you were a soldier. You were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the trees die. \nKatsumoto looks at him deepl y. \nKA TSUMOTO Like those trees, we are all dying. The future is an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion. We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup of tea. Every word we write... Every blossom we hold. \nHe smiles sadly. \nKA TSUMOTO Every life we take. \nA beat. He stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard. \nKATSUMOTO Life in every breath. That is bushido. The wa y of the samurai. \nHe goes. Algren stands for a moment deep in thought \nINT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               NIGHT \nAlgren is asleep. And then we note that the ground is vibrating .. he slides across his mat .- wakes with a start \nAn unholy rumbling- \nAlgren bolts up ... just as a paper wall rips open, the wooden framework to the room splits and the roof collapses-- \nAn earthquake. Common for this part of Japan. \nEXT.                     VILLAGE                            NIGHT \nYoritomo appears. He and Algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches violently- \nPart of the house contorts and caves in \nAround the village, the wooden frame houses are swa ying and lurching they have some torque, but not enough \nUjio directs the villagers as they battle a fire- \nTaka appears, calling frantically for Toshiie. \nThen an even larger seismic tremor suddenly TEARS THROUGH THE VILLAGE \nHouses are ripped apart -- the whole world shifting. \nThough the smoke, Algren sees Toshiie cowering under an eave \nA heavy ceiling beam breaks loose, threatens to crush Toshiie \nAlgren dives forward, grabs Toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y... the front of the house collapses, the beams smashing to the ground.. \nTaka and Higen race to Algren and Toshiie. The boy is safe. \nTaka grabs the child and cradles him. Her look to Algren is fierce, protective, almost feral -- as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer. \nEXT.                       VILLAGE                               DAY \nAlgren watches the villagers rebuild. Yoritomo and Higen strugg1e with a large wooden framework. \nALGREN (V.O.) I am str    uck by these people and their acceptance of Fate in a1l it   s variations. At a time like this, they seem utterly without      sentiment. Even the children have a gravity beyond      their years. \nAlgren goes to them. Silently begins to help them. \nINT.                 YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                    DAYS LATER \nAlgren works with Yoritomo, binding the wooden framework. Higen prepares the paper walls nearby. He does this with considerable skill. \nTaka is getting water from a rain barrel she observes Algren helping rebuild her home. Yoritomo is working nearby. Algren's Japanese is rough but improving: \nALGREN (in Japanese, subtitles) Would last longer ... if stone. \nYORITOMO (subtitles) No. House fall. House go back easy with wood. \nAlgren shakes his head. Taka appears with cups of water. Algren looks at her For the first rime, she holds his gaze. \nEXT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               EVENING \nTorches illuminate a small stage in the center of the village square. Several samurai perform a ritualistic Noh drama. (A form which, by the wa y, the samurai invented.) Others play flutes and large steel drums. \nALGREN (V.O.) And yet I have never seen a people with more capacity for the joy found in the simplest things of life. \nKatsumoto himself plays the lead role. An enthusiastic actor, he plays to the children in the audience. They are delighted with his broad theatrics. \nINT. YORITOMO'S HOUSE \nTaka is carrying in a huge lack of rice. Algren goes to help her. \nTAKA (subtitles) No, please. \nALGREN (insistent) Hai. He carries the rice for her into the pantry area. \nTAKA (subtitles) Japanese men do not help with this. \nALGREN (subtitles) I know. \nToshiie bows. Algren bows and tucks the scroll into his coat. \nAlgren and Yoritomo move out with Katsumoto, Ujio, Nakao and his bodyguard of several dozen Samurai. \nThe villagers bow and honor the warrior as they pass. \nEXT.                    MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPE                             DAY \nAlgren trots alongside Katsumoto. \nALGREN ... The Emperor sends a message for you to return to Tokyo, and you go? \nKATSUMOTO Yes. \nALGREN Even though you're in rebellion against him. \nKATSUMOTO Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him. As I have alwa ys done.    . \nALGREN I don't understand. \nKATSUMOTO Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must sa y to him. \nALGREN But ever yone around him wants you dead. \nKA TSUMOTO And if the Emperor desires, I will take my own life at his command. \nHe spurs his horse and rides on. A1gren watches him. \nEXT.         MOUNTAIN VALLEY                               SUNSET \nThey approach a large inn. \nA boy working in the fields see Katsumoto approaching. He doesn't believe it -- the Great Katsumoto. He drops his hoe and races awa y, calling out. \nKATSUMOTO We will stop here for the night. \nEXT.                      MOUNTAIN VALLEY                              SUNSET \nSamurai guards have been posted around the perimeter. \nINT.         KATSUMOTO'S RQOM                              NIGHT \nAlgren is escorted in. Katsumoto kneels at a table. Preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. \nKATSUMOTO Sit, Captain. \nAlgren sits. By now he has learned how to sit on the ground. Katsumoto begins the exacting, delicate and precise tea ceremony. \nKATSUMOTO Do you drink tea? \nALGREN I've had little else for some time... \nKatsumoto continues with the tea ceremony. \nALGREN How's your poem coming? \nKATSUMOTO I am having trouble. The truth is I am not a very good poet. (Algren smiles) Do you know wh y you were sent here? To Yoshino. \nALGREN To protect the railroad. \n.                              KATSUMOTO Why is the railroad here? \nALGREN So Tokyo can control the whole country. \nKATSUMOTO You have seen my province. All mountains. Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come here? \nKatsumoto tosses a tiny bit of coal on the simmering brazier on the table. Algren watches carefully. \nALGREN You have something they want \nKATSUMOTO What do they want in my mountains? \nALGREN Minerals ... Gold. \nKA TSUMOTO (smiles) There is no gold in Japan. \nKatsumoto gently blows on the coal brazier. The coal flares a bit. \nALGREN Coal? (Katsumoto looks at him) For steamships. \nKA TSUMOTO And why would steamships be so important? \nALGREN ...China. \nKatsumoto looks up at him. Impressed. \nKATSUMOTO Japan has nothing. China has ever ything. \nALGREN Mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to China ... Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and America have a monopol y on the China trade. \nKATSUMOTO Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know the Zaibatus? \nALGREN The wealthy families. \nKATSUMOTO As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all land within four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country grows, so will his wealth. (looks at him) This is why you are fighting. \nKatsumoto completes the tea ceremony. He pours a cup for Algren. Bows his head and offers it to him. \nALGREN And you will tell the emperor to stop them? \nKATSUMOTO I do not tell the emperor what to do. \nALGREN Then what do you hope to accomplish? \nFor when the Ninjas come, they come all at once-- \nA Ninja suddenly comes TEARING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE PAPER WALL, his sword slashing down .- just missing Katsumoto. \nKatsumoto calls out an alarm, diving and rolling across the floor for his sword. He instantly kills one Ninja using his steel-tipped \"war fan\" to slash his attackers throat. Another smashes in through the window. \nINT.                  INN -- MAIN H ALL                      NIGHT \nNinjas EXPLODE into the main hall. Samurai who come out of their rooms are cut down by a variety of weapons -- one takes a throwing star in the face, others are felled by the traditional ninja-to, short swords ideal for fighting in confined spaces, chain-knives, nun-chaka and others. \nMore Ninjas drop from the rafters on ropes. \nINT.                          INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                              NIGHT \nA Ninja SMASHES through the paper wall -- Algren grabs the nearest object, a low tea table. and swings it at his head. The Ninja dodges the blow and slices at Algren with short-sword. \nAlgren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword LODGES deep in the wood. Algren flings himself, bodily, at his attacker. \nINT.                      INN-- MAIN HALL                           NIGHT \nNinja throwing stars spin across the room, killing a samurai. \nYoritomo emerges from his room, readying his bow, but the dead samurai falls back blocking his wa y. From behind the rice wall, Yoritomo lets fly an arrow without even looking. \nIt passes THROUGH the wall, killing the Ninja on the opposite balcony. \nINT.                         INN-- FIRST FLOOR                    NIGHT \nUjio screams a war cry and begins to battle his way up the stairs. With breathtaking moves, he slashes hands and limbs, forcing the Ninja back. \nNakao fights his wa y up beside him, desperately trying to reach Katsumoto's room. Using only his bare hands he catches a Ninja's wrist and hurls him over the railing. \nINT.                         INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                      NIGHT \nAlgren and the Ninja are in a death struggle, kneeing, gouging, butting. They awkwardly smash through a paper wall into the next room. \nINT.                     INN -- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                      NIGHT \nKatsumoto wields his long sword in one hand and his short sword in the other. It is the first time we have seen him in action and his movements are both beautiful and deadly. \nBut more Ninjas are pouring in through the window, threatening to overwhelm him. \nINT.                            INN -- ALGREN'S ROOM                    NIGHT \nRolling on the ground, Algren manages to grab a chopstick and STAB his adversary through the eye. He picks up the fallen short sword and steps out into the hall. \nARROWS whiz past, thudding into the wall beside his head. \nINT.                     INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                          NIGHT \nKatsumoto, breathing heavily, his kimono shredded and bloody, is fending off the Ninjas' increasingly savage attacks as Algren enters. \nAlgren SCREAMS, distracting them just long enough for Katsumoto to take advantage and kill one. \nThen, just as a Ninja it about to kill Algren, Katsumoto FLINGS his short sword ... it pin-wheels across the room, hitting Algren's attacker in the chest. \nWithout missing a beat, Algren pulls the short sword from the dying Ninja's chest and uses it to stab another Ninja who, thinking Algren defenseless, has launched an attack. \nINT.                         INN -- MAIN HALL                       NIGHT \nUjio and Nakao are back to back, a perfect fighting machine as they fight their wa y to Katsumoto's rescue. They battle Ninjas wielding lethal kusarigamas, the Ninjas swing chains, the attached blades slice the air--Nakao catches the chains and flinging the Ninja over the balcony. \nINT.               YORITOMO'S ROOM                           NIGHT \nYoritomo is pinned down. Darts and throwing stars shred the rice paper wall above him. He picks off another Ninja before changing his position. \nINT.                   INN-- KATSUMOTO'S ROOM                          NIGHT \nThe blazing sword battle continues. \nAlgren throws a beautiful painted standing-screen in front of an attacking Ninja, momentarily confusing him. Then he stabs THROUGH THE SCREEN -as a blood- stain SPREADS across the pastoral painting. \nBut another Ninja catches Algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. As Algren lifts his sword to parry the blow, HIS LITILE FINGER IS CHOPPED OFF. \nHe drops the sword, momentarily defenseless. \nAcross the hallway \nYoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls. Algren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow. \nIn Katsumoto's room \nAlgren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade. Suddenly the Ninja JACKKNIFES as if punched by an unseen hand. As he spins, dead, to the ground, we SEE an ARROW lodged bet ween his shoulder blades. Yoritomo has FIRED blindly, through the wall \u00ad killing Algren's attacker. \nNearby, a Ninja hurls a throwing star at Katsumoto. With blind instinct Katsumoto turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm. \nAlgren, meanwhile, has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand. He uses the rest of the fabric TO TIE HIS HAND TO HIS SWORD before launching himself back into the fray -- slicing an attacker just as he is about to impale Katsumoto. \nTogether, he and Katsumoto force the last two Ninjas through a paper wall to the next room. They fight all the wa y through that room and BLAST through another paper wall to the next. \nINT.                  INN \u00ad STAIRWAY                           NIGHT \nThe battle continues unabated on the stairs -- the Ninjas spring for position with incredible grace --perching and fighting on banisters, leaping from one level to the next. \nIt is a mayhem of flashing swords and flailing limbs and flyi ng arrows and spinning Ninja stars. \nSprays of blood splatter against the white rice paper walls. \nSome of the fighting is less than elegant. Men bite and wrestle and gouge to survive in close quarters. \nAll of them arc bloody and sweat y and dirty and tired, heaving for breath, their skin flayed open, their kimonos ripped, their hands and arms and faces blood-stained. \nBut more samurai reinforcements follow Ujio up the stairs: Together with Yoritomo and Nakao, they have begun to gain the upper hand. \nALGREN (after a moment) Private cabin. \nEXT.                   TOKYO \u00ad STREET                             DAY \nGraham walks with Algren. \nGRAHAM Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white man has ever been in your position. Do you have any idea what it will mean to have Omura as your friend? You want land, you want women, you want boys? \nAlgren starts to walk faster, but Graham Stops him. \nGRAHAM Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years. You must believe me there is a majest y about these people -- can you imagine what your own country would be if it had half the drive and the discipline and the belief and the bravery of these ridiculous little people? \nThen raised voices from across the street stop them. \nThey see Yoritomo surrounded by four Imperial Army soldiers. The soldiers are rough and imperious, drunk with power. They carry gleaming rifle.. \nThe soldiers bark orders. Yoritomo stands proudly, responding calmly. \nALGREN \nWhit is this? \nGRAHAM My God, it's the edicts... \nALGREN What edicts? \nAlgren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile - the soldiers are pointing to Yoritomo's head, screaming \nAlgren steps toward the soldiers-- \nALGREN That's enough-- \nOne of the soldiers SCREAMS at him -- raises his rifle -- all the soldiers raise their rifles \u00ad Yoritomo reaches for his sword -- Algren tries to push through - \nALGREN (subtitles) YORITOMO, WAIT! \nOne of the soldiers smacks Algren in the chin with a rifle butt. Algren reels, and by the time he stands straight again, four others are pointing their ba yonets at his face. \nGraham takes hold of Algren's arm. \nGRAHAM Don't be stupid. \nAlgren makes eye contact with Yoritomo, who -- in deference to his friend -- puts his sword away. \nThe Japanese soldiers continue to scream at Yoritomo. They force him to his knees. Rifles pressed to his head. \nYoritomo bows his bead, speaking quietly, as if praying. \nAlgren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet -- another grab. Yoritomo's hair, jerks his head back and begins hacking off Yoritomo's traditional top-knot of hair. Brutally. Blood. \nYoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face. \nThe soldiers laugh and move off. \nAlgren kneels by Yoritomo. Yoritomo looks up at him. There are tears in his eyes. \nEXT.                  KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                    DUSK \nKatsumoto's house on the outskirts of Tokyo is spacious and harmonious. Utterly Japanese. Samurai guards in full regalia, stand menacingly outside. \nINT.                   KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                                   DUSK \nUjio kneels with Yoritomo, dressing the wounds on his head. \nGraham sits across the room talking quietly to the mammoth Nakao, taking notes in a small notebook. Nakao has been brutally shorn of his top knot as well. His shame is apparent. \nINT.                     KATSUMOTO'S CHAMBER                          DUSK \nServants he1p dress Katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as Algren is ushered in. \nKATSUMOTO Captain, I had not thought to see you again. \nALGREN I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to tell you what's going on here. \nKATSUMOTO You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers, is that how you sa y it? \nALGREN They're about to close a trade agreement that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine. \nKATSUMOTO Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to need those weapons before be will sign. \nALGREN (realizing) And you are to be the cause... \nKATSUMOTO Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons. The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu what it wants. And my country is sold to yours. \nAs Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground of old scars, so like his own. \nKA TSUMOTO Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for the elimination of our traditional topknots. \nALGREN I know. \nKATSUMOTO The second banned the wearing of sword. \nAlgren stops. He knows what swords mean to the samurai. \nKATSUMOTO (re: his swords) Hand them to me, will you? \nAlgren picks up Katsumoto's two swords. Looks at him deeply. \nALGREN If you do this, they will kill you. \nKA TSUMOTO I am hard to kill. \nALGREN You don't know what their weapons can do. All your men butchered ... Just for pride. \nGRAHAM Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that time you were with him, up in those mountains, ..................................   ...I told you they were a remarkable people... \nAlgren doesn't answer, but isn't denying it either. \nGRAHAM Then you should get out. Because Omura will become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team. \nGraham notices Algren staring at his followers. \nGRAHAM Case in point. \nALGREN Who are they? \nGRAHAM Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai doing odd jobs for his Nibs. \nALGREN What do they want from me? \nGRAHAM To make sure you're on the side of God and Country, or to make sure you get the hell out. \nALGREN You've been a great help, Graham. I thank you. \nGRAHAM Look who's getting sentimental now. \nA look bet ween them, then Algren nods for the bearer to continue. \nEXT.                  HARBOR                             SUNSET \nAlgren stands at the gangplank. Porters wait with his luggage. Algren looks back into the crowd and sees the ronin. They glare back, no longer trying to keep out of sight. \nA BLAST from the steam whistle. \nAlgren looks from the ship, to the ronin, to the bustling, chaotic city behind them. Finally, he looks out at the harbor and the ocean, beyond which used to lie his home. \nHe turns to the bearer. \nALGREN (subtitles) Take back to quarters. I walk. \nAnd Algren starts back into the city. \nEXT.             TOKYO STREETS               EVENING \nDown a shadowy street, lit only by t orches. Slowl y we realize he is being followed and that he knows it. \nUp ahead, the street appears to dead-end. \nThe two Ronin step out from the shadows and face him, their hands on their swords. \nBehind him, Another dangerous looking Ronin joins the one who has been following him. \nThey begin to close in. \nAlgren stands completely still. They grow closer. \nAlgren appears to close his eyes. And the sound of the approaching footsteps fades as We HEAR ONLY the sound of his breathing. \nThe Ronin draw their swords. \nAlgren gently opens his eyes. Ever ything has SLOWED DOWN: a sign in the breeze, a piece of rubbish on the street, the flame of a nearby torch. \nA BLUR OF MOTION. \nEverything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what has taken place. In the strobing shadows, all we really know is that Algren has leapt to the attack. \nWithin seconds, four bodies lie in the street \nAlgren holds bloody sword. \nHis face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped, but other than that he is unharmed. Ujio has taught him welt \nAs he stands, catching his breath, we HOLD on his face in CLOSE-UP. \nA sudden flash: \nWe see Algren grab one of the torches and smash it across the ronin's face. \nIt is the attack \u00ad replayed in real-time. \nRolling to avoid a death-blow, he grabs the fallen man's sword and eviscerates attacker #2. \nThe two remaining Ronin strike. \nHe parries the blow of attacker #3, whirls to slice the legs of attacker #4, whirls again to cut off the hand of attacker #1, who has returned to the attack. \nMeanwhile, attacker #3 serums and charges -- just lit attacker #4 is trying to stand. \nAlgren steps back as attacker #3 impales attacker #4. Algren steps forward and cuts off the head of attacker #3. \nEven now, it has happened too fast to be truly appreciated. \nBACK TO THE STREET \nWe move, closer-still on Algren's face. \nA sudden flash: \nAnd so we watch the attack again. in super-slow motion now, so we can fully appreciate it's terrible beauty. \nA torch smashes across a face. \nA sword slices the sleeve of a coat. \nSparks fly as two swords meet. \nA severed hand falls in the dirt. \nThree GUARDS round a corner. Swords flash as Ujio and Nakao dispatch them without even slowing. They race on, Graham laboring to keep up. \nINT.                    CASTLE KEEP                     NIGHT \nAlgren rounds a corner-- \nUjio, Yoritomo, Nakao, and Graham are moving toward him. \nALGREN This wa y... \nClearly, this has all been Algren's plan. They move up a stairwa y. \nINT.                CASTLE KEEP (SECOND FLOOR)                           NIGHT \nThe three guards are still standing at attention outside Katsumoto's cell. His swords are next to them. \nAlgren keeps the others out of sight and lowers his head to whisper with Ujio. Ujio nods, then walks into sight and calmly approaches the guards. \nStill hidden, Algren gestures for the others remain to silent. After a moment, he gestures that they can proceed. \nAlgren and the others round the comer to discover the bloody remains of the three guards - whom Ujio has dispatched in absolute silence. They unlock the cell. \nINT.                   CASTLE \u00ad CELL                         FOLLOWING \nKatsumoto is shocked to see Algren enter. Algren tosses him his swords. \nALGREN How's the poem coming? \nKATSUMOTO The ending is proving difficult. \nINT.

CASTLE \u00ad CORRIDOR                          NIGHT \nAlgren, Katsumoto, and the others race through an upper corridor. \nKATSUMOTO (re:Graham) Who is this? \nALGREN Name's Simon Graham. Wants to write a book about you. \nGRAHAM An honor. I have followed your activities with great interest. I think the European public would be fascinated by a book about your adventures. \nKATSUMOTO Not a book. A play! \nSuddenly, from below, the raised voices of guards. They hurry a wa y. \nINT.               CASTLE \u00ad STAIRS                     NIGHT \nGuards carrying pikes race up the stairs-- \nINT.                CASTLE \u00ad CORRIDOR                  NIGHT \nAlgren and the others are moving swiftl y down a stone corridor. \nThe sound of the approaching guards is growing louder. \nA silent WILD BUNCH moment of preparation as they stride down the corridor, five abreast. \nAlgren pulls the cavalry saber from his dress uniform. Katsumoto prepares his swords. Nakao stretches his huge arms. Yoritomo and Uji o draw their bows. \nEXT.                   CASTLE - UPPER COURTYARD                        FOLLOWING \nTen guards with rifles patrol the upper battlements. \nYoritomo and Uji o crouch and fire. Arrow a fter arrow a fter arrow, as fast as a repeating rifle, the arrows streak through the night. Completely silent. \nIt is a dazzling display. They time shots to sail over walls, shoot through tiny windows, shoot out torches. Multiple arrows. Perfect aim. \nIn a matter of seconds all ten guards are dead. \nThey continue across the courtyard, up some steps -- \nINT.             CASTLE--TIGHT CORRIDOR                         FOLLOWING \nThey stride through a tight, dark stone corridor. \nSuddenly, a cadre of Omura guards emerge from the shadows. \nWithout hesitation, they launch into battle. Algren and Katsumoto wield their swords. Yoritomo and Ujio fire arrows. \nNakao fights with his hands, dramatic martial arts from the huge man. \nBut this corridor is just too tight -- it is a sea of combat.. the guards and our warriors are slammed together --the swords and pikes sending up sparks in the darkness as they strike the stone walls. \nThe right corridor echoes with samurai war cries and clanging swords. \nThen... \nMore guards appear. \nThese guards have rifles. \nRifle blasts thunder --startling strobe-like bursts of light in the darkness -- \nAlgren dives in front of Katsumoto to protect him- \nYoritomo is hit- \nHe jerks back -- blood-- \nAMBASSADOR SWANBECK What do you mean? \nOMURA Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will fight. We will destroy them with your new weapons. \nBAGLEY What if he just goes off to the mountains and becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such? \nOMURA You still do not understand us ... Katsumoto can do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama. He must act out his destiny. He knows it. \nAMBASSADOR SWANBECK You trust a lot in destiny. \nOMURA This story was written years ago. From the first sight of your warships in our harbor... (stares out the window) It is a1l inevitable. \nEXT.             HILLS                           SUNSET \nAlgren, Katsumoto, and the others ride over rocky ground. \nALGREN (V.O.) June 1, 1877. Yesterday, I passed the field where Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom I now ride. In the distance a steam train chugs along. Inevitable. Progress. \nEXT.                 FOREST \u00ad MOUNTAINS                     DAY \nThey climb a steep trail. Beyond, the glaciers glow pink. \nALGREN (V.O.) I am beset by ironies -- trained to fight rebels now I am one. And yet 1 ask mysel f... can a man be reborn?: \nAlgren, Katsumoto, and the others ride through a dense forest Katsumoto reins his horse. The others follow suit. They wait \nALGREN (V.O.) And if so, what would he make of it? \nMounted samurai emerge from the thick forest As it they were invisible. \nThe leader leaps from his horse and bows, touching his head to the dirt. All the other samurai follow suit. \nEXT.    CHERRY TREE FOREST--NEAR THE VILLAGE                       EVENING \nKatsumoto rides at the head of his samurai as they pass through the cherry orchard. Then he reins his horse and falls in beside Algren. \nKATSUMOTO (his voice troubled) I was prepared to die in Omura's castle. And yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were you sent into my life. What is the lesson you were meant to give me? \nALGREN Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we thought... \nKatsumoto laugh. And then in a surprisingly deft imitation of Algren \nKATSUMOTO You...ain't whistlin' Dixie... \nHe spurs his horse and heads off. Algren shakes his head and follows. \nEXT.               VILLAGE                     EVENING \nThe returning warriors are warmly welcomed by the villagers. \nAlgren rides directly to Yoritomo's house, dismounts. \nTaka and Toshiie are waiting. \nHe goes to them. His expression tells them all they need to know. \nINT.          YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT \nAlgren sits with the family. The boys sit next to their mother. \nALGREN (subtitles) ... he gave his life to save us. He died bravel y. \nTAKA (subtitles) Thank you, Algren-San. \nHIGEN (subtitles) Will you fight the white men? \nALGREN (subtitles) If they come here, yes. \nHIGEN (subtitles) Why? \nALGREN (subtitles) Because they come to destroy what I have come to love. \nTaka looks at him, moved and surprised. Suddenly, Higen jumps up and bolts... out of the room. Algren looks to Taka. \nTAKA (subtitles) The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children. He misses his father. \nALGREN And he is angry because I am the cause of that. \nShe smiles ever so slightly at his obliviousness. \nTAKA No. He it angry because he fears you will die as well. \nEXT.             VILLAGE                    NIGHT \nHigen stands, looking up at the stars. \nALGREN Higen. \nHIGEN (subtitles) My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle. \nALGREN (subtitles) That is what he believed. \nHIGEN (subtitles) I would be afraid to die in battle. \nALGREN (subtitles) So would I. \nHIGEN (subtitles) But you have been in many battles. \nALGREN (subtitles) And I was always afraid. \nHigen looks at him, tears welling in his eyes. \nHIGEN (subtitles) I don't want you to go. \nEXT.            VILLAGE                      LATER THAT NIGHT \nA somber mood has descended. Algren sits and writes in his journal. \nALGREN (V.O.) July 14, 1877. For so long now, I have managed to convince myself that there was nothing worth believing in. \nA samurai plays a melancholy bamboo flute. The gentle sound floats through the village... \nALGREN (V.O.) Certainly nothing worth dying for. \nWe see samurai preparing for the final battle. Some check their armor... Others meditate... \nALGREN (V.O.) Now I am not so sure. \nSome make up their faces so they will look handsome when they greet death. Some methodically polish their swords. Some sit with their families. \nALGREN (V.O.) And so, for the first time in my life, I am truly afraid. Not of dying. But of losing something worth living for. \nUjio is performing a graceful, ritualistic sword-dance to the song of the flute. Algren Joins Graham to watch him. \nGRAHAM What is it:? . \nALGREN The kenbu,.. his dance of death. \nTaka comes to them. \nTAKA (subtitles) Algren-san, will you come with me? \nAlgren leaves Graham and accompanies Taka toward the house. \nThey pass Higen and Toshiie, who sit with other children at the feet of the massive Nakao, listening to a quiet story he tells, \nINT.                   YORITOMO'S HOUSE                     FOLLOWING \nThe gentle flute music from outside drifts in. \nOne of Yoritomo's beautiful kimonos is elegantly spread on a mat. \nTAKA (subtitles) If you wear this, it will honor us. \nHe nods. \nShe steps to him. \nA moment. She gently reaches forward and unbuttons his collar. \nA tender, silent scene as she undresses him and carefully wraps him in the kimono. Her hands move gracefull y around his body, never quite touching him. His movements are gentle in response. \nWhen he is fully dressed, then are tears in his eyes. \nSuddenly, fiercely, they are holding each other. \nEXT.             KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE -- PORCH                  LATER THAT NIGHT The quiet evening continues. \nAlgren, now dressed in the kimono, finds Katsumoto carefully dropping little leaves of incense into a small flame that simmers inside his battle helmet. \nKATSUMOTO So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I meet my ancestors ... (dry) ... You do not do this ? \nAlgren smiles, sits. ALGREN I studied war at a place called West Point. They taught us about a battle called Thermopylae. Three hundred brave warriors held off the king of Persia's army of a million men. For two da ys they made them pay so dearly that the king lost all appetite for further invasion (looks at him) ... I have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow. \nKATSUMOTO (bemused) Do you really think we can defeat them? \nALGREN I sure as hell want to find out. \nKATSUMOTO You believe a man can change his destiny? \nALGREN No ... But I think a man cannot know his destiny. He can only do what he can, until his destiny is revealed. \nA si1ent beat. \nThen Katsumoto picks up a long bundle wrapped in cloth. He unwraps it. A beautilu1 long samurai sword. \nHe bows his head and offers it to Algren. \nThere are Japanese characters etched on the blade. \nALGREN What does it say? \nKATSUMOTO \"I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new.\" \nAlgren is moved beyond words. He bows. \nAs the CAMERA pulls away, Algren and Katsumoto squat side by side, drawing in the dirt with a stick, planning the next day's battle strategy. \nAcross the square, Ujio continues his elegant dance of death, his graceful form illuminated in silhouette by a fire. \nINT.          YORITOMO'S HOUSE                   MORNING \nIt is the day of the battle. Algren is buttoning the long coat of his cavalry uniform. \nHe looks up to see Higen standing in the doorwa y, holding the breast-plate of his father's armor. \nEXT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                 DAY \nAlgren emerges from the house, wearing the breast-plate over his coat. Taka is at his horse, tying a bag of food to the saddle. She turns and sees her husband's armor on this man. And her breath stops. \nAlgren approaches her. They stand very cl ose. \nTAKA (subtitles) Return. \nALGREN (subtitles) If that is my destiny ... Anshinritsumai. [I wish you peace.] \nTAKA Anshinritsumai. \nColonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisers and Japanese Officers watch through binoculars. Stunned. As the First Wave is routed. \nHAGLEY What the hell? \nOMURA It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny. (snaps an order) Send in the second wave. Two divisions. \nEXT.                  BARRICADES                          DAY \nAlgren and Katsumoto wait behind the second barricade. We note that this barricade is the real thing. \nKatsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm, a bullet wound beneath. Algren looks over the barricade. \nThey see Imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders on the opposing hilltop. \nKATSUMOTO How long? \nALGREN They need to regroup and report our position. Then they'll come hard. \nKatsumoto considers the bodies of the dead Imperia1soldiers. \nKA TSUMOTO It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot tell one warrior from another. \nALGREN They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a modern army. \nKATSUMOTO Not my world anymore. \nEXT.            BATTLE FIELD                   DAY \nBugles. The attack is reforming. Ranks now bolstered by reinforcements. \nThey come at a trot, through the narrow defile, skirting the first barricade, continuing at a trot toward the second barricade. \nEXT.              2ND BARRICADE                      DAY \nKatsumoto pulls his long sword. Algren does the same. \nKatsumoto calls out an order -- the archers fire another round. \nThe Imperial soldiers are being annihilated but still they come in great waves -- for ever y one who falls it seems there are ten to take his place. \nThey race forward, stepping over their fallen comrades, bayonets poised -- \nThe Mauser rifles flash -- \nBullets explode around the samurai, many are hit. \nThe Imperial Army has been trained to keep firing on the run. The waiting Samurai will be decimated, except -- \nFrom the hills on either side \nFully half of the Samurai force -- who have been kept hidden until this moment... charge, screaming into the flank of the attacking Army. Even rifles cannot fire in three directions at once. \nAlgren and Katsumoto lead the charge over the second barricade. Some are cut down, but in moments swords engage ba yonets in brutal hand-to-band combat. \nAlgren And Katsumoto fight back to back, as if one person, slashing with their swords, shattering bayonet, dealing death on all sides. \nUjio crouches, his back leg straight and planted, his front leg bent. Still using his bow, firing off arrows with Stunning speed, refusing to budge-- \nOn the opposing hillside \nBagley and Omura watch the battle through binoculars. \nBAGLEY A classic \"V\" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using Welt Point tactics. \nIn the midst of the battle \nA charging soldier thrust     s his bayonet into Katsumoto's arm - Katsumoto kills, the soldier with his short    sword but is awkwardly tangled with his body, a second soldier races toward him      for the kill - Algren spins and attacks killing the second soldier - but a third races    toward Algren, bayonet f1ashing \nHe dodges -- but the bayonet slices into his side -- \nAlgren kicks the soldier away -- tries to use his sword but the soldier springs back ath1etically .. Ujio appears like a black spectral figure to deliver the coup de grace. \nAll SOUND gradually fades and is replaced by the elegaic sound of a bamboo flute... the images of combat become fragmented and impressionistic. \nBur no matter how bravel y the samurai fight, they are simply outnumbered... \nNakao is like a cornered bear, arcing his two swords wildly around him. He is shot in the chest, and staggers a moment before continuing. Another soldier shoots him in the arm at point blank range. Nakao', sword goes fl ying, so the giant Samurai leaps forward and picks up the shooter bodily, twirling him around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the upraised pike of a fellow Imperial soldier. But now three more soldiers have levelled their weapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again. Shots rain on him as he tries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves him. Finally, with one last lunge, he manages to pull an Imperial soldier with him, crushing him as he falls. \nMore and more fall as Algren, Katsumoto, and their comrades fight desperately... \nThe mournful flute is the appropriate accompaniment as Ujio is mortally wounded. The grim award master is cut through with bullets. Still he fights. An Imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself, and Ujio's blade cuts through the barrel. The soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement before a second sweep of Uji o's sword beheads him. But there are too many to take the man's place, and finally fi ve men run Uji o through with bayonets, and he is pinned against the barricade, still upright in death. \nAt last, what is left of this second wave of the Imperial Army, retreats. \nEXT.             PLAIN                            ALMOST SUNSET \nThe plain before the barricade is littered with Imperial Army dead. \nAlgren and Katsumoto sit exhausted, leaning against the barricade. They are both wounded. \nOnly about. hundred samurai are still alive. \nAlgren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment. Even those still alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of Imperial soldiers. \nKatsumoto is looking at Ujio's body nearby. \nKATSUMOTO He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend. \nALGREN We won't be able to hold them back this time. \nKATSUMOTO This is not your battle. You do not have to die here. \nA long beat. \nTHE SAMURAI CHARGE \nEven while riding at I full gallop, they have fixed arrows into their long \nbows. They let loose a lethal volley. \nBAGLEY \nBAGLEY Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!! \nBut before the guns can open up, he is IMPALED BY ARROW AFTER ARROW, a human pincushion. The final arrow pierces his forehead. \nThen... \nThe Gatling Guns finally fire. Ripping into the samurai- \nDestroying them- \nOne after another is hit -- and still they come -- their voices raised in glorious cries of triumph- \nGraham watches from a hilltop, tears in his eyes. \nKatsumoto is hit, blood explodes .- his horse falls -- he spi1ls off-- \nThen Algren is hit -- he falls-- \nAlgren drags himself to Katsumoto, bullets exploding ever ywhere \u00ad \nAlgren looks up to see... \nThe remaining samurai still charging- \nAnd still the Gatling Guns tear through them-- \nAnd still they charge \u00ad \nUntil they are all down. \nEXT.             OPPOSING HILLTOP                           SUNSET \nA Japanese Officer shouts out an order -- the Gatling Guns stop. \nOmura screams at him to continue firing! \nThe Japanese officer barks out response. Refusing. \nOmura sees all the samurai are dead or dying. \nBut he also sees Algren kneeling by Katsumoto, dragging him awa y. He screams at the Japanese officer to resume fire! \nThe Japanese officer refuses. \nHe just looks over the plain of dying samurai for a moment. Then he does the most remarkable thing. \nHe slowl y kneels and touches his head to the dirt. \nThen a soldier near him does the same thing. Then another and another. And then by the thousands. \nThey kneel and touch their heads to the dirt. \nHonoring the last samurai. \nEXT.                PLAIN                    SUNSET \nA1gren drags the dying Katsumoto to a8 copse of cherry trees nearby... \nEXT.

Without Algren's support, he would fall. \nKATSUMOTO My sword... \nALGREN No. \nKA TSUMOTO You have your honor again. Let me die with mine ... Kaishaku. \nAlgren looks at him, deeply moved. Katsumoto manages to pull out his short sword. \nKATSUMOTO You must help me. Hold it firmly... \nAlgren supports Katsumoto as he holds the sword's point firmly to his stomach. \nKA TSUMOTO Are you ready? \nALGREN No, Kaishaku. \nKatsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly. \nKATSUMOTO We will ride together again. \nKatsumoto embraces Algren firmly -- the sma1l sword impales him \nAlgren holds him tightly. Katsumoto is looking over Algren's shoulder as he dies. \nKatsumoto sees something. A look of joy and absolute peace comes to his features. \n", "test1_input": "YORITOMO Sake? \nALGREN Sake. \nYoritomo glances to the woman. She nods, and brings A1gren a saucer of sake. He drinks it down. Holds out the saucer for a refill \nSmiling, Yoritomo indicates for the woman to comply, but before she can pour another saucer, Algren takes the jug out of her other hand. Yoritomo laughs as Algren drinks it down. \nEXT.                       VILLAGE                               NIGHT \nAutumn leaves fall to the ground.

Finally she enters with a bowl of soup. \nHe glances up, something like panic in his eyes. \nShe kneels and attempts to hand him the soup, but be knocks it out of the wa y and grabs her by the throat. \nALGREN Sake! \nShe stares at him, the breath being squeezed out of her, but there is not even a whisper of fear in her eyes. She is utterly impassive. Shaken, he lets her go, and crumples to the floor.                         . \nALGREN (mumbling to himself) Sake... \nThe woman leaves the soup and wa1ks away. \nINT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                           DAYS LATER \nDaylight streams in, finding Algren lying on his back. The worst of the detox is past. As be lies there, these first moments of repose lead to: \nA sudden flash of memory: \nThe beautiful blond WOMAN from the picture laughs merrily, and falls back languorousl y in a grassy fi eld. \nBack in the room \nAlgren shakes off the memory as harsh SOUNDS from outside draw him to the window.                  . \nEXT.                    YORITOMO'S HOUSE                      MORNING \nAlgren watches from the window as the samurai train. It is like nothing else in the world. Part sacred ritual, part martial preparation, samurai training com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole. \nFinally well enough to walk, Algren comes out onto the porch to watch the spectacle. In front of him, is a Kendo (The Way of the Sword) master practice with their long and short swords. They have incredible control. \nNAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed, four samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking. \nKyudo (\"The Way of the Bow\") masters use their bows for target practice. Yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums. \nAlgren watches. Yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open. \n", "test1_true": "A wooden sword leans against the porch. \nAlgren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. In a flash, Uji o has raced over and grabbed it from him. Algren stands motionless as Ujio screams at him. \nThe training stops, as everyone watches Uji o berate Algren. \nEven as Ujio continues screaming. Algren simply shakes his head, turns awa y, and walk back into the house. \nINT.               YORITOMO'S HOUSE                         DAY \nAs the sounds of training resume outside, Algren explores the house. \nHe comes upon Higen and Toshiie playing with the red ball. They are embarrassed to encounter him alone. There's a moment of suspension, and then Higen throws the ball to Algren. \nAlgren looks back and forth between the two boys, fixes his gaze on Higen but throw the ball to Toshiie, causing both boys to laugh and run awa y. \nAlgren walks on. \nINT.                SMALL ROOM                           DAY \nAlgren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been made into a kind of shrine. \nCand1es and incense burn, a small Buddha sits on a dais, and Algren's eyes are drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner. \nThe BRIGHT RED ARMOR of the warrior Algren killed in the fog, is held upright by an unseen stand. It is almost as if the dead warrior himself is swing back at him. \nAlgren senses someone behind him and turns. The woman is standing across the hall. Their eyes meet. She turn, and walks away. \nEXT.               VILLAGE                            NIGHT \nA first, light snowfall has covered the ground. A1gren walks out into the still night. He turns a corner and confronts curious sight: \nTen warriors kneel, motionless in the snow, their eyes closed in concentration. \nAs Algren puzzles over this, he becomes aware that Katsumoto is now standing next to him. \nKATSUMOTO They are training. \nALGREN Training what? \nKATSUMOTO Their minds. It is called bushido... \nAlgren looks at him. He has never heard the word. \nKATSUMOTO The wa y of the warrior. We study from when we are young. Are my words correct? \nAlgren does not respond. \nKATSUMOTO I will practice my Eng1ish with you. \nALGREN Why do you learn English? \nKATSUMOTO To know m y enemy. \nALGREN If I am your enemy, why have you not killed me? \nKatsumoto doesn't answer. \nALGREN Was General Yoshitaka your enemy? \nKATSUMOTO No, I honor his memory as my kinsman. \nALGREN That why you helped him kill himself? \nKATSUMOTO If a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture. It is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend, help him. I was honored to by his kaishaku. \nALGREN Hell of an honor. \nKATSUMOTO It was his destiny. He knew it, he died at peace. \nALGREN Who was the warrior in the red armor? \nKATSUMOTO My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi. \nALGREN And the woman who cares for me? \nKATSUMOTO My daughter, Hiroshi's wife. Her name is Taka. \nAlgren is incredulous. \nALGREN I killed her husband? \nKATSUMOTO It was an honorable death. \nKatsumoto walks awa y. \nINT.             YORITOMO'S HOUSE                       DAY \nAlgren it now well enough to kneel at the table with the others. Taka treats him with utter politeness and dignity. He watches her intently, seeking any sign of the animosity he's certain she must feel. \nShe hands him a bowl of rice. \nALGREN (smiling politely) You hope I choke on it, don't you? \nShe bows, uncomprehending. \nALGREN You want to poison it and watch me fall over the table and foam at the mouth. Yoritomo bows in response to Algren's new willingness to communicate. \nYORITOMO (to Taka, subtitles) I promise I'll make him take a bath. \nTAKA (subtitles) Soon. Please. \n.EXT.

Algren watches in confusion, as this powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate. Finally: \nKATSUMOTO The parliament of your country has two houses. Why is that? \nALGREN To keep either one from being too powerful. \nKATSUMOTO Does not a people need a powerful ruler to protect them? \nALGREN We believe the opposite. \nKatsumoto thinks about this. \nALGREN I have a question. How do you come to speak English? \nKATSUMOTO Members of the Council were required to study ............              it. ........Yes, I was a member of the government. I helped restore the Emperor to the throne. \nALGREN So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to protect it. \nKatsumoto understands Algren's irony, but doesn't smile. \nALGREN And now you must hate him for what he's done. \nKATSUMOTO He is my blood. I serve him with my life. \nALGREN By fighting his army? \nKatsumoto looks at A1gren. \nKATSUMOTO I do not fight the emperor. I fight those who seek to influence him, those who betray the soul of my country. \nHe slowl y draws his long samurai sword, and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him. \nKA TSUMOTO The Emperor gave this blade to my ancestors 400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his sacred honor. \nKatsumoto hands the sword to Algren. Algren studies it. \nKATSMUOTO It takes many years to make a sword. It is a holy Act. A samurai's sword is his soul. \nALGREN This sword is flawed. What is this uneven line near the edge? \nKatsumoto smiles at Algren's ignorance. \nKATSUMOTO One man is flexible and compromises too much to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know peace. A man who knows both is the perfect warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel bends, and the other cuts. And where they meet is never perfect Hold the blade up. . \nAlgren holds the sword, cutting edge up. Katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it. It gently billows down -- and splits evenly on the edge. \nKATSUMOTO Some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the blood of its enemy. \nAlgren hands the sword back. Suddenly, Katsumoto swings the sword, cleanly splitting the table in two. Silence. \nALGREN The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle ever y seven minutes. \nKA TSUMOTO We gave up firearms two hundred years ago. It takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile awa y. You must look into the eyes of your enemy to know who you have killed. \nALGREN I'm not sure an artillery officer would agree. \nKATSUMOTO Do you? \nALGREN I think all killing's a filthy business. \nKATSUMO TO Taking a man's life is nothing. It is his honor you can never take awa y. \nALGREN In other words you have no respect for human life. \nKA TSUMOTO (fierce) . What do you know of human life? You come here to kill for money Where is your family? Where is your wife, your sons? What is your legacy? \nALGREN (undaunted) And what is yours? To rebel against the future? I fought the South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they were fighting for \"honor\" just as you do. And their people died by the thousands! \nKatsumoto simply looks at him. \nALGREN And my wife is dead. \nKATSUMOTO Mine, too. \nThey look at each other. Some unexpected recognition has taken place. \nKATSUMOTO Tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for dominance in the...\"Far East.\" \nALGREN ...I look forward to it. \nAlgren turns to go. \nEXT.VILLAGE SQUARE DAY \nWe see the village swordsmith at work. He has been forging the same long samurai blade for months... Algren watches him as he works. \nALGREN (V.O.) March 9. 1877. I have never known such a disciplined people. \nEXT. VILLAGE DAY \nAlgren trains with the other men. He attempts an attack, which is easily brushed aside by Nakao. Algren ends up in the dirt again. \nALGREN (V.O.) From the moment they wake, they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue-- \nEXT. VILLAGEDAY \nAlgren walking with Katsumoto -- they are deep in conversation. \nALGREN (V.O.) And yet the more time I spend here, the less I understand them. \nEXT.

YORITOMO'S                         HOUSE \nAlgren, holding the wooden sword in 1870'5 baseball manner, is coaxing Higen to throw the ball at him. The children laugh as Algren hits it onto the next porch. \nTaka watches her sons impassively. It is dear how much they like Algren. \nALGREN (V.O.) And I am sure they regard my wa ys to be as confounding and unfathomable as I find theirs. \nAN ICE CRYSTAL ON THE END OF A BRANCH \nStarts to drip. SPRING bas begun. \nBXT.

Two women hurry awa y from a farmer who is teasing them. \nAlgren is once again among the training warriors. He and another man face off, each waiting for the other to attack with his wooden sword. \nAlgren moves first, but his opponent counters, and strikes him easily. They wheel around and engage again, and again Algren is bested. Furious, he throws himself at his opponent, reverting to classic saber technique. \nIn a flurry of movement, his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock Algren to his knees. Yoritomo approaches and bows. \nYORITOMO A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many mind. \nALGREN What? \nYORITOMO (pointing as he explains) Mind sword, mind face, mind people watch, too many mind. (on Algren's confused expression) No mind. \nALGREN No mind? \nYORITOMO Hai! No mind. You try. \nAlgren nods, uncertainly, and picks himself up. Again he faces the opponent, shaking off the tension and trying to stay calm. \nThis time the opponent charges first, and Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is again bested. \nYoritomo bows happily and begins yammering in Japanese, clearly taking credit for Algren's progress. \nAcross the square, Katsumoto watches. \nEXT.

About the order, your Majest y. \nEMPEROR This railroad must go through Yoshino Province? \nOMURA It is absolutely necessar y your Highness. \nEMPEROR If you sa y so, I shall sign. \nEXT.

CHERRY TREE FOREST                              DAY \nAlgren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village. The pink and red blossoms are dazzling and abundant. Other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms. \nIt is a place of otherworldly beaut y. \nIt is all so beautiful that Algren just stops. Takes it in for a moment. He reaches out and touches a blossom. \nKATSUMOTO (O.S.) A perfect blossom is a rare thing... \nAlgren turns. Katsumoto is kneeling nearby, meditating. \nKA TSUMOTO You could spend your life looking for one. And it would not be a wasted life. \nALGREN Were you praying? \nKATSUMOTO Just sitting... I do not think I have the word. Satori it means, maybe, awareness. \nALGREN Of what? \nKATSUMOTO This moment alone, apart from all others ... You know this? (Algren shakes his head) I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent. I have only written one line on \"His eyes were like my own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean.\" Can you suggest a second line? \nALGREN I'm not much of a writer. \nKA TSUMOTO Is this why you spend so much time with your journal? \n.                     ALGREN How do you know that? (no answer) She told you. \nKatsumoto appraises Algren. \nALGREN Did you love her husband as your own son? \nKA TSUMOTO You have sent men to their deaths, just as I have. \nALGREN The difference is, you feel nothing. \nKA TSUMOTO Before you were a soldier, you were a farmer. \nALGREN What does that have to do with anything? \nKA TSUMOTO You lived on a farm.

Then: \nEMPEROR (subtitles) You rise against me, my teacher. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitles) No, Highness, I rise against your enemies. \nEMPEROR (subtitles) They are my teacher, my advisers, like you. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitles) They advise in their own interest. \nEMPEROR (subtitles) The world is changing, Mori -- you have not seen what goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science. I need men who can look outward, or soon we will be left behind, and defenseless. \nKATSUM OTO (subtitles) I am sworn to defend you even to my last breath. \nEMPEROR (subtit1es) The samurai live in the past. You cannot defend against a future you don't understand. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitles) If I am no use, then I will happily end my life, \nEMPEROR (subtitles) No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the Council of State. I need your voice. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitles) It is your voice that needs to be heard, Highness. You are a living God, you can do what ever you think is right. \nThe young emperor is silent a moment. \nEMPEROR (subtitles) I am a living God only as long as I do what they think is right. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitle) Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for saying what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone a young man I know to have some modest intelligence. \nThe emperor laughs warmly, almost happy to be scolded as he once was. \nEMPEROR (subtitles) Is it possible a living God can be too afraid to make his voice heard?

Plus this particular item you might recognize. \nA few stevedores tear open one of the crates. Algren hides his astonishment: A Gatling Gun is revealed. \nBAGLEY They've been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a minute, The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming. \nAlgren closes his eyes, trying to keep his memories at bay. \nEXT.

A new invention, the rickshaw, has replaced many of the palanquins. \nALGREN (V.O.) As though Tokyo were determined to become another New York or Chicago .- all in one headlong rush. \nSpider's web of telegraph cables spread from a tall new brick building.

All are dressed in Western clothes. \nAlgren, Colonel Bagley, and Ambassador Swanbeck enter. \nAMBASSADOR SWANBECK (to Algren) If he asks, you can talk about ordnance and tactics. But remember, this has to do with a lot more than just weapons. \nAn anteroom holds waiting delegations from the various European powers. A babel of language. ...

This is extremely valuable to me. \nHe watches Algren to see how this lands. \nOMURA You also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to Katsumoto. \nALGREN Again, you flatter me. \nOMURA No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is valuable. And I buy it. (looks at him) In this case, I value your loyalt y. \nAlgren considers the implications of what Omura is saying. \nALGREN I didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold. \nOMURA Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt. \nALGREN (stands) Then I will consider it. \nOMURA And I will be grateful. \nINT.

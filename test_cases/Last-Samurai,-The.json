A banked fire smolders beneath it. \nEmbarrassed, Yoritomo indicates to Algren that be needs to bathe. Algren strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water. \nYoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to Western privacy, he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man. \nYoritomo, unconcerned, climbs into the tub. He chats pleasantly as they bathe, showing off his old battle wounds. \nAlgren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother appears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub! \nAlgren sinks a little lower into the water. The old grandmother smiles at him with her toothless grin. \nEXT.            VILLAGE                          DAY \nAlgren. feeling self-conscious in the clean kimono he's wearing for the first time, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords. \nNearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly, murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking about. \nHigen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren, who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren. \nAlgren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish -- causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on the attack. \nAlgren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer. \nSuddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns. \nUjio is standing behind him, arms folded. \nUjio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword. It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing. \nUjio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually, only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment. \nUjio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his kneels. \nSatisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the bystanders cause him to turn back: . \nAlgren is standing again, and again holding the sword. \nWith grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose. \nAgain Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose. \nUjio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away. \nAgain, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him. \nBut Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren in the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken, Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away. \nThe ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet. This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then finally the head. \nAlgren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword. Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee. \nINT.              YORITOMO'S HOUSE                                   EVENING \nAlgren lies painfully on a mat, his eyes unfocused. \nA sudden flash of memory: \nThe lovel y blond woman, tears in her eyes, looks up to Algren's shining face, the epaulets on his crisp officer's, uniform gleaming gold in the sun. \nThe reverie is broken. \nAs Taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face. He stares at her darkly. \nALGREN Who are you people anywa y? \nShe makes no attempt to understand or respond. \nALGREN You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't even have any fucking walls. Your walls are made of paper, what's the matter with you? \nShe pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck. \nALGREN This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house. What is wrong with you? \nThis last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl of soup she had brought for him, and bringing it to his lips... \nALGREN Do you have a soul at all? \nHe stares at her for a moment, then knocks the soup out of her blinds. \nHer eyes FLASH for one moment, before resuming their usual mildness. But that flash is enough to satisfy him, and he calms down. She walks away. He sighs, exhausted, only to see her approach again with a new bowl. Their eyes meet, and hold for a moment. She does have a soul. He takes a sip. \nINT.                 SHINTO SHRINE                        DAY \nAlgren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine. Katsumoto kneels before a small altar. He doesn't seem aware that Algren is present. \nKATSUMOTO Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword. \nALGREN Is that what he's doing? \nKATSUMOTO At what age did you become I soldier? \nALGREN Nineteen. \nKA TSUMOTO To fight in your American civil war. \nALGREN Yes. \nKA TSUMOTO Tell me about that war'. \nALGREN What about it? \nKATSUMOTO Everything. \n", "test1_true": "Katsumoto sits impassively, staring at the altar. \nALGREN That would take a year. \nKATSUMOTO You have pressing business elsewhere? \nShaking his head, Algren sits down. \nALGREN The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when the rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it probabl y began three years earlier when the Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to be returned to his master \nDISOLVE TO: \nThe TWO OF THEM, hours later-- \nALGREN --and Pickett says he wants to do it, over Longstreet's objections and Lee doesn't know what to think, but he lets him. So 15,000 men go up that hill. And most of them die. \nKATSUMOTO Was that wise? \nALGREN No, it was stupid. \nKATSUMOTO Why? \nALGREN The point of a battle is to win, or at least have enough men survive to fight another day. \nKATSUMOTO You did not try to survive when we took you prisoner. \nAlgren eyes him, frustrated. \nALGREN What do you want from me? \nKATSUMOTO What do you want for yourself? \nALGREN You know they're not going to ransom me. \nKATSUMOTO We have little use for money. \nALGREN (mounting fury) Then what are you doing, why are you asking me these questions, what is going on here? \nKATSUMOTO The snows will melt in May, and the passes will open, and the events of the world will unfold. Until that time, you are here. (smiles) I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I hope you will honor me with more tomorrow. \nKatsumoto stands, bows, and leaves. \nINT.                  YORITOMO'S HOUSE                             DAY \nYoung Toshiie sits near Algren. He labors over a scroll with a brush, the gentle brush strokes are hypnotic as they sweep across the rice paper. \nAlgren tries to indicate that he would like pen and paper for himself. Toshiie gives him what he asks. Algren begins to write: \nALGREN (V.O.) Day unknown, month unknown, 1876. I continue to live among these strange people. \nEXT.                        VILLAGE                            DAY \nKatsumoto watches Ujio bark orders to the men he is training. A sudden Movement of their eyes, causes Uji o to stop. He turns to find: \nAlgren standing at the end of the line, holding I wooden sword. \nAn almost imperceptible look passes bet ween Ujio and Katsumoto, but Ujio's Resentment is over-ruled. Without a word, he continues. \nAlgren does his best to follow the exercise. \nKatsumoto, the slightest hint of a smile on his face, walks away. \nALGREN (V.O.) Each day I am confounded by their strange customs and contradictions, savagery followed by mildness. \nINT.            YORITOMO'S HOUSE                          NIGHT \nAlgren now kneels at the table with the rest of the family as they eat. He is in considerable pain from the rigors of training. He tries to roll the stiffness out of his neck, when be notices that Higen it imitating him. Toshiie laughs. \nALGREN (V.O.) They seem to value nothing more than their families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded men without a shade of remorse.. \nYoritomo sternly tells Higen not to make fun of their guest. Yoritomo apologizes to Algren, who shakes his head unnecessary. \nALGREN .                           Raisu? [Rice?] \nThey stop, shocked. He has spoken! \nYoritomo calls for Taka to serve him more rice, then begins yammering enthusiastically in Japanese. Algren holds up his hand. \nALGREN Not so fast Ko...toba? [Words?] (bolds up chopsticks) What is this? \nYORITOMO Hashi. \nALGREN Hashi. \nYoritomo is hysterical with glee now. \nYORITOMO Hail! \nThe boys are suddenly dervishes, pulling various objects from the table and around the room, shouting the Japanese words for each. \nAlgren shakes his head, and smiles for the first time in this stor y. \nYoritomo manages to quiet the boys. He points to himself. \nYORITOMO Yoritomo. \nALGREN (points to himself) Algren. \nYORITOMO All-gren. Algren nods, and the boys start screaming \"All-gren!\" \nYORITOMO (points to each in rum) Higen.

Do you have any idea what it will mean to have Omura as your friend? You want land, you want women, you want boys? \nAlgren starts to walk faster, but Graham Stops him. \nGRAHAM Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years. You must believe me there is a majest y about these people -- can you imagine what your own country would be if it had half the drive and the discipline and the belief and the bravery of these ridiculous little people? \nThen raised voices from across the street stop them. \nThey see Yoritomo surrounded by four Imperial Army soldiers. The soldiers are rough and imperious, drunk with power. They carry gleaming rifle.. \nThe soldiers bark orders. Yoritomo stands proudly, responding calmly. \nALGREN \nWhit is this? \nGRAHAM My God, it's the edicts... \nALGREN What edicts? \nAlgren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile - the soldiers are pointing to Yoritomo's head, screaming \nAlgren steps toward the soldiers-- \nALGREN That's enough-- \nOne of the soldiers SCREAMS at him -- raises his rifle -- all the soldiers raise their rifles \u00ad Yoritomo reaches for his sword -- Algren tries to push through - \nALGREN (subtitles) YORITOMO, WAIT! \nOne of the soldiers smacks Algren in the chin with a rifle butt. Algren reels, and by the time he stands straight again, four others are pointing their ba yonets at his face. \nGraham takes hold of Algren's arm. \nGRAHAM Don't be stupid. \nAlgren makes eye contact with Yoritomo, who -- in deference to his friend -- puts his sword away. \nThe Japanese soldiers continue to scream at Yoritomo. They force him to his knees. Rifles pressed to his head. \nYoritomo bows his bead, speaking quietly, as if praying. \nAlgren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet -- another grab. Yoritomo's hair, jerks his head back and begins hacking off Yoritomo's traditional top-knot of hair. Brutally. Blood. \nYoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face. \nThe soldiers laugh and move off. \nAlgren kneels by Yoritomo. Yoritomo looks up at him.

But before I go I need to tell you what's going on here. \nKATSUMOTO You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers, is that how you sa y it? \nALGREN They're about to close a trade agreement that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine. \nKATSUMOTO Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to need those weapons before be will sign. \nALGREN (realizing) And you are to be the cause... \nKATSUMOTO Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons. The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu what it wants. And my country is sold to yours. \nAs Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground of old scars, so like his own. \nKA TSUMOTO Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for the elimination of our traditional topknots. \nALGREN I know. \nKATSUMOTO The second banned the wearing of sword. \nAlgren stops. He knows what swords mean to the samurai. \nKATSUMOTO (re: his swords) Hand them to me, will you? \nAlgren picks up Katsumoto's two swords.

COUNCIL OF STATE CHAMBER                          NIGHT \nThe Council of State meets in an august chamber. Many of the Council members wear Western clothes. Cigarette smoke billows. \nThe young Emperor sits on a dais off to the side, as befits his ceremonial role in the proceedings. \nOmura is speaking ... be stops ... looking at something ... all the Council members turn ... and gape. \nKatsumoto strides into the chamber, his swords proudly displayed. \nOMURA (subtitled) Minister Katsumoto, you honor us. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitled) It is my honor to join again the men who are leading Japan into her glorious future. \nOMURA (subtitled) You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict regarding the wearing of swords? \nKATSUMOTO (subtitled) I read ever y edict with singular attention. \nOMURA (subtitled) Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber? \nKATSUMOTO (subtitled) This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred years-- \nOMURA (interrupting, subtitled) We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now. \nKATSUMOTO (calm, subtitled) . We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western \"allies.\" \nKatsumoto slowl y looks around at the Members of the Council, but his words are addressed to the Emperor. \nKATSUMOTO (subtitled) Does Japan no longer need its patriots? \nOmura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty. \nOMURA (subtitled) Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his country trapped in the past, or the man who would help his people into the future? \nKATSUMOTO (subtitled) A future with no honor, \nOMURA (subtitled) Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so they will live.    . \nKATSUMOTO And lining your own pockets in the process. \nThey stare at one another with barely concealed hostility. \nOMURA (subtitled) Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask you to remove your sword, as this body has declared in its edict. \nKatsumoto's hand closes on his sword hilt \nKATSUMOTO This sword serves the emperor, and only he can command me to remove it. \nKatsumoto looks to the Emperor, as murmurs fill the room. \nOMURA (quickly) Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is too pure and great to be heard in such worldly circumstance as the Council of State. \nOne last time, Katsumoto meets the Emperor's eye. \nKATSUMOTO Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my sword. \nOmura looks to his associates, and a silent decision is made. \nOMURA Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where you will be our honored guest. I think you will find the surroundings there quite harmonious. \nGuards with Mauser rifles move into position around Katsumoto. He turns to the other Council members. Looks at them. \nKA TSUMOTO (subtitled) Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done and feel what I never will ... shame. \nOmura nods to the guards.

Algren emerges from the building, sees the same two disreputable MEN who followed him earlier lurking nearby. \nHe resists the temptation to confront them. Instead he climbs into the rickshaw and it starts off. But a moment later, Graham has jogged alongside, huffing and puffing. \nGRAHAM Thought I'd missed you.

Because Omura will become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team. \nGraham notices Algren staring at his followers. \nGRAHAM Case in point. \nALGREN Who are they? \nGRAHAM Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai doing odd jobs for his Nibs. \nALGREN What do they want from me? \nGRAHAM To make sure you're on the side of God and Country, or to make sure you get the hell out. \nALGREN You've been a great help, Graham.

They glare back, no longer trying to keep out of sight. \nA BLAST from the steam whistle. \nAlgren looks from the ship, to the ronin, to the bustling, chaotic city behind them. Finally, he looks out at the harbor and the ocean, beyond which used to lie his home. \nHe turns to the bearer. \nALGREN (subtitles) Take back to quarters.

They grow closer. \nAlgren appears to close his eyes. And the sound of the approaching footsteps fades as We HEAR ONLY the sound of his breathing. \nThe Ronin draw their swords. \nAlgren gently opens his eyes.

In the strobing shadows, all we really know is that Algren has leapt to the attack. \nWithin seconds, four bodies lie in the street \nAlgren holds bloody sword. \nHis face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped, but other than that he is unharmed.

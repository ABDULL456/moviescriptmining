TERMINAL BUILDING - PASSENGER LOADING ZONE - NIGHT \nAirport bus arrives. Stewardess ELAINE DICKINSON steps off. CAMERA FOLLOWS Elaine as she walks to terminal building. \nP.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. There is no stopping in the red zone. \nP.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) The red zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers. There is no stopping in the white zone. \nP.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) No. The white zone is for loading and unloading, and there is no stopping in the red zone. \nP.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) The red zone has always been for loading and unloading, and there is never stopping in a white zone. \nP.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) Don't tell me which zone is for stopping and which zone is for loading. \nP.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) Listen, Betty. Don't start up with your white zone shit again! \nElaine enters terminal building. \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT \nElaine is approached by a religious ZEALOT #1. \nZEALOT #1 Hello, we'd like you to have this flower from the Religious Consciousness Church. \nELAINE No, but thank you very much. \nArrival-Departure TV monitors.

Behind them is sign reading: WARNING, HIJACKING IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE, etc. \nSHIRLEY Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. \nJACK Yeah, I think he is.

We both know perfectly well what it is you're talking about. You want me to have an abortion. \nP.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.) It's really the only sensible thing to do. If it's done properly, therapeutically, there's no danger involved. \nP.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.) Have you considered that what's inside me is a human being; that it's alive. We made love. It's us -- you and me. \nP.A. SYSTER (male v.o.) That isn't true. A fetus at this stage is not a human being, nor is it a person. \nKrishnas enter terminal building. \nINT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe Krishnas are approached by the Religious Zealot. \nELAINE It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect.

Go ahead with your call. \nTURNANSKY (v.o.) This is Doctor Turnansky at the Mayo Clinic. \nINT. DR. TURNANSKY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nDR. TURNANSKY is seated at desk. Behind him are shelves filled with mayonnaise jars. \nTURNANSKY There's a passenger on your Chicago flight two-oh-niner, a little girl named Lisa Davis -- en route to Minneapolis. She's scheduled for a heart transplant and we'd like you to tell her mother that we found a donor an hour ago. \nOn his desk is a beaker containing a beating heart. \nTURNANSKY We have the heart here ready for surgery and we must have the recipient on the operating table within six hours. \nThe heart jumps out of the beaker, across the desk and falls off the edge. \nTURNANSKY I want you to make sure she is kept in a reclined position and that a continuous watch is kept on her I.V. \nINT.

I've requested the Atlanta run. \nSTRIKER Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change. \nELAINE Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing? \nIn the b.g. an airline PORTER is transporting an ELDERLY COUPLE in an electric cart. They round the corner too fast and the woman falls out. Husband doesn't notice. \nSTRIKER You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record. \nELAINE Your war record? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history. \nSTRIKER You expect me to believe that? \nIn the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is immediately run over by another electric cart. \nELAINE It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility. \nSTRIKER But if you'll just give me... \nELAINE It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry. \nShe walks off. Dramatic MUSIC as Striker glares with determination. The religious Zealot tries to pin a flower on his lapel. \nCHECK-IN LADY Smoking or non-smoking? \nSTRIKER Smoking, please. \nShe hands him a smoldering ticket, and he walks out the door. \nEXT.

Ali McGraw announced another spin on the marriage-go-round. And who's the lucky guy? You guessed it. None other than Olympic gymnast... \nElaine approaches Mrs. Elderly. Striker's seat is vacant. \nELAINE Would you like something to read? \nMRS. ELDERLY Do you have anything light? \nElaine hands her a small piece of paper. \nELAINE How about this leaflet: 'Famous Jewish Sports Legends?' \nMRS. ELDERLY (taking pamphlet) Yes. Thank you. \nBar is closing, chairs on tables, bartender sweeping floor, Elaine and Striker dancing slowly in center of room. One final Girl Scout flies into FRAME and falls in a lifeless heap at their feet. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT \nSTRIKER We laughed, we talked, we danced, I never wanted it to end and I guess I still don't. But enough about me. I hope this hasn't been boring for you. \nCAMERA WIDENS to reveal Mrs. Elderly's legs dangling next to him. She has hung herself. \nSTRIKER It's just that when I start to talk about Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in 'Jesus: the Man.' \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT \nMilton, carrying a tray with two cups of coffee, approaches Bernice. \nMILTON I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee. \nBERNICE That's very nice of you.

Like my men. \nMILTON Were you vacationing in Los Angeles? \nBERNICE Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.? \nMILTON No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT \nElaine is taking orders from a couple and their eight year old son. \nELAINE Would you like to order dinner now? \nMR. HAMMEN Yes. Steak for Joey and my wife and I will have the fish. \nJOEY When can I see the cockpit, Dad? \nMR. HAMMEN Well, I think that the pilots are too busy flying the plane for that, Joey. \nJOEY Aw, gee whiz. \nELAINE I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the Captain and see what I can arrange. \nJOEY Gee! That'd be swell! \nElaine moves on to the two Black Dudes. \nELAINE Would you gentlemen care to order your dinners? \nThe Black Dudes point to their selections on the menu. \nBLACK DUDE #1 'Ey ma' muh fuh wha' fo', shi! \nSUBTITLES APPEAR: \"I WOULD LIKE THE STEAK, PLEASE.\" \nBLACK DUDE #2 Shi' mo cain ma foh mess wi' ain?! \nSUBTITLES APPEAR: \"I'LL HAVE THE FISH, THANK YOU.\" \nINT.

PASSENGER CABIN - STEWARDESS ALCOVE - NIGHT \nElaine is replacing a magazine and catches sight of Striker. \nELAINE'S POV - STRIKER \nBoring another passenger. \nHe turns to Basta. \nMURDOCK Ah, Victor, why don't you get the coordinates on the altitude vector and find out the ratio of direct velocity over engine speed? \nVictor is puzzled. \nJOEY You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets! \nMURDOCK I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence? \nOVEUR No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here. \nMURDOCK All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock. \nHe points to his nametag. \nMURDOCK I'm an airline pilot. (to Oveur) Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies. \nJOEY I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense. \nMURDOCK (into microphone) Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner. \nJOEY ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court. \nMURDOCK We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner. \nJOEY ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs. \nMURDOCK The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night. \nMurdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers angrily. \nMURDOCK Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down the court for forty-eight minutes. (into mike) Ah...Denver Control, this is Flight two- zero-niner continuing on a heading two- niner-niner...niner, ah...niner...niner. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT \nElaine is seated next to Striker. \nSTRIKER Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember? \nELAINE I remember everything. All I have are memories. \nSoft MUSIC begins. \nELAINE Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us. \nSTRIKER That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine. \nELAINE But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past! \nElaine leaves, teary-eyed. \nCLOSEUP - STRIKER \nSUPERIMPOSE: \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nFighter plane diving. \nSQUADRON LEADER (v.o.) You're too low, Ted!

HOSPITAL - DAY \nStriker is lying in bed painting a canvas. Elaine is seated at bedside. \nELAINE You got a telegram from head\u00adquarters today. \nSTRIKER Headquarters!? What is it? \nELAINE It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news? \nINSERT - STRIKER'S PAINTING \nRandy takes the guitar and walks down the aisle. The guitar clonks people on the back of the head. Randy approaches Lisa. \nRANDY Is it all right if I talk to your daughter? \nMRS. DAVIS Oh, I think that would be nice. \nRANDY (to Lisa, who is reading) Hi! \nLISA Hi! \nRANDY I'm Randy. \nLISA I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! \nRANDY I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song. \nLISA Oh, I'd love to. \nRANDY Okay, this is one of my favorites. \nRandy is sitting on the edge of the gurney as she strums three opening chords. \nRANDY (strumming and singing in ballad tempo) 'I've traveled the banks of the River Jordan, to find where it flows to the sea.' \nStewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME. \nRANDY 'I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry and saw that I was looking at me.' \nAs singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the Krishnas, then the Black Dudes. Finally, everyone is smiling sweetly at each other. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nMurdock and Oveur smile sweetly at each other... \nINT. CABIN - NIGHT \nRANDY (singing and playing the guitar) 'And I wanted to know if life had a purpose, and what it all means in the end. In the silence I listened to the voices inside me, and they told me again and again.' \nTempo Jumps to rock pace. \nRANDY 'There is only one river. There is only one sea.' \nRandy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar, knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V. squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollow\u00adcheeked. No one else notices. \nRANDY 'And it flows through you, and it flows through me. There is only one people, we are one and the same.' \nLisa manages to reconnect her I.V. \nRANDY (still singing) 'We are all one spirit, one name. We are the Father, we are the son.' \nRandy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the passengers start to get into the music. \nRANDY 'In the Dawn of Creation. We are one.' \nMrs. Davis rushes to reconnect Lisa's I.V. Lisa doesn't react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest. \nRANDY & PASSENGERS 'We are only one people, we are one and the same.' \nAs Lisa revives, Randy swings her guitar and clonks Mrs. Davis on the head. \nRANDY & PASSENGERS 'We are all one spirit on Earth, one name.' \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nRANDY & PASSENGERS (v.o.) 'We are the Father, we are the son, and in the Dawn of Creation we are one.' \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nElaine enters with dinners. \nOVEUR Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight. \nELAINE Who wants to be first? \nMURDOCK Go ahead, Clarence, I got it. \nOveur removes his headset, Elaine puts tray down. \nELAINE How's the weather? \nMURDOCK Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff ahead of us. It might get rough again unless we can climb on top. But our airspeed is holding steady at six hundred ten knots. \nELAINE That's great. By the way, Joey Hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball. \nMurdock autographs it reluctantly. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT \nstruggling with controls, finally regains level flight. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nTHUNDER and lightning -- plane levels off. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nThe St. Christopher statue is holding a motion discomtort bag to its mouth. \nOVEUR What is it, Doctor? What's happening? \nDR. RUMACK I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival. \nRumack and Elaine are now standing face-to-face. Oveur, in the f.g., is at controls. \nDR. RUMACK What was it we had for dinner tonight? \nELAINE Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish. \nDR. RUMACK Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna. \nHe points to Johnson. \nDR. RUMACK What did he have? \nELAINE He had fish. \nRandy enters cockpit. \nRANDY We have two more sick people, and the rest of the passengers are worried. \nOVEUR I'll take care of the passengers. Elaine, find out what the two sick people had for dinner. (into P.A.) This is Captain Oveur speaking. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT \nPassengers are listening to P.A. \nOVEUR (v.o.) It's been a little bumpy up here but we'll be past it in a few minutes. \nRandy and Elaine drag Murodck and Basta down center aisle. \nOVEUR (v.o.) A couple points of interest: we're just now passing over the Hoover Dam and later on, our course will take us just south of the Grand Canyon. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nOVEUR Meanwhile, relax and enjoy the rest of your flight. Okay? Okay! \nHe hangs up phone and turns to Rumack. \nOVEUR That should do it. \nINT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT \nAbsolute pandemonium. Passengers are yelling, screaming, tearing their hair out, climbing about. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nOVEUR (into microphone) Chicago, this is flight two-zero-niner. We're in trouble. \nINT. O'HARE WEATHER CENTER - CLOSEUP - TYPEWRITER - NIGHT \nCAMERA PULLS OUT to reveal DISPATCHER typing Oveur's message. \nOVEUR (v.o.)

Mr. Hammen is sick. \nRANDY Yes? \nMRS. HAMMEN Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please? \nRANDY Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner? \nMRS. HAMMEN Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why? \nRANDY Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly. \nMcCROSKEY (v.o.) Very good. Now, Elaine, where are you? Over. \nELAINE I'm standing over Oveur. Over. \nINT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nMcCROSKEY (into mike) All right, Elaine. Just hold on. We'll be back to you in a minute. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal dispatch is a beehive of activity. The Chief Dispatcher, STEVE McCROSKEY, is barking orders to AIR CONTROLLER #1. \nMcCROSKEY Hold all takeoffs. I don't want another plane in the air. When the 508 reports, bring it straight in. \nAir Controller #1 exits quickly. McCroskey picks up phone. \nMcCROSKEY Put out a general bulletin to suspend all meal service on flights out of Los Angeles. \nHe hangs up phone and talks to AIR CONTROLLER #2. \nMcCROSKEY Tell all dispatchers to remain at their posts. It's going to be a long night. \nAir Controller #2 exits. McCroskey notices he is out of coffee and turns to AIR CONTROLLER HINSHAW. \nMcCROSKEY And how about some coffee, Johnny? \nHINSHAW No thanks. \nAIR CONTROLLER #3 enters. \nMcCROSKEY I want the weather on every landing field on this side of the Rockies, no matter what the size. \nAir Controller #3 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #4 enters. \nMcCROSKEY Do you understand? \nAir Controller #4 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #5 enters. \nMcCROSKEY Any place where there's a chance to land this plane. \nAir Controller #5 exits. SIAMESE TWINS enter. \nMcCROSKEY Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a runway diagram. Terry, check down on the field for emergency equipment. \nSiamese Twins leave. In the b.g. we see them trying to walk in opposite directions. Air Controller #1 enters. \nAIR CONTROLLER #1 Chief, there's fog down to the deck everywhere east of the Rockies. There's no possible place they can land. They'll have to come through to Chicago. \nMcCROSKEY Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. \nHe lights up a cigarette. McCroskey walks toward a table and leans on his hands. \nMcCROSKEY I want the best available man on this. A man who knows this plane inside and out and won't crack under pressure. \nHINSHAW How about Sal Mineo? \nMcCROSKEY Get me Rex Kramer! \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nLightning and THUNDER. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nElaine is in the pilot's seat and the inflated automatic pilot is in co-pilot's seat. \nMcCROSKEY (v.o.) Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge. What speed does it indicate? \nELAINE Three hundred twenty miles per hour. \nINSERT - AIR SPEED GAUGE \nBACK TO SCENE \nWe see, but Elaine does not notice, the automatic pilot very slowly beginning to deflate. \nMcCROSKEY (v.o.) Good. Now check your altitude. That's the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator. \nELAINE Thirty-five thousand feet. \nINSERT - ALTIMATER \nAltitude is dropping. \nBACK TO SCENE \nELAINE No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast! Why is it doing that? \nBy now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is quite deflated. It is staring at her with a half smile. Elaine notices it. \nCAREY You do? Who is it? \nWe hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger. \nKRAMER His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him during the war. And that won't make my job any easier tonight. \nREAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION. \nKRAMER Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up to a point. But he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside. Maybe you know the kind. \nNow REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel. \nKRAMER It takes a certain type to perform under pressure. Striker didn't have it. \nBy now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback chasing and shooting at Kramer's car. \nKRAMER Ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists. The upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nTHUNDER and lightning. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nStriker is in pilot's seat. Rumack is standing behind him. \nSTRIKER Let's see, altitude twenty-four thousand feet, level flight, air speed four hundred sixty knots, course zero niner zero, trim, mixture, landing gear, balance. \nElaine enters. \nELAINE Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane! \nSTRIKER That's what I've been trying to tell these people. \nDR. RUMACK Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got. \nSTRIKER Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights. \nHe flips a switch. The plane dives. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nThe plane is diving. \nINT.

DISPATCH - NIGHT \nKramer sits at the mike. An Air Controller is standing next to him, but only his mid-section is in FRAME. \nKRAMER All right. It's obvious you remember me. \nThe Air Controller is scratching his behind. \nKRAMER So what do you say you and I just forget about everything except what we have to do now? \nThe Air Controller is now scratching his crotch. \nKRAMER You and I are going to bring this plane in together. \nThe Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants straightening out his underwear. \nKRAMER Before we start, I'd like to say something. I know that right now things must look pretty rough up there. \nThe Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands inside his pants. \nKRAMER But if you do what I tell you, when I tell you to do it, there's no reason you can't bring that plane in. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nSTRIKER Let's not kid each other, Kramer. You know I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm going to need all the luck there is. \nINT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nKRAMER Stand by, Striker. (to McCroskey) The one hope we have is to build this man up. I've got to give him all the confidence I can. (into microphone) All right, Striker, have you ever flown a multi-engine plane before? \nSTRIKER (v.o.) No. Never. \nKRAMER Shit! \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nStriker over hears conversation on radio. \nKRAMER (v.o.) This is a goddamn waste of time. There's no way he can land this plane! Route 'em into Lake Michigan and at least avoid killing innocent people! \nINT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nMcCROSKEY Grab hold of yourself! You've got to talk them down. You're the only chance they've got! \nKramer lights cigarette. \nKRAMER (into mike) All right, Striker, now you listen to me and you listen close. Flying is no different than riding a bicycle...it just happens to be a lot harder to put baseball cards in the spokes. Now, if you just follow my instructions... \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nTwo vultures are sitting on back of Striker's seat. \nKRAMER (v.o.) ...there's no reason why you shouldn't have complete confidence in your chances to come out of this thing alive and in one piece. \nINT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nKRAMER First, I want you to familiarize yourself with the controls. Later we'll run through the landing procedure. \nKramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out the window. McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade. There is an EXPLOSION O.S. \nKRAMER All right. Now I'd like you to disengage the automatic pilot. But watch any violent movement of the controls, like you used to make in Spitfires and Phantoms. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nSTRIKER (into microphone) Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic pilot. \nStriker switches off automatic pilot button. Automatic pilot shoots upward out of the seat. Elaine is thrown to the floor. Striker struggles desperately to control the plane. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nflying erratically. \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nKRAMER (v.o.) (matter of factly) Just remember, the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter. \nStriker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the rear of the cockpit. \nKRAMER (v.o.) Don't worry about that. It's perfectly normal. You must watch your airspeed closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both your rudder pedals and elevator trim will have additional play due to increased drag, but you can compensate by lowering manifold pressure below 154. Now there's one other thing. Have you someone up there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying? \nSTRIKER Yes! The stewardess is here with me! \nElaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at engineer's console. \nKRAMER (v.o.) Have her take the co-pilot's seat. \nElaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the plane. He hands Elaine the mike. \nBERNICE I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me. \nMILTON You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. \nBERNICE Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff. \nMILTON That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.' \nINT.

O'HARE WEATHER CENTER - CLOSEUP ON TYPEWRITER \nCAMERA PULLS OUT to reveal Dispatcher typing message. \nRADIO (v.o.) National Weather Service reporting Omaha fogged in. Visibility zero. \nThe Dispatcher attempts to remove the message, but it is stuck in the cartridge. He yanks on it, but the paper stretches out like rubber. The scene now becomes like a cartoon. He lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls until the paper stretches to his face. He grumbles in Donald Duck voice. The typewriter snaps back and hits him. \nINT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nMcCROSKEY (to Air Controller #2) Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife on the phone. We'd better let her know what's going on. \nAir Controller #1 rushes in holding a piece of paper and hands it to McCroskey. \nAIR CONTROLLER #1 Steve, this weather bulletin just came off the wire. \nMcCroskey frowns and hands it to Hinshaw. \nMcCROSKEY Johnny, what can you make out of this? \nHINSHAW This?

OVEUR I've got to go to the airport. You can let yourself out the back door. There's juice in the refrigerator. \nHORSE (sounding like Mr. Ed) Did you finish? Was I good? \nMRS.

Johnny, how about some more coffee? \nHINSHAW Would you like half of my provolone and roast beef? \nMcCROSKEY Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines. \nHe pops a couple pills. Fifteen REPORTERS, Cameramen, etc. enter with Air Controller #l. \nAIR CONTROLLER #1 (to McCroskey) Steve, these reporters won't leave without a statement. \nREPORTER #1 How much longer can the sick passengers hold out? \nMcCROSKEY Half hour...maybe forty-five minutes. \nREPORTER #2 Who's flying the plane? \nAir Controller #2 enters and hands McCroskey a note. Hands holding microphones are thrust INTO FRAME in front of McCroskey. One hand is holding an ice cream cone. \nMcCROSKEY One of the passengers. But he's an experienced air force pilot who flew during the war so there's no cause for alarm. Hinshaw, take over. \nMcCroskey exits. \nREPORTER #3 Have the families been notified? \nHINSHAW I think Florence Henderson knows about it! \nREPORTER #1 What are the chances of bringing this plane in safely? \nHINSHAW What are the chances of returning something to Montgomery Ward the week after Christmas? \nREPORTER #1 (beckoning to door) All right, boys.

CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nMcCroskey and Kramer are at watercooler. McCroskey is filling cup while Kramer drinks. \nMcCROSKEY Rex, I've decided that the best thing to do is to foam the runway -- let him do a wheels-up landing. It'd be a lot simpler. \nKramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey drinks. \nKRAMER (filling up another cup) No, the risk of fire is too great. If she starts burning, you write off all those people who can't get out of there on their own power. \nMcCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer drinks. \nMcCROSKEY (filling up another cup) Well that's better than writing them all off? Are you going to play God with a hundred and 38 lives? \nKramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks. \nKRAMER (filling up another cup) No. A belly landing isn't all that simple. It takes a good pilot to keep from smearin' himself all over the runway. \nMcCroskey throws cup into wastebasket as Kramer drinks. \nMcCROSKEY (filling up another cup) If Striker has the guts to try this, he deserves the best shot we can give him. We've gotta foam that runway. \nKramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks. \nKRAMER (taking another cup) His only shot's with the wheels down. I've seen foam tear a man's guts out. \nMcCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. \nMcCROSKEY And if Striker goes to pieces? \nKRAMER (taking another cup) That's a risk we'll just have to take. \nKramer throws cup into wastebasket.

PULL BACK to include: \nKRAMER I told him to watch that oil temperature. What the hell's he doing up there? \nHe picks up the mike. \nKRAMER Striker, that plane can't land itself! It takes a pilot who can handle pressure. \nMcCROSKEY Ease up, Rex! He hasn't flown for years! It's not his fault. It could happen to any pilot. \nHINSHAW It happened to Barbara Stanwyck! \nINT. COCKPIT - NIGHT \nSTRIKER He's right. I can't take the pressure. I was crazy to think I could land this plane. \nELAINE But Ted, you're the only... \nSTRIKER I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before. \nAs Striker leaves he puts autopilot into pilot's seat.

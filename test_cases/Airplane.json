But he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside. Maybe you know the kind. \nNow REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel. \nKRAMER It takes a certain type to perform under pressure. Striker didn't have it. \nBy now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback chasing and shooting at Kramer's car. \nKRAMER Ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists. The upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT \nTHUNDER and lightning. \nINT.

He's a terrible risk, but what other choice have we got? \nMcCroskey hangs up phone. \nMcCROSKEY Well, that's the whole story, Rex, everything we know. \nKRAMER All right, Steve, let's face a few facts. \nKramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair of sunglasses. \nKRAMER As you know, I flew with this man, Striker, during the war. He'll have enough on his mind without remembering those days when -- well, when things weren't so good. \nMcCROSKEY Well, right now things aren't so good. And while we're talking there are a hundred and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a decision. \nKRAMER Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long time ago... \nA spear slams into the wall behind Kramer. \nKRAMER ...but my feeling is that when the going gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's gonna fold up. \nMcCROSKEY Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn and talk this guy down! You're going to have to let him get the feel of this airplane on the way; you'll have to talk him onto the approach; and so help me, you'll have to talk him right down to the ground! \nA watermelon falls from TOP OF FRAME, splattering on the table. \nKRAMER Very well then.

CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nKRAMER Stand by, Striker. (to McCroskey) The one hope we have is to build this man up. I've got to give him all the confidence I can.

CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT \nKRAMER First, I want you to familiarize yourself with the controls. Later we'll run through the landing procedure. \nKramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out the window. McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade. There is an EXPLOSION O.S. \nKRAMER All right. Now I'd like you to disengage the automatic pilot. But watch any violent movement of the controls, like you used to make in Spitfires and Phantoms. \nINT.

(matter of factly) Just remember, the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter. \nStriker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the rear of the cockpit. \nKRAMER (v.o.) Don't worry about that. It's perfectly normal. You must watch your airspeed closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both your rudder pedals and elevator trim will have additional play due to increased drag, but you can compensate by lowering manifold pressure below 154. Now there's one other thing. Have you someone up there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying? \nSTRIKER Yes! The stewardess is here with me! \nElaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at engineer's console. \nKRAMER (v.o.)

{"train": "FANTASTIC MR. FOX \nWritten by \nRoald Dahl, Wes Anderson & Noah Baumbach \nMarch 4, 2007 \nEXT. WOODS. DAY \nAn apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw. He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that descends into the valley below. A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches: \nFOX What'd the doctor say? \nMRS. FOX Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty- four hour bug. He gave me some pills. \nFOX \n(REASSURINGLY) I told you. You probably just ate some bad gristle. Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the path. Fox points: \nFOX Should we take the short cut or the scenic route? \nMRS. FOX Let's take the short cut. \nFOX But the scenic route is so much prettier. \nMRS. FOX \n(SHRUGS) OK, let's take the scenic route. \nFOX Great. It's actually slightly quicker, anyway. Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off down the scenic route. \nEXT. FARM. DAY \nA rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from the bushes outside a fence. \nMRS. FOX What is a squab? \nFOX You know what a squab is. It's like a pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of bird we can eat. Fox motions toward the edge of the property. \nFOX Should we go through the hole under the horse fence or climb the rail over the bridle path? \nMRS. FOX Well, I guess the horse fence would be a little safer. \nFOX But the bridle path puts us out right next to the squab shack. Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny. \nFOX What's wrong? I've never seen you like this. You're acting all skittish. Don't worry. I've been stealing birds for a living since before I could trot. \nMRS. FOX \n(SIGHS) I want to say I hate my job, but that would make it seem more important to me than I want people to think it is. Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash. \nASH I'm sick. \nMRS. FOX You're not sick. \nASH I have a temperature. Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his forehead. \nMRS. FOX You don't have a temperature. Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom: \nASH I don't want to go. \nMRS. FOX Hurry up. You're going to be late. Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast and coffee. Fox whispers to her: \nFOX I love the way you handled that. Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash: \nMRS. FOX Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be extra nice to him, because he's going through a very hard time right now, OK? Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into them. He says aggressively: \nASH Where's he going to sleep? \nMRS. FOX We're going to make a bed for him in your room tonight. \nASH I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's study. Fox says without looking up from his newspaper: \nFOX Dad's study is occupied by Dad. Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox: \nFOX I don't want to live in a hole anymore. It makes me feel poor. Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says \nSOFTLY: \nMRS. FOX We are poor -- but we're happy. Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating: \nFOX Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are better above ground. Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of coffee. Fox takes her paw and says: \nFOX I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My father died at seven and a half. I don't want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm going to do something about it. Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands and picks up his cup of coffee. \nFOX Well, I'm off. Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts \nCHEERILY: \nFOX Have a good day, my darlings! Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks puzzled. \nFOX What's he wearing? Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded up section of his newspaper. \nINSERT: A clipping from the real estate section. There is a photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a hill. A caption below it reads: Tree Living, Great Views, Classic Beech \nINT. TREE. DAY \nA door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging \nFOX Really? Tell me about them. Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in. \nBADGER All right... \nCUT TO: A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a tweed suit which stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in front of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken houses. He has an ugly face. He is Boggis. \nBADGER (V.0.) Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer. Probably the most successful in the world. \nINT. BOGGIS' KITCHEN. DAY \nBoggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken with a fork and a meat cleaver. \nBADGER (V.0.) He's unbelievably fat -- which maybe is genetic -- but he also eats three boiled chickens smothered with dumplings every day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and dessert. That's twelve in total, per diem. \nINSERT: \nBoggis' ear. Furry black and white hairs grow out of it. A fly buzzes around, lands on it, and crawls inside. Boggis sticks his pinky in after it and scratches. \nBADGER (V.0.) He never takes a bath, as a result of which his ear holes are clogged with all kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing gum and dead flies and so on. \nCUT TO: A short, overweight man with one slightly wandering eye. He wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge shotgun. He stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is Bunce. \nBADGER (V.0.) Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer. He owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000 geese. You might say he's kind ofa pot- bellied dwarf of some kind. \nEXT. SWIMMING POOL. DAY \nBunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT. \nBADGER (V.0.) He's so short his chin would probably be under water in the shallow end of any swimming pool on the planet. \nINT. BUNCE'S KITCHEN. DAY \nBunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair. He guts a dead goose, cutting out its liver and mashing it with a fork. A plate of doughnuts cools on the table. \nBADGER (V.0.) He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up goose livers injected into them. \nCUT TO: A tall, skinny man in a long trench-coat. He holds a Luger pistol. He stands in front of his farm, which is an apple orchard that stretches over thousands of acres. He has a mean face. He is Bean. \nBADGER (V.0.) Franklin Bean is a turkey and apple farmer. He keeps his birds in an orchard \n(MORE) \nBADGER (V.0.) (cont'd) where they run around squawking and gobbling, surrounded by apples. Bean aims his Luger and shoots a humming bird. Crazy turkeys run about among the trees. \nINT. BEAN'S SHED. DAY \nBean works at a moonshine-type cider still, boiling chemicals and sipping from a bottle. \nBADGER (V.0.) He's probably anorexic, because he never eats anything. He's on a liquid diet of strong, alcoholic cider, which he makes from his apples. He's as skinny as a pencil, as smart as a whip -- and easily the biggest cusshole I've ever met in my life. \nFOX Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your tail tucked! Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an eyebrow. \nFOX Still painting thunderstorms, I see. Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns. \nFOX Whose suitcase is that? A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch: \nKRISTOFFERSON Hello, everyone! Good afternoon! Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner, sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim Team. Fox brightens. \nFOX Kristofferson! Welcome to our little tree! I see you brought your swimming trunks! Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head, whistling and hollering: \nFOX Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm speechless, Kristofferson! Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox. \nFOX Plus, he knows karate. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING \nFox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing tae-kwon-do. He wears khaki shorts, yellow sneakers, and a blue, short-sleeved, button-down shirt. \nASH Do you think I'm an athlete? \nFOX (without looking up) What are you talking about? \nASH Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete, and sometimes I feel like you guys don't see me that way. \nFOX What's the sub-text here? Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to Mrs. Fox in the kitchen: \nASH How long is Kristofferson supposed to stay with us? \nMRS. FOX Until your uncle gets better. \nASH Right, but roughly how long do we plan to give him on that? Double-pneumonia isn't even really that big of a deal, is it? In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the doorway and whispers forcefully: \nMRS. FOX As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to be alive. Now -- \nASH Right, but -- Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double- kick with a chop: \nKRISTOFFERSON Ki-ya! Everyone looks startled. Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon- do practice with an angry, wounded look on his face. Mrs. Fox \nSAYS COLDLY: \nMRS. FOX Lower your voice, Ash. \nEXT. TREE. NIGHT \nFox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets chirp. \nFOX Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to try it, though. Raising a family. \nKYLIE Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I \nFox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. Kylie \nSAYS BLITHELY: \nKYLIE Beagles aren't so tough. \nFOX \n(ANNOYED) Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these beagles has chronic rabies, which he's on medication for, and if you get bit by him you have to get shots in your stomach for six months. And, second -- listen, I'm not going to justify this to you. Just pay attention and stop interrupting me. I'm taping this. \nEXT. RAVINE. NIGHT \nFox and Kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a stream. \nFOX (V.0.) I picked some blueberries, butterflied them with a scalpel, and laced each one with ten milligrams of high-potency sleeping powder. \nINSERT: Fox's paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered mickey into a dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red thread. \nFOX (V.0.) Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla. \nCUT TO: Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now smoke pipes. \nKYLIE How do we make them eat it? \nFOX (smiling, with utter certainty) Beagles love blueberries. \nEXT. RIDGE. NIGHT \nFox and Kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of an elderberry bush. Fox looks through his binoculars. \nFOX (V.O.) If we approach with the wind in our faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards away. \nEXT. BARNYARD. DAY \nSeventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously, darting wildly nervous looks at one another. They eat bits of grain off the ground. \nFOX (V.O.) Remember: they aren't very smart, but they're incredibly paranoid -- so always kill a chicken in one bite. \nCUT TO: Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats: \nFOX One bite, get it? Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns. \nFOX Are you listening to me? I look into your eyes and I can't tell whether you're getting anything I'm saying. Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs. (NOTE: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any shots indicating Kylie's vacant look.) \nEXT. MEADOW. NIGHT \nFox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses to sniff the air. He nods. \nFOX A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're ready for that. Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the air. \nKYLIE WHISPERS: \nKYLIE Look at all this apple juice. \nFOX \n(STERNLY) Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn't come here for apple juice. This is some of the strongest, finest alcoholic cider money can buy -- or that can even be stolen. It burns in your throat, boils in your stomach, and tastes almost exactly like pure, melted gold. \n(SUDDENLY) Let's crack open one these 'shine jars and do a shooter. A match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth. He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly. He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik. He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck of his cider jar. He says with a slightly sinister New \nORLEANS ACCENT: \nRAT Y'all are trespassin', now. Illegally. 'Round these parts, we don't take kindly to cider poachers. Fox and Rat stare at each other. Fox says, finally: \nFOX You've aged badly, Rat. \nRAT You're gettin' a little long in the tooth, yourself, partner. Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf, down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at Fox's feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it. He hisses. \nKylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing in the wall. Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance. \nRAT How's your old lady doin'? Kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and Rat circle each other slowly. \nFOX Do you refer to my wife? \nRAT She was the town tart, in her day. Wild and foot-loose and pretty as a mink stole. She was a creme brulee -- until you made an honest woman out of her, Mr. Fox. Kylie says, intrigued, from his hole: \nKYLIE Is that true? \nFOX \n(ANNOYED) Of course, not. I mean, certainly, she lived. We all did. It was a different time. Let's not use a double-standard. She marched against the -- \nKYLIE But town tart? \nFOX Shut up. Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He cocks an eyebrow and smiles: \nFOX That was close, Rat. Be careful. \nRAT Oh, I'm as careful as a -- A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud creak. Rat and Fox look terrified. They both dart away and hide behind cider jars. A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf where Fox is hiding. \nHOUSEKEEPER How many jars should I bring up, ma'am? A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from \nUPSTAIRS: \nMASCULINE VOICE I don't know. Two, I guess. The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper hesitates. \nHOUSEKEEPER He drank three yesterday, ma'am. \nMASCULINE VOICE All right, take three. The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar. Fox closes his eyes. \n(PAUSE) Thanks, Kylie. \nMRS. FOX If what I think is happening is \nHAPPENING -- \n(OMINOUSLY) -- it better not be. \nCUT TO: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to Boggis and Bunce. \nEXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT \nFox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says \nSTONILY: \nFOX Nice job covering for me. Next time \nTRY -- A twig snaps. Fox freezes. \nCUT TO: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes. \nCUT TO: The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its direction. \nCUT TO: Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking: \nFOX All three! Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark. Silence. \nSmoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his flashlight on Fox's hole. In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood- stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce. \nBEAN We got the tail, but we missed the fox. Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie. \nBEAN Petey? You and the boys sober up and get out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider. \nINT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT \nMrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly: \nASH It'll grow back, won't it? \nKYLIE (shaking his head) Tails don't grow back, except for lizards. \nFOX \n(MISERABLY) Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be tail-less for the rest of my life. \nASH \n(NERVOUSLY) Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as double-pneumonia, right? (pointing to Kristofferson) His dad's got one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot worse than -- Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls silent. Kristofferson turns away. \nKYLIE \n(AGONIZED) Stop! Stop! Stop! Fox and Mrs. Fox turn quickly to Kylie standing in the doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Ash \nand Kristofferson stand behind him. They look terrified. Kylie shouts in a pained voice: \nKYLIE You say one thing, she says another, and it all changes back again! The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling. Everyone looks up and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the room with a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over two chairs. \nFOX I've got it! There's not a moment to lose! Why didn't I think of this before? \nMRS. FOX Think of what? \nFOX Think of the one thing a fox does quicker than a man, quicker than any other animal in the world! (at the top of his lungs) \nDIG!!! \nCUT TO: Everyone digging furiously. Dirt flies everywhere. The shot booms down into the ground, among the roots of the tree, through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits. \nTITLE: \n1 HOUR LATER The shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep, deep underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing heavily, with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied around his waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat. Everyone looks at him. \nFOX I think it's time for me to give us a pep talk and explain some things. (commencing a speech) A very long time ago -- \nMRS. FOX May I have a word with you privately? \nFOX \n(HESITATES) Well, we're in a hole. Where -- \nMRS. FOX Just on the other side of this mineral deposit. Follow me. Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in the bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz walls. She wheels on Fox: \nMRS. FOX I'm going to lose my temper now. \nFOX \n(PAUSE) When? \nMRS. FOX Right now. \nFOX \n(PAUSE) Well, when -- Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a quick sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears. (NOTE: the scar in Fox's fur never grows back.) Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says: \nMRS. FOX Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise to me while we were caged inside that fox- trap that, if we survived, you would never steal another chicken, goose, turkey, duck, or squab, whatever they are. I believed you. Why did you lie to me? \nFOX \n(SIMPLY) Because I'm a wild animal. \nBUNCE I'm cussing loving this! \nBOGGIS Who's hyper-cussing-active now? Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant shovels clank against each other, ripping through the tree's roots. \nINSERT: A temperature gauge with its needle pushing the limits of the red. \nCUT TO: A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy yellow and black jumpsuit and coke-bottle protective eyeglasses. A patch on his pocket says E. Malloy. He watches the farmers digging crazily with the tractors. Sparks from the mayhem reflect dancing on his lenses. \nEARL MALLOY These machines weren't made to be handled like this. \nDISSOLVE TO: The hill with half its earth dug out from under the tree. The tree still stands precariously above the wild tractors. \nDISSOLVE TO: The hill now razed with the fallen, old beech tree laying on its side as the tractors dig deeper. \nDISSOLVE TO: The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater. A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean climb down from their tractors. They look angry and tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers. A television reporter with an Action 13 camera crew confronts \nBEAN: \nREPORTER Farmer, correct me if I'm misreading the data, you've successfully destroyed the scenery, but the alleged fox remains at large. What will you three prominent farmers do now? \nBEAN Well, Dan, I can tell you what we're not going to do. We're not going to let him go. \nREPORTER Are you concerned about the possibility \nOF -- \nBEAN I have no further dialogue in this scene. Bean turns away from the reporter and pulls Boggis and Bunce aside. He addresses them with calm intensity: \nBEAN I'm not going home until we smoke this son-of-a-cuss out his hole, string him up on a clothesline, and fly him like a kite. Boggis, how many men have you got working on your farm? \nBOGGIS Thirty-five. \nBEAN Bunce? \nBUNCE Thirty-six. \nBEAN And I've got thirty-seven. That's 108 men altogether. Now what do I got here? Two quitters -- or are you staying with? \nCUT TO: That night. A helicopter with a Bean, inc. decal on the side of it circles the crater scanning the dark terrain with a searchlight. There are tents, trucks, and 108 men gathered around the perimeter. They sit on bricks and logs and are armed with bats, pistols, rifles, shotguns, bows and arrows, and hatchets. \nINT. HOLE. NIGHT \nFox, his family, and Kylie lie exhausted on the floor of their deep hole. The walls are covered with knotted roots and vines. Fox says to Kylie: \nFOX One of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now. \nKYLIE You're paranoid, Foxy. \nCUT TO: Mrs. Bean sitting in her kitchen watching television next to an extremely skinny, freckled twelve year-old boy. The boy points at the screen and laughs to himself: \nFOX You don't just bang into somebody's cussing tunnel! \nBADGER Are you cussing yelling at me! \nFOX You're cussing right I'm cussing yelling! \nBADGER We're all cussing starving to death because of you, you mangy, cussing, little cuss! Fox and Badger snarl and scratch at each other, circling around the hole. They calm down slightly. Badger continues: \nBADGER We've been digging in circles for three days. Half the woods've been obliterated. Nobody can get out. Right now my wife's huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine with Mrs. Mole, Mrs. Beaver, Rabbit's ex- girlfriend, no food, no water, and twenty- seven hungry, whining, starving, little animal brats. This is a total cluster- cuss for everybody! Fox looks around the room at the entire gaunt, dirty, emaciated assembly. Everyone stares at him angrily. He swallows. The mole says softly.: \nMOLE I just want to see a little -- \n(SUDDENLY CRYING) -- sunshine. \nFOX \n(PUZZLED) But you're nocturnal, Phil. Your eyes barely even open, on a good day. \nMOLE \n(ENRAGED) I'm sick of your double-talk. We have rights! Beaver's son looms over Ash and Kristofferson in a muddy alcove on the side of the tunnel. He pokes Ash in the chest with the finger of his paw. \nBEAVER'S SON We don't like you, and we hate your dad. You're too snazzy. You dress like a girl. You're creative. Now grab some of that mud, chew it in your mouth, and swallow it. \nASH (scared and disgusted) I'm not going to eat mud! \nBEAVER'S SON Cuss, yeah, you are. Beaver's son grabs a handful of mud, smashes it into Ash's mouth, and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion. Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson frowns. He takes off his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet ferocity: \nKRISTOFFERSON Don't do that. Beaver's son looks to Kristofferson. He looks down at Kristofferson's feet. \nBEAVER'S SON Why'd you take your shoes off? \nKRISTOFFERSON So I don't break your nose when I kick it. Kristofferson kicks Beaver's son in the face, karate chops his neck, elbow-jabs him twice in the gut, and flips the enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud. Beaver's son gets up, crying, and walks out of the alcove. Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as Kristofferson puts his shoes back on. \nASH I can fight my own fights. Badger and Fox stand facing each other at the end of the tunnel. Badger says aggressively: \nBADGER Those farmers aren't going to quit until they've got you and every member of your family nailed upside-down to a bloody stick with your eyes gorged out. \nFOX \n(FREAKED OUT) This is getting a little too personal. Badger waits for Fox to continue. Fox stares into space. \nFOX Give me a minute. Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie cuts him off sharply: \nKYLIE \n(SHARPLY) Shh! Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw, lost in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the others. He says with a cautious excitement: \nFOX I've got an idea. \nFOX \nSECOND -- Fox seizes a black chicken violently. \nCUT TO: Ash and Kristofferson running down the tunnel carrying two dead, black chickens. They turn three corners and arrive at the mossy hollow. They look inside. \nMONTAGE: Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the silo in front of Bunce Industries. Cows eat grass in the pasture above. Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor and dance an ecstatic jig in a great storeroom lined to the ceiling with plucked ducks and geese. Smoked hams and sides of bacon dangle from the rafters. \nFox and the other diggers tunnel under the windmill in front of Bean, inc. Sheep eat clover in the field above. Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor and dance an ecstatic jig in a corrugated plastic and metal pen among dozens of gobbling turkeys. Fox and the other diggers race dancing ecstatically back through the complex network of tunnels carrying dead turkeys, geese, bacon, flour, salt, sugar, jars of cider, and a portable television set. \nINT. FLINT-MINE. DAY \nThe flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls, a dirt floor, a small kitchen, and a fireplace. There are rows of cots, sleeping bags, boxes, blankets, and suitcases for all the refugee animals. All the animals have gathered together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits, skunks, and field mice set the table. The room is festooned with garlands. A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the piano. A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune. Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver. \nWEASEL What am I going to do? I'm going to hold him to the terms of the contract. It's not my fault they uprooted it. Kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the corner. Ash goes over to him and holds out a mug. \nASH They say I owe you an apology for some of the mean things I said about your father's illness. His double-pneumonia or whatever they're calling it now. Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful. \nKRISTOFFERSON \nOK. \nASH So there it is. I hope we can continue our relationship as cousins or family members or however you want to define \nIT -- (suddenly more intense) -- but do me a favor for yourself. The next time you have a problem with something I've said, come to me as a fox \n(MORE) \nASH (CONT'D) and let's deal with it right then and not let it blow up into a whole, huge thing involving parents and so on. Agreed? Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty mug for a refill. Kristofferson nods slowly. He points at Ash with his ladle. \nKRISTOFFERSON I'm going to teach you karate. Badger sits next to the fireplace with Fox and Kylie. \nBADGER I can imagine how painful, even just emotionally, that must be for you. \nFOX \n(UNEASY) Well, you know, it's not the end of the world. \nBADGER \n(MORE ANIMATED) Oh, but, Foxy, how humiliating! Having your whole tail blown clean off by a -- \nFOX \n(COOLY) Can we drop it? Kristofferson starts to refill Ash's mug again. Ash suddenly puts his paw over the brim. Kristofferson hesitates. Ash raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously: \nASH Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps? \nEXT. CAMP. DAY \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT \nThe flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals into a murky, brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and three inches of black water on its floor. Fox picks himself up, dazed and scared, and looks around at his soaked friends and their families. \nFOX What the cuss just happened? Something with water. That was dangerous. Is anyone hurt? \nBADGER \n(FURIOUS ) We're all hurt! My entire flint-mine just got demolished! \nFOX Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a buddy! Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart about, searching. He shouts: \nFOX Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson? Ash's voice cracks on the other side of the cavern: \nASH I'm here. Everyone turns to see Ash standing at the mouth of a smaller pipe. He looks devastated and terrified. Fox points to him. \nFOX Ash! Who's your buddy? \nASH Kristofferson, but I lost him. \nFOX You lost him? Where were you? \nASH We went for cookies. Everyone turns to Fox. Fox yells desperately: \nFOX Kristofferson! Fox sprints around the cavern, splashing, digging, and ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts: \nFOX Kristofferson! Kristofferson! Kristofferson! \nCUT TO: The three farmers standing next to the fire truck. Bean holds a soaked, half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air by the tail. Kristofferson is quietly crying. \nBEAN Wrap this wet, little mutt in a newspaper and put him in a box with some holes punched in the top. \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT \nEveryone has gathered together. They are all in a state of shock. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox beside him. \nFOX Your brother's going to kill me, if he survives his double-pneumonia. Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe, \nSHOUTING: \nBEAVER There's only one way out of this sewer, but the manhole cover's closed, and there's a station-wagon parked on it -- which means we're permanently stuck down here. \nBADGER \n(BITTERLY) You still think we beat 'em, Foxy? Everyone turns to Fox and stares at him coldly. Fox sits down on the floor, in the water. He says quietly: \nFOX Somebody take over. I'm not in charge anymore. \nEveryone looks around at each other. They don't know what to do. Mrs. Fox sits down in the water next to Fox. \nFOX You're stepping on my lines. \nASH Keep telling it. \nFOX So we dug. And the whole time I put paw over paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy beside me, I kept wondering: who is this little boy going to be? \nASH Or girl. \nFOX Or girl, right -- because at that point we didn't know. Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye. \nFOX Ash, I'm so glad he was you. Fox hugs Ash tightly, holds him for an instant, then let's go. He turns to the group. \nFOX Badger, organize a search party and try to find Kristofferson. Maybe he's alive. I'm sorry, everyone. I wish -- \n(HESITATES) Well, good-bye. Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs. Fox standing with her back to him. She turns to face him. Her eyes are burning. Fox smiles sadly. He races away down the drain-pipe. Everyone watches him disappear. Badger hesitates. He addresses the \nGROUP UNCERTAINLY: \nBADGER I guess we should probably split into a certain number of groups and start doing something, right? \nINT. CONDUIT. NIGHT \nFox sprints full-speed in the darkness. His claws scratch rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of shallow water. Fox stops suddenly. He stands up tall on his hind legs. His ears perk up. One pins back. He listens. \nCUT TO: Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash, Mole, and two small rabbits down a drainpipe. Badger calls out: \nBADGER Kristofferson? Hello? Can you hear us? Rat's voice echoes in the darkness: \nRAT Y'all lookin' for somethin'? Nothin' down here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin' water. Everyone stops short. Rat drops into the pipe from an overhead drain ahead of them. He says ominously: \nRAT They got the boy. \nBADGER \n(FROZEN) Who's got him? \nRAT The farmers three. You know who I'm talkin' about. \nBADGER \n(HESITATES) They've kidnapped him? \nRAT Well-done, Mr. Badger. You're a smart man. They want to trade the son for his poppa. \nRat flicks a folded letter through the air. Badger catches it. He opens it. Kylie looks over his shoulder. Badger frowns. \nBADGER Why'd they write this in letters cut out of magazines? \nKYLIE To protect their identities. (on second thought) Oh, right, but then why'd they sign their names? Plus, we already knew who they were because they're trying to kill us. \n(YELLING) Now, go! The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe. Badger walks with Fox and Ash. \nBADGER What was he saying about that wristwatch? I didn't get what he was talking about. \nFox hesitates. He shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia: \nFOX Just some old back-story. \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT \nThe entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the brick cavern. Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the group. He has a bandage on his chest. \nFOX In a way, I'm almost glad that flood interrupted us, because I don't like the toast I was giving. I'm going to start over. Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass. \nFOX When I look down this table with the exquisite feast set before us, I see: two terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician, a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate agent, an excellent tailor, a crack accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty good minnow fisherman, and possibly the best landscape painter working on the scene today. As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver; Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish field mouse; Mole; Kylie (who looks slightly offended); and Mrs. Fox, respectively. \nFOX Maybe a few of you might even read my column from time to time. Who knows? I tend to doubt it. \n(DRAMATIC PAUSE) I also see a room full of wild animals. Everyone stares at Fox curiously, skeptical but intrigued. Fox points at them: \nFOX Wild animals with true natures and pure talents. Wild animals with scientific- sounding Latin names that mean something about our D.N.A. Wild animals each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species, and also -- well, I guess these things usually have a lot to \n(MORE) \nFOX (CONT'D) do with the parents, as we all know. Anyway, I think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us that just might give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew and letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is. I don't know. It's just a thought. Thank you for listening. Cheers, everyone. Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor. He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts: \nKYLIE Let's eat! Everyone turns to Kylie uncertainly. Kylie hesitates. \nKYLIE What? I'm just playing along with the -- \nFOX \n(FORCEFULLY) All right! Let's start planning! Who knows shorthand? Pause. Badger points to his otter secretary. She is Linda. Fox darts over to her and grips her by the arm. \nFOX Linda! Lutra Lutra! You got some dry paper? Here we go! Fox, highly energized, moves among the group, touching their shoulders and patting their backs. \nFOX Mole! Talpa Europea! What do you got? \nMOLE \n(HESITATES) I can see in the dark? \nFOX \n(EXHILARATED) That's incredible! We can use that! Linda? \nLINDA \n(TAKING SHORTHAND) Got it. \nFIELD MOUSE Not particularly, except maybe domestic/ kitchen sink-type stuff, but I have a hunch I might just -- \n(DEVIL-MAY-CARE) -- land a few good punches before I get stepped on, poisoned, or lured to my death by a little piece of cheese. Who's to say? \nFOX (smiling with admiration) You're a cuss of a lot bigger than you look, Rickity. Kylie tugs at Fox's sleeve. Fox turns to look at him. Kylie \nSAYS SHYLY: \nKYLIE I didn't get a job yet -- or a Latin name. What's my strength? Fox raises an eyebrow. He thinks of something: \nFOX Listen, you're Kylie. You're an unbelievably nice guy. Your job is really just to... be available, I think. I don't know your Latin name. I doubt they even had opossums in ancient Rome. Kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls. \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT \nMrs. Fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted on the longest, tallest wall of the brick cavern. She stands on a ladder. Her sleeves are rolled up, and she is splattered with twelve different colors of paint. She looks down to Fox standing below with an entourage of Kylie, Badger, Linda, and Rickity. The animal children mop and scrub in the background. Ash stands leaning against a push-broom watching his parents. Fox surveys the mural. It is highly detailed, filled with the textures of the landscape, and decorated with images of flowers, leaves, acorns, etc. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox opens his arms wide and shouts: \nFOX It's stupendous. Where's us? \nMRS. FOX (pointing to a spot) Right here. \nFOX Paint an X. \nINSERT: The bottom of the map. Mrs. Fox's paw paints a red X and puts a circle around it. The shot zooms out to reveal the entire valley -- no longer a painting on the brick wall. Lighting strikes at the horizon. Dark clouds loom over the three farmers' compounds. It looks exactly like one of Mrs. Fox's paintings of a landscape in a rainstorm. Bean's helicopter circles the area. \nEXT. HILL. NIGHT \nA bicycle messenger with a head-lamp rings his bell as he approaches the farmers' camp. He stops in front of Bean and hands him an envelope. Bean tears it open and unfolds the letter inside. \nINSERT: \nA note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted onto a piece of paper. It reads: Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, I have no alternative but to agree to your terms. Move the station wagon and open the manhole cover below the foot of the drainpipe next to the cobbler's shop and meet me there today at 10 A.M. sharp. I will hand myself over to you in exchange for the boy's safe return. Cordially, Mr. Fox Bean frowns. He studies the letter. He shows it to Boggis and Bunce. \nBEAN Why'd he write this in letters cut out of magazines? \nBUNCE \n(SHRUGS) I don't know, but you did the same thing. \nBEAN \n(UNEASY) I don't trust this guy. Anyway, set up the ambush. \nINT. ATTIC. DAY \nThe top floor of Bean Annex. The room is filled with boxes of Christmas ornaments, old sports equipment, two stained mattresses, and a broken birdcage. Cobwebs hang from the rafters below the sloped roof. Kristofferson stands with his hands in his pockets looking out between the slats from inside a padlocked apple crate on top of a gun locker in the corner. He clears his throat. He calls out politely: \nKRISTOFFERSON Could I have a cup of water, please? Kristofferson waits for a reply, but no one answers. He whistles to himself for a minute. He clears his throat again. He calls out: \nKRISTOFFERSON Excuse me! Excuse me? \nASH I'm sorry. \nKRISTOFFERSON \n(DAZED) That's all right. You were just trying to unlock the apple crate. \nASH No, I mean I'm sorry about -- \nKRISTOFFERSON (picking himself up) Oh, you mean from before. The apology you owed me which you never actually said. \nASH Yeah. Kristofferson nods sadly. He takes a deep breath. He nods again. \nKRISTOFFERSON That's all right, too. Throw me the shoelace, please. Ash smiles. \nCUT TO: Badger trapped in his cage. He hears something. He looks quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns the corner and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself: \nBADGER Badoit et fils. \nA cobblestone beside Badger suddenly drops straight down and disappears into the ground. Badger recoils, scared and confused. Mrs. Fox pokes her head up through the hole. She is beaded with perspiration and breathes heavily. Her fur is wildly dishevelled. She looks to the van driving up the alley. She looks to Badger. She extends her paw to him and says \nFIERCELY: \nMRS. FOX Let's go! \nEXT. YARD. DAY \nFox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the courtyard doors. They freeze. The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn. Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion: \nFOX Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your posse hunted my family. Your gunmen kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my wife -- and you shot off my tail. \n(STEELY) I'm not leaving here without that neck- tie. Bean smiles his sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly. Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically: \nASH I weigh less than a slice of bread. \nFOX \n(HESITATES) What? \nASH I'll be right back. Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take cover behind a hay-bale. \nAsh dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back- flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors \nAND SCREAMS: \nASH Ki-ya! Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes light up. Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw hanging open. The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run around, panicking, with their guns blazing. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He says with the deepest affection and respect: \nFOX Ash, that was pure, wild animal craziness. You're an athlete. Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter. (NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and animated slightly more gracefully.) Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as: Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells: \nFOX Holy swearing cuss!!! \nFOX He doesn't seem to know. Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his \nVOICE: \nFOX I have a phobia of wolves! The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox closes his mouth and his eyes soften. Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times. It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off into the woods. Fox says wistfully: \nFOX What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck, boys. Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits. \nTITLE: THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks) The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a tasteful sewer-conduit. The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires, pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe 1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox. Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio. \nFox swings his head into the room from a tunnel. He says \nGENTLY: \nFOX My darlings? Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him. \nINT. DRAINPIPE. NIGHT \nThe cement conduit with the iron grating above it. Fox and his family walk briskly down the pipe. A knitted, woolen, artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of Fox's trousers. \nASH Where are we going? \nFOX Nobody knows. \nASH We were in the middle of a meditation practice. \nFOX Watch your step. Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a metal ladder. He says theatrically: \nFOX Let's see, now. Where does this lead? \nMRS. FOX Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy. \nFOX Keep a good grip, everyone. \nASH This better be worth it. \nFOX I think I see a little sliver of light. What's this? Is that a door? \nMRS. FOX You're a terrible actor, Foxy. \nKRISTOFFERSON Do you smell something? Is that -- \n(SNIFFS TWICE) -- freon? \nFOX Shh. I'm going to crack open this trap door and see if something's on the other side. I highly doubt it, though. There's probably just more sewer. Fox clears his throat. Pause. \nFOX You know, wouldn't it be surprising if -- \nASH Open it. Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone follows him. \n", "test1_input": "FOX Yeah. \nKYLIE What happens now? \nFOX I have no idea. Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands, barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox shouts to Kylie: \nFOX Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow me again! Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door- flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says \nBREATHLESSLY: \nFOX Let's hit the five and dime on the way home! We need to make some fake price tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper so it looks like we got them at the butcher shop! Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically. \nMONTAGE: A fox's paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted chicken with an apple in its mouth. Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and drinking wine. Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk. Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine comes out of his nose. Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7 carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole cut into the electric fence. Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole knocked into a brick wall. Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade. Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow glade. They look exhilarated. \nINT. KITCHEN. EVENING \nMrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around its ankle. She examines it. She frowns. Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back out of the room. \nMRS. FOX Where'd you get this chicken? \nFOX \n(SHRUGS) I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last night on my way back from -- \nMRS. FOX It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its ankle. \nFOX \n(HESITATES) Huh. Must've escaped from there before I bought it. \nINT. DINING ROOM. EVENING \nAsh, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at the children's table eating dinner. Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten- up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it. \nKYLIE What's that? \nASH This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won for being an athlete. Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food: \nFOX I'm supposed to cover this book party at some animal's nest in a tobacco field down the hill, so me and Kylie are going to hop over there and give it a whirl. Don't wait up. Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the table, and stands up. Mrs. Fox asks cooly: \nMRS. FOX What's the book? \nFOX \n(HESITATES) Some memoir. I'll get him to sign you a copy. Fox kisses Mrs. Fox on the cheek. She looks at him suspiciously. \nFOX Dinner was -- (doing a little gesture) -- pitch-perfect. \nEXT. WOODS. NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "FOX I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars underneath the back door to Bean's secret cider cellar. \nKYLIE We're breaking into Bean's house? \nFOX \n(HESITATES) Cellar. \nKYLIE Where he lives? \nFOX \n(HESITATES) Where he keeps the cider. \nASH \n(BRIGHTLY) Below where he lives. Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit, is walking with Fox and Kylie. Fox stops short: \nFOX Where'd you come from? Go back to the tree and do your homework! \nASH I want to help you steal some cider. \nFOX \n(ANGRILY) We're going to a book party! And keep your mouth shut about any cider, because no one ever said that! Get out of here! \nASH But Dad -- \nFOX But nothing! You're going to get me in a lot of trouble! The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his head. \nFOX Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can you believe that? How'd he get tipped off? You think he's going to tell on us? Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly. \nFOX Before we go any further, from now on can you give me some kind of signal once in a while just so I know any of this is getting through to you? Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox hesitates. \nFOX Was that it? OK. \nEXT. BARNYARD. NIGHT \nFox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of Bean's farmhouse. Kylie whispers as they run: \nKYLIE One time this wolf -- \nFOX \n(IRRITATED) What's with all the wolf talk? Can we give it a rest, for once? Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window shutter. He and Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar bars. \nINT. BEAN'S SECRET CIDER CELLAR. NIGHT \nA vast, damp, gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars stacked from floor to ceiling. Each jar is marked Cider. Fox and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor. \n", "test1_id": 1032, "test2_input": "FOX Come on! That doesn't sound anything like him! It's amateur night in Dixie! Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nA ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean frowns. \nBEAN What the cuss is he burning? A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes out. The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts: \nBEAN Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox? Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and scramble in the confusion. Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six farmers chase after him, firing their weapons. \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY \nDown in the brick cavern, Mole listens to a tin can attached to a string. He says urgently as he makes notations in a \nLEDGER: \nMOLE Twenty-eight pinecones fired! Twenty-two targets hit! Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks quickly on the street in her mural. The stolen, portable television set sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13's coverage of the chaos in the street. \nCUT TO: Rabbit running full-steam out of the village being pursued by the six farmhands. He hurdles an empty Coke bottle lying on its side in the road. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nBadger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows, and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down a cobblestone lane. Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path. Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity lets out a little whoop. There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive. Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with a sidecar. \nCUT TO: Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar. They both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox over the sound of the motor: \nKYLIE Are you scared of wolves? \nFOX Scared, no! I have a phobia of them! \nKYLIE Well, I have a thing about thunder! \nFOX \n(ANNOYED) Why? That's stupid! Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape flutters behind him. He shouts: \nASH I don't like needles! Fox and Kylie look to Ash in disbelief. Fox says furiously: \nFOX Where'd you come from again? How'd you get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm losing my mind! Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road. \nINT. HELICOPTER. DAY \nA pilot with a red moustache and a South African accent flies Bean's chopper. He wears a Bean, inc. patch on his shoulder. He shouts into the microphone connected to his helmet: \nPILOT I've got a fox on a motorcycle with a littler fox and what looks to be an opossum in the sidecar riding north on farm lane seven. Does that sound like anything to anybody? A military-type voice responds over the radio: \nMILITARY VOICE (O.S.) Roger that, Red. Let me just, uh -- Oh, I think the boss wants to -- \nBEAN (0.S.) Red, it's Franklin Bean! Turn around, get the cuss back here, and pick us up on the \n", "test2_true": "EXT. BEAN'S COMPOUND. DAY \nThe Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds. Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean Annex. The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire security barricade. \nFOX That's the annex over there on the right. Ash nods. Kylie does not respond. \nFOX The white building over there on the right. Pause. Fox looks to Kylie. \nFOX Kylie? Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says \nSHARPLY: \nFOX Kylie! \nKYLIE What? \n(SUDDENLY) I did it! \nFOX When? I didn't see it! Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his bicycle. Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the motorcycle. \nFox climbs onto Kylie's shoulders and tries the knobs. They are locked. \nFOX Kylie, you got a credit card? \nKYLIE (digging in his pockets) Sure. \nFOX \n(IMPRESSED) See, this is what I was saying about how good you are at just being available for \nWHATEVER -- Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler Titanium Card. Fox frowns. \nFOX A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you qualify for this? \nKYLIE \n(SHRUGS) I pay my bills on time. I've always had good credit. Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock and opens the doors. The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side, there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted, broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest, fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle. White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily. Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck reads Spitz. Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie. \nFOX Give me a blueberry. Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly: \nASH What's that white stuff around his mouth? \nKYLIE \n(SQUINTING) I think he eats soap. Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above some bags of fertilizer. It's reads: Drug: Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg \nNAME: SPITZ \nBREED: BEAGLE For: RABIES (chronic) Other: Take with meat, do not operate heavy machinery Fox frowns. He says grimly: \n", "test2_id": 1033, "test3_input": "FOX That's not soap. \nKYLIE \n(HESITATES) Well, then why does he have that bubbly -- \nFOX He's rabid. With rabies. I've heard about this beagle. The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully: \nFOX Easy, boy. Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over his shoulder to Kylie and Ash: \nFOX I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel like there's a tenderness in his eyes. Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The beagle watches him calmly. \nFOX Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little lonely, maybe, but -- Fox takes another cautious step. \nFOX -- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy. Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't it? \nKYLIE (aside, to Ash) I thought he said you never look a beagle in the eye. \nFOX \n(COAXINGLY) Why, you're just as sweet as a -- Fox and the beagle lock eyes. The pupils of the beagle's eyes contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets. The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie, and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his voice cracking like a grandmother's: \nFOX Climb the trellis! In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the courtyard. Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased: \nFOX So the attic is probably in the area right up around here somewhere, I figure, huh? Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at Fox vacantly. (NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.) \nFOX \n(IRRITATED) Come on, guys. Stay with me. We did good. That's just some dog. Let's not get traumatized. \nEXT. ROOF. DAY \nBean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and climb inside. They take off. \nCUT TO: The street below. An orange and yellow Citroen van screeches into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell Badoit et Fils, Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with an image of a trapped fox. An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and start unloading stacks of metal cages. \nCUT TO: Rabbit still running full-steam down a country lane being pursued by the six farmhands. \nINT. ATTIC. DAY \nKristofferson stands inside the apple crate leaning against the wall with his legs crossed and one arm akimbo with his hand on his hip. There is a clanking sound from above. Kristofferson looks up. A trap door in the ceiling creaks open. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look inside, down at Kristofferson. Kristofferson smiles oddly and says in a surprised, fancy-meeting-you-here voice: \nKRISTOFFERSON Hi! \nCUT TO: Fox and Kylie lowering Ash into the room with three different- colored shoelaces tied together and belted around his waist. Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the apple crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates. He says \nSUDDENLY: \nASH Can I get one of those karate lessons real quick? \n", "test3_true": "(LONG PAUSE) OK. Normally, we start with some breathing exercises and such. Stand like this. Kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of him. Ash mimics this. \nCUT TO: A fox-trap hanging from a chain suspended above the alley behind the Nag's Head Tavern. A second one hangs behind Sweetings Bakery. A third one hangs behind Harrison Travel. A fourth one hangs behind St. John's Coin-op Laundry. A fifth one hangs behind Ferguson Cobblers. Rickity curiously examines a little, hanging wire. He mutters \nTO HIMSELF: \nRICKITY Is this spring-loaded? \nCUT TO: Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson: \nKRISTOFFERSON This next part is mental. Position yourself on the balls of your feet. Kristofferson stands lightly poised with his arms out. Ash mimics this. \nKRISTOFFERSON Close your eyes. Kristofferson closes his eyes. So does Ash. So do Fox and Kylie. Kristofferson says mystically: \nKRISTOFFERSON You weigh less than a slice of bread. \nCUT TO: Each fox-trap in rapid succession as it falls on: Rickity, Badger, Weasel, and Beaver. The two small rabbits watch from a sewer-gutter drain under the street-curb. They panic. They race down a pipe, into a tunnel, and through a conduit. \nCUT TO: Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson: \nKRISTOFFERSON Let's review the principle agility techniques: jumping, flipping, landing. \nCUT TO: Mrs. Fox looking down from her ladder at the three, panting rabbits. She looks stunned. She motions to her mural/map and \nSAYS: \nMRS. FOX Show me where they are! \nCUT TO: The two small rabbits, Mrs. Rabbit, Mrs. Badger, Mole, and Mrs. Fox each furiously digging a new tunnel. \nKRISTOFFERSON (V.0.) Now for a rudimentary version of the cyclone chop. \nCUT TO: Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson: \nKRISTOFFERSON First, you need to get a running start, which, obviously, I can't do in here, then, as you arrive at the destination of the chop -- \n(DEMONSTRATING) -- lean and thrust into the point of contact, paw remains open and straight, then withdraw instantaneously. Remember, it's the pull-back that matters. The pull- \nBACK -- \n(DEMONSTRATING) -- generates the force of the impact. \nASH \n(IMMEDIATELY) Got it. Ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf. Fox and Kylie watch from above. Kylie says excitedly: \nKYLIE He's going to do it! Fox makes a face that says, I'm not so sure. Ash takes a deep breath. He screams at the top of his lungs as he sprints toward the apple crate: \nASH Ki-ya! Ash's toe catches on a loose nail. He somersaults twice through the air and bounces off the side of the apple crate, which falls off the shelf. Kristofferson braces himself. The apple crate hits the floor and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies among the wreckage. Ash looks over the side of the shelf. Fox and Kylie watch from above, grimacing. \n", "test3_id": 1034}

{"test1_input": "(PAUSE) Thanks, Kylie. \nMRS. FOX If what I think is happening is \nHAPPENING -- \n(OMINOUSLY) -- it better not be. \nCUT TO: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to Boggis and Bunce. \nEXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT \nFox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says \nSTONILY: \nFOX Nice job covering for me. Next time \nTRY -- A twig snaps. Fox freezes. \nCUT TO: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes. \nCUT TO: The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its direction. \nCUT TO: Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking: \nFOX All three! Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark. Silence. \nSmoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his flashlight on Fox's hole. In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood- stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce. \nBEAN We got the tail, but we missed the fox. Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie. \nBEAN Petey? You and the boys sober up and get out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider. \nINT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT \nMrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly: \nASH It'll grow back, won't it? \nKYLIE (shaking his head) Tails don't grow back, except for lizards. \nFOX \n(MISERABLY) Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be tail-less for the rest of my life. \nASH \n(NERVOUSLY) Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as double-pneumonia, right? (pointing to Kristofferson) His dad's got one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot worse than -- Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls silent. Kristofferson turns away. \n", "test1_true": "MRS. FOX You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up with a proper apology. Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly: \nFOX What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape and the pants tucked into your socks? Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back to the room. \nFOX I got fired slash quit the Gazette and started stealing chickens on the sly. \nMRS. FOX \n(ICILY) That tail was the first thing I ever noticed about you. It was easily the most attractive tail for at least 50 miles in every direction. It was probably your single best quality -- and now it's gone forever. \nCUT TO: Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to Mrs. Fox. \nFOX Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer? At this point we'll be lucky if we can flip this tree for half of what we've already sunk into it. Fox flips over onto his stomach. \nFOX I won't be able to sleep on my back for six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen to my lawyer? \nMRS. FOX \n(BITTERLY) Because you don't listen to anybody. \nFOX (sitting up suddenly) What was that? \nMRS. FOX \n(PAUSE) What? I said -- There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of bed. He hollers: \nFOX Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us out! There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox looks at Fox intensely: \nMRS. FOX They'll kill the children! \nFOX \n(STEELY) Over my dead body, they will. \nMRS. FOX \n(ANGRILY) That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead, too, in that scenario! \nFOX \n(ANGRILY) Well, I'm arguing against that! \nMRS. FOX \n(SCREAMING) What are you talking about? \nFOX \n(SCREAMING) Why are you yelling at me? \n", "test1_id": 1032, "test2_input": "(YELLING) Now, go! The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe. Badger walks with Fox and Ash. \nBADGER What was he saying about that wristwatch? I didn't get what he was talking about. \nFox hesitates. He shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia: \nFOX Just some old back-story. \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT \nThe entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the brick cavern. Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the group. He has a bandage on his chest. \nFOX In a way, I'm almost glad that flood interrupted us, because I don't like the toast I was giving. I'm going to start over. Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass. \nFOX When I look down this table with the exquisite feast set before us, I see: two terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician, a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate agent, an excellent tailor, a crack accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty good minnow fisherman, and possibly the best landscape painter working on the scene today. As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver; Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish field mouse; Mole; Kylie (who looks slightly offended); and Mrs. Fox, respectively. \nFOX Maybe a few of you might even read my column from time to time. Who knows? I tend to doubt it. \n(DRAMATIC PAUSE) I also see a room full of wild animals. Everyone stares at Fox curiously, skeptical but intrigued. Fox points at them: \nFOX Wild animals with true natures and pure talents. Wild animals with scientific- sounding Latin names that mean something about our D.N.A. Wild animals each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species, and also -- well, I guess these things usually have a lot to \n(MORE) \nFOX (CONT'D) do with the parents, as we all know. Anyway, I think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us that just might give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew and letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is. I don't know. It's just a thought. Thank you for listening. Cheers, everyone. Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor. He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts: \nKYLIE Let's eat! Everyone turns to Kylie uncertainly. Kylie hesitates. \nKYLIE What? I'm just playing along with the -- \nFOX \n(FORCEFULLY) All right! Let's start planning! Who knows shorthand? Pause. Badger points to his otter secretary. She is Linda. Fox darts over to her and grips her by the arm. \nFOX Linda! Lutra Lutra! You got some dry paper? Here we go! Fox, highly energized, moves among the group, touching their shoulders and patting their backs. \nFOX Mole! Talpa Europea! What do you got? \nMOLE \n(HESITATES) I can see in the dark? \nFOX \n(EXHILARATED) That's incredible! We can use that! Linda? \nLINDA \n(TAKING SHORTHAND) Got it. \n", "test2_true": "RABBIT I'm fast. \nFOX You bet your cuss you are! Linda? \nLINDA \n(TAKING SHORTHAND) Got it. \nFOX Beaver! Castor Fiber! \nBEAVER I can chew through wood. \nFOX Amazing! Linda? \nLINDA \n(TAKING SHORTHAND) Got it. \nFOX Badger! Meles Meles! \nBADGER Demolitions expert! \nFOX \n(CONFUSED) What? Since when? \nBADGER Explosions, flames, things that burn! \nFOX Demolitions expert! OK! Linda! \nLINDA \n(TAKING SHORTHAND) Got it! Fox's cheeks and forehead are beaded with perspiration. He \nSCREAMS INSANELY: \nFOX Weasel! Mustela Nivalis! \nWEASEL Stop yelling! Fox snaps his fingers, kicks a rock, and throws his arm into the air. \nFOX All right! Fox points to the various cubs and pups. \nFOX All you little kids get organized and put together some kind of a K.P. unit or something to keep this sewer clean. It's good for morale. The field mouse shoves his way to the front of the crowd. He makes a fist with his paw. \nFIELD MOUSE I want to go with you, too! I want to fight! \nFOX \n(PAUSE) Good. Fabulous! Microtus Pennsylvanicus! Do you do that, in fact? Are field mice violent? \n", "test2_id": 1033, "test3_input": "FOX Come on! That doesn't sound anything like him! It's amateur night in Dixie! Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nA ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean frowns. \nBEAN What the cuss is he burning? A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes out. The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts: \nBEAN Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox? Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and scramble in the confusion. Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six farmers chase after him, firing their weapons. \nINT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY \nDown in the brick cavern, Mole listens to a tin can attached to a string. He says urgently as he makes notations in a \nLEDGER: \nMOLE Twenty-eight pinecones fired! Twenty-two targets hit! Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks quickly on the street in her mural. The stolen, portable television set sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13's coverage of the chaos in the street. \nCUT TO: Rabbit running full-steam out of the village being pursued by the six farmhands. He hurdles an empty Coke bottle lying on its side in the road. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nBadger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows, and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down a cobblestone lane. Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path. Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity lets out a little whoop. There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive. Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with a sidecar. \nCUT TO: Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar. They both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox over the sound of the motor: \nKYLIE Are you scared of wolves? \nFOX Scared, no! I have a phobia of them! \nKYLIE Well, I have a thing about thunder! \nFOX \n(ANNOYED) Why? That's stupid! Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape flutters behind him. He shouts: \nASH I don't like needles! Fox and Kylie look to Ash in disbelief. Fox says furiously: \nFOX Where'd you come from again? How'd you get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm losing my mind! Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road. \nINT. HELICOPTER. DAY \nA pilot with a red moustache and a South African accent flies Bean's chopper. He wears a Bean, inc. patch on his shoulder. He shouts into the microphone connected to his helmet: \nPILOT I've got a fox on a motorcycle with a littler fox and what looks to be an opossum in the sidecar riding north on farm lane seven. Does that sound like anything to anybody? A military-type voice responds over the radio: \nMILITARY VOICE (O.S.) Roger that, Red. Let me just, uh -- Oh, I think the boss wants to -- \nBEAN (0.S.) Red, it's Franklin Bean! Turn around, get the cuss back here, and pick us up on the \n", "test3_true": "EXT. BEAN'S COMPOUND. DAY \nThe Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds. Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean Annex. The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire security barricade. \nFOX That's the annex over there on the right. Ash nods. Kylie does not respond. \nFOX The white building over there on the right. Pause. Fox looks to Kylie. \nFOX Kylie? Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says \nSHARPLY: \nFOX Kylie! \nKYLIE What? \n(SUDDENLY) I did it! \nFOX When? I didn't see it! Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his bicycle. Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the motorcycle. \nFox climbs onto Kylie's shoulders and tries the knobs. They are locked. \nFOX Kylie, you got a credit card? \nKYLIE (digging in his pockets) Sure. \nFOX \n(IMPRESSED) See, this is what I was saying about how good you are at just being available for \nWHATEVER -- Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler Titanium Card. Fox frowns. \nFOX A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you qualify for this? \nKYLIE \n(SHRUGS) I pay my bills on time. I've always had good credit. Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock and opens the doors. The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side, there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted, broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest, fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle. White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily. Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck reads Spitz. Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie. \nFOX Give me a blueberry. Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly: \nASH What's that white stuff around his mouth? \nKYLIE \n(SQUINTING) I think he eats soap. Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above some bags of fertilizer. It's reads: Drug: Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg \nNAME: SPITZ \nBREED: BEAGLE For: RABIES (chronic) Other: Take with meat, do not operate heavy machinery Fox frowns. He says grimly: \n", "test3_id": 1034}

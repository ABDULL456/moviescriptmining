We see three faces in lamplight, looking down. They have been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes and disarranged clothing. One is a young gentlewoman with a sweet girlish face, KATE KELLER; the second is an elderly DOCTOR, stethoscope at neck, thermometer in fingers; the third is a gruff gentleman in his forties with chin whis- kers, CAPTAIN ARTHUR KELLER. 
DOCTOR Shet11 live. KATE closes her eyes. I can tell you now, I thought she wouldn't, 
KELLER 
(INDULGENT) I've brought up two of them, but this is my wife's first, she isn't battle-scarred yet.

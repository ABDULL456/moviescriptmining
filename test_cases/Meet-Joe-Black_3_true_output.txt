VOICE (V.O.) '...I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.' 
Parrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts: 
SUSAN What is it, Daddy --? 
PARRISH Nothing. 
Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a thing but him. 
PARRISH (cont'd) Just talking to myself again.  You know me -- 
The elevator door opens. 
PARRISH Well, here we are -- 
Parrish leads the group out. 
EXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
They exit the building. 
SUSAN (to Parrish) Are you okay? 
PARRISH A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action. 
SUSAN Well, go get 'em, Pops. 
PARRISH Yer damn right. 
Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine, Quince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a cab. 
INT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
DREW ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far? 
PARRISH Sounds good. 
DREW It's going to be great -- 
PARRISH Do you think I need a haircut? 
DREW Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one. 
Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator. 
INT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY 
Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing the overkill decor. 
DREW Their PR guy asked me, what did I think Parrish Communications stood for, that's principle and ethics- wise?  I came up with something, but then it occurred to me, why don't I ask Bill?  What do you think? 
A moment, Parrish shrugs. 
PARRISH Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time. 
DREW That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou. 
Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec- utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white- haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55. 
BONTECOU Bill, thanks for coming over... (to Drew) And how're you doing today, Drew? (to Parrish) You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table. 
PARRISH Good, good.  Glad to hear it. 
BONTECOU We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was? 
PARRISH I'm sorry, I don't recall -- 
BONTECOU Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes -- 
PARRISH I thought you were buying my company. 
BONTECOU Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint. 
Silence.  Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits', Bontecou holding away. 
PARRISH Well, that's very nice to hear. 
Drew nods excitedly. 
EXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY 
The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue. 
INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY 
A thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors, residents and interns. 
Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman, with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her speaking into the pay phone. 
An attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder. 
YOUNG MAN ...Honey, you've got to go on... there's a time to sow and a time to reap, you sow now and forget about him... yeah, I liked him, I don't like him anymore... because you're my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me -- I'm on a plane in a minute... as soon as I get my phone in, you're my first call, that's a promise... where you going now?... good, hit the books, get that degree, one day we'll hang out a shingle together... you bet, honey... later. 
The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take her eyes off him.  He senses her eyes, glances over, his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly. 
YOUNG MAN Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry. 
SUSAN Not at all.  It was fascinating. 
YOUNG MAN Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it? 
SUSAN You and 'Honey'? 
YOUNG MAN My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school. 
SUSAN I'm sorry -- 
YOUNG MAN Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it? 
SUSAN What's the way? 
YOUNG MAN Nothing lasts.

DUKE OK.  I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left. 
GONZO Can we make it? 
DUKE That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door. 
GONZO I want to leave fast. 
DUKE OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly.  It's going to be a long walk. (signals waitress who comes over) 
GONZO (suddenly to waitress) Do they pay you to screw that bear? 
WAITRESS What? 
DUKE He's just kidding. (to GONZO) Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs and gamble. 
GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the turntable. 
GONZO When does this thing stop? 
DUKE It won't stop.  It's not ever going to stop. 
DUKE carefully steps off the turntable. 
GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away. 
DUKE Don't move you'll come around. 
DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps going around. 
The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them. 
DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream. DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling. 
DUKE You fell.  Let's go. 
GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched, looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps? 
DUKE (CONT'D) OK.  You stay here and go to jail. I'm leaving. 
DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with him. 
GONZO Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back. 
DUKE Probably the bartender.  He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress. 
GONZO Good God!  Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator? 
DUKE (turning him in the opposite direction) Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement. 
EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT 
DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance. 
DUKE Don't run.  They'd like any excuse to shoot us. 
GONZO (in an extended fall) You drive!  I think there's something wrong with me. 
INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT 
DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET. 
GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock. 
GONZO Those bastards have changed the lock on us.  They probably searched the room.  Jesus, we're finished! 
The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
GONZO Bolt everything!  Use all chains!

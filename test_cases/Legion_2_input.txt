Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag, feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant. Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her eyes, fear and anger overtaking her. She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration. 
INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER 
It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie, wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought. 
JEEP (O.S.) Guess it's your turn not to sleep. Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her. 
CHARLIE Hey... Jeep sees the strain on her face. 
JEEP You okay? 
CHARLIE You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah? Jeep smiles, nods. 
CHARLIE Crazy thing is...I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that? (off Jeep's reaction:) I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran. 
(BEAT) For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it like I'd planned. Then I'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I didn't have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me. A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then: 
JEEP You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will. She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her: 
CHARLIE How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated. 
JEEP You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself. And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON 
Sand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking. Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5. 
KYLE ...Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety. 
AUDREY Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks. She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life. Off Kyle's surprised look: 
AUDREY Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a thing for guns. Parents hated him. 
KYLE I bet they did. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands the gun over to Kyle. Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years overnight. 
AUDREY My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving. 
KYLE Yeah? 
AUDREY They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club. Kyle considers her thoughtfully. 
KYLE The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did? 
AUDREY What? 
KYLE I got really good at being bad. She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He wipes a tear from her cheek. She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately. His hands trace over her body. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up. It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head back. Further. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word "Paradise" illuminated above them. Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

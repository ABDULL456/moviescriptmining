UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is being asked to do something against his own people.  He looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion. 
COLUMBUS You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did! 
UTAPAN You did the same to your God! 
COLUMBUS is caught short. 
COLUMBUS We have to stop this war. 
UTAPAN nods.  He walks and takes an arrow.  He examines it. 
COLUMBUS Do you know them? 
UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  HILL AND VALLEY - DAY 
Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot. 
This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stands up shouting. 
COLUMBUS Stop!  Stop this! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT 
MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them), silently approach the entrance of the mansion. 
A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry. 
INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT 
MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall. On the table, the model of the future city. 
Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel. 
A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes... 
EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT 
The half-burnt remains of the Mansion.  COLUMBUS stands in the square, looking up at it.  Behind him, his SOLDIERS, his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS. 
GIACOMO walks slowly across the square.  COLUMBUS looks at him in disbelief. 
GIACOMO (through cracked lips) Moxica... 
EXT.  RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN 
COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle, looking for the MUTINEERS. 
They reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing. COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by a HALBERDIER. 
Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above their heads. 
A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the current. 
Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river stained with blood. 
Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield... others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is shot down from the branches of a tree... 
The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to him is killed, and carried away by the current. 
Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves. There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are beginning to surrender. 
In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him. COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of a cliff. 
EXT.  JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY 
MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing in slow motion. 
EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY 
MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him. 
Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance. He steps backwards towards the edge.

Scout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled: 
SCOUT MASTER WARD I'm trying. 
Mr. Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his back. Captain Sharp blocks Mr. Bishop. 
CAPTAIN SHARP Stop. 
Mr. Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp. Mrs. Bishop jerks him backwards and shouts: 
MRS. BISHOP Stop it, Walt! 
Mr. Bishop faces Mrs. Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing heavily. Scout Master Ward looks depressed. Jed, Gadge, Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside the seaplane. 
CAPTAIN SHARP I do blame him -- (pointing to Scout Master Ward) -- but I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people. 
MRS. BISHOP (HESITATES) What are you talking about? 
SCOUT MASTER WARD She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. Look. 
Scout Master Ward shows Mrs. Bishop the blood all over his hands and uniform. Mrs. Bishop looks confused. 
MRS. BISHOP I don't get it. Were there witnesses? 
SCOUT MASTER WARD Of course. It's assault. 
MRS. BISHOP I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer? 
SCOUT MASTER WARD No, ma'am, but -- 
MRS. BISHOP (FURIOUS) Well, I am! 
Captain Sharp gently draws Mrs. Bishop away by the shoulder. He links arms with her as he tries to placate the group: 
CAPTAIN SHARP Easy does it. Calm down, Laura. 
MR. BISHOP Stay away from my wife. 
Mr. Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs. Bishop into Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr. Bishop but is intercepted by Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop. They shout REPEATEDLY: 
CAPTAIN SHARP/MR. BISHOP SCOUT MASTER WARD/MRS. BISHOP Dammit! Christ! Shit! Jesus! 
At this moment, a voice interjects from the shore: 
NARRATOR (O.S.) Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain Sharp? 
Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stop fighting and turn around at once. They see: the narrator. He stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal with rubber bands wrapped around it. They all stare at him blankly. He continues: 
NARRATOR As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration. 
Long pause. Everyone looks utterly perplexed. The propeller of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes from the blast of wind and dust. The narrator hesitates. He yells over the noise: 
NARRATOR What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going. 
The narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal.

EXT. TIDAL LAGOON. DAY 
A small cove enclosed by a low, rocky cliff. It forms an almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers, and branches. A thin channel leads out to the ocean. The sand on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and crowded with shells at the bottom. Birds echo and fly from tree to tree. 
Sam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach. The kitten wanders, exploring. The lid of the portable record player is open. The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker: 
RECORD PLAYER (V.O.) Onto the bird-house, where every kind of bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling around. This is a real acrobatic act for our gifted young flute player, Paula Robeson. 
As they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove. They each climb up a rock over the water. They look at each other across the lagoon. They both laugh. Suzy shouts, SMILING:

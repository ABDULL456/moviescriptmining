Did she say anything about you? 13 in the corner. \nSHEPHERD No, it's just that we had a nice couple of minutes together. She threatened me and I patronized her and we didn't have anything to eat, but I thought there was a connection. \nA.J. is staring at him in disbelief. \nSHEPHERD She didn't say anything about me? \nA.J. (quietly) Well, no, but I could pass her a note before study hall and-- \nSHEPHERD Tell me this: Hypothetically, what would happen-- \nA.J. I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in the corner. \nHe misses the shot. \nSHEPHERD --if I called Sydney and asked her to be my date at the State Dinner Thursday night? \nA.J. You're not serious. \nSHEPHERD Don't I sound serious? \nA.J. The President can't just go out on a date. \nSHEPHERD Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did. \nA.J. You're not-- \nSHEPHERD Wilson was widowed during his first term. He meets a woman named Edith Gault. He dated her, courted her, married her, and somewhere in there managed to form the League of Nations. \nA.J. Mr. President, this is an election year. If you're looking for female companionship, we can make arrangements that'll insure total privacy and-- \nSHEPHERD I don't want you to get me a girl, A.J. What is this, Vegas? \nA.J. No, sir, this is the White House. \nSHEPHERD And I'm talking about something that in no way is at conflict with my oath of office. I'm a single adult, and I met a woman that I'd like to see again socially. How's that different from what Wilson did? \nA.J. The difference is he didn't have to be the president on television. You've said it a million times: If there were a television set in every living room 60 years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair. \nSHEPHERD What are you saying? \nA.J. We'll take a hit. \nSHEPHERD How big? \nA.J. I don't know. Five points. Maybe more. \nSHEPHERD Five points we're standing here talking about?! \nA.J. It could be more. \nSHEPHERD I drop five points when Wisconsin doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl. 5 in the corner. \nA.J. Do you want me to have Kodak put together some numbers so we know what we're talking about? \nSHEPHERD Yeah. (beat) No. No. I don't want to check a polling sample to see if this is okay, like I'm asking permission to stay out an hour past curfew. This isn't the business of the American people. \nA.J. Mr. President, the American people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business. \nSHEPHERD I like her, A.J.

I acted like a college freshman at a protest rally. \nBETH Tell him the part about walking out the wrong door. \nSYDNEY Oh God, I forgot about that.

I regrouped, you gotta gimme that. I pulled it together at the end. I stood in the middle of the Oval Office and I made it very clear that from now on, he who doesn't take the GDC seriously does so at his peril! \nBETH And then you walked out the wrong door. \nSYDNEY Are you gonna be throwing that back at me the rest of my life? \nBETH That's my current plan, yes. \nThe TELEPHONE RINGS... \nSYDNEY That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said he'd call at nine. \nSYDNEY picks up the phone-- \nSYDNEY (continuing; into phone) Hello? \nSHEPHERD Uh, hi, is this Sydney? \nSYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice-- \nSYDNEY (into phone) Leo? \nPHONE VOICE No, this is Andrew Shepherd. \nSYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to her-- \nSYDNEY Andrew Shepherd.

Well, I'm so glad you called, because I forgot to tell you today what a nice ass you have. I'm also impressed that you were able to get my phone number, considering I don't have a phone.

You want a drink? Lemme take your coat. \nBut SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off. \nSYDNEY Mr. President, this isn't gonna work. \nSHEPHERD Sure it will. You button the top button, and it doesn't fall off the hanger. \nSYDNEY That's not what I... \nSHEPHERD I didn't think so. Listen... \nSYDNEY I've really enjoyed the time we've spent together, but this has catastrophe written all over it. Please, Mr. President, don't pursue me outside the political arena. \nSHEPHERD Well, I have no intention of pursuing you inside the political arena, so that leaves everything out, and that's unacceptable to me. \nSYDNEY If I were on your staff, I would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the Western world. \nSHEPHERD Let's clear up a couple of things. Number 1: I seldom prance. Number 2: I have no intention of engaging in a character debate, and Number 3: You're not on my staff. \nSYDNEY Yes, of course, but if you'll follow the immutable-- \nSHEPHERD Why is that, by the way? \nSYDNEY Why's that? \nSHEPHERD Why aren't you on my staff? \nSYDNEY You can't afford me. \nSHEPHERD How much do you make? \nSYDNEY More than you do, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD The name's Andy. How much money do you make? \nSYDNEY What the hell does it matter how much money I-- \nSHEPHERD You would raise your voice to the President? \nSYDNEY I'm only thinking about the health of your Presidency. You think this morning's press conference was the end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be drooling over this. \nSHEPHERD Are you attracted to me? \nSYDNEY I beg your pardon? \nSHEPHERD I asked if-- \nSYDNEY (of course she is) That's not the issue-- \nSHEPHERD Well, I tell you what. Let's make it the issue. Let's try something new, 'cause I know that most couples, when they're first getting together, are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool. \nSYDNEY You're not most people. \nSHEPHERD You know what your problem is? \nSYDNEY What's my problem? \nSHEPHERD Sex and nervousness. \nSYDNEY Sex and nervousness is my problem. \nSHEPHERD Yes. Last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room, I realized that those place settings were provided by the First Ladies. And I'll bet none of those First Ladies were nervous about having sex with their President husbands. And you know why? \nSYDNEY No, but I'm sure you'll explain it to me. \nSHEPHERD I will. Because they weren't presidents when they met them. Not the case here. \nSYDNEY Ahhhhhh. \nSHEPHERD You see what I'm getting at? \nSYDNEY Yes. May I use your bathroom for a moment? \nSHEPHERD Sure. It's right through there. \nSYDNEY I want to freshen up. \nSHEPHERD As you pass through, you'll see a large closet on your left. And if you feel comfortable, hang up your coat, and when you come back I'll have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on the couch, and I will explain to you my plan. \nSYDNEY You have a plan? Don't make me wait. You're on a roll. \nSYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area. SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks. \nSHEPHERD (speaking up) Okay. You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President. It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason I know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and I know what a big step that was for you. So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down. When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen. \n", "test2_true": "SHEPHERD (continuing) Perhaps I didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the \"Slow Down\" plan. \nSYDNEY You explained it great. \nShe moves closer to him. \nSHEPHERD (pause) Are you nervous? \nSYDNEY No. \nSHEPHERD Good. My nervousness exists on several levels. Number 1 -- and this is in no particular order -- I haven't done this in a pretty long time. Number 2: Any expectations you might have, due to the fact that I'm, you know... \nSYDNEY The most powerful man in the world? \nSHEPHERD Exactly, thank you. Just so you remember that's a political distinction that comes with the office. I mean, if Eisenhower were here instead of me he'd be dead by now. And number three... \nSYDNEY (gently) Andy... \nThey're both standing, facing each other... \nThey gently kiss.

(listens) Yeah...all right. \nHe hangs up the phone and looks around the room, only to notice SYDNEY is tiptoeing around in the dim light, trying to quietly dress herself and gather up her things. SHEPHERD watches this odd spectacle for a moment before he says-- \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Sydney? \nSYDNEY turns around. \nSYDNEY Hi. \nSHEPHERD What are you doing? \nSYDNEY I wanted to leave the building before the press corps got here. \nSHEPHERD I have those same thoughts every day of my life. Say, you know Lewis Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's... \nSYDNEY Sure.

Hi, Sydney. \nSYDNEY Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President, thank you for taking the time to go over those fossil fuel numbers.

Can't you declare it a Federal Disaster Area or something? \nSHEPHERD I'll look into it. \nA.J. What were you doing up on the Hill, anyway? \nSYDNEY Ahhh...I had a terrible meeting today. Totally lost my cool with McSorley, McCluskey and Shane. \nSHEPHERD You went to see the Motown Three? \nSYDNEY I pitched 'em the hill. \nA.J. (beat) On its merits? \nSHEPHERD The woman knows no fear. She'd lobby the Carolinas to the American Lung Association. \nSYDNEY It was a disaster. \nA.J. You're in good company. I sat with 'em a week ago. They told me there was nothing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill. \nSYDNEY Well, congratulations, fellas, you're outta the cellar. McSorley told me the only thing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill was the fossil fuel package. \nThis catches SHEPHERD and A.J. by surprise--like accidentally drawing to an inside straight. \nA.J.

Sydney Wade told her boyfriend and her boyfriend's best friend that she had a lousy day. \nA.J. It doesn't change the facts, Mr. President. If Sydney gets her 24 votes and we're three short, there's some maneuvering to be done. \nSHEPHERD I made a promise, A.J. \nA.J. You made a deal, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD I made it with Sydney. \nA.J. You made it with the GDC. \nSHEPHERD Yeah, well, this is all academic anyway. We're not going to need those votes. \nA.J.

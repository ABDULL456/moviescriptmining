BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY \nIt's an early November morning, and the sun has just come over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment before we \nCUT TO: \nINT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY \nA SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff. \nAGENT COOPER Liberty's moving. \nAnother AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is followed a step or two later by \nPRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD. \nSHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy, professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old. \nJANIE The 10:15 event's been moved inside to the Indian Treaty Room. \nSHEPHERD (to Janie) The 10:15 is American Fisheries? \nJANIE Yes, sir. They're giving you a 200-pound halibut. \nSHEPHERD Janie, make a note. We need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish. \nJANIE starts to make a note. \nJANIE Yes, sir. \nSHEPHERD Janie, I was kidding. \nJANIE Of course, sir. \nSHEPHERD (to the AGENT at the elevator) Hey, Cooper. \nAGENT COOPER 'Morning, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close... \nJANIE Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning. \nSHEPHERD Is he upset about the speech last night? \nJANIE He seemed concerned. \nSHEPHERD Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning unless Lewis was concerned about something I did Sunday night. \nThe elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32, LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night, though that doesn't seem to slow him down. \nLEWIS You skipped the whole paragraph. \nSHEPHERD (to Janie) And Monday morning it is. \nLEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the South Lawn. \nLEWIS \"American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society\"...and then nothing. You dumped the whole handguns paragraph. \nSHEPHERD This is a time for prudence, Lewis. \nLEWIS That was the kick-ass section. \nThe three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing. \nSHEPHERD I thought what with being the President and all... \nLEWIS Sir, of course I didn't mean to imply-- \nSHEPHERD I thought you'd be turning cartwheels this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job approval. \nLEWIS That's great news, sir, but... \nThey walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass. \nGROUNDKEEPER 'Morning, Mr. President. \nBefore he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting, JANIE quickly and quietly said-- \nJANIE Charlie. \nSHEPHERD 'Morning, Charlie. \nLEWIS Sir, the press is gonna need an explanation. \nSHEPHERD For what? \nSHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make their way through the corridors of \nINT. THE WEST WING - DAY \nSHEPHERD It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control. \nA.J. I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President. \nROBIN Are they blaming the President for global warming? \nA.J. Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean. \n(continuing; to SHEPHERD) Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point. \nLEWIS What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions. \nA.J. It won't pass at 20 percent. \nLEWIS We haven't really tried. \nA.J. Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year. \nSHEPHERD Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon? \nA.J. (to an AIDE) Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him the President's-- \nA.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on pedestrian collision in the outer office-- \nMRS. CHAPIL (O.S.) Aaagh! \nKODAK (O.S.) Sorry! Sorry, my fault. \nA.J. (to the AIDE) Never mind. \nLEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years. \nKODAK Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD You all right? \nKODAK They keep moving that big ficus plant. \nA.J. We're all here, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD Okay. First, I wanted to say congratulations. Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job. \nKODAK Wait a second. You wanted me to poll registered voters? \nEveryone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles... \nSHEPHERD But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear. \nROBIN Can I tell my morning press gaggle that gun control-- \nA.J. Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime. \nLEWIS Hang on, are we not-- \nA.J. Lewis-- \nLEWIS Are we not putting back the handgun restrictions?! \nA.J. We're leaving 'em out. \nLEWIS Sir, we campaigned on this issue. Now, I understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now. \nSHEPHERD After the elections. \nLEWIS Sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. Let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do. \nSHEPHERD We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis. We need it to get re-elected. For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime. \nA.J. Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda. \nROBIN Got it. \nA.J. Leon, you're gonna run the war room. We're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. And, Leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do what the N.R.A. does. \nKODAK Scare the shit out of 'em? \nA.J. Yeah. \nKODAK I can do that. \nA.J. Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. You're gonna run the show on the hill. \nLEWIS Can I just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers. \nSHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a temper. \nSHEPHERD Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win. \nLEWIS Yes, sir. \nA.J. We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today. The last nose count put us 18 votes short. \nSHEPHERD Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you, everyone. Janie, what's next? \nA.J. Thank you, Mr. President. \nThe meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their \"Thank you, Mr. President\"'s as they exit. \nJANIE Security briefing, sir. \nCUT TO: \nLUCY Are my lips swollen? \nSHEPHERD Are they supposed to be? \nLUCY Yeah. \nSHEPHERD Then you're doing fine. \nLUCY Whatcha got behind your back? \nSHEPHERD A little gift. \nLUCY Is it a dirt bike? \nSHEPHERD Nope. \nHe hands her an old textbook ... \nLUCY Is it a really old seventh-grade textbook of yours that you're gonna make me read cover to cover and discuss at dinner and drive me crazy with? \nSHEPHERD I'm not comfortable with the \"really old\" part, but everything else you said was true. \nLUCY (reading the cover) \"Understanding the Constitution.\" \nSHEPHERD Your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the Constitution this week. \nLUCY You talked to Mr. Linder? \nSHEPHERD Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher Conference. Mr. Linder and I were the key player in that discussion. Why don't you like social studies, Luce? \nLUCY I like it fine, Dad. \nSHEPHERD All your other teachers say you're happy, you're enthusiastic, you've always got your hand up...Mr. Linder says you don't participate unless he calls on you, and even then it's a one-word answer. \nLUCY I don't know what to say, Dad. I guess I'm just not...I don't know. \nSHEPHERD Luce, take a look at this book. This is exciting stuff. It's about who we are and what we want. Read what it says on the first page. \nLUCY (reading) \"Property of Gilmore Junior High School.\" \nSHEPHERD The next page. \nLUCY (reading) \"We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union...\" \nSHEPHERD See? Grabs you right off the bat. It's a page-turner. \nLUCY I can't wait. \nSHEPHERD Good, 'cause it's possible the subject might come up at dinner tonight. \nLUCY Do you see it as part of your job to torture me? \nSHEPHERD No, it's just one of the perks. See you tonight. \nHe gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door. Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of \"Hail to the Chief.\" SHEPHERD shoots her a look as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT \nWhere SHEPHERD is finishing a meeting with the DEFENSE SECRETARY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS and a NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, each of whom is accompanied by at least one DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present. \nDEFENSE SECRETARY The C-STAD hardware's been in place for a month. We've got 22 instructors from the Army Air Defense School waiting to go down and train the Israelis. \nA.J. How soon can you deploy them? \nCHAIRMAN We can airlift 'em in the morning. They'll have C-STAD operational in 20 days. \nA.J. Any security concerns? \nSECURITY ADVISOR If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd have hit it by now. \nSHEPHERD Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you, gentlemen. \nSHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of \"good-bye\" 's and \"Thank you, Mr. President\"'s. They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil. \nMRS. CHAPIL You too, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the residence. \nIt is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE in the morning. \nSHEPHERD I'll see you in the morning, Janie. \nJANIE You will, Mr. President. \nA SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance. \nAGENT #2 (sotto) Liberty is moving. \nA.J. Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun at the GDC. \nSHEPHERD It's about time. \nA.J. She's a lawyer from Virginia named Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman well. She's had a lot of success getting congressmen elected. \nSHEPHERD Maybe we should try to steal her. Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that. \nA.J. You know, if you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello. It might smooth the way. \nSYDNEY (quietly) My name's Sydney Ellen Wade. I'd like to-- \nOPERATOR (O.S.) (filtered) The President's expecting your call, ma'am. I'll put you right through. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHEPHERD'S PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT \nHe's just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings. He picks up the phone-- \nSHEPHERD Hello. \nSYDNEY Mr. President, I'm sure there's an appropriate thing to say at this moment. Probably some formal apology for the nice-ass remark would be in order. I just don't quite know how to word it. \nSHEPHERD It's my fault. I shouldn't have called you at home. Should I call you at the office tomorrow? \nSYDNEY No, sir, of course not. I mean -- yes, you can call me anytime you want -- this is fine. Right now is fine. When I said \"of course not,\" I meat that...You know what? The hell with it -- I'm moving to another country. \nSHEPHERD (smiling) What did you mean when you said you don't have a phone. \nSYDNEY I just moved to Washington over the weekend, and my apartment isn't ready yet. This is my sister's apartment. Come to think of it, how did you get this number? \nSHEPHERD (beat) How did I get the number. That's a reasonable question. I don't know. Probably the FBI. \nSYDNEY (trying to pretend it's just another guy on the phone) The FBI. Sure. 'Cause i-if you want to find someone and you're the president, that's who you would call. \nSHEPHERD You know who else is good at that? \nSYDNEY The C.I.A.? \nSHEPHERD Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the Internal Revenue Service. They have computer files that...Well...I should stop stalling. As I'm sure you know, the French have elected themselves a new president, and we're having a formal state dinner at the White House, and I was wondering -- and you're under no obligation at all -- but I thought it might be fun... I was wondering if you maybe wanted to go...with me, and uh... there it is. That's why I was calling. \nThere's a long silence on the phone. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Sydney? Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long to-- \nSYDNEY The President has asked me to join him in representing our country. I'm honored. I'm equal to the task. And I won't let you down, sir. \nSHEPHERD (beat) Sydney, this is just a dinner. We're not gonna be doing espionage or anything. \nSYDNEY No. Of course. I'm a little...uh...what do I do? I, I mean, where do I go? Should I meet you? Will you... \nSHEPHERD I'm gonna have a very nice woman named Marsha Bridgeport call you. She's the White House Social Director, and she'll help you with anything you want. Now when she calls you and tells you her name is Marsha Bridgeport, it'll help if you give her the benefit of the doubt. \nSYDNEY Of course. \nSHEPHERD I'll see you Thursday night. \nSYDNEY Mr. President, thank you for asking me. Really. This is a first for me. \nSHEPHERD Me too. \nThey hang up. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nINT. THE CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY \nA large conference room at OEOB has been converted for the use of a half-dozen STAFFERS as well as ten or twelve interns, some of them high school age. A sign on a corkboard reads, \"17 Votes in 69 Days.\" \nThe two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following numbers in descending order. \nThere is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the House of Representatives and is divided up into five columns: FOR, LEANING TOWARDS, UNDECIDED, LEANING AGAINST, and AGAINST. \nKODAK Who's on Indiana? (raising his voice) Excuse me. New people, I can't remember your names. Raise your hand if you're on Indiana. \nTwo INTERNS raise their hands-- \nKODAK (continuing) Put your hands down -- you're on Illinois. \nLEWIS comes in. \nLEWIS We've got Jarrett. \nKODAK What? \nLEWIS George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid \"yes.\" \nKODAK I don't believe it. (to an INTERN) You. New guy. \"Jarrett, Democrat, Minnesota.\" Slide his name on over to \"for.\" (to Lewis) We just had his name laminated under \"Undecided.\" How'd you get the fence pole out of his butt? \nLEWIS I wish I could take credit. He just said, \"Lewis, I support the President a hundred percent .\" Not the bill, the President. \nLEWIS We're gonna win this in a walk. It's like a kissing booth at a carnival. Give us a vote, get a photo-op with number 63. \nLEWIS reaches to the tote board and pulls the \"17\" off, revealing \"16.\" \nLEWIS We should have gone after the handguns. \nKODAK We gotta do one thing at a time. \nLEWIS We don't have time to do one thing at a time. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY \nA GDC conference room that SYDNEY, her assistant, DAVID, and two INTERNS have made into their 72-day headquarters. A similar tote board reads \"23 Votes in 69 Days.\" \nThe two interns are marking spreadsheets. DAVID is on one phone, SYDNEY is on another. \nA.J. Sydney, come on in. You look beautiful. \nSYDNEY Thank you. I have no idea what I'm doing here. \nA.J. I promise you there's no hidden agenda. \nSHEPHERD approaches SYDNEY. \nSHEPHERD Sydney. Andrew Shepherd. We spoke on the phone. \nSYDNEY Yes, sir. I remember. \nESTHER, MACINERNERY, A.J.'S wife, joins them. \nA.J. You know my wife, Esther. \nSYDNEY Sure. It's nice to see you again. \nESTHER (affectionately) Sydney, the President told me about how you two met. I think it's priceless. \nSYDNEY I don't know what happened. One minute I was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader. The next minute I had a date. \nESTHER Men like being insulted by women. It makes them feel loved. Don't ask me why. \nA.J. Sydney, when you meet the French President, don't make him feel too loved, all right? We just signed a new trade agreement. \nSYDNEY Got it. \nThe French President, D'ASTIER, and his WIFE approach. \nSHEPHERD (to D'Astier) Mr. President, would allow me to introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney, this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier and his wife Monique Danielle D'Astier of France. \nSYDNEY An honor to meet you both. \nJANIE Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt. The receiving line is in place. \nSHEPHERD Sydney, it sounds like our table's ready. \nSHEPHERD's guests make their way out of the residence, leaving SHEPHERD with SYDNEY and the FRENCH PRESIDENT and MDME. D'ASTIER. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD and SYDNEY are walking down the staircase that leads to the red-carpeted hall through which the President enters the East Room. \nThe GROUP escorting the President gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy. \nSHEPHERD Once we hit the bottom of the stairs, I gotta do a thing. You'll be escorted... \nSYDNEY They took me through it. \nAfter a slight pause-- \nSYDNEY (continuing) Do you do this often, sir? \nSHEPHERD (beat) This is, actually, only our second State Dinner. The first was for the Emperor of Japan, who died shortly after that, so we stopped having them for a while, just in case. \nSYDNEY I meant do you go out on...do you-- often--do you-- \nSHEPHERD Do I date a lot? \nSYDNEY Well, yeah. \nSHEPHERD No. How 'bout you? \nSYDNEY Me? Lately, I seem to be going out on a lot of first dates. \nSHEPHERD Then you're experienced at this. \nSYDNEY Oh yeah, you can ask me anything. \nSHEPHERD How are we doing so far? \nSYDNEY It's hard to say at this point. So far it's just your typical first date stuff. \nAnd all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East Room-- \n--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes. \nSHEPHERD Damn. And I wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys. \nA BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces-- \nVOICE (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. \nAnd now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision -- \nSHEPHERD By the way, nice shoes. \n--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF. \nThe 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud. \nThe GROUP following the President catches up to the spot where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite swept up. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. EAST ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is beautifully appointed, with the Marine Corps Dance Band playing dinner music -- and the SECRET SERVICE strategically positioned. \nINT. A BLACK LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nas it pulls away from the White House and into the night. In the back, SYDNEY slips a shoe off and rubs her foot. \nShe smiles, then turns around to look out the back window as the White House slips out of view. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING \nSERIES OF SHOTS - DAY IN THE LIFE \nCUT TO: \nINT. OUTER OFFICE OF THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nMRS. CHAPIL and JANIE are at their respective desks as SHEPHERD walks in. \nSHEPHERD Good morning, Mrs. Chapil. \nMRS. CHAPIL Good morning, Mr. President. Mr. Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the office, sir. They said they needed to speak with you before scheduling. \nSHEPHERD Fine. Janie, can you get me the number of a local florist? \nJANIE I'll take care of it, sir. Where do you want them sent? \nSHEPHERD I want to do it myself. I just need the phone number. \nJANIE I don't understand. \nSHEPHERD I want the phone number of a florist. \nJANIE You just want the phone number? \nSHEPHERD Yeah. \nJANIE (beat) I don't understand, sir, is there-- \nSHEPHERD I want to send some flowers, Janie. I want to do it myself. I don't want to staff it out, and I don't want to issue an Executive Order. I just want a phone number. \nJANIE I'll get it for you right away, sir. \nSHEPHERD Thank you. \nHe heads into the office. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nwhere LEWIS and ROBIN are waiting anxiously. \nROBIN Mr. President, we need five minutes before scheduling if you can spare it. \nSHEPHERD (to Robin) I just need two minutes to make a call and I'll be right with you. \nJANIE enters and hands SHEPHERD a piece of paper. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Thank you, Janie. \nShe exits. \nLEWIS Who are we calling, sir? \nSHEPHERD I'm calling the Organization of the United Brotherhood of It's-None-of- Your-Damn-Business, Lewis. I'll be with you in a minute. \nLEWIS Yes, sir. \nLEWIS and ROBIN exit the Oval Office. SHEPHERD picks up the phone. \nSHEPHERD (to the OPERATOR) Yeah, good morning. How do I get an outside line? Really? That's simple. Thank you. \nSHEPHERD dials the phone number JANIE's given him. \nCUT TO: \nLEWIS and ROBIN \nhovering near the outer office. \nLEWIS Janie? \nJANIE Yes? \nLEWIS What's the President doing? \nJANIE I'm sorry, I'm really not at liberty to say. \nCUT TO: \nSHEPHERD ON THE PHONE \nSHEPHERD (into phone) Tell me something. What is the state flower of Virginia? \nCUT TO: \nTHE OUTER OFFICE \nROBIN Does this have something to do with Sydney Wade? \nJANIE I'm really not at liberty to say. \nThere's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in with a strange-looking package. \nSYDNEY Leo, there is no relationship. It was one night. It's done. \nLEO'S SECRETARY Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered by White House messenger. It's marked \"Perishable.\" \nLEO The White House has sent me something perishable? \nLEO'S SECRETARY It's for Ms. Wade. \nLEO Here we go... \nSYDNEY begins unwrapping the package. \nSYDNEY Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a formality. \nLEO'S SECRETARY (exited) It's from him. \nLEO Of course it's from him. \nSYDNEY So he had some staff flunky send me a fruit basket. \nLEO'S SECRETARY He wrote the note himself. \nSYDNEY I'm sure he didn't take the time to-- \nLEO'S SECRETARY The messenger said he was waiting in the Oval Office for ten minutes while the President wrote the card. \nSYDNEY Okay, listen, so he-- (to LEO'S SECRETARY) --it took him ten minutes to write a card?! \nLEO'S SECRETARY Apparently he went through several drafts. \nSYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is. \nLEO What is it...what is it? \nSYDNEY A ham. \nLEO (beat) A ham? \nSYDNEY He sent me a Virginia ham. \nLEO'S SECRETARY Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the President's girlfriend. \nSYDNEY's smile fades away...she looks at LEO. \nLEO There's never an egg timer around when you need one. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nSHEPHERD is conferring with LEWIS and ROBIN. \nROBIN Sir, they're gonna be pressing today about whether the White House is prepared to soften the assault weapons section of the crime bill. \nLEWIS There is no need to entertain that at this point. \nROBIN How do you want me to handle the Sydney issue? \nSHEPHERD The Sydney issue? \nLEWIS We should have a consensus on how the White House is going to handle it. \nSHEPHERD I sure hope the Sydney issue refers in some way to a problem we're having with Australia, because if it's anything else... \nJANIE pokes her head in. \nJANIE Mr. President, Ms. Wade is here to see you. \nSHEPHERD Tell her she can come right in. I'm finished here. \nJANIE Yes, sir. \nSHEPHERD (to LEWIS and ROBIN) There is no Sydney issue. \nSYDNEY enters, crossing paths with LEWIS and ROBIN. They exchange pleasantries. \nSYDNEY (to SHEPHERD) Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. \nSHEPHERD No problem. Did you get the ham? \nSYDNEY I got the ham, yes. Thank you very much. \nSHEPHERD I wanted to send you flowers, but there seem to be some kinks in the system. I'm really glad you stopped by. I had such a good time last night. \nSYDNEY So did I. It's just that... \nJANIE enters. \nJANIE They're 45 seconds away, sir. \nDuring the following, JANIE will go to the desk, pick up two briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up his things -- all without interrupting the conversation a beat. \nSHEPHERD I'm delivering a luncheon speech at the Governor's Conference this morning. I'm sorry to-- \nSYDNEY C-STAD? \nLUCY Yeah. \nSYDNEY Capricorn Surface To Air Defense. \nLUCY Right. \nSHEPHERD enters. \nSHEPHERD Let meat loaf night begin. \nSYDNEY Everything all right with your teeth? \nSHEPHERD My teeth? \nSYDNEY The dentist. \nSHEPHERD Oh, right. I've got a cavity in my upper bicuspid region. \nSYDNEY You've got a short-range weapons system outside Tel Aviv. \nSHEPHERD (to LUCY) You turned on me. \nLUCY Can we eat? \nCUT TO: \nINT. A POSE HOUSE IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT \nTwo dozen limos and town cars line this suburban Maryland street, their drivers waiting patiently. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE HOUSE IN CHEVY CHASE - NIGHT \nA cocktail party is underway. This is a fat cat fundraiser for the Republicans. \nRUMSON (V.O.) You're over-thinking this. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThe look and feel of old money. Rumson is holding court with a half-dozen political insiders. Some smoke cigars; others sip their drinks. \nRUMSON (continuing) Voters aren't interested in how to achieve economic growth, and they don't want to hear our plans to strengthen foreign policy. \nSTAFFER #1 So it comes down to character. \nSTAFFER #2 The press like him, Senator. The networks, the newspapers, they're-- \nRUMSON Reporters like him. Networks and newspapers like ratings and circulation. For all the bitching we do about liberal bias in the press when it comes down to a character debate... \nSTAFFER #3 The press is an unwitting accomplice. \nCARL Bob, the character debate didn't work out for us. \nRUMSON Because it couldn't. Our polling told us that attacking his character less than a year after he'd lost his wife was gonna be a turn-off and was gonna make people feel sorry for him. We couldn't run the campaign we wanted because the opponent was a widower. \nCARL He's still a widower. Time's passed, but-- \nRUMSON (to the rest) You'll have to forgive my friend. He's been on a hunting trip and cut off from the world. \nCARL What's going on? \nAnd four STAFFERS grab whatever newspaper is closest to their hand and toss them to CARL. \nRUMSON The President's got a girlfriend. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRIVATE OFFICE/THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT \nLUCY, SHEPHERD and SYDNEY are finishing up a game of Scrabble. \nSYDNEY (to LUCY) Your dad says you're studying the Constitutional Convention. \nSHEPHERD She's not having any fun, though. \nLUCY Dad-- \nSYDNEY You're not having fun? \nLUCY (to herself) This is a nightmare. This is a social studies nightmare. \nSHEPHERD They're doing a mock Congress. Each kid is playing one of the original delegates, and they debate the Amendments. Now what's not fun about that? \nLUCY gets up from the table and kisses her father. \nLUCY G'night, Dad. \nSHEPHERD G'night, sweetheart. \nLUCY It was nice meeting you, Mrs.-- \nSYDNEY Sydney. \nLUCY It was nice meeting you, Sydney. \nSYDNEY Thank you. It was nice meeting you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD, A.J., the SECRETARY OF STATE, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, and about a dozen or so Pentagon, Security Council, and Joint Chiefs OFFICIALS are doing exactly what they're trained for. \nCHAIRMAN (continuing) ...The F-18's are fired up on the Kimitz and the Kitty Hawk. They're just waiting for your attack order, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD And we're gonna hit Libyan Intelligence Headquarters? \nMAN The N.S.A. confirmed they're the ones who planned the bombing. \nA.J. What's the estimate? \nGENERAL We'll level the building. \nSHEPHERD Libyan I.H.Q's in the middle of downtown Tripoli -- are we gonna hit anything else? \nGENERAL Only if we miss. \nSHEPHERD Are we gonna miss? \nGENERAL No, sir. \nSHEPHERD How many people work in that building? \nCHAIRMAN We've been all through-- \nSHEPHERD How many people work in the damn building? \nDEPUTY I've got those number here. There are three shifts, so it-- \nSHEPHERD The fewest. What shift puts the fewest people in the building? The night shift, right? \nDEPUTY By far. Mostly custodial staff and a few-- \nSHEPHERD What time does the night crew go on? \nDEPUTY They're on now, sir. \nSHEPHERD A.J.? \nA.J. It's immediate, it's decisive, it's low risk, and it's a proportional response. \nSHEPHERD Someday somebody's going to have to explain to me the virtue of a proportional response. \nThere's a SILENCE. SHEPHERD gets up and starts to head out the door. \nCHAIRMAN Mr. President? \nSHEPHERD Attack. CUT TO: \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD is with A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, KODAK and a couple of AIDES, all of whom look as though they've been called out of their homes in the middle of the night. \nA.J. Robin, as soon as our planes have cleared Libyan airspace, you can call the press. I don't know when we'll have the full B.D.A.-- \nLEWIS General Rork says around O-Eight Hundred. \nROBIN Sir, what do you think about a national address? \nSHEPHERD The last thing I want to do is put the Lybians center stage. \nKODAK I think it's a great idea, sir. You know Rumson's gonna be talking about your lack of military service. \nSHEPHERD This isn't about Rumson. What I did tonight was not about political gain. \nKODAK But it can be, sir. What you did tonight was very presidential. \nSHEPHERD Leon, somewhere in Libyan right now there's a janitor working the night shift at the Libyan Intelligence Headquarters. He's going about his job 'cause he has no idea that in about an hour he's gonna die in a massive explosion. He's just going about his job 'cause he has no idea that an hour ago I gave an order to have him killed. You just saw me do the least presidential thing I do. \nKODAK yes, sir. \nPRESS (V.O.) Mr. President...Mr. President! \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY \nSHEPHERD is at the podium taking questions. He's flanked by his PENTAGON STAFF. A.J. and LEWIS stand to the side. ROBIN stands out of the way. \nSALLY Is there anything at all about the C-STAD weapons system that could have been mistaken by Libyan Intelligence as offensive rather than defensive? \nSHEPHERD No. We did everything but show them the blueprints. The hardware was sitting in a airplane hangar for a month. They didn't hit it until the \nAmerican personnel got there. Leslie. \nLESLIE Sir, there's an unconfirmed report that you were with Sydney Wade when you learned of the attack. Can you comment? \nA.J. (sotto to ROBIN) Get him off. \nSHEPHERD Yes, we'd just finished dinner. \nROBIN Last question. \nMARK Sir, would you care to comment on the status of your relationship? \nSHEPHERD We don't have a relationship. We just had dinner. \nCAROL Can you tell us if she spent the night at the White House or did-- \nSYDNEY \nAll right. But I'm gonna end it on the phone. I'm not gonna go over there. CUT TO: \nINT. SHEPHERD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD opens his door, revealing SYDNEY. Agent COOPER is letting her in. \nSYDNEY I just came over here to tell you why I can't see you anymore. \nSHEPHERD (to COOPER) Thanks, Coop. \nSHEPHERD closes the door. \nSYDNEY Look, I know you've had a tough day. \nSHEPHERD Not as tough as some. You want a drink? Lemme take your coat. \nBut SYDNEY doesn't take her coat off. \nSYDNEY Mr. President, this isn't gonna work. \nSHEPHERD Sure it will. You button the top button, and it doesn't fall off the hanger. \nSYDNEY That's not what I... \nSHEPHERD I didn't think so. Listen... \nSYDNEY I've really enjoyed the time we've spent together, but this has catastrophe written all over it. Please, Mr. President, don't pursue me outside the political arena. \nSHEPHERD Well, I have no intention of pursuing you inside the political arena, so that leaves everything out, and that's unacceptable to me. \nSYDNEY If I were on your staff, I would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the Western world. \nSHEPHERD Let's clear up a couple of things. Number 1: I seldom prance. Number 2: I have no intention of engaging in a character debate, and Number 3: You're not on my staff. \nSYDNEY Yes, of course, but if you'll follow the immutable-- \nSHEPHERD Why is that, by the way? \nSYDNEY Why's that? \nSHEPHERD Why aren't you on my staff? \nSYDNEY You can't afford me. \nSHEPHERD How much do you make? \nSYDNEY More than you do, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD The name's Andy. How much money do you make? \nSYDNEY What the hell does it matter how much money I-- \nSHEPHERD You would raise your voice to the President? \nSYDNEY I'm only thinking about the health of your Presidency. You think this morning's press conference was the end of it? Bob Rumson's gotta be drooling over this. \nSHEPHERD Are you attracted to me? \nSYDNEY I beg your pardon? \nSHEPHERD I asked if-- \nSYDNEY (of course she is) That's not the issue-- \nSHEPHERD Well, I tell you what. Let's make it the issue. Let's try something new, 'cause I know that most couples, when they're first getting together, are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool. \nSYDNEY You're not most people. \nSHEPHERD You know what your problem is? \nSYDNEY What's my problem? \nSHEPHERD Sex and nervousness. \nSYDNEY Sex and nervousness is my problem. \nSHEPHERD Yes. Last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room, I realized that those place settings were provided by the First Ladies. And I'll bet none of those First Ladies were nervous about having sex with their President husbands. And you know why? \nSYDNEY No, but I'm sure you'll explain it to me. \nSHEPHERD I will. Because they weren't presidents when they met them. Not the case here. \nSYDNEY Ahhhhhh. \nSHEPHERD You see what I'm getting at? \nSYDNEY Yes. May I use your bathroom for a moment? \nSHEPHERD Sure. It's right through there. \nSYDNEY I want to freshen up. \nSHEPHERD As you pass through, you'll see a large closet on your left. And if you feel comfortable, hang up your coat, and when you come back I'll have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on the couch, and I will explain to you my plan. \nSYDNEY You have a plan? Don't make me wait. You're on a roll. \nSYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area. SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks. \nSHEPHERD (speaking up) Okay. You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President. It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason I know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and I know what a big step that was for you. So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down. When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen. \nROBIN enters. \nROBIN Good morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney. I came over as soon as Lewis called. \nSHEPHERD Thank God. \nROBIN I think the important thing is not to make it look like we're panicking. \nSHEPHERD See, and I think the important thing is actually not to be panicking. \nA.J. KNOCKS on the open door and walks in. \nA.J. Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning, Ms. Wade. I see everyone's getting an early start today. \nLEWIS How do we exit Sydney from the building and what do we say to the press at that point? \nROBIN We need a diversion. \nSYDNEY A diversion. \nROBIN You understand that by diversion I'm not saying we set the White House on fire. \nSHEPHERD No, please, let's do. \nLEWIS Can I state very clearly that I can't be party to anything illegal. \nA.J. Good for you, Lewis. \nLEWIS Say what you want, but it's always the guy in my job that ends up doing eighteen months in Danbury Minimum Security Prison. \nSHEPHERD Rest easy, Lewis. We're not creating a diversion. \nROBIN No diversion. \nSHEPHERD (to SYDNEY) We'll have somebody take you home. \nA.J. Esther's over in my office. She's got the station wagon outside. \nSHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned ahead. \nLEWIS Okay. Good. Now, the press statement. \nSHEPHERD (to SYDNEY) Sydney, when you leave here, you're gonna run into reporters and photographers. Your picture's gonna be taken every day, and you're gonna be asked questions every day. Answer them, don't answer them -- it's entirely up to you. The White House has no official position except to say \"no comment.\" \nROBIN No comment? \nSHEPHERD The White House doesn't comment on the President's personal life. \nLEWIS We can't just leave it at that, sir. \nSHEPHERD I tell you what, Lewis, we just did. \nLEWIS But, sir... \nA.J. (the meeting's over) Thank you, Mr. President. \nLEWIS, ROBIN and A.J. say their \"Thank you, Mr. President\"'s on the way out ... \nA.J. (continuing) Sydney. Esther'll be in my office. You take your time. \nSYDNEY Thanks, A.J. \nA.J. leaves... \nSHEPHERD I'm sorry about all this. We'll do it better next time. \nSYDNEY I'm no expert, but I thought we did it pretty good this time. \nSHEPHERD No, I mean... \nSYDNEY I know. I had a good time. \nSHEPHERD Me, too. I'll call you. I'll be in Panama, but I'll call you. \nSYDNEY I'd like that. \nSYDNEY gives him a good-bye kiss... \nSYDNEY (continuing) Bye. \nShe exits the bedroom. \nSHEPHERD All right...okay...this is good. \nCUT TO: \nA SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY/NIGHT \nAS we move through a series of quick DISSOLVES, all M.O.S., we HEAR in VOICE-OVER the sounds of American's electronic media -- network news, news magazines, gossip shows, talk radio, political round tables, etc. -- dissecting the \"Girlfriend Factor.\" \nINT. FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY \nSYDNEY and the TEAM are in full gear. Lisa rips off another vote on the tote board, making it \"14 Votes in 51 Days.\" \nREPORTER #1 Sydney Ellen Wade, the political strategist who accompanied President Shepherd to last week's state dinner, reportedly spent the night at the White House as a guest of-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CRIME BILL WAR ROOM - DAY \nThe tote board reads \"8 Votes in 45 Days.\" KODAK is pointing to a spot on an electoral map to emphasize a point to a young INTERN. \nSYDNEY wads up some paper and flings it at David to shut him up. \nSYDNEY (into phone) Harry, think like a father for a second. Wouldn't you like your kids to be able to take a deep breath when they're 30? Thank you. You're doing the right thing. \nShe hangs up. \nSYDNEY (continuing; announcing) Tote board's heavy. \nThe room CHEERS, knows what this means. DAVID rips off the 11, revealing 10. \nDAVID How's this? \nSYDNEY That's better! \nEveryone gets back to work as SYDNEY and DAVID speak among themselves. \nDAVID Hey, Syd, I saw on your schedule you're gonna meet with McSorley, McCluskey and Shane. \nSYDNEY Yeah, the Motown Three said they'd give me 30 minutes next week. \nDAVID Sydney, these are people who represent people who make cars for a living. \nSYDNEY Yeah. \nDAVID Cars, you understand, run on gasoline. \nSYDNEY Hey, I know it's a long shot, but if I can get one of them, it'll be a huge payoff in visibility. \nDAVID Well, if we're gonna try, we should do some prep work. You wanna order in? \nSYDNEY I can't work tonight. I'm having dinner at the White House. We can start early tomorrow. \nDAVID Okay. I'm having lunch at the Kremlin, so we'll have to, you know, start real early... \nSYDNEY (exciting) Good night, David. \nDAVID ...in order for me to catch the morning plane to Moscow. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE WEST WING - DUSK \nThe President's motorcade sits in its formation, engines running, waiting for its passenger. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DUSK \nJANIE and a couple of AIDES are in a familiar routine, doing their last-minute scrambling to get the President out the door so that he doesn't fall behind his usual \"45-minutes- behind-schedule\" schedule. SHEPHERD is on the phone at his desk. \nSHEPHERD (into phone) Douglas, does the N.R.A. have videotapes of you playing golf with Satan? We've already softened the assault weapons. We're leaving the SKS, the mini 14, and about 250 other types on the street. I mean, how much pull can one lobby-- \nJANIE catches SHEPHERD's eye and makes a subtle gesture to her wristwatch. \nSHEPHERD (continuing; into phone) --Yeah, look, we're gonna continue this tomorrow. I'm late for the party fund-raiser. I'll be sure and put in a good word for you, by the way. (listens) Okay. \nHe hangs up. \nJANIE You're incredibly late. \nThey head to door as A.J. enters from the other side of the office. \nA.J. Mr. President. I just got off the phone with the Federal Mediator in St. Louis. Management just walked away from the table. The baggage handlers, pilots and flight attendants are getting set to walk in 48 hours. \nSHEPHERD I studied under a Nobel-Prize-Winning economist. You know what he taught me? \nA.J. Don't have a airline strike at Christmas? \nSHEPHERD Yeah. I'm going to St. Louis. \nA.J. You can leave straight from the fund- raiser. Janie, get him outta here. \nSECRET AGENT #4 (sotto) Liberty's moving. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE WEST WING - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD is getting into the limo when LEWIS and ROBIN hurry out to catch him. \nROBIN (calling) Sir... \nJANIE He's incredibly late. \nSHEPHERD (to LEWIS and ROBIN) Hop in. We'll talk in the car. \nAs they do they're told, and the motorcade gets on its way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHEPHERD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nLEWIS We've got a small problem. \nROBIN (meant for LEWIS) It could've been a small problem. It's now at the very least a medium- sized-- \nLEWIS Robin sees it as a problem. I see it as a opportunity. \nROBIN It could've been an opportunity if we'd caught it... \nLEWIS We caught it. \nLEWIS Let the agents do a security sweep. We don't know who's in there. \nSHEPHERD You think there's a florist who's planning an assassination on the off-chance that I'd be stopping by? \nLEWIS It's possible. \nSHEPHERD hops out of the car. AGENT COOPER trails after him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - IN FRONT OF FLOWER SHOP - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD's sudden decision sets off a chain reaction of Secret Service activity to accommodate the change of plans. \nINT. CARMEN'S HOUSE OF FLOWERS - NIGHT \nA high school GIRL is behind the counter, talking to a friend on the phone. Her back is to the door when SHEPHERD walks in with a couple of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS scrambling to keep up. SHEPHERD begins surveying the various flowers that are behind the glass. \nGIRL (into phone) At the basketball game... \nSHEPHERD Excuse me-- \nGIRL No, at the game. I'm telling you, Kiki wasn't even there. \nSHEPHERD Excuse me-- \nGIRL (to Shepherd) I will be right with you. \nThe GIRL notices, and the receiver falls from her hand as she stares in disbelief. \nSHEPHERD (to the GIRL) Hey, I don't know if you're the one I talked to on the phone... Virginia, dogwood, the President ...any of it ring a-- \nAnd apparently it does, because the GIRL faints and falls to the floor. \nSHEPHERD Same girl. She remembers me. \nAGENT COOPER She'll be fine. \nRUMSON (V.O.) Yes, and I'm glad to see ol' \nAndy's got himself a girl. \nAPPLAUSE and appreciative LAUGHTER from a CROWD as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEMPHIS GRAND HYATT - NIGHT \nRUMSON is speaking to a black-tie fund-raiser for the REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ALLIANCE. \nRUMSON (continuing) Never mind she's the hired gun of an ultra-liberal political action committee. \nThe crowd's getting into it-- \nRUMSON (continuing) Never mind that the President takes the Fifth anytime a reporter has the temerity to ask a question about a woman in a position to exert enormous influence over a huge range of issues. \nA wave building-- \nRUMSON (continuing) Never mind that this woman's idea of how to unwind at the end of a tough day is by getting together with her ACLU pals and setting American flags on fire... \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/ST. LOUISE HILTON - NIGHT \nThe RUMSON FAMILY glows from a TELEVISION in the corner. LEWIS and ROBIN react to the news highlight reel of that day's screw-up. \nROBIN (to herself) No reaction from the White House. \nSHEPHERD's off in a corner, talking on the phone. The Presidential Suite has been turned into the St. Louis Oval Office for the night as STAFFERS zigzag around room service tables during the late-night preparations. \nINT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nSYDNEY (into phone) What do Lewis and Robin think? \nSHEPHERD (into phone) Brutus and Cassius? They want me to get into the character debate and mix it up. \nSYDNEY (into phone) Lewis and Robin are very smart. \nSHEPHERD (to LEWIS and ROBIN) Sydney says you guys are really stupid. \nSYDNEY (shouting through the phone) I didn't say that! \nSHEPHERD (to LEWIS and ROBIN) She's questioning your loyalty. \nLEWIS Hell, I question it all the time. \nSHEPHERD (into phone) Wait a second, here comes my favorite part. \nHe's referring to RUMSON on the TV. \nRUMSON (V.O.) My name is Bob Rumson, and I'm running for President. \nSHEPHERD (into phone) It's a good thing he cleared that up, 'cause the crowd was gettin' ready to buy some AMWAY products. \nSYDNEY (into phone) His number are climbing. \nSHEPHERD (into phone) Sydney, his number have nowhere to go but up. \nSYDNEY (into phone) What about yours? \nSHEPHERD (into phone) We're fine. We'll be back up in the 60's once I get the votes for the crime bill. (beat; into phone) Say, what're you doing this weekend? \nEXT. SOUTH LAWN - NIGHT \nThe official White House Christmas Tree is glimmering for the TOURISTS. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT \nAn informal Christmas party is underway with maybe 20 GUESTS, some of them familiar faces. \nSHEPHERD and a GREEN-BLAZERED MAN \nGREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL) Mr. President, militant women are out to destroy college football in this country. \nSHEPHERD Is that a fact? \nGREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL) Have you been following this situation down in Atlanta? These women want parity for girls' softball, field hockey, volleyball... \nSHEPHERD If I'm not mistaken, Gill, I think the courts ruled on Title 9 about 20 years ago. \nGREEN BLAZERED MAN (GILL) Yes sir, but now I'm saying these women want that law enforced. \nSHEPHERD Well, it's a world gone mad, Gill. \nLEWIS, KODAK and ROBIN stand huddled with cups of eggnog... \nKODAK The country has mood swings. \nLEWIS Mood swings? Nineteen post-graduate degrees in mathematics and you explain going from a 63 to a 46 percent approval rating in 5 weeks on mood swings? \nKODAK Well, I could explain it better, but I'd need charts and graphs and an easel. \nROBIN Fellas, we haven't slept in three years. Can't we forget work for one night and take this moment to enjoy each other as friends? It's Christmas. \nLEWIS (pause) It's Christmas? \nKODAK Yeah, you didn't get the memo? \nAT THE BUFFET TABLE \nKID #1 'Cause your father's President, does he automatically get to be on money? \nLUCY I honestly don't know. \nKID #2 I think only if he's a really good President. \nA.J. spots SYDNEY as she walks through the doorway and comes over to her. She seems a bit agitated. \nA.J. Hey, Sydney, Merry Christmas. \nSYDNEY Merry Christmas, A.J. \nA.J. Where you been? \nSYDNEY I got stuck on DePont Circle. I can never remember which lane I'm supposed to take. Then I got cut off by this idiot cab driver who starts screaming at me like it's my fault. \nA.J. Syd, relax. It's Christmas. \nSHEPHERD joins them. \nSHEPHERD Hi, Syd. Get stuck on DuPont Circle again? \nSYDNEY It's not funny. I hate that place. Can't you declare it a Federal Disaster Area or something? \nSHEPHERD I'll look into it. \nA.J. What were you doing up on the Hill, anyway? \nSYDNEY Ahhh...I had a terrible meeting today. Totally lost my cool with McSorley, McCluskey and Shane. \nSHEPHERD You went to see the Motown Three? \nSYDNEY I pitched 'em the hill. \nA.J. (beat) On its merits? \nSHEPHERD The woman knows no fear. She'd lobby the Carolinas to the American Lung Association. \nSYDNEY It was a disaster. \nA.J. You're in good company. I sat with 'em a week ago. They told me there was nothing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill. \nSYDNEY Well, congratulations, fellas, you're outta the cellar. McSorley told me the only thing on the President's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill was the fossil fuel package. \nThis catches SHEPHERD and A.J. by surprise--like accidentally drawing to an inside straight. \nA.J. You're kidding, right? \nSYDNEY isn't aware she's said anything of particular consequence. \nSYDNEY No, I'm not kidding. It's funny that he used the same words. \nA.J. and SHEPHERD are trying to study the situation without giving anything away. \nA.J. Yeah... \nSHEPHERD I don't think the Pep Boys know too many words. \nSYDNEY I'm gonna get a drink and shake this off. When I come back, I'll have Christmas spirit. \nSHEPHERD (beat) Okay. \nSHEPHERD is stopped. \nA.J. Mr. President, I think we have to do it. \nSHEPHERD She is one vote away, A.J. It's important legislation that for the first time has a legitimate chance. I think she deserves every possible opportunity to-- \nLEWIS She? You meant \"it,\" didn't you, sir? You meant the \"important legislation\" deserves every opportunity. \nA.J. Lewis, shut up. \nThere's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked eyes with LEWIS. \nSHEPHERD You got something to say to me? \nLEWIS Respectfully, sir. I think we should examine the new poll for more than its value as a box score. \nSHEPHERD Examine what? They don't like that I'm going out with Sydney. \nLEWIS It's not that simple, sir. I think this poll helps bribg a murky problem into specific relief. \nSHEPHERD Whose problem we talking about, Lewis? Yours? You worried about your job? This poll isn't talking about my Presidency. This poll is talking about my life. Two hundred and sixty-four million people have decided-- \nLEWIS Mr. President, two hundred and sixty- four million people don't give a damn about your life. They give a damn about their own. \nA.J. All right, that's enough. \nLEWIS Mr. President, you've raised a daughter almost entirely on your own, and she's terrific. What does it say to you that in the last seven weeks, 59 percent of this country has begun to question your family values? \nA.J. The President doesn't answer to you, Lewis. \nLEWIS Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen, this is my president, and in this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders, it is our responsibility. But you already know that, Mr. President, because you have a deeper love of this country than any man I've ever known, and I want to know what it says to you that in the past seven weeks 59 percent of Americans have begun to question your patriotism? \nSHEPHERD Look, if people want to listen to Bob Rumson-- \nLEWIS They don't have a choice! Rob Rumson's the only one doing the talking. People want leadership. And in the absence of genuine leadership, they will listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone. They want leadership, Mr. President. They're so thirsty for it, they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand. \nSHEPHERD (evenly) Lewis, we've had Presidents who were beloved, who couldn't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight. People don't drink the sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis. They drink it 'cause they don't know the difference. \nThe room is slightly stunned by what their President has just said. \nSHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door... \nSHEPHERD (continuing; on his way out) Make the deal. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE FOSSIL FUEL WAR ROOM - DAY \nSYDNEY, SUSAN, DAVID, INTERNS and STAFFERS are having a little office celebration. Champagne flows from paper cups. Streamers and balloons adorn the tote board, which reads 0 Votes in 1 Day. \nSUSAN, maybe a little drunk, has concerned SYDNEY. \nSUSAN I want to go on the record and apologize for my attitude toward you since your arrival. \nSYDNEY I didn't notice. Was there an attitude? \nA PHONE RINGS, and one of the staffers takes it. SYDNEY tries to rejoin the party, but-- \nSUSAN I think I have a lot of pent-up hostility. \nSYDNEY Well-- \nSUSAN I wonder who I can blame it on. \nSYDNEY I'm not really qualified to-- \nSUSAN 'Cause I've been blaming it on my mother and my ex-husband, and that hasn't been working. \nDAVID (approaching SYDNEY) Leo needs to see you. \nSYDNEY Tell him to get over here. It's a party. \nDAVID He needs to see you in his office. \nSYDNEY It can't wait? \nDAVID He just got off the phone with MacInerney. There's been a development. \nSYDNEY holds for a moment...then heads out the door and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - LATE AFTERNOON \nTROMBONE MUSIC comes from LUCY's bedroom as SHEPHERD rounds the corner. \nINT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - LATER AFTERNOON \nSHEPHERD pops his head in. \nSHEPHERD Sounds good. \nLUCY It's progressive. \nSHEPHERD I'll say. \nLUCY Hey, Dad, what's wrong with Sydney? You guys have a fight? \nSHEPHERD (beat) What do you mean? \nLUCY She seemed pretty-- \nSHEPHERD Good. 14 in the side. \nSHEPHERD gets down over the ball... \nSMACK!!! \n...but instead of the cue hitting the ball, it's A.J.'s palms slamming the cue against the table. \nA.J. But I sure as hell will if you don't start gettin' your head outta your ass. \nSHEPHERD Excuse me. \nA.J. Lewis is right. Go after this guy. \nSHEPHERD Has he lied?! \nA.J. What? \nSHEPHERD Has Rumson lied in the last seven weeks? \nA.J. Has he lied? \nSHEPHERD Other than not knowing the difference between Harvard and Stanford, has he said something that isn't true? Am I not a Commander-in-Chief who's never served in the military? Am I not opposed to a Constitutional amendment banning flag burning? Am I not an unmarried father who was sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist down the hall from my twelve-year-old daughter? \nA.J. And you think you're wrong? \nSHEPHERD I don't think you win elections by telling 59 percent of the people that they are. \nA.J. We fight the fights we can win. \nSHEPHERD Don't-- \nA.J. You fight the fights that need fighting! \nSHEPHERD Is the view pretty good from the cheap seats, A.J.? \nA.J. I beg your pardon. \nSHEPHERD It occurs to me that in 25 years I've never seen your name on a ballot. Why have you always been standing a pace behind me? \nA.J. Because if I hadn't been, you'd be the most popular history professor at the University of Wisconsin. \nSHEPHERD Fuck you. \nSHEPHERD's tossed his cue stick and is heading out... \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Have Lewis put the final drafts of the State of the Union and the Crime Bill announcement on my desk in the morning. \nA.J. Yes, sir. \nSHEPHERD gets to the doorway...stops...turns around... \nSHEPHERD If Mary hadn't died...would we have won three years ago? \nA.J. Would we have won? \nSHEPHERD If we'd had to go through a character debate three years ago, would we have won? \nA.J. I don't know. But I would've liked that campaign. If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up, I would have liked that campaign. \nSHEPHERD looks away...nods absently... \nSHEPHERD (pause) Yeah. \nSHEPHERD exits, leaving A.J. alone as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nA series of shots showing SHEPHERD walking down the corridor to the dish room, then walking down a long corridor which contains a series of paintings of various presidents. Then sitting alone in the Oval Office, lost in thought... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RESIDENCE DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nSHEPHERD and LUCY are eating breakfast in silence, neither of them very happy, each with their own problems. A nearby T.V. MONITOR glows with the live coverage of ROBIN's morning press briefing. \nFinally... \nSHEPHERD You're not hungry? \nLUCY This is oatmeal. \nSHEPHERD Yeah. \nLUCY We never have oatmeal. \nSHEPHERD It's good for you. \nLUCY I'm from Wisconsin. I need food. \nSHEPHERD You're not from Wisconsin. I'm from Wisconsin. You've lived in Washington your whole life. \nHe glances toward the T.V. screen. ROBIN's standing up there doing what she's been told: \"No comment...No, this President is not participating in character debates...\" He mutes the volume. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) How are you doing in your Constitutional debates? \nLUCY We're done. \nSHEPHERD You're done? \nANGLE - ROBIN \nwho's picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in four numbers. \nShe turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the rest of the room. \nROBIN (into phone) Lewis...call A.J. and come on down here...I don't know, but something's happening. \nSHEPHERD ...and although I have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me, I've been here three years and three days, and I can tell you without hesitation: Being President of this country is entirely about character. \nLEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) For the record: Yes, I am a card- carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But the more important question is why aren't you, Bob? This is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights, so it naturally begs the questions. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Why would a senator, his party's most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president, choose to reject upholding the Constitution? If you can answer that question, then, folks, you're smarter than I am, because I didn't understand it until a couple of minutes ago. Everybody knows American isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say, \"You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating, at the top of his lungs, that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free, then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest.\" Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free. I've known Bob Rumson for years. I've been operating under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didn't get it. Well, I was wrong. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it. Bob's problem is that he can't sell it. Nobody has ever won an election by talking about what I was just talking about. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) This is a country made up of people with hard jobs that they're terrified of losing. The roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment. We are a nation afraid to go out at night. We're a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated. We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious men to solve them. And whatever your particular problem is, friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character. Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend. You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob. She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) You want a character debate? Fine, but you better stick with me, 'cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league. I've loved two women in my life. I lost one to cancer, and I lost the other 'cause I was so busy keeping my job I forgot to do my job. Well that ends right now. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration. It's White House Resolution 455, an energy bill requiring a 20 percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years. It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming. The other piece of legislation is the crime bill. As of today it no longer exists. I'm throwing it out. I'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense. You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns. I consider them a threat to national security, and I will go door to door if I have to, but I'm gonna convince Americans that I'm right, and I'm gonna get the guns. We've got serous problems, and we need serious men, and if you want to talk about character, Bob, you'd better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card. If you want to talk about character and American values, fine. Just tell me where and when, and I'll show up. This is a time for serious men, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up. My name's Andrew Shepherd, and I am the President. \nSHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his wake. \nThe MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium. \nROBIN Any questions? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY \nA.J. and LEWIS are following after the President. \nA.J. Well, you don't see that every day of the week. \nLEWIS He's got the whole White House Press Corps asking each other how to spell \"erudite.\" \nA.J. Lewis, call the printer. \nLEWIS I know. Gotta rewrite the State of the Union. \nA.J. Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new ball game. You've got 35 minutes. \nLEWIS Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed. \nLEWIS goes off in one direction. A.J. heads towards the Oval Office. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nSHEPHERD is on the phone. \nSHEPHERD I don't want the limo. I don't want an escort. \nA.J. enters. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) I want a plain, ordinary, non- bullet-proof automobile. Someone around here must have a Chevy I can borrow. Well, find one and meet me outside the West Wing entrance in five minutes. \nA.J. Where are you going? \nSHEPHERD I'm going to her house. I'm gonna stand at her front door till she lets me in. And I'm not leaving till I get her back. \nA.J. How're you gonna do that? \nSHEPHERD I haven't worked that out yet. But I'm sure groveling will be involved. \nA.J. You're just gonna drive over? \nSHEPHERD I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful army in the world. You don't think I can drive ten blocks? \nSYDNEY Just stay away from DuPont Circle. I hear it's murder this time of day. \nSHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing in the doorway, but of course he does anyway. \nSYDNEY Hi, A.J. \nA.J. It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If anybody needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen. \nA.J. exits. \nSYDNEY I heard your speech. I was in my car, and it just kind of steered its way over here. \nSHEPHERD I'm glad. \nSYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and smile. SYDNEY starts toward him. \nSHEPHERD (continuing) Sydney, I didn't decide to send 455 to the floor to get you back. \nSYDNEY I didn't come back 'cause you decided to send 455 to the floor. \nThey move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because... \nLEWIS (entering) Mr. President, I thought you might want to look at this. I moved Social Security up front. Hello, Sydney. \nJANIE enters-- \n", "test1_input": "SHEPHERD The GDC meeting. Right. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A.J.'s OFFICE - DAY \nA.J. Your concerns are not falling on deaf ears. The environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the White House than President Shepherd. \nSYDNEY Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J. \nSUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable-- \nSUSAN Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney alone now. He's already given us more time than-- \nSYDNEY Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's not yet done what he needs to do today. \nSUSAN Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the deep end of the pool on her first day. She hasn't even had a chance to read the report of the Quebec Conference. \nSYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes, check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides, instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck. \nSYDNEY You're right. I haven't read it. If someone had asked me yesterday, I'd have told them the Quebec Conference was made up of six professional hockey teams. But what I do know is that it's time for the President to run for president again. Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and I'm certain he's told the President exactly what I'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration... \nSUSAN (to SYDNEY) It's really time to-- \nSYDNEY Susan, I promise you, the White House Chief of Staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news. \nNo one in the room really understands what's going on... except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire SYDNEY but, of course, can't. \nA.J. (pause) I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although not about Michigan and California. The President has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent. \nThere's an uncomfortable silence in the room... \nA.J. (continuing) The President is willing to go it alone on this, but he's asking for, and frankly he's expecting, the full support of the GDC. \nSYDNEY The President's expecting our full support? \nA.J. Yes, he is. \nSYDNEY The President's dreamin', A.J. \nSUSAN Sydney! \nSYDNEY --the President has critically misjudged reality. If he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because he's a nice guy and he's done better than his predecessors, then your boss is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland. \nVOICE (O.S.) Let's take him out back and beat the shit out of him. \nSYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in person, The President of the United States. \nShe is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on her head right now. \nA.J. Good morning, Mr. President. How are you today? \nSHEPHERD Couldn't be better. (to the GROUP) I apologize for the interruption, but A.J. asked me to stop and say hello. You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by any chance, would you? \nSYDNEY Mr. President, I'm...don't know what to say. I'm speechless. \nSHEPHERD All evidence to the contrary. \nSUSAN Mr. President, we haven't met. My name is Susan Sloan. I used to work with Congressman Myers. I hope this episode in no way-- \nSHEPHERD Sydney? \nSYDNEY Yes, sir? \nSHEPHERD You got a second? \nSYDNEY (quietly) Of course. \nSYDNEY gets up to leave. SHEPHERD escorts her out of A.J.'s office and into the hallway. \nSHEPHERD I thought maybe we might have a word in private. Someplace a little less intimidating. (calling) Janie? \nJANIE Yes, sir. \nSHEPHERD (to SYDNEY) This is my personal assistant, Janie Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms. Wade into the rec room. I'll be there in a second. \nSHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall. SYDNEY continues down the hallway. \nJANIE (to SYDNEY) This way... \nJANIE leads SYDNEY into... \nINT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY \n...where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably, not knowing whether to sit or stand. Waiting. Trying -- the way a jumper on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to notice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of the United States, the bust of Lincoln... \nSHEPHERD strides in-- \nSHEPHERD Sorry to keep you waiting. \nSYDNEY Mr. President-- \nSHEPHERD Is it okay if I call you Sydney? \nSYDNEY Of course. Mr. President-- \nSHEPHERD Have you ever been in the Oval Office? \nSYDNEY I've just been on the regular tour. It didn't include... \nSHEPHERD I hear it's pretty good. \n", "test1_true": "SHEPHERD Are you under the impression that I'm mad at you? \nSYDNEY (pause) Well... \nSHEPHERD Sydney, seldom does a day go by that I'm not burned in effigy. \nSYDNEY Not by a professional political operative standing 30 feet from the Oval Office. \nSHEPHERD No, I'll give you that. \nSYDNEY Mr. President-- \nSHEPHERD Did you know that when the City Planners sat down to design Washington, D.C., their intention was to build a city that would intimidate and humble foreign heads of state? It's true. \nSYDNEY I didn't know that. \nSHEPHERD The White House has the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world. \nSYDNEY Learned that one the hard way. \nSHEPHERD Sydney, this bill is important to me. \nSYDNEY Yes, sir, I'll convey your message. \nSHEPHERD But you don't believe me? \nSYDNEY The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir. \nSHEPHERD It's not gonna pass at 20 percent. It's a long shot at 10. \nSYDNEY How do you know that until you put the full weight of the White House behind-- \nSHEPHERD Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes shy in the House. It can't be done. But I tell you what. I'll make you a deal with you. If you can get 24 votes, I'll get you the last 10. \nSYDNEY Twenty-four votes? \nSHEPHERD If you can swing 24 votes by the State of the Union, I'll promise you full White House support. \nSYDNEY Do I have your word on that, sir? \nSHEPHERD Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry? I skipped breakfast. You wanna have some coffee? A donut or something? \nSYDNEY Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my surroundings, and yes, I've gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning, but don't let that diminish the weight of my message: The GDC has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity, the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war. The best scientists in the world have given you every reason to take the GDC seriously. But I'm gonna give you one more. If you don't live up to the deal you just made, come New Hampshire, we're gonna go shopping for a new candidate. \nSYDNEY heads for the door-- \nSHEPHERD You can't do that, Sydney. \nSYDNEY With all due respect, Mr. President, who's gonna stop me? \nSHEPHERD Well, if you go through that door, the United States Secret Service. That's my private office. (pointing) You need to go out that way. \nSYDNEY (beat) Ah. \nSYDNEY, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the Oval Office. SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT \nSHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor residence. His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is something he does almost as well as being President. A.J. stands to the side with his pool cue. \nA.J. McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know we're making our move on the crime bill. They're circling the wagons on the assault weapons. \nSHEPHERD Should I meet with them? \nA.J. Let Lewis take a pass at them first. \nSHEPHERD Fine. 2 in the side. \nSHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket. \nA.J. Nice shot, Mr. President. \nSHEPHERD Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't call me by my name when we're playing pool. \nA.J. assesses the table. \nA.J. I will not do it playing pool, I will not do it in a school, I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am. \nSHEPHERD At ease, A.J., and get away from the pocket. 9 in the corner. \nSHEPHERD makes the shot. \nA.J. Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was thrilled with the deal you made this morning. \nSHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it there was something he was supposed to tell A.J. \nSHEPHERD I forgot to tell you. \nA.J. It's a waste of time. \nSHEPHERD Not our time. GDC makes a big push for the votes, and when they come up short, we move in with the softer bill, to get passed, we're everybody's hero. 3 in the side. \nA.J. Also, Sydney Wade called. \nSHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile. \nSHEPHERD Sydney Wade? \nA.J.

(beat) Sydney Wade? \nSHEPHERD When she called. \nA.J. Did she say anything about you? 13 in the corner. \nSHEPHERD No, it's just that we had a nice couple of minutes together. She threatened me and I patronized her and we didn't have anything to eat, but I thought there was a connection. \nA.J. is staring at him in disbelief. \nSHEPHERD She didn't say anything about me? \nA.J. (quietly) Well, no, but I could pass her a note before study hall and-- \nSHEPHERD Tell me this: Hypothetically, what would happen-- \nA.J. I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in the corner. \nHe misses the shot. \nSHEPHERD --if I called Sydney and asked her to be my date at the State Dinner Thursday night? \nA.J. You're not serious. \nSHEPHERD Don't I sound serious? \nA.J. The President can't just go out on a date. \nSHEPHERD Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did. \nA.J. You're not-- \nSHEPHERD Wilson was widowed during his first term. He meets a woman named Edith Gault. He dated her, courted her, married her, and somewhere in there managed to form the League of Nations. \nA.J. Mr. President, this is an election year. If you're looking for female companionship, we can make arrangements that'll insure total privacy and-- \nSHEPHERD I don't want you to get me a girl, A.J. What is this, Vegas? \nA.J. No, sir, this is the White House. \nSHEPHERD And I'm talking about something that in no way is at conflict with my oath of office. I'm a single adult, and I met a woman that I'd like to see again socially. How's that different from what Wilson did? \nA.J. The difference is he didn't have to be the president on television. You've said it a million times: If there were a television set in every living room 60 years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair. \nSHEPHERD What are you saying? \nA.J. We'll take a hit. \nSHEPHERD How big? \nA.J. I don't know. Five points. Maybe more. \nSHEPHERD Five points we're standing here talking about?! \nA.J. It could be more. \nSHEPHERD I drop five points when Wisconsin doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl. 5 in the corner. \nA.J. Do you want me to have Kodak put together some numbers so we know what we're talking about? \nSHEPHERD Yeah. (beat) No. No. I don't want to check a polling sample to see if this is okay, like I'm asking permission to stay out an hour past curfew. This isn't the business of the American people. \nA.J. Mr. President, the American people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business. \nSHEPHERD I like her, A.J. (pause) Stop being my chief of staff for one minute. \nA.J. (beat) Give her a call. \nSHEPHERD (calling out) Janie! (to A.J.) She didn't say anything about me? \nA.J. She said you're taller than she thought you'd be. \nSHEPHERD That's something. \nJANIE enters-- \nJANIE Yes, sir? \nSHEPHERD I need you to track down a phone number. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as evidence that SYDNEY's staying with her sister BETH temporarily. \nBETH, still in hospital scrubs from a 12-hour shift, opens a bottle of wine while SYDNEY, in a bathrobe and wet hair, tries to get off the phone. \nSYDNEY (into phone) Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny. I acted like a college freshman at a protest rally. \nBETH Tell him the part about walking out the wrong door. \nSYDNEY Oh God, I forgot about that.

I regrouped, you gotta gimme that. I pulled it together at the end. I stood in the middle of the Oval Office and I made it very clear that from now on, he who doesn't take the GDC seriously does so at his peril! \nBETH And then you walked out the wrong door. \nSYDNEY Are you gonna be throwing that back at me the rest of my life? \nBETH That's my current plan, yes. \nThe TELEPHONE RINGS... \nSYDNEY That's gonna be Leo Solomon. He said he'd call at nine. \nSYDNEY picks up the phone-- \nSYDNEY (continuing; into phone) Hello? \nSHEPHERD Uh, hi, is this Sydney? \nSYDNEY doesn't recognize the voice-- \nSYDNEY (into phone) Leo? \nPHONE VOICE No, this is Andrew Shepherd. \nSYDNEY looks at BETH and rolls her eyes, then explains to her-- \nSYDNEY Andrew Shepherd.

Well, I'm so glad you called, because I forgot to tell you today what a nice ass you have. I'm also impressed that you were able to get my phone number, considering I don't have a phone.

The agent who checked the food thought it was delicious, and I sort of told him I'd bring him some if there was any left. \nSYDNEY So you didn't like it. \nSHEPHERD No, I loved it. \nSYDNEY You're lying. \nSHEPHERD No, I'm not. \nSYDNEY You are. I can tell when you're holding something back. You do a thing with your face. \nSYDNEY pops a bottle of port and pours two glasses. \nSHEPHERD When have you seen me do a thing with my face? \nSYDNEY Two days before I met you. You gave a speech for the Daughters of the American Revolution. I was there. \nSHEPHERD You were? \nSYDNEY You remember the speech? \nSHEPHERD Vaguely. \nSYDNEY \"American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society.\" \nSHEPHERD Ah. \nSYDNEY There was supposed to be something else after that, wasn't there? \nSHEPHERD How did you know? \nSYDNEY I told you.

LEWIS is losing it on the phone. \nLEWIS (continuing; listens) But you're not gonna stay at 41. The numbers are gonna be go back up. (listens) But they're gonna go back up. (listens) George... (listens) Congressman... (listens) Congressman Jarrett... (listens) George, it's crunch time. It's personal. This is one of those moments. It's just you and the President. Now that's it gonna be? \nLEWIS looks over at ROBIN and KODAK ...his face telling the story. \nLEWIS (continuing) Yeah. (listens) Yeah. (listens) Hey, George? Can I tell you something? We're gonna win this thing. We're gonna get the votes and we're gonna win. And after we do, I mean that very night, I'm gonna go to Sam & Harry's, I'm gonna order a big steak, and I'm gonna make a list of everybody who tried to fuck us this week. \nROBIN and KODAK are trying to get their friend from setting fire to a bridge out of pure frustration. \nROBIN (a whispered shout) Lewis! \nLEWIS (into phone) Vote your conscience, you chicken- shit, lame-ass-- \nLEWIS hangs up the phone. He takes a deep breath, slumps down in the nearest chair, and looks up at ROBIN and KODAK. \nThere's a long silence before LEWIS says-- \nLEWIS (continuing) We lost Jarrett. \nKODAK (beat) I hope so. 'Cause, you know, if that was an \"undecided,\" then we need to work on our people skills. \nLEWIS picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers. Even before that line starts ringing, he picks up another phone and punches in a different set of numbers. \nLEWIS (into the first phone) Karen, it's Lewis. Could you hunt down Congressman Quincy for me. I need to talk to him right way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY \nSHEPHERD stands in front A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK. JANIE is somewhere in the background. \nA.J. We lost Quincy, too. \nSHEPHERD Did he give a reason? \nLEWIS He thinks your numbers aren't likely to rebound. \nKODAK We're three votes down again, sir. \nThere's a pause before ... \nKODAK (continuing) Mr. President, as of this morning, Sydney only needed one more vote. The Motown Three have gotta be scared blind. I don't think there'll be a better opportunity. \nROBIN The press is expecting an announcement on the crime bill by the Sate of the Union. \nKODAK If you agree to stick 455 in a drawer until after the elections, they'll give you the three votes. \nROBIN (beat) And we declare victory, sir. \nSHEPHERD We said as a last resort. \nKODAK We're there, sir. The State of the Union is 48 hours away. \nSHEPHERD No. Come on. There's gotta be three votes someplace else. \nKODAK There isn't. \nSHEPHERD Bullshit, Leon. There's gotta be somebody we haven't-- \nKODAK There isn't, sir. \nSHEPHERD Storch. \nKODAK I beg your pardon? \nSHEPHERD What about Storch? \nA.J. Mr. President-- \nKODAK Storch is a \"no.\" \nSHEPHERD Wagner. \nKODAK No. \nSHEPHERD Sobel. \nKODAK No. \nSHEPHERD Clark. \nKODAK No. \nSHEPHERD Not that Clark, the one from Indiana. \nKODAK (pause) That one too, sir. \n", "test3_id": 2822}

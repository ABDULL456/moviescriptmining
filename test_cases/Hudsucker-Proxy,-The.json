HOLD. \nWith a STINGING CHORD we -- \nCUT TO: \nCITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958) \nLights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS. \nAfter a beat, the voice of an elderly black man: \nNARRATOR (V.O.) The's right... New York. \nWe are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING. \nWe are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers slip by left and right. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' minutes it is. Come midnight it's gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother feelin'. The New Year. The future... \nThe SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is \"Auld Lang Syne.\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to start one mo' trip 'round the sun, an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' gay... \nWe are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top is a large illuminated clock. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Yep... \nWe hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...All over town champagne corks is a-poppin'. \nA big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots is dancin' to the strains of Guy Lombardo... Down in Times Square the little folks is a-watchin' and a- waitin' fo' that big ball to drop... \nThe LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant CROWD: \"Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...They all tryin' to catch holt a one moment of time... \nThe CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name: \"HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES.\" Below it, in neon, the company's motto: \"THE FUTURE IS NOW.\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...to be able to say -- 'Right now! This is it! I got it!' 'Course by then it'll be past. (more cheerfully) But they all happy, evvybody havin' a good time. \nWe are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the clock. The window starts to open. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a few lost souls floatin' 'round out there... \nA young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge. With the opening of the window, \"AULD LANG SYNE\" filters out with greater volume. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...This one's Norville Barnes. \nThe man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on the apron: \"HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now.\" \nHe looks with nervous determination into the void. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Let's move in for a closer look. \nThe CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...That office he jes stepped out of is the office of the president of Hudsucker Industries. It's his office... \nNorville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows louder and the WIND blows in his face. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...How'd he get so high? An' why is he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna do it -- is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk? \nNorville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME. \nWe are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL THRUM becomes very loud indeed. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Well the future, that's something you can't never tell about... \nThe second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES UP: \"Nine! Eight! Seven!\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...But the past... That's another story... \nOVER BLACK \nThe HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and GRINDING GEARS as we... \nCUT TO: \nDESTINATION DISPLAY \nOn the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display says \"MUNCIE-NEW YORK.\" \nLINE OF BAGS \nis being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.: \nIt has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. \nAfter a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up. \n", "test1_true": "STREET \nFOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the street. He pauses, sets it down. \nYOUNG MAN \nFresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at: \nWESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY \nThe sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures board in a great train station, with each of its individual entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER, LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc. \nREVERSE \nOn the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads, bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a prospect they like. \nNorville stands pat, watching. \nHIS POV \nAn entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. \nNORVILLE \nHe brightens. \nBOARD \nWe PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. \nNORVILLE \nHe frowns. \nAround him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply for their respective jobs. \nWe see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE ONLY. EXECUTIVE MANAGER... MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE. BUSINESSMAN... EXPERIENCED. \nThe CROSS-CUTTING ENDS in a wash of SUPER-IMPOSITIONS PANNING OVER Norviille, now alone on the sidewalk: \nEXPERIENCED ONLY... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED... \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE \nA middle-aged, mousy-looking man in a conservative suit and wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone O.S. Behind the Executive we see only the skyline of New York City. \nEXECUTIVE -- So in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening. We're up 18 percent over last year's third quarter gross and, needless to say, that's a new record... \nTRACKING \nDOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of the table, to whom the report is being directed. \nHe is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive who drones on. \nEXECUTIVE ...The competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack. Market share in most divisions is increasing and we've opened seven new regional offices... \nThe TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end of the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning Executive. The smile is serene, almost otherwordly. \nThis is WARING HUDSUCKER. \nREPORTING EXECUTIVE \nHe drones on. \nEXECUTIVE ...Our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we're looking at some exciting things in R&D... \nThe CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the big man's attention apparently wanders; we FRAME UP ON the picture window skyline of New York. \nEXECUTIVE (V.O.) Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me about sub-franchising; we're making so much money in sub-franchising it isn't even funny. \nFOLDED-BACK WANT ADS \nA hand with pencil goes down a list of positions, ticking each one: STREETSWEEPER -- EXPERIENCED; LINOTYPE MAN -- EXPERIENCED; CANTOR (REFORM) -- EXPERIENCED; SPARRING PARTNER -- EXPERIENCED. \nWIDER \nNorville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm. \nHis hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs his coffee with his spoon. \nHe takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change, turning it inside-out. \nCLOSE ON COUNTER \nAs Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME. \nA waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter. She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle around one entry: \nTHE FUTURE IS NOW. Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries. Low pay. Long Hours. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue. \nAs we hear the COFFEESHOP DOOR OPENING O.S., a draft wafts the sheet of newspaper off the counter and OUT OF FRAME. \nNEW YORK CITY SKYLINE \nAgain LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as, O.S., the reporting Executive drones on. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...Our owned-and-operateds are performing far above expectations both here and abroad, and the Federal Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell writeoff on our plant and heavies... \nWARING HUDSUCKER \nlooks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his lips. \nEXECUTIVE ...The news in the money market isn't good -- it's excellent... \n", "test1_id": 2361, "test2_input": "He is surprised by a burst of laughter. \nREPORTER #3 'Hoopla on the hula hoop' -- can we quote you on that, Mr. Barnes? \nNORVILLE Well sure, I guess -- \nREPORTER #4 Mr. Barnes, are you thinking of giving yourself a nice fat raise? \nNORVILLE Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, guys... \nFlash bulb explosion effects a... \nCUT TO: \nNEWSREEL \nA scientist with a Van Dyke beard, wearing a laboratory smock, is facing the camera. Behind him we see other scientists studying a hoop that has been hooked up to a gyroscopic- looking device that analyzes its various movements and properties. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) What scientific principle explains the mind-bending motion of this whipping wheel of wonder? \nA title supered over the Scientist's chest identifies him as Professor Erwin Schweide. \nSCIENTIST (V.O.) Ze dinkus is kvite zimple, really. It operates on ze same principle zat keeps ze earth spinning 'round ze sun, and zat keeps you from flying off ze earth into ze coldest reaches of outer space vere you vood die like a miserable shvine! Yes, ze principle is ze same, except for ze piece of grrrit zey put in to make ze whole experience more pleasant -- \nTRACKING IN TO: \nINT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE \nThe mean laugh. Norville, behind his desk in LONG SHOT, laughing, as we begin to TRACK IN. There is something disconcerting about his laugh -- it is harder, more businesslike, colder than the dopey laugh that accompanied his elevation to the presidency. Or perhaps it is only our imagination, for while still some distance away from him: \nFlash bulb explosion effects a... \nCUT BACK TO: \nNEWS CONFERENCE \nNewsmen follow Norville as he walks through the lobby of the Hudsucker Building. \nREPORTER #1 Mr. Barnes, did the board consider you an 'idea man' when they promoted you from the mail room? \nNORVILLE Well, I guess so -- I don't think they promoted me because they thought I was a jerk. \nREPORTER #2 Mr. Barnes, what's the next big idea for you and Hudsucker Industries? \nNORVILLE Jeez, I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby doesn't just come overnight... \nREPORTER Mr. Barnes, are you -- \nNORVILLE -- Although I'll tell you one thing: I certainly didn't expect all this 'hoopla'! \nThis TIRED old joke brings some polite laughter. \nNorville is smiling as he enters the elevator. As its doors start to close, leaving Amy behind: \nNORVILLE ...And you can quote me on that! \nFlash bulb explosion effects a... \nCUT BACK TO: \nNEWSREEL \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Yes, it's hula hula everywhere! From the cocktail parties of the Park Avenue smart set... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA group of people in formal evening wear are sipping highballs and chatting as they keep hoops in motion 'round their waists. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...to sweethearts who want to be married in the 'swing' of things... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA young couple stands before the altar hula hooping. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...To our friend the Negro, in the heart of the dark continent. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPan down from elephant to two natives hula hooping as they grin into the newsreel camera. \nTRACKING IN ON: \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe mean laugh. Yes, as we draw closer, it seems clear that his laugh is colder than before. \nFlash bulb explosion effects a... \nCUT TO: \nNORVILLE \nSitting in a barber chair, face lathered up, as Reporters crowd in. \nREPORTER #1 Mr. Barnes, Mr. Barnes, Rumpus magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year, and the society pages have been linking you with high-fashion model Za-Za. Would you care to comment? \nA burning cigar emerges from the lather around Norville's face. It waggles as he talks. \nNORVILLE There's no truth to the rumors; we're just dear friends... \nHe looks to one side. \nNORVILLE ...Isn't that right, Za-Za? \nSWISH PAN TO: \n", "test2_true": "ZA-ZA (sexily) Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-oww! \nThe newsmen react. \nREPORTER #2 Ho-leeee! \nREPORTER #3 Mr. Barnes, whither Hudsucker? Whither Norville Barnes? \nREPORTER #4 How do you respond to the charges that you're out of ideas? Has Norville Barnes run dry? \nThe barber is periodically pinching Norville's nose to shave under it; as he alternately pinches and releases, Norville's voice breaks from nasal to normal and back. \nNORVILLE Not at all. Why, just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas. A larger model hula hoop for the portly. A battery option for the lazy and handicapped. A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm earning my keep. \nREPORTER #5 Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you expect to get a raise? \nNORVILLE Well, by anyone's account I've saved Hudsucker Industries; our stock is worth more than it's ever been. So, yes, I expect to be compensated for that. \nEND TRACK IN ON: \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe mean laugh. FURTHER TRACK IN ON Norville ENDS in CLOSE SHOT, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, as he finishes his hard, square-jawed, man-on-top laugh, gazing flintily INTO the CAMERA. \nNORVILLE -- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! \nPULL BACK FROM: \nWEEPING EXECUTIVE \nThe PULL BACK FROM a blubbering executive REVEALS that we are at a Board meeting. All of the Board members sit around the table except for Mussburger, who, a towel around his waist, is receiving a choppity-chop massage on a padded table from a muscular man in a bulging T-shirt. \nMUSSBURGER Pull yourself together, Addison. \nAddison snuffles. \nADDISON Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock? \nMUSSBURGER We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison -- \nADDISON I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now! \nMUSSBURGER Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap -- \nADDISON Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined! \nHe climbs up onto the board table. \nADDISON I'm getting off this merry-go-round! \nEXECUTIVE Addison! \nANOTHER EXECUTIVE Myron! \nADDISON Aaaaahhh! \nHe runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward the window and: \nThwok! \nCUT TO: \nMUSSBURGER'S OFFICE - ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE \nLOOKING IN, as Addison flattens against the f.g. glass, his face squushing, his outflung hands likewise. \nAll stare in horror for a long silent beat. \nWith the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass, Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree. \nMussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth. \nMUSSBURGER Plexiglas. Had it installed last week. \nEXECUTIVE ...Myron? \nMUSSBURGER All right, so the kid caught a wave. So right now he and his dingus are on top. Well, this too shall pass. Myrtle J. Mussburger didn't raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first sign of adversity. I say, we made this kid and we can break him. I say, the higher he climbs, the harder he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a future, and in it I see shame, dishonor, ignominy and disgrace. \nSure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin ain't over yet. \nNORVILLE'S OFFICE \nA small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs. \nA French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a stone chisel and hammer. \nA GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, reading the funny papers. \nAt length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager. \nNORVILLE Hold it!... \nThe musicians' playing dribbles away to silence. \nNORVILLE ...Nobody move, nobody breathe... \nAll sit frozen. You could hear a pin drop. \nNORVILLE ...An idea... is coming... \nEyes narrowed, he gazes off into space, squinting for his idea. \nCLOSE ON TAILOR'S KIT \nA straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops off -- \n", "test2_id": 2362, "test3_input": "EXTREME CLOSE ON FLOOR \nWhere the PIN -- PING! -- hits. \nNORVILLE Deflates. He glares at the tailor. \nNORVILLE It's gone now. \nThe musicians resume playing. Everyone else resumes work. The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces: \nFEMALE (V.O.) Miss Amy here to see you. \nNorville leans forward to hit his intercom. \nNORVILLE Is she in the book? -- \nThe door bursts open and Amy storms in. \nAMY For Pete's sake, Norville! \nNORVILLE Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie -- \nAMY Never mind about that... \nShe shakes a piece of paper at Norville. \nAMY ...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing? \nNORVILLE Well, I wouldn't call them nincom -- \nAMY They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- \nNORVILLE Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- \nAMY You mean you know about this? \nNORVILLE Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start. \nAMY Your i -- \nNORVILLE We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker -- \nAMY You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?! \nThis was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing dribbles off. They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office. \nAMY ...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me -- \nNORVILLE Now, Aim -- \nAMY Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile -- \nNORVILLE Now, Aim -- \nAMY Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after -- \nNORVILLE Now, Aim -- \nAMY Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you... \nNORVILLE Worked in a watch factory? \nThe Goon looks up from his funnies. \nGOON Huh-huh-huh! \nAMY (to the Goon) Shutup! (to Norville) Exactly! Don't you remember how you used to feel about the hoop? You told me you were gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America, regardless of race, creed or color. Finally there'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together -- even if it kept 'em apart, spacially -- you know, for kids? Your words, Norville, not mine. I used to love Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! -- when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head, but now your head is too big to be in over! \nNORVILLE Now, Amy -- \nAMY Consider this my resignation -- \nThwock -- She slaps him. \nThe bodyguard is on his feet. \nGOON Hey!! \nCrack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin. \nGOON ...Awooooo! \nAMY -- Effective immediately!! \nShe strides to the door, leaving Norville rubbing his cheek and the Goon hopping around on one leg. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE SHOT - PICTURE OF AMY \nPULL BACK SHOWS it to be her identification in her Hudsucker personnel file. \nA hand brings INTO FRAME another picture of her -- this one a newspaper clipping. She stands on a podium accepting an award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets. The caption says, \"Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives Pulitzer Prize.\" \nWIDER ANGLE \nWe are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just put them down. \nMUSSBURGER Hmmm... Thank you, Aloysius. This may be useful. \nAloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave. \nAs we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy, we: \n", "test3_true": "FADE UP TO: \nPERFECT WHITE \nAfter a beat, a woman ENTERS against the unblemished white background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing a long, diaphanous veil. She performs a flowingly sensuous dance moderne; the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo with lasciviously bending blue notes. \nAfter the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville enters, dancing after her, pursuing her. He is wearing a coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened. \nThe woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil trail sinuously around his body. \nWe hear an ECHOING voice: \nVOICE (O.S.) Buddy... Say, buddy... \nCLOSE SHOT - NORVILLE \nSitting in his desk chair, sheened with sweat, eyes closed, licking his lips. \nCLOSER NOW: \nVOICE (O.S.) Buddy... Ya busy? \nNORVILLE Huh-whuh? \nHe opens his eyes and looks stuporously about. \nBuzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator cap. \nBUZZ Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! Say, ya got a minute? \nNorville clears his throat. \nNORVILLE Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important? \nBUZZ I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on! \nHe turns an easel to face the desk. \nBUZZ ...Ya see, I don't intend to be an elevator boy forever! Take a look at this sweet baby! \nThe easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper. \nOnto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line. \nNorville gazes stupidly at the circle. \nBUZZ ...Ya get it, buddy? Incredibly convenient, isn't it? Ya see -- \nHe produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in it. \nBUZZ -- this is how it works, it's these little ridges on the side that give it its whammy! See, ya don't have to drink like this anymore -- \nHe holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical straw. \nBUZZ -- Now you can drink like this -- \nHe bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal. \nBUZZ ...I call it the Buzz-Sucker, get it, buddy? -- After me! Buzz! Why, people are just dyin' for a product like this, and the great thing is we won't have to charge an arm and a -- \nNorville, who has been stewing, finally barks: \nNORVILLE Wait a minute! \nHe grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering. \nNORVILLE ...Why, this is worthless. \nBUZZ Huh?! But, buddy -- \nNorville yanks the straw out and crumples it up. \nNORVILLE This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life! \nBUZZ Yeah, but, buddy -- \nNORVILLE Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh... \nHe pauses to belch. \nNORVILLE ...say, the hula hoop such a success. \nBUZZ But, buddy -- \nNORVILLE And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here -- \nBUZZ But, buddy, you were -- \nNORVILLE -- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves! \nBUZZ Geez, I'm sorry, buddy -- \nNORVILLE An example must be made! \nBuzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to Norville. \nBUZZ Wuddya mean, buddy? \nNORVILLE Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster! \nBuzz's jaw drops. His elastic chin strap snaps under the pressure. \nBUZZ Awwww, buddy -- \nNORVILLE And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out! \n", "test3_id": 2363}

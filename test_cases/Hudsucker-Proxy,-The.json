{"train": "THE HUDSUCKER PROXY \n\"THE HUDSUCKER PROXY\" \nWritten by \nEthan Coen, Joel Coen, and Sam Raimi \nSeptember 1992 Draft \nBLACK \nNo image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD. \nWith a STINGING CHORD we -- \nCUT TO: \nCITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958) \nLights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS. \nAfter a beat, the voice of an elderly black man: \nNARRATOR (V.O.) The's right... New York. \nWe are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING. \nWe are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers slip by left and right. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' minutes it is. Come midnight it's gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother feelin'. The New Year. The future... \nThe SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is \"Auld Lang Syne.\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to start one mo' trip 'round the sun, an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' gay... \nWe are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top is a large illuminated clock. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Yep... \nWe hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...All over town champagne corks is a-poppin'. \nA big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots is dancin' to the strains of Guy Lombardo... Down in Times Square the little folks is a-watchin' and a- waitin' fo' that big ball to drop... \nThe LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant CROWD: \"Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...They all tryin' to catch holt a one moment of time... \nThe CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name: \"HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES.\" Below it, in neon, the company's motto: \"THE FUTURE IS NOW.\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...to be able to say -- 'Right now! This is it! I got it!' 'Course by then it'll be past. (more cheerfully) But they all happy, evvybody havin' a good time. \nWe are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the clock. The window starts to open. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a few lost souls floatin' 'round out there... \nA young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge. With the opening of the window, \"AULD LANG SYNE\" filters out with greater volume. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...This one's Norville Barnes. \nThe man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on the apron: \"HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now.\" \nHe looks with nervous determination into the void. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Let's move in for a closer look. \nThe CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...That office he jes stepped out of is the office of the president of Hudsucker Industries. It's his office... \nNorville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows louder and the WIND blows in his face. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...How'd he get so high? An' why is he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna do it -- is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk? \nNorville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME. \nWe are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL THRUM becomes very loud indeed. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...Well the future, that's something you can't never tell about... \nThe second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES UP: \"Nine! Eight! Seven!\" \nNARRATOR (V.O.) ...But the past... That's another story... \nOVER BLACK \nThe HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and GRINDING GEARS as we... \nCUT TO: \nDESTINATION DISPLAY \nOn the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display says \"MUNCIE-NEW YORK.\" \nLINE OF BAGS \nis being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.: \nIt has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. \nAfter a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up. \nCUT TO: \nNORVILLE'S BACK \nHe walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his pockets. \nA sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it this way and that. \nSlap! -- It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it away. \nThe newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against Norville. \nHe peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops, noticing something. \nNEWSPAPER SCRAP \nIt is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly circled by a coffee stain. \nBACK TO NORVILLE \nHe looks up from the paper. There is purpose in his gaze. Wind whips his hair. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER \nAs the Executive drones on, O.S., Hudsucker is carefully winding his wristwatch. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...Our nominees and assigns continue to multiply and expand extending our influence regionally, nationally and globally. So, third quarter and year- to-date, we've set a new record for sales... \nHudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...new record in gross... \nHudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right amount under the suit. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...new record in pre-tax earnings... \nHudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets it in his ashtray. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...new record in after-tax profit... \nHe deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its face. \nThe sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that will end at precisely noon. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...and our stock has split twice this year... \nHudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table. \nEXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...In short... \nSavoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table. \nEXECUTIVE ...we're loaded. \nThis draws an appreciative chuckle from the board. It is cut off by: \nHUDSUCKER Ahem... \nThe board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and deliberately, and rubs his palms together. \nHe swings his chair out. \nHe steps up onto the chair. \nThe board stares. \nHe steps up from the chair onto the board table. \nThe heads of the board members swing up in unison. \nHudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint. \nEXECUTIVE ...Mr. Hudsucker? \nCLOSE ON WANT ADS \nTHE CIRCLED AD \nTHE FUTURE IS NOW. Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries. Low pay. Long Hours. NO EXPERIENCED NECESSARY. Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue. \nThe hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office building across the street. Its street number tops its imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285. \nWe continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper, to reveal a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the identification \"HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES.\"  Below the clock is the motto \"THE FUTURE IS NOW.\" \nThe huge clock's sweep second hand is just approaching the position that will make the time 12:00 sharp. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying out. \nHUDSUCKER Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh... \nSECRETARIAL AREA \nSomewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK. \nHUDSUCKER ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh... \nAs Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME (wafting papers have their motion arrested) and SUPER A TITLE. \nTRACKING \nWITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. The CLOCK TOLLS. \nADDISON A month at the most. \nMUSSBURGER One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic. \nAN EXECUTIVE We play up the fact that Hud is dead. \nALL (in unison) Long live the Hud!! \nANOTHER EXECUTIVE We depress the stock -- \nYET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE -- to the point where we can buy fifty-percent. \nPRECISE EXECUTIVE Fifty-one. \nELDERLY EXECUTIVE Not counting the mezzanine. \nCAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE It could work. \nOPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE It should work. \nPRACTICAL EXECUTIVE It would work. \nMUSSBURGER (at ticker tape machine) It's working already. Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue. All we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in our stockholders. \nENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE Yeah, a puppet! \nANOTHER EXECUTIVE A proxy! \nYET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE A pawn! \nMussburger strides across the room from the still CHATTERING TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into Waring Hudsucker's chair. He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales a cloud of smoke. \nMUSSBURGER Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really push around. \nCUT TO: \nSWINGING STEEL DOORS \nthat read, \"MAILROOM.\" They burst open as Norville, who wears a mail clerk's leather apron, imprinted: HUDSUCKER MAILROOM/The Future is Now. The hellish mailroom is criss- crossed by pipes that emit HISSING jets of STEAM. \nAs he wheels a piled-high mail cart down the aisle, Norville is accompanied by an orientation AGENT who bellows at him over the clamor and roar of many men laboring in the bowels of a great corporation. \nAGENT You punch in at 8:30 every morning except you punch in at 7:30 following a business holiday unless it's a Monday and then you punch in at eight o'clock!  You punch in at 7:45 whenever we work extended day and you punch out at the regular time unless you've worked through lunch! \nNORVILLE What's exte -- \nAGENT Punch in late and they dock ya! \nPeople on either side bellow at Norville and stuff envelopes and packages under his elbows, into his pockets, under his chin, between his clenched teeth, etc. \nFIRST SCREAMER This goes to seven! Mr. Mutuszak! Urgent! \nAGENT Incoming articles, get a voucher! Outgoing articles, provide a voucher! Move any article without a voucher and they dock ya! \nSECOND SCREAMER Take this up to the secretarial pool on three! Right away! Don't break it! \nAGENT Letter size a green voucher! Folder size a yellow voucher! Parcel size a maroon voucher! \nTHIRD SCREAMER This one's for Morgatross! Chop chop! \nAGENT Wrong color voucher and they dock ya! Six-seven-eight-seven-zero-four- niner-alpha-slash-six! That is your employee number! It will not be repeated! Without your employee number you cannot cash your paycheck! \nFOURTH SCREAMER This goes up to twenty-seven! If there's no one there bring it down to eighteen! Have 'em sign the waiver! DON'T COME BACK DOWN HERE WITHOUT A SIGNED WAIVER!! \nAGENT Inter-office mail is code 37! INTRA- office mail is 37-dash-3! Outside mail is 3-dash 37! Code it wrong and they dock ya! \nFIFTH SCREAMER I was supposed to have this on twenty- eight ten minutes ago! Cover for me! \nAGENT This has been your orientation! Is there anything you do not understand? Is there anything you understand only partially? If you have not been fully oriented -- if there is something you do not understand in all of its particulars you must file a complaint with personnel! File a faulty complaint... and they dock ya! \nCUT TO: \nNORVILLE \nstanding in front of a shelf of cubbyholes. As we FOLLOW his hand drawing an 8 X 10 envelope across the line of alphabetized mail slots. The envelope is addressed to Max Kloppitt, Jr. \nNORVILLE (muttering to himself) ...Bring it down to fif(?)... fifteen... sign the voucher, uh, waiver... cover for Mr. Anatole... he's a swell guy... Morgatross... He was on, uh... \nHe is COASTING ACROSS the \"K\" mail slots, finally COMES TO Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others. The envelope will not fit in. \nHe frowns. \nHe is about to fold the envelope, but notices something stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD. \nNorville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in rapid succession, left to right. \nCLOSEUP - ANCIENT SORTER \nAn old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail. \nWithout ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his left hand. \nANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF \nAs his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots. \nNORVILLE \nHe raises his voice over the mailroom din: \nNORVILLE Say, what do you do when the envelope is too big for the slot? \nThe ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking his mail. \nANCIENT SORTER Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire ya... \nCLOSEUP - LETTER \nTRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g., the faces that the letter passes are agog. \nCROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the Ancient Sorter. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's ear. \nANCIENT SORTER It's a blue letter... top, top level... confidential communication between the brass... usually bad news... they hate blue letters upstairs... Hate 'em! \nNorville gulps. \nHUTCHINSON You! \nNorville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has disappeared. \nHUTCHINSON ...Yeah, you! Barnes! \nAs he points, the people around Norville shrink away. \nHUTCHINSON ...You don't look busy! Think you can handle a blue letter? (laughs sadistically) ...This letter was sent down this morning by the big guy himself! 'At's right, Waring Hudsucker! It's addressed to Sid Mussburger! Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a blue letter! That means you put it right in Mussburger's hand. No secretaries! No receptionists! No colleagues! No excuses! \nDRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face. \nCOMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON \nWe can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the hairs in his ears. \nHUTCHINSON Mussburger!! \nCUT TO: \nELEVATOR DOORS \nROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched onto his breast pocket. \nAs Norville enters the elevators: \nBUZZ Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got the fuzz... \nHe lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his head. \nBUZZ ...I make the elevator do what she duzz! \nHe holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he snaps it away and pats down his crewcut: \nBUZZ ...Hang it up to dry. \nHe cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed to it. \nBUZZ ...What's your pleasure, buddy? \nNORVILLE (regaining his balance) Forty-fourth floor, and it's very -- \nBUZZ Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down? \nNORVILLE I -- \nBUZZ Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! \nWith a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia, painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator. \nBuzz opens the door and a couple of people enter. \nBUZZ Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven. \nMR. LEVIN Thirty-six. \nBUZZ Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen, step to the rear; here comes gargantuan Mr. Grier. \nAn obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar: \nFAT MAN Buzz. \nBuzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks only a little under the G-force. \nBUZZ Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street? \nNORVILLE Well, I -- \nBUZZ Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha! \nHe turns to look at Norville. \nBUZZ ...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun, it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a blue letter?! \nAll heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those near Norville shrink away. \nBUZZ ...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express to the top floor! \nThe ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we: \nCUT TO: \nELEVATOR DOORS \nSweeping open. Norville staggers out. \nBUZZ (hissing) Good luck, buddy! \nThe door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around. \nBehind him the elevator doors suddenly open again. \nVOICE (V.O.) Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs. \nMussburger hits the intercom. \nMUSSBURGER Tell him I'll be right there... (looks at Norville) Well, what is it? \nNORVILLE I -- \nBut Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from the PHONE. \nMUSSBURGER You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him. (looks up at Norville) ...Make it fast, make it fast. \nNORVILLE You -- \nThe INTERCOM SQUAWKS. \nVOICE (V.O.) Mr. Bumstead is getting very -- \nMUSSBURGER I'll be right there. Give him a magazine. (to Norville) ...What're you, a mute? \nThe second PHONE on Mussburger's desk RINGS. \nMUSSBURGER ...Yeah, how's the stock doing? ...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough. (into the first phone) ...Look, chump, either you find me a grade A ding-dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom. (into the second phone) And that goes double for you. (into the first phone) Ear-clay? (into both phones) Ood-gay! (slams down both phones, looks at Norville) This better be good. I'm in a bad mood. \nNorville clears his throat. \nNORVILLE Well, sir. I've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if I could just take a minute or so from your very busy time... \nHe reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at Norville, making no move to take the paper. \nNORVILLE ...to show you a, uh... \nNorville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders. \nNORVILLE ...a little something I've been working on for the last two or three years... \nMussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at Norville. \nNORVILLE ...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby -- \nMUSSBURGER Wait a minute! \nSudden quiet. \nWith one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings abruptly stop. \nAs Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute and paralyzed. \nHis eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk. He stands toe-to-toe with Norville. \nHe thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, evaluating. \nFinally he draws his head back. \nMUSSBURGER Hmmm... \nWith one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that his teeth clench it. \nMUSSBURGER Umm-hmm... \nHe steps back, eyes still on Norville. \nHe jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair behind the desk. \nMUSSBURGER Siddown. \nNorville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger. \nMUSSBURGER ...Go ahead. Try it on. \nNorville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly. \nMUSSBURGER ...Put your feet up. \nNorville is again reluctant. \nMUSSBURGER ...Go ahead. \nNorville obeys. Mussburger studies. \nMUSSBURGER Hmmmm... Let's get to know one another, shall we? \nNorville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax. \nMUSSBURGER ...Let's chat! (beams) ...Man to man! \nNorville beams. \nMUSSBURGER ...You weren't blessed with much... \nHe waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a euphemism. \nMUSSBURGER ...education, were you? \nNORVILLE Well, I'm a college graduate -- \nMUSSBURGER All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...? \nNORVILLE Well, I made the dean's list. \nMUSSBURGER (worried) Hmmm. \nNorville sputters out some more cigar smoke. \nNORVILLE At the Muncie College of Business Administration. \nBUMSTEAD, a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is screaming at an O.S. secretary. He holds a pot of coffee in one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other. \nBUMSTEAD No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?! \nIn the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper fluttering down. \nCUT TO: \nNORVILLE \nDesperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs. \nNORVILLE Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. I gotcha by your pants! \nMussburger's screaming abruptly stops. \nCLOSEUP - MUSSBURGER'S HORROR-STRICKEN FACE REMEMBERING (THE SCREEN GOES WATERY): \nMUSSBURGER \nis in a basement tailor shop. LUIGI, an old Italian tailor, is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam. \nLUIGI Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make 'em strong, and they look-a real sharp. \nMUSSBURGER (barking) No! Single stitch is fine. \nLUIGI (begging) But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, the dooble stitch she last-a forever -- \nMUSSBURGER Why on earth would I need a double stitch? To pad your bill? Single stitch is fine! \nCUT BACK TO: \nCLOSEUP OF PANICKED MUSSBURGER \nMUSSBURGER Damn! \nWe hear a LOUD TEARING sound O.S. Mussburger drops a few inches. \nQUICK WIPE TO: \nLUIGI AT HIS SEWING MACHINE \nLUIGI (musing to himself) What the heck. Meester Moosaburger such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong- a steech-a, you bet! \nBACK TO MUSSBURGER'S PANTS \nThe tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of the pants hold intact. \nMUSSBURGER \nsighs with relief. \nHe looks up. \nNORVILLE \nNorville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face. \nMUSSBURGER \nLooking. Thinking. \nNORVILLE \nStruggling to hold on. \nMUSSBURGER \nCalm. Contemplating. \nMUSSBURGER Hmmm... \nHe absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way. \nHe looks at Norville. \nNORVILLE \nHis face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on. \nA PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however, that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness. \nMussburger's legs are gone. \nNorville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely -- but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This inaugurates: \nLAUGHING MONTAGE \nMontage silent but for MUSIC. \nA) Norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of the near-disaster. Mussburger is slapping him merrily on the back. \nB) CLOSE SHOT - Board member laughing. \nC) Another board member. Laughing. \nD) Mussburger. Laughing. \nE) Norville laughing. \nF) FREEZE FRAME ON Norville's laughing face. \nANGLE \nPULL BACK to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus. \nREPORTER NEXT TO HIM Still waters run deep, chief. \nEDITOR The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson is the holes in his ears. Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations? Does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day? How tall is he and what's his shoe size? Where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast? Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he put jam on his toast, and if not why not and since when? \nHe thrust his face into that of the Reporter. \nEDITOR ...Well?!! \nNo answer. \nEDITOR ...Ahh, you're useless. Yes, Idea Man! Creator! Innovator! Cerebrator! Tycoon!-- \nWOMAN (O.S.) Fake. \nEDITOR Huhh!! \nWOMAN \nStar reporter AMY ARCHER -- attractive, smartly-dressed. \nAMY I tell ya the guy's a phony. \nEDITOR Phony, huh? \nAMY As a three-dollar bill. \nEDITOR Sez who? \nAMY Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?... \nOne Reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low: \nREPORTER Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer. \nOTHER REPORTER Again? You're on. \nAMY (as she picks up the morning paper) ...And just take a look at the mug on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin. Why he has a face only a mother could love -- \nWhack! The Editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again but: Amy, smiling, raises a cigar INTO FRAME having beaten him. \nShe tosses it to the Reporter who failed to get one. \nAMY ...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al. \nEDITOR Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry? \nAMY I filed it yesterday. \nEDITOR Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story! \nREPORTERS All right, chief... We'll do our best, chief... I'll give it a shot, chief... \nAMY (at the door) Al, he's the bunk. \nSlam! \nOne of the wagering Reporters grins at the other, who is taking out a five dollar bill. \nThe door bursts open and Amy sticks her head in. \nAMY I'll stake my Pulitzer on it! \nCUT TO: \nELEVATOR DOORS \nSweeping open to reveal the leering face of Buzz, the elevator gnat. \nBUZZ Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new duds? \nNorville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit. \nBUZZ ...and say, buddy! How'd old bucketbutt like his blue letter? Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger, sir... \nBuzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator. \nBUZZ ...How're you this fine morning, sir? \nNorville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the mention of the blue letter. \nNORVILLE That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that-- \nMUSSBURGER (to Buzz) Lobby. We haven't got all day. \nBUZZ Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir. \nAs he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a cigar, inspects it. \nMUSSBURGER Well I'm starved. I understand it'll be quite an affair this afternoon, and the executive roast tom turkey at the Bohemian Grove redefines the word superb. \nHe puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there with a lighter. \nBUZZ My pleasure, sir. \nNORVILLE Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too -- \nMUSSBURGER Sure, sure... \nThe elevator doors open. \nBUZZ It's been a pleasure serving you, Mr. Mussburger. \nBuzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it: \nBUZZ ...and it's been a pleasure serving you too, uh... buddy. \nShe throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer. \nAmy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a match off the desktop. \nAMY ...Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king? \nFrom the washroom: \nNORVILLE (O.S.) No, I -- \nAmy throws open another drawer, empty except for an appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior Achievers Club. \nAMY Is the a la king repeating on you? \nAmy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer. \nNORVILLE (O.S.) ...I'm fine, I... You were saying? \nShe mutters: \nAMY Values... watchwords... uh, tender years... (aloud) -- A little town you've probably never heard of... \nShe hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to disperse the smoke. \nAMY ...Muncie, Indiana. \nShe scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch just as the washroom door opens. \nNorville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his forehead. \nNORVILLE You're from Muncie?! \nAMY Why yes, do you know it? \nNorville starts making pumping motions with his fists and loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him. \nHe starts singing, off-key: \nNORVILLE 'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!' \nAmy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly follows sit, also pumping her fists. \nAs Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers: \nNORVILLE ...Goooooooo Eagles! \nAmy awkwardly imitates. \nNorville excitedly sits behind his desk. \nNORVILLE ...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud. \nAMY Oh, no, really, I -- \nNORVILLE Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up. \nHe hits the intercom. \nNORVILLE ...Mail room. \nTo Amy: \nNORVILLE ...This'll only take a moment. \nINTERCOM (V.O.) Yeah? \nNORVILLE Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes -- \nINTERCOM (V.O.) Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?! \nNorville thumps at his pockets. \nNORVILLE ...Well, I'm not sure where I -- \nINTERCOM (V.O.) I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important! \nNORVILLE But look, I'm president of the company now and I -- \nINTERCOM (V.O.) I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now! \nCLICK. The intercom goes dead. \nNORVILLE Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine? \nAMY Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic! \nNorville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm. \nNORVILLE -- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that! \nAMY Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes -- \nNORVILLE Please! Norville! \nAs he reaches to shake: \nNORVILLE ...It's my pleasure! \nShe reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and, winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes wings of his fingers. \nNORVILLE ...Gooooooo Eagles! \nAMY \nlikewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, and, winking back: \nAMY Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you? \nMOSES I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way. \nAMY So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president. \nMOSES Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart. \nAMY That smart?! \nMOSES But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know. \nAMY Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president? \nMOSES 'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does... \nHe draws a circle with his finger in the air. \nMOSES ...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, he's a caution. Wal, some folks is square, an' some is hip -- \nTo punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips. \nMOSES ...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh? \nAMY Well, maybe I -- \nMOSES An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go? \nAMY (bristling) It's hardly the same -- \nMOSES Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh? \nAMY Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were -- \nMOSES I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy. \nAMY (uncomfortably) I'm happy enough. \nMOSES (chuckles) Okay, Miss Archuh. (turns and walks away) ...I got gears to see to. \nAMY (calls after him) I'm plenty happy! \nShe is answered only by WHIRRING MACHINERY. \nMOSES \nElsewhere in the great room, he is hunkered down next to a catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag. Amy's VOICE ECHOES UP: \nAMY (O.S.) ...Hello? \nMOSES (muttering to himself) Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat... \nAs OMINOUS MUSIC SWELLS, we -- \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. CHIEF'S OFFICE \nHe slams down a typescript. \nCHIEF I can't print this! \nAMY Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap! \nCHIEF It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel! \nSMITTY (chuckling) Ol' satchel-butt... \nAMY I know they're gonna buy that stock -- \nCHIEF You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for? \nAMY I don't know... \nSMITTY Amy's hunches are usually pretty good, Chief. \nCHIEF You don't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus aren't interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation. Facts, figures -- those are the tools of the newspaper trade! Why it's almost as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- like you've gone all soft on him! \nSMITTY Come on, Chief, that's a low blow. Archer's not gonna go goey for a corn-fed idiot. \nCHIEF All right, I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock swindle story. Gimme some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff -- \nAMY Muncie. \nCHIEF Whatever. That's what sells newspapers. \nAMY I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk. \nCHIEF Watch it, Archer -- \nAMY It's about a dimwitted editor who -- \nSMITTY Easy, Amy... \nHe gives her a companionable goose. \nSMITTY ...Let's grab a highball and calm down. \nShe whirls and slaps him. \nAMY Back off -- smoocher! \nSmitty rubs his cheek, staring as she storms off. \nNORVILLE (O.S.) We anticipate, in short order, an upward... \nIn rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch -- Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN. \nMRS. FINDLANDSEN Ahhh! \nThere is a drum roll and, as the lights dim: \nEMCEE \ngrabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the band and grins. \nEMCEE Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Hudsucker board. I give you the king of swing, the rajah of romance, the incredible, the unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta! \nVic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and bounces across his forehead. \nCUT TO: \nSEVERAL BOARD MEMBERS \nClustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars. \nIn the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his song. \nAs Mussburger joins them: \nEXECUTIVE #1 How's it going, Mr. Mussburger? \nMUSSBURGER Bad. \nEXECUTIVE #2 Good. \nMUSSBURGER But not bad enough. \nEXECUTIVE #3 Too bad. \nMUSSBURGER It could be better, it could be worse. \nALL THREE EXECUTIVES Hmmmmmm. \nMUSSBURGER The stock's got to drop another five points if we expect to get controlling interest. Norville tells me he's got some hot idea. Can't be good. \nEXECUTIVE #1 Then it can't be bad! \nEXECUTIVE #2 Couldn't be better if it couldn't be worse. \nALL Hmmmmmm. \nEXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE \nwhere the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just FILTERING OUT. \nWe are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture, with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a stiff neck tossing back a drink. \nREVERSE \nAmy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him. \nAMY ...Norville? \nHe turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a dripping icepack against one eye. \nAMY ...What happened? \nNORVILLE Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover. \nAMY Let me look. \nHe does. \nNORVILLE Sid found me the icepack. \nAMY Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner. \nNORVILLE Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story. \nAMY ...I'm sorry. \nNORVILLE Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this. \nAs she rolls the pack gently across his eye: \nAMY Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary. \nNORVILLE I know that, Amy. \nAMY ...You do? \nNORVILLE I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front -- (massages his eye) -- not that everyone's buying it. \nAMY I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions -- \nNORVILLE Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people -- \nAMY Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie... \nThey gaze out at the city. \nAMY ...Certain people are -- \nNORVILLE Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town? \nAMY ...Huh? \nNORVILLE You know, on farm route 17. \nThe Board is staring. \nELDERLY EXECUTIVE Yeah but... What is it? \nEXECUTIVE #2 Does it have rules? \nEXECUTIVE #3 Can more than one play? \nEXECUTIVE #4 (to #3) What makes you think it's a game? \nEXECUTIVE #3 Is it a game? \nEXECUTIVE #5 Will it break? \nEXECUTIVE #6 It better break eventually! \nEXECUTIVE #2 Is there an object? \nEXECUTIVE #3 Are you supposed to make it fly off? \nEXECUTIVE #5 Does it come with batteries? \nEXECUTIVE #4 Could we charge extra for them? \nEXECUTIVE #7 Is it safe for toddlers? \nEXECUTIVE #3 How can you tell when you're done? \nEXECUTIVE #2 How do you make it stop? \nEXECUTIVE #1 Is that a girl's model or a boy's? \nEXECUTIVE #3 Can a parent assemble it?? \nEXECUTIVE #7 What if you get tired before it's done? \nEXECUTIVE #6 Is there a larger model for the obese? \nEXECUTIVE #4 Can you do it around your neck? \nELDERLY EXECUTIVE And finally... what is it? \nNORVILLE You know, for kids! It's... it's ... well, it's... \nMUSSBURGER It's brilliant. \nThe Board looks at Mussburger. \nMUSSBURGER ...It's genius. It's just exactly what Hudsucker needs at this juncture. Sure, sure, a blind man could tell you that there's an enormous demand for this, uh... \nHe smiles weakly at Norville. \nMUSSBURGER ...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours. \nNORVILLE Well... I'm for it... \nAs furiously BUSY MUSIC STARTS: \nCUT TO: \nTELETYPE \nFuriously PRINTING out \"EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE #37451-JL7. \nA hand ENTERS FRAME and rips the directive from the teletype, then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a cylindrical metal capsule. \nThe capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube. \nANGLE - LENGTH OF PNEUMATIC PIPING \nsomewhere in the labyrinthine substructure of the Hudsucker Building. We hear a MISSILE furiously HURTLING towards us, inside the pipe, and ROCKETING by. \nANGLE ON ANOTHER LENGTH OF PIPING \nOnce again we hear the CAPSULE APPROACH and ROCKET past. \nBLINDING RED LIGHTS \nas a SIREN BLARES. On a huge board that says HUDSUCKER DESIGN DEPARTMENT, flashing red letters announce: INCOMING DIRECTIVE! \nThe pneumatic tube spout shoots out a cylinder, and a hand eagerly picks it up and yanks it OUT OF FRAME. \nA technician in white laboratory smock is reading the directive as several other white-jacketed technicians crowd their heads around his shoulders, also reading. \nAll of their eye and head motions synchronize as they eagerly read, devouring the document line by line. \nA large sheet of graph paper is whipped down on top of a drafting table. Under the caption OVERHEAD ANGLE is a perfect circle. Under the caption HORIZONTAL is a horizontal line. Under the caption VERTICAL SIDE ANGLE is a vertical line. \nEXTREME LOW ANGLE - SEVERAL TECHNICIANS \nlooking thoughtfully down at the rendering. The head technician is stroking his beard and nodding. \nCUT TO: \nRENDERING \nas a hand ENTERS FRAME and stamps the drawing approved. \nCUT TO: \nTWO MORE LENGTHS OF PNEUMATIC PIPE \nas we hear the CYLINDER ROCKETING by. \nSWISH PAN TO: \nADVERTISING DEPARTMENT CREATIVE BULLPEN \nThe secretary in the f.g. is now reading Anna Karenina. \nThe silhouetted ad men, frustrated and hoarse, are still at it. \nAD MAN #1 (O.S.) The Hoopsucker! \nAD MAN #2 (O.S.) The Hudswinger! \nAD MAN #1 (O.S.) The Hoop-dee-doo! \nAD MAN #2 (O.S.) The Hudsucker Hoop! \nThe third ad man, slouched motionless at the typewriter up until now, finally raises his head. \nAD MAN #3 (O.S.) Fellas. Fellas! \nAD MAN #1 (O.S.) Ya got somethin'? \nAD MAN #2 (O.S.) Ya got somethin'?! \nAD MAN #3 (O.S.) Fellas! I got somethin'! \nCUT TO: \nPIECE OF ART PAPER \nPrinted at the top: Hudsucker Industries Proudly Presents \nPAN DOWN to reveal: THE HULA HOOP \nPAN DOWN to reveal: \nAn artist's hand working in fast motion to render the hula hoop logo: A grinning, healthy 1950s boy with a spray of freckles, one fist thrown forward, the other behind, as if doing an athletic frug, a hula hoop spinning with action lines around his waist. \nIn seconds the artist has completed the logo and now, also in fast motion, he writes the slogan on either side of the boy: \"You know... For Kids!\" \nAs the page is ripped off the art pad: \nMATCH CUT TO: \nPAGE \nbeing carried away in a continuous motion by an engineer who looks at it, nodding. We see that we are now in an enormous plant area. The engineer, grimy from his labors in this sweaty industrial realm, reaches up to pull an enormous lever. \nCUT TO: \nMACHINES \nGRINDING into motion. \nCUT TO: \nDONUT SPOUT \nAs it begins to spit hula hoops in massive numbers. \nThe hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest, hanging. \nA bale of hula hoops is loaded into a Hudsucker truck to complete its load. The truck door is slammed shut. \nIRON GRILL \nis thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just opening for the day. \nIn the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama -- \"You know... for Kids!\" \nReflected in the display window we see crowds of people scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped glumly in his hands. \nINT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE \nNorville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits hunched over the ticker-tape machine, studying the emerging tape. Amy finally looks up at Norville and sadly shakes her head. \nBACK TO SHOP WINDOW \nCrowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands idly in his doorway, smoking a cigarette. \nWe TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of $1.79 has been crossed out. Underneath it, inked in: \"Reduced: \nINT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE \nNorville is nervously pacing. Amy still studies the ticker- tape. Once again she is forced to shake her head sadly. \nBACK TO SHOP'S PRICE DISPLAY \nThe old $1.59 is suddenly covered as the hand ENTERS FRAME to slap on a sticker: $1.49. A beat. The hand ENTERS FRAME to slap on a new sticker: $1.29. Then in rapid-fire succession: $0.99. $0.79. $0.49. Two for $0.25. Free with any purchase. \nALLEY BEHIND SHOP \nwhere garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection: \nHands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of hoops towards the trash heap. One errant hoop rolls towards the mouth of the alley. \nThe mouth of the alley. The escaped hula hoop emerges and starts rolling down the street. \nHULA HOOP \nIt rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid it. \nIt rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement. \nThe little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING. \nINT. NEARBY SCHOOLHOUSE \nEXTREME CLOSE ON FLOOR \nWhere the PIN -- PING! -- hits. \nNORVILLE Deflates. He glares at the tailor. \nNORVILLE It's gone now. \nThe musicians resume playing. Everyone else resumes work. The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces: \nFEMALE (V.O.) Miss Amy here to see you. \nNorville leans forward to hit his intercom. \nNORVILLE Is she in the book? -- \nThe door bursts open and Amy storms in. \nAMY For Pete's sake, Norville! \nNORVILLE Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie -- \nAMY Never mind about that... \nShe shakes a piece of paper at Norville. \nAMY ...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing? \nNORVILLE Well, I wouldn't call them nincom -- \nAMY They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- \nNORVILLE Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- \nAMY You mean you know about this? \nNORVILLE Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start. \nAMY Your i -- \nNORVILLE We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker -- \nAMY You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?! \nThis was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing dribbles off. They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office. \nAMY ...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me -- \nNORVILLE Now, Aim -- \nAMY Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile -- \nNORVILLE Now, Aim -- \nAMY Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after -- \nNORVILLE Now, Aim -- \nAMY Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you... \nNORVILLE Worked in a watch factory? \nThe Goon looks up from his funnies. \nGOON Huh-huh-huh! \nAMY (to the Goon) Shutup! (to Norville) Exactly! Don't you remember how you used to feel about the hoop? You told me you were gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in America, regardless of race, creed or color. Finally there'd be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together -- even if it kept 'em apart, spacially -- you know, for kids? Your words, Norville, not mine. I used to love Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! -- when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head, but now your head is too big to be in over! \nNORVILLE Now, Amy -- \nAMY Consider this my resignation -- \nThwock -- She slaps him. \nThe bodyguard is on his feet. \nGOON Hey!! \nCrack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin. \nGOON ...Awooooo! \nAMY -- Effective immediately!! \nShe strides to the door, leaving Norville rubbing his cheek and the Goon hopping around on one leg. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE SHOT - PICTURE OF AMY \nPULL BACK SHOWS it to be her identification in her Hudsucker personnel file. \nA hand brings INTO FRAME another picture of her -- this one a newspaper clipping. She stands on a podium accepting an award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets. The caption says, \"Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives Pulitzer Prize.\" \nWIDER ANGLE \nWe are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just put them down. \nMUSSBURGER Hmmm... Thank you, Aloysius. This may be useful. \nAloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave. \nAs we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy, we: \nBuzz sinks to his knees, weeping. He clutches pathetically at Norville's pants legs. \nBUZZ Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got! \nNORVILLE Get up! \nBUZZ I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya! \nNORVILLE We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room! \nBuzz stumbles away, still weeping. \nBUZZ I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry... \nNORVILLE Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha! \nAs we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low, unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO: \nFLAMES \nWe PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar. \nHe is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge. He has a full golf bag over his shoulder. \nNORVILLE Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder. \nMUSSBURGER Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud. \nNORVILLE Ya don't say. \nMUSSBURGER Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly. \nNORVILLE How's that, Sid? \nMUSSBURGER It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him -- \nNORVILLE Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I -- \nMUSSBURGER Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company... \nHe is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it. \nMUSSBURGER ...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story. But her newspaper won't play ball... Looks like her story's coming out... \nWe TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD Norville, who stares horrified at the file. \nMUSSBURGER ...See, kid, the problem the Board'll have... you hired this woman. Kept her on, while she made a chump out of you. Serious error of judgment... I mean, business is war, kid -- ya take no prisoners, ya get no second chances. And a boner like this... I'm afraid when the Board meets, after New Year's, your position... well, it looks like you're finished... stick a fork in ya, you're done... washed up... \nWe LOSE Mussburger FROM FRAME as we TIGHTEN FURTHER ON Norville, Mussburger continuing off: \nMUSSBURGER (O.S.) ...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this dolly who betrayed you, she used to be a friend of yours... \nNorville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head. \nMUSSBURGER (O.S.) ...And this elevator dope used to be a friend, too... \nNorville stares, perfectly still. \nMUSSBURGER (O.S.) ...Well, they've got your throat pretty well slit. And when you're dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah, looks like curtains. Well, condolences, kid... \nNorville's IMAGE TURNS TO: \nBLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE OF NORVILLE \nWe PULL BACK to show that it is on the front page of the Manhattan Argus. \nThe headline, in screaming nine-point type: \nFAKE! \nNext to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a Fraud. \nNext to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator- operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator Jockey Clarence \"Buzz\" Gunderson. \nAMY (O.S.) You can't print that! \nCHIEF He grins wolfishly. \nCHIEF We are printing it! She's hittin' the streets this evening -- \nSWISH PAN TO: \nSMITTY -- and she's dynamite! \nAMY But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile! \nCHIEF Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy -- \nAMY Says who?! \nSMITTY You're not the only one with sources, Amy -- \nCHIEF Smith has a source on the Hud board -- very senior, very hushhush -- \nAMY Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger! \nSMITTY You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque -- \nAMY Muncie! \nCHIEF Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' -- \nAMY You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him! \nCHIEF (gently) Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack. \nBARMAN Martinis are for squares, man. \nSuddenly enraged: \nNORVILLE What'd you call me?! \nHe starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat. \nNORVILLE ...You son of a -- \nAMY (O.S.) Norville! \nNORVILLE Huh?! \nHe looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around his elbows. He sees Amy rushing up. \nNORVILLE ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?! \nAMY Oh Norville, I -- \nNorville's attention has already left her. He looks for the missing bartender. \nNORVILLE (swaying) Barman! Set'm up, fella! \nAMY Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- \nNORVILLE Hey! Where's that martini?! \nAMY Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can -- \nNORVILLE Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella! \nAMY Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it! \nShe starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting. \nAMY ...Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie. \nShe steps back off the stool. Norville watches her dully, his head swaying. \nAMY ...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you! Goooooo Eagles! \nShe looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out: \nNORVILLE You lied to me! I can't believe you lied to me! a Muncie girl! \nHe lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him, despair fights with confusion on Amy's face. \nAMY But Norville... I... \nShe realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple innocent she loved -- \nAMY ... Oh, Norville! \n-- and bursts into tears. \nTwo loud REVELERS reel INTO FRAME, one of them uncurling a blow-beeper at the weeping Amy. \nREVELER #1 Happy Newby-Newby-New! \nREVELER #2 1959 we dig you the most! \nEXT. ANNE'S \nAs Norville exits. It is night, snowing. \nWe PAN WITH Norville OFF the bar facade and, ENDING the PAN in the f.g.: \nNEWSPAPER \nWIPES UP INTO FRAME. Next to a picture of Norville is the headline \"MUNCIE MENTAL CASE.\" The subhead: \"Hud Chief to Tend Daisies.\" Sub-subhead: \"Headshrinker Calls Him Walking Time Bomb.\" \nNEWSIE (O.S.) Extra! Extra! New Year's Eve Edition! \nNorville's hand ENTERS FRAME to push the newspaper away and leave us looking up the empty street. Norville's back ENTERS as he stumbles off alone up the street, pulling up his coat collar as he recedes, the NEWSIE's VOICE continuing: \nNEWSIE (O.S.) ...Ring out the old! Ring in the new! \nCLOSE ON NORVILLE \ntrudging. VOICES WELL UP, ECHOING. A face looms with each voice, hellishly lit, superimposed over the walking Norville: \nVOICES (V.O.) ...You're not so slow but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after all!... Noooo, I don't guess you will be here long... Sure, sure, but even there they called you dipstick... lamebrain... dope... schmoe... And is this sap from chumpsville?!... imbecile after all... Norville, you let me down... You let Mrs. Eisenhower down... You let the American people down... imbecile after all... imbecile... I predict you're going to lose all the good things your ideas brought you... Please, buddy...! When you're dead, ya stay dead... Sure, sure, the kid's screwy -- it's official... \nThis last voice and supered face is Mussburger's. \nNorville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the: \nINT. BOARDROOM \nHellishly bottom-lit board members sit around the table, conical New Year's hats on their heads. Mussburger, the only one not wearing a cap, waves his cigar as he continues to talk: \nMUSSBURGER ...The barred-window boys are out looking for him now, and we'll see how Wall Street likes the news that the President of Hudsucker Industries is headed for the booby-hatch. Why, when the doc gets through with him he'll need diapers and a dribble cup... \nThe board murmurs appreciatively. \nMUSSBURGER ...Let me remind you that our secret post-New Year's party will be held in the office of the President shortly after midnight tonight. Remember, it's strictly stag, so leave the wives at home; we'll be showing some films and, yes, gentlemen, there will be exotic dancers. \nLouder murmuring. One board member leers, a trace of spittle at the corner of his mouth. \nMUSSBURGER Well, if that's all... \nWith an unnatural rumble he straightens his papers and we... \nJUMP UP TO: \nNorville reels over to it, stares dumbly. \nSTATUE \nMutely -- mockingly -- dignified. \nNORVILLE \nHe staggers off to the elevators. \nMUSSBURGER'S OFFICE \nWe are TRACKING ACROSS the office TOWARD Mussburger, his feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing on his desk; THRUMMMMM -- the SWEEP SECOND HAND of the clock, illuminated now, casts a moving shadow that rolls across the floor. Evil prevails. \nA piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk; as we APPROACH WE PAN DOWN and SWING AROUND to read it, LOSING Mussburger but still hearing his LAUGHTER. \nMOVING IN ON THE PAPER: \nMusssucker Industries. Hudberger Industries. Sidsucker Industries. This last alternative has been circled in red. Below it has been scribbled: \nSidney J. Mussburger, President. \nEvil LAUGHTER. Sweeping shadows. \nCUT TO: \nNORVILLE'S OFFICE DOOR \nWe are TRACKING IN TOWARD the back of Aloysius, the sign painter, who is stooped in front of the door. He looks back over his shoulder, leering PAST the CAMERA, to reveal his work: Under PRESIDENT Norville's name has been scraped away, and painted in is SIDNEY J. MUSSBUR... \nNORVILLE \nHe pushes past the sign painter. \nINT. OFFICE \nDark and empty. Norville is peeling off his coat as he staggers over to the closet. \nWe can hear DISTANT REVELRY and the STRAINS of \"AULD LANG SYNE.\" \nNorville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now. \nNorville looks at the door. \nTHROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of \"Mussburger\" being painted into place. \nNorville throws open the window. \nWIND WHISTLES. \nHe climbs out. \nLEDGE \nNorville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down. \nWe hear DISTANT CHANTING: \nVOICES (V.O.) Ten... nine... eight... seven... \nHIS POV \nA sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far, far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling snow. \nVOICES (V.O.) Six... five... four... \nWIDER ON NORVILLE \nWe are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began. The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the CHANTING continues: \nVOICES (V.O.) Three... two... \nWe have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his cheek. \nVOICES (V.O.) ...One... \nBONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly: \nVOICES (V.O.) Happy New Year! \nBONG!! \nHe can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges his way back toward the window. \nHIS POV \nThe open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it shut. \nBACK TO SCENE \nNorville waves. \nNORVILLE No -- \nBONG!! \nHis gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he trips -- falls -- catches the ledge -- \nNORVILLE -- No, please! \nHe is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet dangle away. Snow falls. \nHIS POV \nLooking STEEPLY UP. \nHUDSUCKER Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal. \nNORVILLE Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid -- \nHUDSUCKER It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile. \nNorville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter. \nNORVILLE Oh, geez. \nHUDSUCKER Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal. \nNORVILLE Geez, I -- \nHUDSUCKER Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying. \nNORVILLE Yessir. \nHUDSUCKER Well, why don't ya read it. \nNORVILLE Sir? \nHUDSUCKER Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'. \nNORVILLE Yes sir... \nHe tears open the envelope, reads: \nNORVILLE 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- \nHUDSUCKER Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph. \nNORVILLE 'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done? \nAs Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, then pats down a yawn. \nNORVILLE '...Looking back now, Sid, I see that I allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself -- but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of I...' \nNorville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up. \nHudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief. \nHe saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently quavers in a voice strangled with emotion: \nHUDSUCKER Skip this part... \nHe waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles. \nHUDSUCKER ...Last paragraph, last paragraph. \nNorville looks down the page. \nNORVILLE '...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --' \nHUDSUCKER -- tough titty toenails! \nHe roars with laughter. \nHUDSUCKER ...That'll show the bastard! \nHe merrily wipes his eyes. \nHUDSUCKER ...Yeah, go ahead. \nNORVILLE '...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...' \nNorville gives a musingly appreciative nod. \nHUDSUCKER ...Geez. \nPleased with himself: \nHUDSUCKER Yup. It's all there. Well, see that it gets delivered in the morning. \nHudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the stars. \nHUDSUCKER Sheeel beeee... \nMUSSBURGER'S OFFICE \nMussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on his way back to the heavens. \nHUDSUCKER ...Ridin' six white horses, She'll be ridin' six white horses She'll be ridin' six white horses When she comes... \nWe hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door. \nGEAR ROOM \nMoses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear. \nWith a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn -- \nSWEEP SECOND HAND \nLurching forward -- \nPERPETUAL MOTION BALL \nSwinging down -- \nEXT.

He don't look wise. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) Plan two: Here come the waterworks. \nThe woman starts crying. \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) Yellowstone. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) Old Faithful. \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) Hello, Niagara. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) He notices. \nAs the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles Norville and he finally does indeed notice. \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) He's concerned. \nThe woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically and waves his hands at the waitress. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) She explains her perdicament, and... \nVETERAN #1 & #2 (O.S.) (in unison) ...entuh the light lunch. \nThe waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman. \nThe woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at him. \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) She's got other problems, of course... \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) ...Her mother needs an operation... \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) ...adenoids. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) No, Bennie: Lumbago. \nVeteran #1's enunciation of \"lumbago\" falls into perfect sync with the woman's moving lips. \nNorville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices his watch. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) (alarmed) She's losing him, Bennie. \nNorville is rising to his feet. \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) Maybe he's wise. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) He don't look wise. \nAs Norville turns to leave: \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) How does she pull this out? \nShe puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) (disbelieving) She isn't! \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) (thrilled) She is! \nAnd indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her. \nNorville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help. \nVETERAN #1 (O.S.) She's good, Bennie. \nVETERAN #2 (O.S.) She's damn good, Lou. \nA WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she holds. \nWAITRESS (bored, nasal voice) Can I get you boys anything else? \nREVERSE ANGLE \nBack of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They sport extremely bored expressions, topped by \"cabbie\" caps. \nVETERAN #1 Bromo. \nBeat. \nVETERAN #2 ...Bromo. \nINT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE \nLooking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President. \nThe sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand. \nThe door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode. \nHe swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN tnediserP. \nWeakly, still cradled in Norville's arms: \nAMY I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy... \nNORVILLE Not at all. You're light as a feather. \nAMY (pointing languorously) The couch, please. \nStill wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks at her. \nNORVILLE'S POV \nShe is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs. \nWe hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as if coming from a long way away. \n", "test1_true": "NORVILLE Just a minute. \nHe perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his head between his knees, still fighting for breath. \nAMY I don't know what came over me. I suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in after so long, or whatever. But then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry... \nSpeaking into his knees as he wheezes: \nNORVILLE Hungry, anyway. \nAMY I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story... \nNorville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her head. \nAMY ...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless -- though not for want of trying, that I'm friendless, with no one to -- thank you -- take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did -- \nShe screams, staring down at the couch. \nNorville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking. \nOn the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is printed, in wet ink, right side around: NORVILLE BARNES, President. \nAMY Norville, I didn't know you were president here! \nNorville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. When the nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the seat of his pants. \nDistracted but still modest: \nNORVILLE Oh, it's nothing really. Just determination and hard work... \nHe unbuckles his trousers. \nNORVILLE ...Of course, when I started in the mailroom last Tuesday I thought it might take more time -- \nBuzz enters holding a brown paper bag. \nBUZZ Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you asked f -- \nHe freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch; Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in his own hand. \nNORVILLE (flustered) Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on the desk. \nLeering: \nBUZZ Happy days, buddy... \nAs he turns to leave: \nBUZZ ...and I'll tell your secretary you're not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!! \nHe snaps the elastic strap under his chin. \nAfter the doors shut behind Buzz: \nAMY (shuddering) What a horrible little person. \nNORVILLE Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really -- \nAMY At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world -- \nNorville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her. \nAMY A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future -- \nNORVILLE I myself -- \nHe crosses back to the desk. \nAMY Only to have that belief, that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place -- \nNorville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box on the desk and sticks it in his mouth. \nNORVILLE Cigarette? \nAMY No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years -- \nOVER NORVILLE'S SHOULDER \nHe has been pushing the box towards her. The box tilts lazily forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. We hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter of cigarettes raining onto the carpet. \nAmy's brow crinkles. Continuing: \nAMY -- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of -- \nNORVILLE Mind if I join you? \nHe is pouring himself a drink. \nAMY Be my guest. A little town you've probably -- \nHe tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes bulging. \nHIS POV \nOnce again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips. \nNORVILLE He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet. \nNORVILLE Excuse me -- I -- executive washroom... \nHe staggers out a side door. \nOn his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his desk. At the top of her voice: \nAMY Are you all right?... \n", "test2_input": "DISSOLVE THROUGH TO: \nPRESSES \nrolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint. \nPapers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very quickly. \nDELIVERY MAN \nthrowing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck. \nBALED PAPER \nrolling into the f.g.

I didn't think the picture did you justice. \nNORVILLE The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence -- \nAMY -- or lack thereof? \nNORVILLE (nodding) -- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera. \nHe drifts into thought. \nAMY Is that all, Mr. Barnes? \nNORVILLE ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile? \nAMY I'm sure I -- \nNORVILLE Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion. \nAMY Well, I -- \nNORVILLE Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this? \nHe whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle rendered onto it. \nAmy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly beaming face. \nNORVILLE ...I designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top. \nAmy is bewildered. Norville explains: \nNORVILLE ...You know! For kids! \nAMY ...Why don't I just type this up... \nNORVILLE Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess. \nAMY Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man. \nNORVILLE Well, she probably had a deadline... \nAMY Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record! \nNORVILLE Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam... \nShe gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when Norville adds: \nNORVILLE ...She's probably just a little confused. \nAmy turns at the door. \nAMY Confused? \nNORVILLE Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean. \nAMY (through clenched teeth) I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean. \n", "test2_true": "AMY Oh, is that it! \nNORVILLE Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or... \nAMY Smitty. \nNORVILLE Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline? \nAMY Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance. \nNORVILLE I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I -- \nWhap!

ROOM \nIt is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs, gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsucker clock. \nAmy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one she entered from. \nShe stoops to peek through its keyhole. \nHER POV \nWe are LOOKING INTO Sidney J.

An idea like this sweet baby doesn't just come overnight... \nREPORTER Mr. Barnes, are you -- \nNORVILLE -- Although I'll tell you one thing: I certainly didn't expect all this 'hoopla'! \nThis TIRED old joke brings some polite laughter. \nNorville is smiling as he enters the elevator. As its doors start to close, leaving Amy behind: \nNORVILLE ...And you can quote me on that! \nFlash bulb explosion effects a... \nCUT BACK TO: \nNEWSREEL \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Yes, it's hula hula everywhere! From the cocktail parties of the Park Avenue smart set... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA group of people in formal evening wear are sipping highballs and chatting as they keep hoops in motion 'round their waists. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...to sweethearts who want to be married in the 'swing' of things... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA young couple stands before the altar hula hooping. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...To our friend the Negro, in the heart of the dark continent. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nPan down from elephant to two natives hula hooping as they grin into the newsreel camera. \nTRACKING IN ON: \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe mean laugh. Yes, as we draw closer, it seems clear that his laugh is colder than before. \nFlash bulb explosion effects a... \nCUT TO: \nNORVILLE \nSitting in a barber chair, face lathered up, as Reporters crowd in. \nREPORTER #1 Mr. Barnes, Mr. Barnes, Rumpus magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year, and the society pages have been linking you with high-fashion model Za-Za. Would you care to comment? \nA burning cigar emerges from the lather around Norville's face. It waggles as he talks. \nNORVILLE There's no truth to the rumors; we're just dear friends... \nHe looks to one side. \nNORVILLE ...Isn't that right, Za-Za? \nSWISH PAN TO: \n", "test3_true": "ZA-ZA (sexily) Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-oww! \nThe newsmen react. \nREPORTER #2 Ho-leeee! \nREPORTER #3 Mr. Barnes, whither Hudsucker? Whither Norville Barnes? \nREPORTER #4 How do you respond to the charges that you're out of ideas? Has Norville Barnes run dry? \nThe barber is periodically pinching Norville's nose to shave under it; as he alternately pinches and releases, Norville's voice breaks from nasal to normal and back. \nNORVILLE Not at all. Why, just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas. A larger model hula hoop for the portly. A battery option for the lazy and handicapped. A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm earning my keep. \nREPORTER #5 Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you expect to get a raise? \nNORVILLE Well, by anyone's account I've saved Hudsucker Industries; our stock is worth more than it's ever been. So, yes, I expect to be compensated for that. \nEND TRACK IN ON: \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe mean laugh. FURTHER TRACK IN ON Norville ENDS in CLOSE SHOT, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, as he finishes his hard, square-jawed, man-on-top laugh, gazing flintily INTO the CAMERA. \nNORVILLE -- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! \nPULL BACK FROM: \nWEEPING EXECUTIVE \nThe PULL BACK FROM a blubbering executive REVEALS that we are at a Board meeting. All of the Board members sit around the table except for Mussburger, who, a towel around his waist, is receiving a choppity-chop massage on a padded table from a muscular man in a bulging T-shirt. \nMUSSBURGER Pull yourself together, Addison. \nAddison snuffles. \nADDISON Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock? \nMUSSBURGER We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison -- \nADDISON I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now! \nMUSSBURGER Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap -- \nADDISON Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined! \nHe climbs up onto the board table. \nADDISON I'm getting off this merry-go-round! \nEXECUTIVE Addison! \nANOTHER EXECUTIVE Myron! \nADDISON Aaaaahhh! \nHe runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward the window and: \nThwok! \nCUT TO: \nMUSSBURGER'S OFFICE - ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE \nLOOKING IN, as Addison flattens against the f.g. glass, his face squushing, his outflung hands likewise. \nAll stare in horror for a long silent beat. \nWith the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass, Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree. \nMussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth. \nMUSSBURGER Plexiglas. Had it installed last week. \nEXECUTIVE ...Myron? \nMUSSBURGER All right, so the kid caught a wave. So right now he and his dingus are on top. Well, this too shall pass. Myrtle J. Mussburger didn't raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first sign of adversity. I say, we made this kid and we can break him. I say, the higher he climbs, the harder he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a future, and in it I see shame, dishonor, ignominy and disgrace. \nSure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin ain't over yet. \nNORVILLE'S OFFICE \nA small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs. \nA French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a stone chisel and hammer. \nA GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, reading the funny papers. \nAt length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager. \nNORVILLE Hold it!... \nThe musicians' playing dribbles away to silence. \nNORVILLE ...Nobody move, nobody breathe... \nAll sit frozen. You could hear a pin drop. \nNORVILLE ...An idea... is coming... \nEyes narrowed, he gazes off into space, squinting for his idea. \nCLOSE ON TAILOR'S KIT \nA straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops off -- \n"}

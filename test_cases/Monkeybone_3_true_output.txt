At the sight of STU behind bars, she breaks down CRYING. 
KITTY I'm so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. 
STU Kitty...my situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey. 
KITTY You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her. 
STU Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to?? 
RAT GUARD Time's up! Break it up, you two. 
The RAT GUARD pushes STU back with a prod. KITTY reaches out... 
KITTY No! Give me a moment. Just to look at him. Oh, Stu. Oh, my sweet, sweet Stu. 
As she gazes at him, love struck, the overhead PANEL opens and a deluge of CRUD from the Morpheum lands directly on STU. 
RAT GUARD Feeding time! 
KITTY BAWLS inconsolably as the RAT GUARD leads her away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
STU-BONE in pajamas and a head bandage, reading the morning funnies. He pounds the table, practically WEEPING with hilarity at the MONKEYBONE COMIC STRIP. 
STU-BONE Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just kills me! 
JULIE I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay? 
STU-BONE Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a word of coverage in this stinkin' rag! (shuffling through the paper) Hey. Don't I have a TV show? 
JULIE They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times. 
STU-BONE I need a new PR guy. 
JULIE grins, plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead, and exits. He waits a minute, then reaches for the PHONE. 
WIPE TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
The house is crawling with PRESS. There must be three dozen REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS hanging on STU­BONE's every pronouncement. 
STU-BONE Yes, being in a coma taught Stu Miley a thing or two about life. Buckle your seat belts, for one. But seriously, Stu Miley is a different man today. I'm much homier. 
The front door opens. A stunned JULIE pushes her way inside... 
STU-BONE And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy. 
JULIE I had to park two blocks away. Is something - 
He pulls her to his side for a photo op. FLASHBULBS go off. 
STU I took the liberty of calling a little press conference. We're on TV, so don't say "shit." ­(covering his mouth) Shit! I said it. Shit! I said it again! 
REPORTER Stu, what is it about Monkeybone that makes him so popular? 
STU-BONE Well, it's partly that he punctures all the phony pretensions of our modern society...and it's partly that he's a breathtakin', heartbreakin', rump-shakin' sex machine! (beat) Ask these gentlemen here. They're an important cog in my media machine. They'll be doing six new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my personal supervision. 
He pauses for a photo op with MIKE CACHUELA and MIKE MITCHELL. 
STU-BONE It's all synergy. The show synergizes the strip, which synergizes the merchandising, which synergizes the religion, which synergizes the Barbara Walters special; and then, baby, we are all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia. 
INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 
JULIE squeezes through the crowd, finds HERB working the phone. 
HERB I tell you, he's ready to merchandise. We've gotta move quickly. Get the toy guys, the burger guys, the lunchbox guys - 
JULIE Herb...what in God's name - 
HERB holds up a finger. He's too busy talking. STU-BONE enters with the video crew in tow. JULIE somehow manages to sideline him.

197 CONTINUED: 197 JANUSZ helps SMITH sit up, feeding him a small piece of meat. SMITH waves him away, sinking back to the ground too tired to eat. 
VOSS Kind of like chicken. 
ZORAN Yeah, a long black poisonous chicken with no legs. 
JANUSZ You know Valka talked of eating each other? In Siberia? 
ZORAN He did? Would you have eaten me? 
JANUSZ Probably. 
ZORAN I would never have eaten you - too stringy and bitter, I'd rather eat snake. VOSS nearly chokes on something, reaches into his mouth, pulls out a tooth. 
JANUSZ Scurvy.

199 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 199 
The fire burns low, VOSS and ZORAN sleep. SMITH wakes from time to time and JANUSZ forces him to eat and drink. SMITH is deathly pale, his life ebbing away. He speaks in short, croaky stabs, every breath an effort. 
SMITH It can kill you, remember? JANUSZ puzzled. 
SMITH (CONT'D) 'Kindness'. JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives him away. 
199 CONTINUED: 199 
SMITH (CONT'D) How long can you survive on snakes and mud? You should leave me, but you can't can you? You're a fool. I'd leave you. He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and suffering etched in sharp lines. 
JANUSZ Mister? 
SMITH What? 
JANUSZ I mightn't know youur first name, but I know your son's name. SMITH stares at him. 
SMITH Irena told you. JANUSZ nods. 
JANUSZ Can I say his name? Nothing from SMITH. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) 'David'. 
SMITH Saying his name on't bring him back. He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ, an ironic smile on his lips. 
SMITH (CONT'D) You trying to give me the will to live? That it? Stop me giving up? 
JANUSZ Are you giving up? 
SMITH In the camps, some saw death as 'freedom'.

JANUSZ So why didn't you kill yourself? 
SMITH Survival was a kind of protest. JANUSZ makes him take a little water. 
SMITH (CONT'D) Now being alive is my punishment. 
JANUSZ Punishment for what? 
SMITH I brought David to Russia didn't 
I?

{"test1_input": "THE READER \nWritten by \nDavid Hare \nBased on the novel by Bernhard Schlink \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS \n1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark- haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate. \nMICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can, turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The credits end. \nBRIGITTE You didn't wake me. \nMICHAEL You were sleeping. \nBRIGITTE You let me sleep because you can't bear to have breakfast with me. \nIt's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react. \nMICHAEL Nothing could be further from the truth. I boiled you an egg. See? \nMICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table. \nMICHAEL I'd hardly have boiled you an egg if I didn't want to see you. Tea or coffee? \nBRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing gown. She's still half-serious. \nBRIGITTE Does any woman ever stay long enough to find out what the hell goes on in your head? \nMICHAEL smiles to himself. \nBRIGITTE What are you doing tonight? \nMICHAEL I'm seeing my daughter. \nBRIGITTE Your daughter? You've kept very quiet about her. \nMICHAEL Have I? She's been abroad for a year. Did you say tea? \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY \nMICHAEL kisses BRIGITTE on the cheek as she departs. \nBRIGITTE I'm going. Give my love to your daughter. \nHe closes the door, then turns to the open door of the bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making. Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn goes by. \nINT. TRAM. DAY. \nDecember 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill. \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY \n1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out. \nINT. TRAM. DAY \n1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets off at the next stop. \n", "test1_true": "1995. MICHAEL closes the window. \nEXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \n1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS walks past. \nMICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the pavement and seizes him by the arm. \nHANNA Hey. Hey! \nHANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties. She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket. \nHANNA Hey, kid. Hey. \nMICHAEL I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \nEffortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head. \nHANNA Where do you live? \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nHANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his satchel, she is pulling him by the arm. \nEXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY \nThey come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops outside his block, as if nervous she might come in. \nMICHAEL It's here. I'll be fine now. Thank you. \nHANNA Look after yourself. \nMICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone. She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came. MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision. \nINT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHT \nCARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner through for the BERG family, at a round table in a traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier. \nMICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS, 18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY. MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food. \nCARLA I'm worried about him. He looks terrible. \nPETER The boy's saying he doesn't need a doctor. \nEMILY He does. \nMICHAEL I don't need a doctor. \nPETER Good then. \nCARLA looks reproachful. \nCARLA Peter. \nPETER We're not going to argue about this. People have to take responsibility for their own lives. \nINT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY \nMICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently inflamed. CARLA is with the DOCTOR, a much older man. \n", "test1_id": 2847, "test2_input": "DOCTOR Remind me, how old are you now? \nCARLA Michael's fifteen. \nDOCTOR It's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed for several months. At least. \nMICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head. Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away. \nCARLA Keep away. He's contagious. \nThey vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is heard. \nDOCTOR Burn the sheets. Complete isolation. And three months is the minimum. \nINT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY \n1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving round behind him, tidying the room. \nCARLA How are you feeling? \nMICHAEL Better. By the way, I meant to tell you, the day I got ill... a woman helped me. A woman in the street. \nCARLA She helped you? \nMICHAEL Yes. She brought me home. \nCARLA Do you have her address? \nEXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \nMICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building. \nINT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \nMICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay - green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment. Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a moment. \nHANNA Come in. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nThe flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs. There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the room. HANNA carries on ironing. \nMICHAEL I brought you these flowers. To say thank you. \nHANNA Put them down there. \nMICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and puts it over one of the chairs. \nMICHAEL I would have come earlier, but I've been in bed for three months. \nHANNA You're better now? \nMICHAEL Thank you. \nHANNA Have you always been weak? \nMICHAEL Oh no. I'd never been ill before. It's incredibly boring. There's nothing to do. I couldn't even be bothered to read. \nHANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers. He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she upends the iron. \nHANNA I have to go to work. I'll walk with you. Wait in the hall while I change. \n", "test2_true": "She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches, riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door slams. \nINT. STAIRS. DAY \nMICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the front door. \nEXT. COURTYARD. DAY \nThe WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming the outer door. \nINT. BEDROOM. DAWN \nMICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram going by outside. \nEXT. STREET. DAWN \nThe tram making its way along the quiet street. \nINT. BEDROOM. DAWN \nMICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed. \nINT. TRAM. DAY \nMICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next stop. She doesn't see him as she works. \nEXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \nMICHAEL is standing on the other side   of the street from HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds   about whether to go in. The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He   waits for them to finish before he slips in through the   archway, making his way to the stairs. \nINT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nMICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then, as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him. \nHANNA There are two more buckets downstairs. You can fill them and bring them up. \nHANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if there might be some contact. But she goes by. \nINT. CELLAR. DAY \nMICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke, poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nHANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy. She roars with laughter, full-throated. \nHANNA You look ridiculous, look at you, kid. \nMICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen. \nHANNA You can't go home like that. Give me your clothes, I'll run you a bath. \nHANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops. \nHANNA What, do you always take a bath in your trousers? \nHANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail. \nHANNA It's all right, I won't look. \n", "test2_id": 2848, "test3_input": "HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious. \nHANNA There were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. That's how we did it - every month. We'd all choose ten. \nJUDGE Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process? \nHANNA We all did. \nJUDGE Even though they've denied it? But you admit it. You're saying you took part in the process. \nThe other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is intent, following his own line. \nJUDGE Did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths? \nHe waits. HANNA nods slightly. \nHANNA Yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on. \nJUDGE I'm not sure you understand... \nHANNA We couldn't keep everyone. There wasn't room. \nThe JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem to understand his point. \nJUDGE No, but what I'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `You you and you have to be sent back to be killed.' \nHANNA Well, what would you have done? \nHANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly asks herself a question. \nHANNA So should I never have signed up at Siemens? \nINT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY \nMICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a CLERK leans in to the younger woman. \nCLERK Ms. Mather, they're ready for you now. \nThe two women go into the court. The door closes. \nINT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY \nMICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on. \nMICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one of a couple who isn't bothering to listen. \nPROSECUTOR In your book you describe the process of selection... \nILANA Yes. You were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to Auschwitz to be killed. \nPROSECUTOR Are there people here today who made that selection? \nILANA Yes. \nPROSECUTOR I need you to identify them. Can you please point them out? \nILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS. \nILANA Her. And her. And her. And her. And her. And her. \nThe last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA does not react. \n", "test3_true": "JUDGE In what way differently? \nILANA She had favourites. Girls, mostly young. We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. In the evening, she asked them to join her. We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought. \nHANNA stares back, impassive. MICHAEL watches. \nILANA Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her. They were reading to her. At first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder. Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. But then she dispatched them. Is that kinder? \nHANNA looks back, not apologizing. \nINT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY \nMICHAEL sits alone, head in hands, in despair. \nINT. COURTROOM. DAY \nNow ROSE is testifying. The court is quiet, focused. \nJUDGE I want to move on now to the march. As I understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months. \nROSE Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. But the plan kept changing every day. Women were dying all around us in the snow. Half of us died on the march. My daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop. \nMICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting. \nJUDGE Please tell us about the night in the church. \nMICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA stares back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, as if accepting she must go ahead and speak. \nROSE That night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads. We'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house. But they let us sleep in a church. There was a bombing raid. In the middle of the night. At first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple. Then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to the doors. But the doors had been locked on the outside. \nJUDGE The church burned down? Nobody came to open the doors? Is that right? \nROSE Nobody. \nJUDGE Even though you were all burning to death? \nROSE nods. \nJUDGE How many people were killed? \nROSE Everyone was killed. \nJUDGE How did you survive? \nROSE I needed to get away from the other women. Because they were panicking, they were screaming. I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand their screaming. I was more frightened of the other women than I was of the fire. So I too my daughter and led her to the upper floor. I can't defend what I did. It's impossible to defend. I took Ilana in my arms and I led her towards the fire. There was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level. It saved our lives. The gallery didn't burn. \nROSE turns, in tears, to look at ILANA. \nJUDGE Thank you. I want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify. \nINT. LECTURE ROOM. LAW SCHOOL. DAY \nThe group is back in the big hall. But the atmosphere is grim. It's a while before DIETER speaks. \nDIETER I don't know. I don't know what we're doing any more. \nROHL Don't you? \nDIETER You keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there's something disgusting about this. \n", "test3_id": 2849}

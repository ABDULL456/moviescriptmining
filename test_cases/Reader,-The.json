{"train": "THE READER \nWritten by \nDavid Hare \nBased on the novel by Bernhard Schlink \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS \n1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark- haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate. \nMICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can, turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The credits end. \nBRIGITTE You didn't wake me. \nMICHAEL You were sleeping. \nBRIGITTE You let me sleep because you can't bear to have breakfast with me. \nIt's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react. \nMICHAEL Nothing could be further from the truth. I boiled you an egg. See? \nMICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table. \nMICHAEL I'd hardly have boiled you an egg if I didn't want to see you. Tea or coffee? \nBRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing gown. She's still half-serious. \nBRIGITTE Does any woman ever stay long enough to find out what the hell goes on in your head? \nMICHAEL smiles to himself. \nBRIGITTE What are you doing tonight? \nMICHAEL I'm seeing my daughter. \nBRIGITTE Your daughter? You've kept very quiet about her. \nMICHAEL Have I? She's been abroad for a year. Did you say tea? \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY \nMICHAEL kisses BRIGITTE on the cheek as she departs. \nBRIGITTE I'm going. Give my love to your daughter. \nHe closes the door, then turns to the open door of the bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making. Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn goes by. \nINT. TRAM. DAY. \nDecember 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill. \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY \n1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out. \nINT. TRAM. DAY \n1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets off at the next stop. \nDOCTOR Remind me, how old are you now? \nCARLA Michael's fifteen. \nDOCTOR It's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed for several months. At least. \nMICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head. Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away. \nCARLA Keep away. He's contagious. \nThey vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is heard. \nDOCTOR Burn the sheets. Complete isolation. And three months is the minimum. \nINT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY \n1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving round behind him, tidying the room. \nCARLA How are you feeling? \nMICHAEL Better. By the way, I meant to tell you, the day I got ill... a woman helped me. A woman in the street. \nCARLA She helped you? \nMICHAEL Yes. She brought me home. \nCARLA Do you have her address? \nEXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \nMICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building. \nINT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \nMICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay - green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment. Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a moment. \nHANNA Come in. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nThe flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs. There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the room. HANNA carries on ironing. \nMICHAEL I brought you these flowers. To say thank you. \nHANNA Put them down there. \nMICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and puts it over one of the chairs. \nMICHAEL I would have come earlier, but I've been in bed for three months. \nHANNA You're better now? \nMICHAEL Thank you. \nHANNA Have you always been weak? \nMICHAEL Oh no. I'd never been ill before. It's incredibly boring. There's nothing to do. I couldn't even be bothered to read. \nHANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers. He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she upends the iron. \nHANNA I have to go to work. I'll walk with you. Wait in the hall while I change. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE \nLater. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake. \nHANNA You never tell me what you've been studying. \nMICHAEL Studying? \nHANNA At school. Do you learn languages? \nMICHAEL Yes. \nHANNA What languages? \nMICHAEL Latin. \nHANNA Say something in Latin. \nMICHAEL Oh... \nMICHAEL thinks a moment. \nMICHAEL Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur dexteris aptantur enses conditi? \nMICHAEL smiles slightly. \nMICHAEL It's Horace. \nHANNA It's wonderful. \nMICHAEL Do you want some Greek? \nMICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light. \nMICHAEL Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon oi da naon phais epi gan malainan emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto tis eratai. \nHANNA It's beautiful. \nMICHAEL How can you tell? How do you know when you've no idea what it means? \nHANNA looks at him a moment. \nHANNA What about in German? \nMICHAEL In German? \nHANNA Do you have anything? \nMICHAEL Well, I'm writing an essay. It's about a play. By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps you've heard of him? \nHANNA makes no reaction. \nMICHAEL The play's called Emilia Galotti. \nHANNA Have you got it? \nMICHAEL reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book. \nMICHAEL Here. You can read it. \nHANNA I'd rather listen to you. \nHANNA lets herself in, saying nothing. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nHANNA has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen table. MICHAEL follows, desperate. \nMICHAEL I got up - at 4.30 - specially - it's the first day of the holidays, I'd been planning to surprise you - \nHANNA Poor little baby. Got up at four thirty - and on your holidays too. \nMICHAEL What is this? I was on your tram! You totally ignored me! What do you think I was doing? Why the hell do you think I was there? \nMICHAEL has yelled in desperation. HANNA looks him straight in the eye. \nHANNA I haven't the slightest idea. And what you do is your business not mine. \nHANNA turns and moves away. \nHANNA And if you wanted to speak to me, I was in the first carriage. So why did you sit in the second? \nHANNA goes to run a bath. \nHANNA And now, thanks very much, I've been working, I need a bath. Get out, I'd like to be by myself. \nMICHAEL I didn't mean to upset you. \nHANNA You don't have the power to upset me. You don't matter enough to upset me. \nShe takes off her clothes to get in. As soon as she does, he gets up and goes into the other room. He sits by himself, miserable. He hears her, bathing. Then finally gets up and goes back in. She is still in the bath. \nMICHAEL I don't know what to say. I've never been with a woman. We've been together four weeks and I can't live without you. I can't. Even the thought of it kills me. \nHANNA looks at him thoughtfully. \nMICHAEL I sat in the second carriage because I thought you might kiss me. \nHANNA Kid, you thought we could make love in a tram? \nThey smile. But MICHAEL has a more urgent question. \nMICHAEL Is it true what you said? That I don't matter to you? \nIn the bath, she shakes her head. \nMICHAEL Do you forgive me? \nShe nods. \nMICHAEL Do you love me? \nShe looks at him. Then she nods. \nINT. BEDROOM. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nMICHAEL is sitting on the side of the bed. HANNA comes in, wrapped in a towel. \nHANNA Do you have a book? \nMICHAEL Oh. Well I do. I took something with me this morning. \nHANNA What is it? \nMICHAEL Whisky! By thunder, whisky. `Whisky? Come now captain, you can't be serious.' \nHANNA All right, kid, that's enough for today. \nThey fall back onto the bed. \nMICHAEL I was wondering, do you think you could get some time off? Maybe we could go for a trip. \nHANNA What sort of trip? \nMICHAEL I'd love to go bicycling. Just for two days. \nMICHAEL reaches for a book. \nMICHAEL I've got a guide-book. I've worked out the route. Look, what do you think? \nHANNA'S look is so far-away she doesn't seem to hear the question. Silence. Then : \nHANNA I think you like planning, don't you? \nShe throws the book away and they begin to make love. \nINT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAWN \nFirst light. Dawn breaking outside the window. MICHAEL is working at his desk, the surface covered in stamps, his collection book open. He picks one with a pyramid on it and looks at it. Underneath, MICHAEL'S VOICE reading Intrigue and Love by Schiller. \nMICHAEL'S VOICE \"I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. Why should I be? I welcome obstacles, because they'll be like mountains I can fly over to be in your arms. The more I suffer, the more I'll love... \nINT & EXT. SHOP. DAY \nSeen from outside, a shop full of stamps. MICHAEL and a STAMP DEALER with white hair and a moustache. MICHAEL is offering his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the STAMP DEALER shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much as he hopes. \nThen MICHAEL concedes, the DEALER concedes, and a bunch of notes are handed across. MICHAEL runs exhilarated out into the street. \nMICHAEL'S VOICE \"Danger will only increase my love, it will sharpen it, it will give it spice. I'll be the only angel you need. On this arm, Luise, you will go dancing through life. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say `Only one thing can make a soul complete, and that thing is love.' \nEXT. HILL. DAY \nHANNA and MICHAEL are whizzing down a hill together on bicycles. He has a rucksack. It's a rural paradise - hills on all sides, a gleaming river below, the sun shining brightly. She is wearing a blue dress. \nEXT. CAFE. DAY \nThey come to a cafe and sit down outside. They pick up the menus on the table. A WAITRESS arrives. \nWAITRESS So what would you like to have? \nMICHAEL What are you having? \nHANNA You order. I'll have what you have. \nMICHAEL starts giving the order. Next to them are a group of BOY SCOUTS, who are laughing among themselves. \nBOYS There's sausages, sausages or sausages. Give it to me, come on, give it here. Let me have a look. You always have the same thing. \nThey all laugh. HANNA watches them nervously. \nEXT. CAFE. DAY \nThe meal finished, MICHAEL is alone, paying the bill. \nWAITRESS I hope your mother was happy. \nINT. STAIRWAY. SCHOOL. DAY \n1958. A sheriff's posse of sixteen-year old GIRLS, come laughing, blushing towards the classroom. One of them is talking excitedly to the other. \nSOPHIE I'm just going to pretend I've been here for years, I'm not going to behave in any special way. \nGIRL You just wait. You wait and see. \nThey smile together and head for the classroom. \nINT. SCHOOL. DAY \nThe BOYS are already in place, dotted round, as the GIRLS come in. There are cries of `Here they come'. Then the TEACHER comes in. \nTEACHER Good morning, ladies. Gentlemen, please welcome your new fellow- students, treat them with courtesy, please. \nNot far from MICHAEL, a GIRL sits across the aisle, virginal with brown hair, brown summer skin. \nSOPHIE Hello. My name's Sophie. \nMICHAEL I'm Michael. \nThe TEACHER comes in. The class quietens. \nINT. SCHOOL. DAY \nLater. The TEACHER is in full flow. MICHAEL can't take his eyes off SOPHIE. \nTEACHER Everyone believes that Homer's subject is homecoming. In fact, The Odyssey is a book about a journey. Home is a place you dream of, it's not a place you ever attain. \nThe TEACHER breaks off. \nTEACHER Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but we're meant to studying Homer, not studying Sophia. \nThe whole class cracks up. MICHAEL blushes. \nEXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY \nMICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the water. Around him, YOUNG PEOPLE are lounging round on towels. It's the social centre. HOLGER and RUDOLF are rubbing their hair with towels as SOPHIE approaches. \nHOLGER Michael the water's fantastic. \nMICHAEL It's wonderful, isn't it? \nHOLGER Wonderful. It's going to be a great summer. \nMICHAEL looks across to where a group of AMERICANS are shouting and playing a very loud game of volleyball. \nHOLGER Now the Americans have allowed us back in our own lake. \nSOPHIE Why are they so loud? \nHOLGER You should see their stores. They have everything. \nMICHAEL Oh sure. Everything mankind could ever dream of. \nSOPHIE You don't like Americans? \nMICHAEL Just it's more fun without them. \nHe looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden silence, MICHAEL looking straight at SOPHIE. SOPHIE looks down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff. \nMICHAEL So how will you decide? \nJULIA I don't know. I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose. \nMICHAEL You've seen your mother? \nJULIA nods. \nJULIA I wanted to get away. There was nothing more to it. It was Paris, but it could have been anywhere. \nMICHAEL Away from your parents? \nJULIA doesn't answer. \nMICHAEL I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't always open with you. I'm not open with anyone. \nJULIA I knew you were distant. I'd always assumed it was my fault. \nMICHAEL Julia. How wrong can you be? \nJULIA colours, on the verge of tears. Then she looks away. \nINT & EXT. CAR. NIGHT \nThey drive through the gleaming streets. It's been raining - Berlin is glistening. Their voices : \nMICHAEL I admit it now, I was nervous. \nJULIA I was nervous too. It's silly isn't it? \nMICHAEL It is silly. \nJULIA Thank you for dinner. \nMICHAEL I'll see you very soon. \nEXT. CAR. DAY \nMICHAEL lets JULIA out, and is watching her safely to her door from the car. \nJULIA Good night, Dad. \nMICHAEL suddenly gets out himself. \nMICHAEL Julia, wait. I want to ask you a favour. \nJULIA What favour? \nMICHAEL I want to take you on a trip. I want to show you something. \nJULIA When? \nMICHAEL Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up in the car? \nJULIA doesn't need to say anything. \nMICHAEL At ten, say. \nJULIA smiles. \nMICHAEL Then good. \nINT. TOWN HALL. DAY \nA courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side. As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and the others take places in the gallery \nCLERK All photographers are now asked to leave. \nThe PHOTOGRAPHERS go. \nJUDGE The defendants, please. \nFrom being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent. \nJUDGE The first thing I'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers. (MORE) \nJUDGE (cont'd) They're going to be arguing that there's no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial. \nDIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation. \nJUDGE I am going to take these cases one by one. \nMICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as MARTHE shakes a pen which isn't working. \nMICHAEL Do you want a pen? \nMARTHE I've got a pen. \nSo MICHAEL doesn't hear as the JUDGE speaks. \nJUDGE Hanna Schmitz. \nThere is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA, her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come very quietly, across a great distance. \nJUDGE Your name is Hanna Schmitz? \nHANNA Yes. \nIt is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks up, hearing it for the first time. \nJUDGE Can you speak louder please? \nHANNA My name is Hanna Schmitz. \nMICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring. \nJUDGE Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922? \nHANNA Yes. \nJUDGE At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old? \nHANNA Yes. \nJUDGE You joined the SS in 1943? \nHANNA Yes. \nJUDGE What was your reason? What was your reason for joining? \nHANNA doesn't answer. \nJUDGE You were working at the Siemens factory at the time? \nROHL Why? Why did you think it exciting? \nDIETER Because it's justice. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY \nThe train hurtles through the German countryside. \nINT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT \nA student party, in a candle-lit room. MARTHE is singing to a guitar. It's been going on for hours - the STUDENTS are on the floor with beer and cigarettes. The front door is open. DIETER, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can see MICHAEL bent away from them, all by himself. \nEXT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT \nMICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love. \nINT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY \nThe small STUDENT GROUP is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room. \nROHL I need to correct an impression. Dieter said yesterday this was about justice. But is it? (MORE) \nROHL (cont'd) If it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long? The war ended twenty years ago. Remember, there've been no significant trials between Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz trials a couple of years ago. That's a long gap. What's the reason for the gap? \nROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer. \nDIETER I'd have thought it was obvious. \nROHL Say. \nDIETER Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't it? It's bad conscience. It's the big cover-up. \nROHL Go on. \nDIETER After the war. The German people didn't want to look at what they'd done. \nROHL Is that right? \nDIETER Because they had too much to hide. All our parents are liars. All right, mine are. So it's left to us, isn't it? \nROHL How so? \nDIETER Because we're not implicated. \nROHL Aren't you? Good. So that's all right then. \nEveryone laughs. \nMARTHE No, but seriously, Dieter's right. My parents, I can't even talk to them. I don't love them. How could I? How could anyone love them? Because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. Isn't that why we signed up for this seminar? \nROHL I don't know. You tell me. \nMARTHE Speaking for myself. \nROHL Michael? \nMICHAEL I'm not sure any more. \nROHL is staring at him thoughtfully. \nROHL What did your father do, Dieter? \nHANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious. \nHANNA There were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. That's how we did it - every month. We'd all choose ten. \nJUDGE Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process? \nHANNA We all did. \nJUDGE Even though they've denied it? But you admit it. You're saying you took part in the process. \nThe other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is intent, following his own line. \nJUDGE Did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths? \nHe waits. HANNA nods slightly. \nHANNA Yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on. \nJUDGE I'm not sure you understand... \nHANNA We couldn't keep everyone. There wasn't room. \nThe JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem to understand his point. \nJUDGE No, but what I'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `You you and you have to be sent back to be killed.' \nHANNA Well, what would you have done? \nHANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly asks herself a question. \nHANNA So should I never have signed up at Siemens? \nINT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY \nMICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a CLERK leans in to the younger woman. \nCLERK Ms. Mather, they're ready for you now. \nThe two women go into the court. The door closes. \nINT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY \nMICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on. \nMICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one of a couple who isn't bothering to listen. \nPROSECUTOR In your book you describe the process of selection... \nILANA Yes. You were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to Auschwitz to be killed. \nPROSECUTOR Are there people here today who made that selection? \nILANA Yes. \nPROSECUTOR I need you to identify them. Can you please point them out? \nILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS. \nILANA Her. And her. And her. And her. And her. And her. \nThe last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA does not react. \nROHL is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading his patient to the heart of things. \nROHL How so? \nDIETER This didn't happen to the Germans. It happened to the Jews. \nEveryone is shocked at his violent passion. \nDIETER What are we trying to do? \nMICHAEL We're trying to understand. \nDIETER Six women locked    three hundred Jews in a church, and    let them burn. What is there to    understand? Tell me, I'm asking :    what is there to understand? \nMICHAEL can't answer. DIETER gets up, outraged now. \nDIETER I started out believing in this trial, I thought it was great, now I think it's just a diversion. \nROHL Yes? Diversion from what? \nDIETER You choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `They were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'. Brilliant! (MORE) \nDIETER (cont'd) Because one of the victims happened to write a book! That's why they're on trial and nobody else. Do you know how many camps there were in Europe? \nDIETER turns, furious. \nDIETER People go on about how much did everyone know? `Who knew?' `What did they know?' That isn't the question. The question is `How could you let it happen?' And - better - `Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?' \nOne of the group walks out. \nDIETER Thousands! That's how many. There were thousands of camps. Everyone knew. \nDIETER'S passion is so great that everyone is shaken. \nDIETER Look at that woman... \nMICHAEL Which woman? \nDIETER The woman you're always staring at. I'm sorry but you are. \nMICHAEL is white. The atmosphere is electric. \nMICHAEL I don't know which woman you mean. \nDIETER You know what I'd do? Put the gun in my hand, I'd shoot her myself. \nEXT. EMPTY ROAD. DAY \nMICHAEL walks along an empty wooded road, miles from anywhere. The sun is shining through the trees behind him. \nEXT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY \nThe wire fence of a concentration camp, deserted. MICHAEL, with a back-pack, goes alone through the metal gate. MICHAEL walks among the deserted empty huts. \nINT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY \nInside one of the huts, MICHAEL is by himself staring at a line of empty beds. He moves on, overwhelmed, lost. He passes through the showers. Then he comes to a room with vast metal cages on either side. In the cages, the countless dusty shoes of the exterminated. \nINT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY \nMICHAEL opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas ovens. He walks past them. Then he stands beside them, his head down. \nThe other DEFENDANTS interrupt to call out `She was in charge'. \nJUDGE Did you write the report? \nHANNA No. No. We all discussed what to say. We all wrote it together. \nBECKHART She wrote it! She wrote the report. She was in charge. \nJUDGE Is that true? \nHANNA No. And I didn't write the report. Does it matter who did? \nRITA BECKHART has called out from her place. The JUDGE looks at HANNA a moment. \nJUDGE I need to see a sample of your handwriting. \nHANNA My handwriting? \nJUDGE Yes. I need to establish who wrote the report. \nAt once HANNA'S COUNSEL rises. \nHANNA'S COUNSEL I'm sorry, but I really don't see how that's appropriate. Nearly twenty years have gone by. \nJUDGE Somebody take her this piece of paper. \nHANNA'S COUNSEL Are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago, with handwriting of today? \nJUDGE Give her the paper. Counsel, approach the bench. \nA piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of HANNA. Her COUNSEL moves to the bench. MICHAEL stares, first at her, then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him. \nINT & EXT. DAY AND NIGHT. FLASHBACKS \nMICHAEL thinks back, to HANNA in her bedroom saying `No you read', to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment. At this moment, MICHAEL realises she is illiterate. \nINT. COURTROOM. DAY \nBack in the courtroom, HANNA looks up to the JUDGE to stop the conference. \nHANNA There's no need. I wrote the report. \nMICHAEL, in a panic, pushes along his row, past ROHL and the others, who all look up, knowing something is going on. HANNA turns, as if sensing him behind her. \nINT. STAIRS. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY \nMICHAEL is sitting on the steps outside the lecture room. ROHL walks straight past him. \nROHL You've been skipping seminars. \nINT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY \nMICHAEL comes into the room and sits down, smoking a cigarette. ROHL waits. \nROHL So? \nMICHAEL looks at him. \nMICHAEL I have a piece of information. Concerning one of the defendants. Something they're not admitting. \nROHL What information? \nEXT. PRISON YARD. DAY \nMICHAEL turns away and heads back the way he came. \nINT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY \nHANNA looks round. Nobody is coming. She waits more. \nGUARD Time's up. \nINT. PRISON. EVE \nHANNA is still waiting. Then she is led back to her cell. \nINT. MARTHE'S ROOM. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT \nMICHAEL appears at the door of MARTHE'S room. She is working at her desk. He smiles and closes the door. \nMARTHE You've taken your time. \nThey kiss. She starts to pull his clothes off. He lets her. He makes no move to undress her. She takes all his clothes off until he is naked, and she remains clothed. He looks at her a moment, then takes her in his arms and they go down on the bed. They make love. \nINT. MARTHE'S ROOM. NIGHT \nMARTHE is apparently asleep, MICHAEL awake. As quietly as he can MICHAEL tries to slip away. \nMARTHE Where are you going? \nMICHAEL I'm sorry. I need to sleep by myself. \nINT. REMAND CELL. DAWN \nHANNA is standing naked at the sink, preparing herself for the day. \nINT. STUDENT DIGS. MICHAEL'S ROOM. DAWN \nMICHAEL is lying in his own bed, staring up at the ceiling, not able to sleep. MICHAEL reluctantly pushes back the cover and gets naked out of bed. Slowly he begins to dress. \nINT. REMAND CELL. DAY \nHANNA washes herself, naked. \nINT. STUDENT DIGS. DAY \nMICHAEL is dressed now. He stands in front of his mirror, adjusting his tie. \nINT. REMAND CELL. DAY \nHANNA stands in front of the mirror, tying her tie. There is a small, inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress - a black suit, a white blouse and black tie. She looks very formal. \nINT. PRISON. DAY \nHANNA is led through the prison by a GUARD. \nEXT. TOWN HALL. DAY \nA lot of people heading into the courtroom. As the seminar group goes in, MICHAEL hangs back. ROHL looks at him as he goes through the doors. MICHAEL is left outside, then goes to watch as the vans arrive. \nINT. COURTROOM. TOWN HALL. DAY \nHANNA and the PRISONERS are led into the court. HANNA'S suit is so formal that members of the public call out. `Nazi! Nazi!' DIETER leans in to MARTHE. HANNA walks on to her place. \nCARLA Were you really so unhappy? \nMICHAEL That's not what I'm saying. It's not what I meant. \nCARLA Well then? \nCARLA looks at him hard. \nMICHAEL You mustn't worry about Gertrud. I'm going to look after her. And anyway, let's face it, she's already a state prosecutor, she earns far more than I do. \nCARLA Michael, I'm not worried about Gertrud. I'm worried about you. \nINT. TRAIN. EVE \nExhausted by her day, JULIA is sleeping in MICHAEL'S arms. He looks down at her, full of love. \nEXT. SCHONEBERG. BERLIN. NIGHT \nOn the other side of a busy Berlin street full of traffic, MICHAEL holds JULIA'S hand, a loving father, to guide her across the street. \nINT. LANDING. GERTRUD'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. NIGHT \nGERTRUD has come to the door, a shrewd-looking intelligent woman, a little older than MICHAEL, very thin, in slacks and a blouse. MICHAEL is standing outside with JULIA. \nJULIA Hello Mummy. \nGERTRUD Hello beautiful. \nGERTRUD leans down and scoops JULIA up, kisses her. MICHAEL stands on the step, hovering. \nGERTRUD Do you mind if I don't ask you in? \nMICHAEL I don't mind at all. I've a lot to do, in fact. \nIt doesn't look like it. He stands, not going. \nMICHAEL I took her to see where I grew up. \nGERTRUD You went to the West? My God, what a trip. \nJULIA We went to say hello to granny. \nGERTRUD Oh. Daddy took you to see Carla, did he? \nJULIA She was strange. \nGERTRUD Come on, let's see what's on TV. \nGERTRUD gives JULIA her supper and puts her in front of the TV. Then she comes back to MICHAEL. \nGERTRUD I bet she was strange. \nMICHAEL You could say. \nGERTRUD She always was. Why on earth did you decide to do that? \nMICHAEL I don't know. Impulse. \nGERTRUD says nothing. \nMICHAEL I suppose if I'm honest we went because I wanted to re-establish contact. \nMS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE) You're Michael Berg? \nMICHAEL'S VOICE Yes. \nMS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE) You got my letter? \nMICHAEL I have it here. \nMS BRENNER (PHONE) As I say, Hanna Schmitz is coming up for release very soon. \nMICHAEL fingers the letter a moment. \nINT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. PRISON. DAY \nMS BRENNER is sitting at her desk in a simple, modern office. \nMS BRENNER Hanna has been in prison for over twenty years. She has no family. She has no friends. You're her only contact. And I'm told you don't visit her. \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY \nMICHAEL is sitting quite still. \nMICHAEL No. I don't. \nINT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. DAY \nMS BRENNER When she gets out, she's going to need a job. She's going to need somewhere to live. You can't imagine how frightening the modern world will seem to her. \nThere is a silence. \nMICHAEL Yes. I'm still here. \nINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY \nMS BRENNER I have no-one else to ask. If you don't take responsibility for her, then Hanna has no future at all. \nMICHAEL It's kind of you. Thank you for letting me know. \nMICHAEL puts the phone down. He looks as if he has just been handed a sentence. He gets up and stares at the wall which is now stacked with all the books he has read. Then he goes to his balcony. \nEXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY \nMICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony. \nEXT. PRISON. DAY \nMICHAEL walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to the guichet to sign in. \nEXT. PRISON YARD. DAY \nMICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let MICHAEL in. \nMS BRENNER You're Michael Berg? \nMICHAEL Yes. \nMS BRENNER Louisa Brenner. We were expecting you earlier. \nINT & EXT. STAIRS & PASSAGE. PRISON. DAY \nMS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES. \nMICHAEL I wasn't sure what you'd learnt. \nHANNA I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to read. \nMICHAEL stares, devastated. \nMICHAEL I'll pick you up next week, OK? \nHANNA That sounds a good plan. \nMICHAEL Good. Quietly, or shall we make a big fuss? \nHANNA Quietly. \nMICHAEL OK. Quietly. \nThey look at each other. The other PRISONERS have already gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward. \nHANNA Take care, kid. \nMICHAEL You too. \nThey walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of saying goodbye, she takes his hand. \nMICHAEL See you next week. \nShe stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand, then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone. \nEXT. PRISON. EVE \nMICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment, looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car. \nINT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE \nThe room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture. The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content. \nINT. CELL. DAWN \nHANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes. She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table. Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up. \nEXT & INT. PRISON. DAY \nMICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the GUARD who is in a modern office. \nINT. PRISON. DAY \nFrom the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen. \nINT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY \nThe two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table, a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins. \nMICHAEL She didn't pack. She never intended to leave. \nMS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the cassette machine. \nAbove the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees. One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations, articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school literature prize.' \nMS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet of paper from her suit pocket. \nMS BRENNER She left me a message, a sort of will. I'll read out the bit that concerns you. \nMICHAEL No. No. She taught herself to read when she was in prison. I sent her tapes. She'd always liked being read to. \nILANA shifts slightly. \nILANA Why don't you start by being honest with me? At least start that way. What was the nature of your friendship? \nMICHAEL When I was young I had an affair with Hanna. \nILANA looks at him for a moment. \nILANA I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg. Or rather, even if I could I'm not willing to. \nMICHAEL I was almost sixteen when I took up with her. The affair only lasted a summer. But. \nILANA But what? \nMICHAEL just looks at her. \nILANA I see. And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life? \nMICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time. \nMICHAEL She'd done much worse to other people. I've never told anyone. \nILANA People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these things. \nILANA looks at him, unrelenting. \nILANA What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps. Nothing. \nILANA looks at him, unrelenting. \nMICHAEL What she wanted...what she wanted was to leave you her money. I have with me. \nILANA To do what? \nMICHAEL As you think fit. \nMICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA. \nMICHAEL Here. \nILANA lifts the tin. \nILANA When I was a little girl, I had a tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite like this. It had Cyrillic lettering. I took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen. \nMICHAEL What was in it? \nILANA Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of hair from our dog. Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. It wasn't stolen for its contents. It was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it. \nShe sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin. \nILANA There's nothing I can do with this money. If I give it to anything associated with the extermination of the Jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something I'm neither willing nor in a position to grant. \nMICHAEL nods slightly. \nMICHAEL I was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy. \nILANA Good. \nThere's a silence. \n", "test1_input": "On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him. MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air. \nWhen he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands it to him. \nHANNA Wash your hair, I'll get you a towel. \nMICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out, turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He turns and faces her. \nHANNA So. That's why you came back. \nMICHAEL looks at her, awed. \nMICHAEL You're so incredibly beautiful. \nHANNA Now, kid, you know that's not true. \nAt once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time, she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise. \nINT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT \nThe family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA. \nPETER You've inconvenienced your mother. \nMICHAEL How many more times? I've said I'm sorry. \nPETER You scared her. \nMICHAEL It's hardly my fault, I got lost, that's all. That's why I was late. Can I have some more? \nHe reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this. \nEMILY How can anyone get lost in their own home town? \nMICHAEL The doctor told me I had to take walks. \nEMILY So? \nMICHAEL I meant to head for the castle, I ended up at the sports-field. \nEMILY They're in opposite directions. \nMICHAEL It's none of your business. \nEMILY He's lying. \nCARLA He's not lying. Michael never lies. \nCARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she's right. They all eat on for a few moments. \nMICHAEL Dad, I've decided, I want to go back to school tomorrow. \nCARLA The doctor says you need another three weeks. \nMICHAEL Well I'm going. \nCARLA Peter? \nPETER If he wants to go back, then he must. \nMICHAEL can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know what's going on. \n", "test1_true": "A massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving goodbye to his friends and running quickly away. \nINT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY \nMICHAEL comes quickly up the stairs. The door of HANNA'S apartment is ajar. He pushes it open. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nHANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about twenty seconds. He stands sweating. \nHANNA All right, kid, it's not just about you. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nThey are on the bed. He is lying underneath her. HANNA leads his hands to her face, then down her body. She begins to move, and in response, he moves too. He watches awed as she comes. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nHANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake, looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of the wood yard below. He kisses the birthmark. She stirs. \nMICHAEL What's your name? \nShe opens her eyes. A look of suspicion. \nHANNA What? \nMICHAEL Your name. \nHANNA Why do you want to know? \nMICHAEL I've been here three times. You haven't told me your name. \nMICHAEL waits a moment. \nHANNA It's Hanna. What's yours, kid? \nMICHAEL Michael. \nHANNA Michael. Hmm. So I'm with a Michael. \nHANNA smiles, as if there were something funny about it. \nMICHAEL `Hanna'. \nINT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAY \nA TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words `Odysseus', `Hamlet' and `Faust' on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across the way, RUDOLF. \nTEACHER The notion of secrecy is central to Western literature. You may say the whole idea of character in fiction is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons - sometimes perverse, sometimes noble - they are determined not to disclose. \nMICHAEL looks content. The bell goes. \nINT. CORRIDOR. SCHOOL. DAY \nThe BOYS come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and head to the next classroom. MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed. There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new. MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite direction, alone. \nEXT. SCHOOL.

What's wrong with you? \nHANNA What business is it of yours? \nShe has snapped at him, razor-like. \nMICHAEL It's always on your terms. Everything. We do what you want. It's always what you want. My friends were giving me a party! \nHANNA Well then why are you here? Go back to your party. Isn't that what you want? \nHANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed. \nMICHAEL And it's always me that has to apologize. \nSilence. HANNA lets time go by. Then : \nHANNA You don't have to apologize. No-one has to apologize. No-one can make you. \nHANNA reaches for a book from beside the bed. She throws it down on the cover. \nHANNA War and Peace, kid. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nHANNA is on the edge of the bath, running water. She has a pale blue flowered smock. She is running with sweat. The smock sticks to her. MICHAEL gets out a book. HANNA drops lavender oil into the bath. MICHAEL stands in the bath and she washes his body. \nINT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY \nThey are making love on the bed. It's intense. At one point she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she lets go. \nINT.

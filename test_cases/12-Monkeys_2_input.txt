DR. PETERS Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples. I have the appropriate papers. 
INT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT 
RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security. 
RAILLY Oh, God, we don't have time for this. 
ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of clothes and a Walkman. 
DR. PETERS Biological samples.  I have the paperwork right here. 
DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands. 
SECURITY OFFICER I'm going to have to ask you to open this, sir. 
DR. PETERS Open it? (blinks stupidly, then) Of course. 
DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it. 
There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE. 
SECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. 
ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the commotion. 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed glass tube out of the metal cylinder. 
DR. PETERS Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the papers -- it's all proper.  I have a permit. 
SECURITY OFFICER It's empty! 
Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it. 
DR. PETERS Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty! But I assure you, it's not. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER. 
RAILLY Please listen to me -- this is very urgent! 
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER You'll have to get in line, ma'am. 
TRAVELER We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so special about you? 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers. 
DR. PETERS You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye. 
A beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes, and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose! 
DR. PETERS It doesn't even have an odor. 
The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing, and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist. 
SECURITY OFFICER That's not necessary, sir.  Here you go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have a good flight. 
Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and shoves them back into his gym bag. 
ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her with his finger. 
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER Who are you calling a "moron"? 
COLE Get your hands off her! 
The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble. 
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns. 
FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE'S moustache is slipping.  COLE senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look. For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away. 
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away. 
SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.} HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT. 
DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen. 
The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS. 
DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants. 
ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he confronts the SECURITY OFFICER. 
COLE I said, get your hands off her.  She's not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a psychiatrist. 
RAILLY looks alarmed at that. 
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE has the photos in his hand. 
ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates. 
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS! 
RAILLY THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS!  STOP HIM! 
ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE MAN FROM HIS DREAM!

CARRIE I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months -- and -- for five months you kept a secret like that? 
MIRANDA I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out -- 
CARRIE Once? You tried to tell me once? You should have tried to tell me every single day! 
MIRANDA I know, I was looking for the right time. 
CARRIE There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage! 
The Room is now at "attention." 
MIRANDA It just happened -- I wasn't thinking. 
Carrie grabs her purse -- to leave. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Carrie, please -- Don't go -- I -- 
Carrie stands up -- the festive balloon strings bob in front of her face. She pushes them away. 
CARRIE And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever! 
She starts out. Stops, comes back -- through the ribbons. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) No, I'm lying. For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve. (beat) There. How does it feel? 
She turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts out. A KISSING COUPLE (20's) is BLOCKING her way. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Excuse me! 
They stop -- She squeezes by them. Miranda is devastated. 
191   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS -- WINTER 1 
Candles are lit. Samantha enters wearing a sexy sheer robe and carrying a giant tray of homemade sushi. The phone rings. The machine picks up. Smith leaves a message. 
SMITH (V.O.) Babe -- we're way behind on set. I still haven't been released. I'll get there as soon as I can. 
She SIGHS -- places the tray on the table. Looks at the wall clock: Seven-thirty. 
118A. 
192   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             192 
Eight o'clock. Samantha is sitting in the robe near the table. Not pleased. 
193   INT. BEACHOUSE/DINING ROOM -- LATER -- WINTER             193 
Eight-thirty -- Samantha is pacing. She takes a piece of sushi -- pops it in her mouth and chews -- pissed. A WOMAN MOANING is heard. She walks over and glances out the window into Dante's living room. Candles are everywhere -- he is naked and GIVING HEAD to naked BLONDE WOMAN. She is writhing in pleasure. Samantha watches -- even more pissed. 
CARRIE (V.O.) It was the same Valentine night Samantha had planned -- minus the sushi. 
194   INT. BEACHOUSE/KITCHEN -- LATER                            194 
Samantha now wearing sweat clothes, sits with her arms crossed -- waiting. The door opens and Smith enters. 
SMITH I'm home! 
He see's Samantha sitting there. He smiles. 
SMITH (CONT'D) (CONT'D) Man, that was a long day -- the crew went into double overtime. 
SAMANTHA You are three hours late. 
SMITH Bummer. I know. Did you eat? 
SAMANTHA Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I hand made for you. The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you. 
SMITH Why are you so upset? I called. 
SAMANTHA I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you. 
SMITH You made some sushi -- it's not a big deal! 
SAMANTHA Not a big deal? 
She stands up. She picks up some pieces of sushi. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) You see this -- This took me five fucking hours! 
She throws sushi at him. He dodges them. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I am not the type of woman who sits home all day waiting for a man! (beat) You love California so much -- enjoy your hand-made California roll! 
She throws more sushi and storms out. Smith looks at the subzero fridge. A sushi piece slides down the front.

196B   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                   196B 
A FLORAL ARRANGEMENT sits on the hall table next to the answering machine. A card reading: "I'm sorry -- Miranda" is nearby. The answering machine is recording an incoming call from Miranda. 
MIRANDA (V.O) It's me. Pick up. Are you there? 
Carrie is standing in the bathroom; looking out at the answering machine, brushing her teeth. 
CARRIE (V.O.) Three days of "I'm sorry" calls and e-mails and flowers -- and I still wasn't ready. It was the longest we'd even gone without speaking. 
120A. 
196C   EXT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY -- WINTER                  196C 
Rain. Carrie walks up to her stoop. A CAB idling in front. The cab window goes down. Miranda is sitting there. 
MIRANDA Carrie. 
Carrie looks. Stops. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Hi. I need to talk to you. 
CARRIE How long have you been waiting here? 
Miranda looks to the meter, then back to her. 
MIRANDA Seventeen dollars long. (beat) Please get in. It just turned to eighteen. 
Carrie looks at her, hesitates, starts over to the cab. 
196D   INT. CAB -- A LITTLE LATER                                196D 
Rain pours down the windows. Carrie and Miranda sit in silence. A MIDDLE EASTERN DRIVER sits behind the wheel. CLOSE ON: THE METER. It reads 22.00. 
This is weird not talking.

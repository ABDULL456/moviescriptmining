INT. CLEARING - NIGHT CUT 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters NATHAN'S bedroom. 
KYOKO is lying on NATHAN'S bed. 
She's naked.    On her back.   Legs open. 
Her head turns as CALEB enters. 
But apart from that, she doesn't react. 
CALEB walks to the line of long mirrored cabinets opposite the bed. 
He hesitates. 
Then pulls the first door open. 
LILY is inside. Standing upright.     Gazing back at him, frozen, blank eyed. 
CALEB goes to the next door and opens it. 
He sees a slender black girl, whose limbs are robotic, but whose torso and head are synthetic. 
He opens another door, and another, and another. 
Then steps back, into the middle of the room, and gazes at the line of android girls. 
Stunned. 
The camera drifts away from him. 
Then settles. 
In the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors, we can see KYOKO'S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed behind him. 
Like an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
CUT 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB stands above KYOKO'S naked form. He reaches out a hand. 
She takes it. 
He gently pulls her to a standing position. 
Then he moves her arms away from her body... 
... and sees, running under her arms in a straight contour, over her ribs, there is a faint line. 
He touches it with his finger. 
KYOKO steps back. 
But it's not a defensive action.    It's just to give her space... 
... as she reaches under her arm, and adjusts something unseen. And a moment later, the faint line that runs down each side of her torso is opening. As if unzipping. 
Then KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso, and pulls off the skin covering over her entire chest, in a single section from her collar bone, over the breasts, to her solar plexus. 
Revealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form. 
INT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
On the monitor screens, apparently unnoticed by CALEB, NATHAN is on the live CCTV feed. 
Making his way along the mezzanine. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
- CALEB. 
Transfixed, as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head. 
And finds something on the back of her head, at the nape of her neck, inside her hairline. 
Which unzips the skin around her jaw. 
Allowing her to remove her face. 
INT. HOUSE/DINING ROOM/ELEVATOR ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
NATHAN uses the glass wall to support himself. 
He reaches his door. Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD. 
But it isn't there. 
He checks his other pocket. 
NATHAN ... What the fuck? 
Suddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance, and crashes to the ground. 
Lands hard. 
Lies there for a moment. 
Groaning.   Blinking.    Catching his breath. 
Then sees the figure of CALEB standing over him.

THE HOOD (with his back still to Alan) How are you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady 
Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm 
going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain again) 
You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out again) You have something that belongs 
to me. 
PARKER Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't the first time my head's been pulverized. And it's never 
done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers on them and they cry out in pain 
louder this time) 
ALAN (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the guidance processor 
toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it over to him before it can hit the water) 
THE HOOD You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put them with the 
others. (Transom grabs Parker) 
MULLION (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws Lady 
Penelope over his shoulder) 
LADY PENELOPE Put me down! This outfit is couture. 
Scene switches to Thunderbird 5. 
JEFF Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open. 
Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and 
Parker. 
MULLION You need to cool off, milady. 
TINTIN Lady Penelope! 
LADY PENELOPE (To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite 
enough losing for one day. 
ALAN (To Fermat) So, how does it feel to be right all the time? 
FERMAT Not b-bad, actually. 
ALAN I'm so sorry, Fermat. 
FERMAT We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen. 
LADY PENELOPE Parker, I have an idea. 
PARKER Excellent, milady. 
LADY PENELOPE Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?

This is a fairly rundown beach area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants, and strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger stand. Over the stand is a faded sign: \"FAT SAM\u2019S HAMBURGERS\". A simple but haunting electronic melody plays in the b.g. \nINT. \"FAT SAM\u2019S\" \u2013 DAY 2Seated just inside the stand on a folding aluminum chair is a chubby man in his late thirties. He\u2019s wearing a stained valor sweat suit and a cap. This is Fat Sam. He\u2019s a dealer. Seated on the sand next to him is Fletch, a rangy man, early thirties, in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt, nodding idly on a battered Casio music machine which he treats lovingly. This is the source of the title music. FLETCH So what do you figure? FAT SAM No idea. FLETCH No idea at all? FAT SAM Okay. Some idea. FLETCH Like when? FAT SAM Like tonight. FLETCH For sure? FAT SAM No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some $hit? FLETCH I think I\u2019d rather have drugs. \nCONTINUED \nFAT SAM \n(shakes head and smiles) \nFletch\u2026 \nFLETCH \nSorry. I find a little humor really brightens \nthings up around here, don\u2019t you? \nA young junkie with a black eye \u2013 Gummy \u2013 passes. \nGUMMY \nHi Sam. Hi Fletch. \nFLETCH \nHi Gummy. How\u2019s the eye? \nGUMMY \nIt\u2019s okay. The cops did it. \nFLETCH \nI know. \nGUMMY \nThey busted me last week. \nFLETCH \nThey bust you every week. \nGUMMY \nI know. I got bad luck or something. \nSTANWYK (shakes his hand) Alan Stanwyk. \nFLETCH Charmed. \n9 EXT. BERMAN STREET - BEVERLY HILLS - DAY \n---A Jaguar XJ sedan goes up Berman Street, a dead end.  Fletch's hand reaches out ---of the passenger window and empties sand out of a sneaker. \n10 INT. JAGURE - DAY \nFLETCH I always liked this part of town. \n11 EXT. BERMAN STREET - DAY \n---The Jaguar continues on up Berman Street, stopping before massive iron gates ---marked PRIVATE PROPERTY -- NO TRESPASSING -- STANWYK. The gates open ---electronically. \n12 EXT. STANWYK HOUSE - DAY \n---The jaguar goes up the center of the drive toward a white-pillared mansion. The ---lawns and planting are spectacular. \n13 INT. JAGUAR - DAY \n---Fletch stares out the window. \nFLETCH What a coincidence. \n---The car stops before the house. \nSTANWYK What? \n14 EXT. HOUSE - DAY \n---as they get out of the car. \nFLETCH I came this close... (holds fingers slightly apart) ...to buying this place \n---Stanwyk ignores Fletch and starts toward the house. Fletch follows. \nFLETCH Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me. \nSTANWYK Who? \nFLETCH Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange. \n---Stanwyk stops before the front door, stares at Fletch \nSTANWYK What are you, doped up or something? \n---Fletch abruptly changes gears, stares at Stanwyk \nFLETCH I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that. \nSTANWYK (after a beat) Come inside. \n15 INT. HOUSE - DAY \n---Stanwyk and Fletch enter. A Mexican Maid crosses. \nSTANWYK Buenas dias. \nMAID Buenas dias. \nShe disappeared. \nFLETCH I commend you on your Spanish. \n---Stanwyk doesn't reply, keeps on walking. He opens a set of double doors to the ---left of the winding staircase, then stands to one side, indicating that Fletch ---should enter. \n16 INT. LIBRARY - DAY \n---Massive fireplace. Everything built in teak. Fletch enters, and Stanwyk closes ---the door behind them. \nFLETCH Ahh, the library. Masculine but sensitive. \n---Stanwyk wordlessly goes behind the desk \nFLETCH Really, I love what you've done with the place. Must have cost you...hundreds. \n---Stanwyk turns, looks out a pair of French doors behind his desk, then turns ---back. \nFLETCH Oh, I hate it when he calls me that. \nWALKER Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story! \nFLETCH I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay? \nWALKER No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday? \nFLETCH I never read the paper. \nWALKER ...never reads the paper... \nWalker goes through a pile of unread newspapers on Fletch's desk, finds the Sunday paper. \nFLETCH What's the spread on the game tonight? \nWALKER I don't know. (holds up paper) Look! \nFLETCH Looks great. \n42 INSERT - AD \nA full-page ad. \nNEXT WEEK A \"JANE DOE\" SPECIAL REPORT: DRUGS ON OUR BEACHES - SHAME OF THE CITY \n43 MASTER \nFLETCH 'Shame of Our City' is so good. \nWALKER Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story. \nFLETCH Why not? Oh $hit...really? \nWalker just stares at him. \nFLETCH Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it. \nWALKER You broke it? You know the source? \nFLETCH Practically. \n44 WALKER \nready to kill. \nWALKER What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him.... \n45 MASTER \nFLETCH I have pictures of him. Dealing.... \nWALKER So let's go! We run the pictures. \nFLETCH He's not the story! There's a source behind him. \nWALKER Who? \nFLETCH Well, there we're in a gray area. \nWALKER How gray? \nFLETCH I'd say charcoal. \nWALKER (straining for control) I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that? \nFLETCH Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God. (to himself as he exits) I hope. \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER CLIPPING \nALAN STANWYK NEW V/P BOYD AVIATION \nA photograph of Stanwyk; a head shot. Hands turn the clipping paper. Next clipping: a social page spread on the wedding of Alan Stanwyk. (\"GAIL BOYD WED TO ALAN STANWYK.\") \nLARRY (V.O.) Everything's recent. \n47 FLETCH AND LARRY \nFletch and Larry examine the file. \nDR. DOLEN Joan or Margaret Smith. \nFLETCH Right. \nDR. DOLEN Well, which one? \nFLETCH Margaret. \nDR. DOLEN Funny old bird. \nFLETCH Is she ever. I've got some stories.... \nDR. DOLEN I'll bet. Shame about Ed. \nFLETCH (vamping) It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly. \nDR. DOLEN Oh, he was dying for years. \nFLETCH Sure, but the end was so sudden. \nDR. DOLEN He was in intensive care for eight weeks. \nFLETCH Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. (quickly) You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy. \nDR. DOLEN Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar. \nFLETCH Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that.... \nDR. DOLEN Just relax.... \nFLETCH Honest, I feel fine. You better be married. \nFletch looks alarmed as Dolan pushes him into position. Dolan puts on a plastic glove. \n53 CLOSE - FLETCH \nFLETCH Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- (as Dolan starts to probe from behind) Ever serve time? \nDR. DOLEN Breathe easy.... \nFLETCH Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family. \nDR. DOLEN (noncommittally) There is? \nFLETCH Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist? \nDR. DOLEN Just relax. \nFLETCH (reacts to a poke) Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right? \nDR. DOLEN I can't discuss another patient. You know that. (rising into frame and washing up) Well, I can't find anything wrong with you. \nFLETCH I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you? \nDR. DOLEN Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now. \nFLETCH I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove? \nDR. DOLEN Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements. \nFLETCH Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant. \n54 INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nFletch is dressed in shorts, a clean shirt, and is carrying a doctor's bag. He is wearing a stethoscope around his neck , has a beeper on, a lot of pencils and other doctor gadgets. He's standing at the directory \n55 DIRECTORY \nCombing it with his eyes, he sees the directory: \nPATHOLOGY - THIRD FLOOR B. ROSENSTIEN, M.D. H. ROSENBLATT, M.D. P. ROSENWOHL, M.D. \nFletch goes to a door marked \"Stairs.\" \n56 INT. STAIRWELL - DAY \nFletch abruptly empties his doctor's bag and puts on a long green gown, a cap and a face mask. He plugs the stethoscope in his ears, removes miscellaneous file folders filled with papers, closes the bag, and heads for Pathology. \n57 INT PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT - DAY \nHe puts the bag over his mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation with her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g. looking over, but does not come into the records room or question what's happening). \nRECORDS NURSE Is there anything particular you're looking for? \nFLETCH My associates did a biopsy on this man recently. (thumbs through file) He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it. \nRECORDS NURSE (taking the file) Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. (searches) Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign. \nFLETCH That's it? \nRECORDS NURSE (shows him the file) That's it. \nFLETCH (reading it) This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer. \nRECORDS NURSE I guess not. \nFLETCH (very puzzled) He'll be so relieved. \n60 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nFletch pulls up in front of his building, a 1970's cinderblock apartment complex. Fletch parks his car halfway up the curb, gets out and spots a Mercedes coupe. He starts running toward the rear of his building. \n61 EXT. REAR OF THE BUILDING - DAY \nFletch starts climbing up the fire escape of his building. \n62 FIRE ESCAPE - DAY \nFletch reaches the second floor. He's huffing and puffing. \nFLETCH Christ. \n63 REVERSE \nAttorney Charles Gillett is waiting for him on the second floor fire escape. Gillett smiles. \nGILLETT Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch. \n64 MASTER \nFLETCH What about breaking and entering? (points to Gillett's coat) Are you wearing anything under that? \nGILLETT I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband. \nFLETCH I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside. \nFletch takes out a credit card and jimmies open the lock on the window. \n65 INT. FLETCH'S APARTMENT - DAY \nFletch climbs in through the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is just barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the wall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett. \nFLETCH One on one? \nGillett shakes his head. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic globe lamb crashing to the floor. \nFLETCH And the foul. \nFletch takes a second, successful shot. \nGILLETT You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars. \nFLETCH (still playing b-ball) She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it. \nGILLETT I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence. \nFLETCH It stinks. I thought woman were independent now. \nGILLETT Until she remarries, Fletch. \nFLETCH Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this. \nGILLETT I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out. \nFLETCH She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that.... \nGILLETT You should have proved that in a court of law. \nFLETCH My lawyer was a bum. \nThere's Fletch, his hair in an Afro, dressed in Laker gold. He's on the receiving end of a Jabbar pass, making an easy layup. \nHEARN (V.O.) Gosh, he makes it look so easy! \n75 FLETCH \nasleep, smiling. \n77 PRICATICE COURT - DAY \nGail Stanwyk is on the other side of the net, loading tennis balls into the automatic serve machine. She is in her late twenties and quite attractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we see here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up to the entrance of the court. \nFLETCH Gail Stanwyk! \nShe looks up. He enters the court with great delight. \nFLETCH (continuing) I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great. \nMRS. STANWYK (genuinely pleased) I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are. \nFLETCH Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours. \nMRS. STANWYK Oh, mine! Thank God. (furrows her brow) Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's? \nFLETCH We used to fly together. I'm...John. \nMRS. STANWYK (snaps her fingers in happy recognition) John! You used to fly together! \nHer smile segues right into an \"I'm sorry, bit I give up\" expression. \nMRS. STANWYK John who? \nFLETCH John Ultrarelamensky. \nMRS. STANWYK (bursts out in laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really. \nFLETCH It's Scotch-Rumanian. \nMRS. STANWYK (still loading tennis balls) That's a strange combination. \nFLETCH So were my parents. \nMRS. STANWYK Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little. \nFLETCH Please. \nAs Mrs. Stanwyk crosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch. \nWAITER Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club? \nFLETCH Yes, I'm with the Underhills. \nWAITER They just left, sir. \nFLETCH They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis. \nWAITER Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill. \nFLETCH Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich. \nWAITER Very good sir. \nThe Waiter leaves, and Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving machine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get the racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in her life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a tennis ball in this century. \nMRS. STANWYK Damn, I thought I had that one. \nFLETCH You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan? \nMRS. STANWYK What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. \nFLETCH Preoccupied with what? \nMRS. STANWYK Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one! \nIndeed, she has. Strait up. She and Fletch crane their necks upward to follow it's flight. \nFLETCH Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game. \nShe completely misses the next one. \nFLETCH Gummy and two cops.... \nand OMITTED \n104 INT. FRANK WALKER'S OFFICE - DAY \nFLETCH Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here. \nWALKER Your onto something. That's good. What? \nFLETCH I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow? \nLarry, knocks on the door. \nWALKER What do you want? \nLarry points to Fletch. \nWALKER Speak, don't point! \nLARRY I need Fletch for a second. \nFLETCH She needs me, Frank. \nFletch turns to Larry. Push to two shot. \nLARRY Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did --- \nFLETCH That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while. \nLarry starts to exit. \nWALKER Just give me a hint, all right? \nFLETCH All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this. \nLARRY (stopping in the doorway) Did you say cops? \nFLETCH Yeah. \nLARRY That's one thing I did find. It's from Last month, so it was in the unsorted pile. \nShe hands Fletch a clipping. \n105 INSERT - CLIPPING \nIt is an article and photograph of the newly-appointed citizens on the Police Advisory Board. One of them is Alan Stanwyk. \nWALKER What's that? \n106 MASTER \nFletch pockets the photo. \nFLETCH (puzzled) More cops. (then) I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank. \nWALKER Utah? \nFLETCH Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures. \nWALKER What about finding the source? \nFLETCH I have some ideas. \nWALKER Who? Donnie and Marie? \nFLETCH Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt. \nWALKER Go to transportation, get a ticket. \nLARRY (to Fletch as he exits) My hero. \nFLETCH Nothing to it. \n107 EXT. PROVO, UTAH - AIRPORT -DAY \nA Western Airlines flight arrives. \n107-A EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK \nFLETCH Roll over. Play dead. Good boy. \nFletch now grabs hold of the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls himself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the vulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and the going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary eye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and closer to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside. \nFLETCH You any relation to Doctor Dolan? \nNow he's at the window. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance from the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't believe it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window with his elbow. \nFLETCH I hate this. \nHe climbs into the darkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around the fenced in yard that surrounds the house. \n123 INT SWARTHOUT'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT \nFletch tiptoes though the upstairs bedroom and down the stairs. From outside, he can still hear the dog snarling and barking. \n124 INT. SWARTHOUT'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT \nAs Fletch passes through the living room he sees the dog snarling at him through the living room window. \n125 INT. SWARTHOUT'S DEN - NIGHT \nFletch enters and looks around. \nThe dog is now outside the den window. \nFLETCH Make sure nobody comes in, okay? \nHe goes to the file cabinet and opens it. \nHe flips through the \"S\" section. \"Stanwyk\". He pulls it. He thumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking for. A copy of a deed. He pulls it out. \n125-A INSERT - DEED - CLOSE ON THE PURCHASE PRICE \nThree Thousand Dollars. \nFLETCH (O.S.) So much for your three million dollar ranch. \n126 FLETCH \ntakes out a tiny document camera -- the kind spies use in the movies -- and loads it fumblingly. Then he props the deed up on top of the file cabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he snaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound. \n127 WINDOW \nThe murderous Doberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window, sending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room to rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds. \n128 MASTER \nFletch bolts and the dog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all the files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and runs through it just as the dog slams into it. \n129 INT. KITCHEN \nFletch is now holed up in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full course of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees that he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in order to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that would allow the dog to get in. \nLooking around frantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming of the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props under the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of the door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get in, and he makes his break for the window. \nHe vaults up onto the counter top and is just about to break the window when he sees that the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening the door. \nFletch knows he has only seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door of the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the snarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at it. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet mignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large bucket of cranberry sauce on the dog. \nFLETCH Suck on this Cujo! \nThen he dumps an equally large bucket of mashed potatoes. With the dog temporarily vision-impaired, Fletch bolts. \n130 EXT. SWARTHOUT HOUSE - NIGHT \nFletch runs as fast as humanly possible towards his car, fishing for his keys as he goes. The dog -- having shaken off the people-food from his hateful face -- is seconds behind and closing. \nFletch makes it to his car, hops inside, and slams the door just as the dog leaps furiously at the windshield. \n131 INT. FLETCH'S CAR \nFletch makes it to his car, huffing and puffing. The dog jumps across the closed window, snarling and bug-eyed with hatred. \nFletch smiles, waves at the dog, and starts taking its picture with his little camera. \nFLETCH Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one... (starting the car) Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap.... \nFletch is ready to pull out, but the dog is still leaping madly at the window. Fletch points back to the house. \nFLETCH Fletch F. Fletch \nCUMMINGS (skeptical but patient) I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch? \nFLETCH I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation. \nCummings just stares at Fletch. \nCUMMINGS Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch? \nFLETCH Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. \nCUMMINGS For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin.... \nFLETCH It was planted on me, sir. \nCUMMINGS We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want...Jane Doe? \nHe suddenly kicks Fletch's chair out from under him. Fletch falls to the floor. \nCUMMINGS Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. \nFletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down. \nCUMMINGS I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men. \nFLETCH 'Your men' might just be involved in all this. \nCUMMINGS You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops. \nCummings picks Fletch up, and holds him by the lapels. \nCUMMINGS If you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just a little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder. And if you print your story this week, you might get some of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch. \nHe throws Fletch against the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the floor. \nCUMMINGS You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it. \nFLETCH (picks up a picture) Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great. \nFletch takes the picture and hurls it across the room. It smashes into the opposite wall and shatters. \nFLETCH I don't like Tommy Lasorda. \nand OMITTED \n140 JAIL CORRIDOR \nFletch is tossed into an empty cell by the two Cops who brought him in. Cummings watches. The two Cops leave, and we see that all the cells in this corridor are empty. \nFLETCH You can't keep me here. \nCUMMINGS Maybe I'm not going to keep you here. (takes out a gun) Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out. \nFLETCH I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights. \nThe Chief takes a knife out of his pocket, holding it with a handkerchief. \nCUMMINGS After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way. \nFLETCH My God, you're serious. \nCUMMINGS Ask anybody. \nFLETCH Can I ask anybody now? \nCummings looks down the corridor. Deserted. \nFLETCH Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her. \nCUMMINGS (cocks the gun) What'll it be Fletch? \nFletch looks in Cummings' eyes. They are steely and cold. He is quite serious. \nFLETCH I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you? \nCUMMINGS (opening the cell) Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column. \nFletch walks out of the cell. Cummings walks with him through the empty corridor to the exit. \n154 OMITTED and \n156 EXT. CABANA ONE \nA little Spanish bungalow-type affair. Old California money-style elegance. Fletch rings the bell. \nMRS. STANWYK (V.O.) Who is it? \nFLETCH It's John. John... (forgets name) Znhcneelsky. \nMRS. STANWYK John Ultramalensky? \nShe opens the door, clad only in a towel. A towel is wrapped around her head. She seems surprised, but not displeased, to see Fletch. She also seems a little at a loss for words. \nFLETCH Hi. \nMRS. STANWYK (finally) Hi. \nFLETCH I was hoping you'd say that. \nThey have just shaken hands, and Fletch notices his hand is now sopping wet. \nMRS. STANWYK Uh...I'm just out of the shower. \nFLETCH Can I borrow your towel for a minute? \nShe laughs a nervous little laugh. There is a bit of sexual tension here. \nMRS. STANWYK I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think...What do you want? \nFLETCH I ordered lunch. \nMRS. STANWYK You ordered it here? \nFLETCH Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be. \nMRS. STANWYK Down boy. \nWith a nervous glance in both directions, she lets him in and closes the door behind them. \n157 INT. CABANA \nThey stand there for a few seconds looking at each other. \nMRS. STANWYK I really should change. \nFLETCH No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today. \nMRS. STANWYK I mean put clothes on. \nFLETCH Here, take mine. \nHe starts to take off his shirt. She is amused, and responds playfully, but firmly. \nMRS. STANWYK Stop that! \nHe does. \nMRS. STANWYK Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? \nFLETCH Yes. \nShe stands there, looking around, trying to act as if her heartbeat weren't speeding up. \nSFX: Knock at door. \nFLETCH Lunch.... \nMRS. STANWYK God.... \nShe goes sprinting into the bathroom. \nFLETCH Come on in. \nThe door opens. A second Waiter, Mexican, solemnly wheels in a cart bearing the goodies ordered by Fletch. The twin bottle of Dom Perignon juts from a silver ice bucket. \nWAITER You want I set up? \nFLETCH No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill. \nMRS. STANWYK He never sees them and I never met them. \nFLETCH How come? \nSFX: Insistent knock at door. \nFletch and Mrs. Stanwyk freeze. \nMRS. STANWYK Yes? \nMR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here...I'm a new member. \nFletch rises. \nFLETCH Thanks for the great time. \nMRS. STANWYK (sotto voice) What is this? \nFLETCH Long story. \nMR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill. \nMRS. STANWYK (hissing) John! \nFletch starts pushing the lunch table towards the bathroom. \nMRS. STANWYK You don't know the Underhills? \nMR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you. \nMRS. STANWYK I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute? \nMR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Of course. \nMrs. Stanwyk follows Fletch into the bathroom. \n160 INT BATHROOM \nFletch jams the cart into the bathroom. \nFLETCH Take one end. \nMrs. Stanwyk lifts one side of the cart. They lift it and put it up into the bathtub. There's a window in the bathroom. Fletch opens it. \nFLETCH I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. \nMRS. STANWYK I think you should call me Gail, now. \nFLETCH Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him. \nMRS. STANWYK Why did you do it? \nFletch shrugs, smiles. \nMRS. STANWYK A four hundred dollar lunch tab! \nFLETCH Yeah. \nMRS. STANWYK I'll cover it. You have any other surprises? \nFLETCH (after a beat) Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding. \nShe stares at him. \nMRS. STANWYK Who. \nFLETCH Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. \nA long beat. \nMRS. STANWYK So? \nFLETCH So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth. \nMRS. STANWYK What are you talking about? \nFLETCH That's what I want to know. \n161 EXT. CABANA \nTEENAGER Okay, okay, just stop, will you. I admit it. I stole it. I was just taking it for a little joy ride, that's all.... \nFLETCH Holy sh*t. \n191-B EXT. CAR \nFletch squeals around a corner, runs a light, and booms into the parking lot of a large Holiday Inn. He's a few seconds ahead of the cops. \nFLETCH Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat. \nFletch pops his hat on the kid's head, and runs off. \n192 EXT. HOLIDAY INN \nFletch runs into the kitchen entrance of the Holiday Inn. \n193 INT. HOLIDAY INN KITCHEN \nFletch picks up a case of vegetables and walks through as if he belonged there. \nMoments later, two cops enter. \n194 THE COPS \ncan't see him because of the crate. \n195 INT. HOLIDAY INN - BANQUET ROOM \nA testimonial dinner is in progress. A sign on the wall reads: \nTRB SYSTEMS SALUTES FRED DORFMAN 40 YEARS OF SERVICE \nThirty tables of conservatively dressed, older men and women are enjoying lunch. Fletch enters from the kitchen followed by several waiters and busboys. He looks over his shoulder. \n196 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - KITCHEN \nTwo cops are in hot pursuit. \n197 FLETCH \nmoves into the middle of the tables as a florid fat Speaker at the dais drones on. \nSPEAKER ...and he can truly be called the Father of Internal Bushings. \nA round of applause which Fletch joins heartily, as he quickly sits in the audience at an empty seat at a table in the center. \nFLETCH (to his table) Hello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked? \nFletch looks to the kitchen entrance and sees two cops scanning the crowd. One signals to the opposite door. \n198 DOOR \nFour more cops converge, looking for Fletch. Distant sirens indicate even more. \n199 MASTER \nSPEAKER And now a man who needs no further introduction.... \nThe police spot Fletch and start moving forward. Fletch stands up. A spotlight swings onto him. \nFLETCH Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong friend of.... (looks at banner) ...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here. \n200 DIAS \nFred Dorfman turns to the people on either side of him and whispers, obviously wondering who the hell this guy is. \n201 FLETCH \nThe cops are hesitant to move in. They wait for Fletch to finish and get out of the light. \nFLETCH Many of you are probably not aware of Freddie's lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent Association. \n202 POLICE \nlook at each other, sensing a trick, and start to move in. \n203 FLETCH \ngoing for broke. \nFletch enters. \n213 FLETCH's POINT OF VIEW - LIVING ROOM \nThe shelves are bare. Furniture is in place. \n214 MASTER \nFletch enters the kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. Inside is a can of coffee, and some vegetables. Fletch leaves the kitchen and heads for the bedroom. We follow him as he enters the bedroom. \n215 INT. BEDROOM \nFletch opens the closet. It's bare. He pulls open the drawers. Nothing. Fletch gets down and looks under the bed. \nVOICE Who the hell are you? \nIn his surprise, Fletch bangs his head as he starts up. \n216 REVERSE \nAt the door stands a gruff-looking Man in a red and black hunter's jacket, overalls, and a hat with earflaps. He holds a rifle. \nMAN Get up. \n217 MASTER \nFletch gets up. \nFLETCH The door was unlocked. \nMAN Lock's busted. \nFLETCH No wonder. \nMAN I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place. \nFLETCH I commend him on his choice. \nMAN What? \nFLETCH I commend him on his choice \nThe Man stares at him, holding the gun. He's not the brightest guy in the world, and Fletch has already caught on to that. \nFLETCH I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh. \nMAN Who are you? \nFLETCH Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's. \nThe Man just stares at Fletch. Fletch starts to move ever so slightly, testing his freedom of movement. \nFLETCH Where is she? \nMAN Moved out. \nFLETCH She moved out? \nThe Man nods and cocks the weapon. Fletch stops his tentative movements and just looks around the room \nFLETCH I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything. \nMAN She moved out. \nFLETCH So you're saying she moved out. \nMAN This morning. \nFLETCH This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over. \nThe Man continues to gaze unblinkingly at Fletch, holding the rifle. \nMAN What did you want under the bed? \nFLETCH Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon. \nMAN I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops. \nFLETCH I'm her cousin. \nThis is all news to Fletch, but he covers his surprise. \nFLETCH Isn't that nice. Since when? \nMARVIN Since he moved to L.A. \nFletch is very interested in all this. \nFLETCH Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo. \nMARVIN What the hell does this have to do with insurance? \nFLETCH Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy. \nMARVIN Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his. \nVELMA Cute young thing, too. \nFLETCH I'm sorry? \nVELMA His bride. Cute as a button. \nFLETCH You've met her? \nMARVIN Well, of course we have. He brings her with him. \nFletch is getting very puzzled and very concerned about all this. \nFLETCH Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh? \nMarvin and Velma exchange the oddest of glances between them. \nFLETCH Has he? \nMARVIN Boy, what the hell's the matter with you? \nFLETCH Then he has. \nMARVIN Course he has. That's his wife. \nYou could knock Fletch over with a straw. Again, he quickly recovers. \nFLETCH Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh? \nVELMA Cute thing. \nFLETCH (starting to sweat a little) Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife? \nVELMA Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some. \nVelma rummages through a family album on a side table as Fletch tried to sort all this out in his mind. She brings a photo over to him. He looks at it. \n223 INSERT - PHOTO \nIt's a wedding photo of Alan and a woman we have not seen. She is brunette and quite unlike Gail. Alan wears a similar sh*t-eating grin, and makes a similar thumbs-up gesture to the wedding photo with Gail that Fletch saw in Boyd's office. \n224 FLETCH \nHe sighs. \nFLETCH And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann. \nMARVIN Of course they are. \nVELMA She's cute as a button. \nFLETCH How long have they been married? \nMARVIN Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A...four years April. \nFLETCH Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --- \nVELMA Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception? \nFLETCH (rising) No, thank you. \nVELMA How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party? \nExit Fletch. \nMRS. STANWYK Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... \nFLETCH Gail, please. \nShe sits in a chair. he hands her the wedding photo. \nFLETCH I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time. \nFirst she looks at Fletch with puzzlement. Then, she looks at the photo and can't seem to decide what to think of it. But she knows it's bad. \nMRS. STANWYK What is this.... \nFLETCH I checked. There was no divorce. \nMRS. STANWYK Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist??? \nFLETCH I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. \nShe is stunned. \nFLETCH And they're leaving the country tomorrow night. \nMRS. STANWYK (rocked) Bastard. \nFLETCH I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow. \nMRS. STANWYK I'm calling the police. Right now. \nFLETCH You cant do that. \nMRS. STANWYK Don't tell me I can't --- \nFLETCH They're trying to kill me! \nShe is taken aback by that, but there is a determination in her eyes. \nMRS. STANWYK Your twenty-four hours are up, Fletch. \nShe starts for the phone, but he stops her. \nFLETCH You're going to have to trust me, Gail. You have to. Now listen to me: he's expecting you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house. \nThere is a long beat. \nMRS. STANWYK I'm terrified. \nFLETCH Come here. \nHe puts his arms around her and holds her tight against him. After a few seconds she raises her head and turns the hug into a kiss. Then the kiss turns passionate. \nDISSOLVE TO \n233 FRISBEE \nsails across the surf. \n234 EXT. BEACH - DAY - WIDER \nThe usual scene-- a mix of teeny-boppers, junkies and surfers. Into the f.g. step a couple of \"surfers.\" They're wearing wet suits and carrying surfboards, but they're obviously cops. They sit down. Across the beach, a Sufi, dressed in a turban and flowing garments, crosses the sand. \nSURFER COP A Sufi junkie. \nThe cops laugh derisively and turn their attention else-where. \n235 CLOSER ON SUFI \nIt's Fletch. he's got a beard pasted on, and nervously scans the beach. \n236 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - GUMMY \nis seated on a towel. \n237 MASTER \nFletch sits near, but not next to, Gummy. \nFLETCH Gum? \nGummy looks around. \nFAT SAM Thought so. What for? \nFLETCH For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a deposition. \nFAT SAM (smiles) You gonna nail the chief? \nFLETCH I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --- \nFAT SAM Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort. \nFLETCH You don't have a piece of the action? \nFAT SAM Noooo. Free snort. That's it. \nFLETCH (hands him a card) Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that. \nFAT SAM Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch? \nFLETCH What? \nFAT SAM You find the source? \nFLETCH Gum thought Brazil. \nFAT SAM Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive. \nand OMITTED \n241 INT. NEWSPAPER - CITY ROOM \nFletch parades through the city room, still in his Sufi getup. He takes off the beard and heads for Frank Walker's office. Fat Sam and Gummy, looking like fish out of water, follow him. \n242 WALKER'S OFFICE \nFletch marches in with Sam and Gummy. Walker gawks at him. \nWALKER Fletch.... \nFletch takes off the turban. \nFLETCH I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight. \nWALKER What? (stares at Fat Sam and Gummy) Who the hell are they? \nFLETCH This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. (hands two sheets of paper to Walker) \nWALKER What.... \nFLETCH Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship. \nWalker just stares at the sheets. \nWALKER Jesus H. Christ. (smiles) Fletch, this is the greatest. \nFAT SAM He's some reporter, this guy. \nFLETCH I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. \nWALKER Fletch, I got nervous. Please.... \nFLETCH Forget it. \nFletch takes off his robe and drops it to the floor. Beneath the robes he's wearing cutoffs and a Bob McAdoo t-shirt. \nFLETCH I'm going to write the story. Just hold the last couple of paragraphs till ten o'clock tonight. \nFletch leaves the office. \nFLETCH (to Fat Sam and Gummy) Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but don't leave the office. \n243 CORRIDOR \nFletch heads for his office. Walker follows. \nWALKER Fletch! \nFletch doesn't answer. \n244 FLETCH'S OFFICE \n256 INSERT LETTER \nWe see that it is addressed to: \nJOHN BOYD CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD BOYD AVIATION \n257 STANWYK \nMR. STANYK (reading) 'Dear Sir: Alan Stanwyk murdered me tonight. The charred remains found by the police in the Jaguar are mine, not his. Mr. Stanwyk, using my name and passport, boarded Pan Am Flight 306 for Rio, where he intends to establish residence with ---' \nHe stares at Fletch. \n258 FLETCH \nHe is lifting Stanwyk's two attach\u00e9 cases. \nFLETCH Pretty hefty. Keep reading. \n259 STANWYK \nMR. STANWYK (reading) '...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.' \nStanwyk stops. He's stunned, and not about to read anymore of this. \nGAIL'S VOICE (O.S.) Keep reading, Alan. \nStanwyk spins to the doorway. \n259-A GAIL STANWYK \nstanding in the doorway. \nMRS. STANWYK Don't worry, I can take it. \n260 MASTER \nFLETCH You shouldn't be here. \nMRS. STANWYK I want to hear this. \nFletch takes the letter from Alan. \nFLETCH He doesn't read my stuff well. (reads) 'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.' (aside) That was stupid, Alan. \nMR. STANWYK I'd have been long gone. \nFLETCH Ahem. (continues reading) 'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.' \nMr. Stanwyk blanches. Fletch continues. \nFLETCH 'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper. Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.' \nAlan mulls over all this for a few seconds, then smiles wistfully. \nMR. STANWYK Bravo, Mr. Fletcher. \nFLETCH The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together. \nStanwyk shoots a surprised look at Gail. She returns it with an innocent shrug. \nMR. STANWYK (to Fletch) And what was that? \nFLETCH How similar in build you and I are. then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up. \nMRS. STANWYK My God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you? \nNow it is Alan's turn to shrug innocently. \nMR. STANWYK Sorry, darling. \nMRS. STANWYK You sonofabitch. \nMR. STANWYK Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm not a stupid sonofabitch. \nMr. Stanwyk reaches into his desk and pulls out his gun, and levels it at Fletch. \nMR. STANWYK I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two? \nFLETCH Whoops. \n", "test1_input": "STANWYK (goes on, unresponsive) I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves? \nFLETCH I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy. \nSTANWYK In this drawer.... \n---He opens the top drawer of his desk \n32 INSIDE THE DRAWER \n---an enormous .357 Magnum. \n33 MASTER \n---Stanwyk holds up the gun. \n34 FLETCH \nFLETCH A .357. \n35 MASTER \nSTANWYK Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray. \nFLETCH So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you. \nSTANWYK Precisely. Are you a good shot? \nFLETCH (looking at the huge gun) What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first. \nSTANWYK Get me on the first shot, if you can. \nFLETCH I don't think you'll have to worry about that. \n---A beat. Stanwyk stares at Fletch. \nSTANWYK Do you have a passport? \nFLETCH Sure, all drifters do. \nSTANWYK Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment. \nFLETCH Take it where? \n---Stanwyk starts to write down the information on a note pad. \nSTANWYK LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. \nFLETCH Where am I going? \nSTANWYK (hands Fletch the note) Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM. \nFLETCH They serve dinner on the flight? \nSTANWYK It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Fletcher. \nFLETCH You've certainly thought this out, haven't you? \nSTANWYK I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Fletcher. \nFLETCH You sure those doors will be open? \nSTANWYK Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. \nFLETCH The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying. \nSTANWYK That's right. \nFLETCH You sure got the hard part. \nSTANWYK What do you say, Mr. Fletcher? You'll be doing me and my family a great service. \n36 FLETCH \n---thinking it over. \n37 STANWYK \nSTANWYK Will you kill me? \n", "test1_true": "FLETCH Sure. \n39 INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY \nFletch pushes through the double glass doors, still dresses in a beach mufti -- the jeans and Magic Johnson shirt, Puma sneakers. \n40 INT. L.A.

She is fun and flirty, and her feelings for Fletch fall just short of idolatry. \nLARRY Yo! \nFLETCH Can I steal you for a minute? \nLARRY Only if you promise not to return me. \nFLETCH Deal. \nLARRY (pointing to Fletch's T-shirt) 'Magic' today, huh? \nFLETCH Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor. \nLARRY Shoot. \nFLETCH Don't say shoot, okay. \nThey pass the office of the city editor Frank Walker, fiftyish. Hold on Walker's office. Upon noticing Fletch, he jumps from his seat, edges his way past the two reporters in his office and runs outside. \nWALKER Fletch. Fletch! \n40-A FLETCH AND LARRY \nThey continue their walk. \nFLETCH Did you hear something? \nLARRY Not me. \nFLETCH Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away. \nWALKER (running up to them) Fletch, I take it by your presence here that the story is done. Tell me I'm right. \nFletch hold up a hand. \nFLETCH W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute. \nLARRY No problem, boss. \nLarry peels off and Fletch now talks to Walker without breaking stride for his office. \nWALKER Fletch. \nFLETCH Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit? \nWALKER No, I want an answer, Is the story done? \nFLETCH Uh, almost. \nWALKER 'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer. \nFLETCH (as he enters his cubicle) And a damn fine one, I might add. \n41 INT. FLETCH'S CUBICLE - DAY \nA pile of mail is on his desk. On the walls are a team portrait of the Lakers, plus a couple of blow-ups of his column. Fletch writes under the name of Jane Doe. An unused word processor is on his desk, but the keyboard has been moved aside to make room for an old, much-used Royal typewriter. \nHe bounces some waste paper off the monitor into a strategically placed waste can. (A lot of crumpled papers lie on the floor all around the can.) \nFLETCH Two.... \nWALKER Irwin.... \n", "test1_id": 2712, "test2_input": "FLETCH I feel like dirt.

First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face. \nFLETCH (stands and closes briefcase) God I admire you. \nBOYD By the way: what kind of name is Poon? \nFLETCH Comanche Indian. \n80 ALAN STANWYK'S OFFICE - DAY \nFletch breezes in, right up to the Secretary, whose nameplate reads MADELINE TURNER. \nFLETCH (rapidly) Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo.

BEACH - DAY \nPan across the beach.... \nFLETCH (O.S.) Larry, it's me.... \nFletch is in a phone booth on the sidewalk next to the beach, keeping an eye on \"Fat Sam's.\" \nFLETCH See if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy about him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving in with me. \nWe hear police sirens. Fletch looks O.S. \nFLETCH Later. \nHe hangs up. \n82 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - FOUR SQUAD CARS \nhave pulled up to the beach, lights flashing. The druggies are dispersing. Creasy is running towards Fletch. \nCREASY Fletch! Take off! \n83 FLETCH \nHe steps out onto the beach, and starts towards the cops. \n84 MASTER \nCREASY What are you doing? \n85 MASTER \nEveryone is scattering. The cops run past everyone, and approach Gummey. \n86 FLETCH AND CREASY \nFLETCH They're after Gummy again. It's weird. \nFletch keeps moving toward the police. \nCREASY (out of breath) Fletch, slow down. \n87 GUMMY AND THE COPS \nGummy trips and falls in the sand.

What do you want from --- \nOne of the cops turns and, in one smooth motion, kicks Fletch in the balls. Fletch sinks to the ground. \n92 SQUAD CAR \nGummy is packed into the squad car. \n93 FLETCH \nHe rises slowly from the sand. He is in great pain. He starts after the cops again. \n94 CREASY \nCREASY Fletch! \n95 MASTER \nFLETCH What goddamn right do you have to take him? \nThe cop car starts off. Fletch picks up a rock, hurls it at the cop car. It smashes the rear window. \n96 CREASY \nCREASY Fletch!!! \n97 MASTER \nThe cop cars go off. Fletch bends over. He's hurting. Creasy comes over to him. \nCREASY Hey you're really nuts. \nFLETCH (breathless) They didn't do anything. \nCREASY What? What are you talking about? \nFLETCH I busted their window, they didn't do anything. \nCREASY You're lucky. \nFLETCH Not luck.

BOYD AVIATION - PARKING LOT \nAlan Stanwyk crosses the parking lot and gets into his Jaguar. He starts the engine, backs out of his reserved space, and pulls out of the lot. \n166 ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT \nFletch is reading a copy of Sports Illustrated. He puts it down, starts his car, and pulls out of the lot. \n167 SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD \nStanwyk's Jaguar tools down Santa Monica Boulevard. Fletch's car follows, several discreet car lengths behind. \n168 INT. JAGUAR \nStanwyk checks his watch, and makes a turn. \n169 MASTER \nStanwyk has pulled into a service station. He gets out of his car and opens the trunk. \n170 FLETCH \nHe pulls into a fast-food joint on the west side of the street. He opens the Sports Illustrated and peers over it. \n171 STANWYK \nHe takes a gas can from the trunk, goes to the pump, fills it, and pays the attendant in cash. \n172 FLETCH \nCurious. \n173 STANWYK \nHe puts the gas can back in the trunk, gets into the car, and starts off. \n174 FLETCH \nfollows suit. \n175 SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD \nWe are getting into the increasingly rundown section of Santa Monica.

A cop steps out and says something to Stanwyk. Stanwyk gets out of his car and walks over to the unmarked police car, and gets in. \n178-A FLETCH \ntakes out his binoculars. \n178-B FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW \nBecause he's looking through the reflection of sunlight on the back window of the unmarked police car, Fletch's point of view is fuzzy, but we can just make out the form of someone else in animated conversation with Stanwyk. \n178-C FLETCH \nA moment of possible recognition.

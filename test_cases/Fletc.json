Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story! \nFLETCH I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay? \nWALKER No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday? \nFLETCH I never read the paper. \nWALKER ...never reads the paper... \nWalker goes through a pile of unread newspapers on Fletch's desk, finds the Sunday paper. \nFLETCH What's the spread on the game tonight? \nWALKER I don't know.

There's a source behind him. \nWALKER Who? \nFLETCH Well, there we're in a gray area. \nWALKER How gray? \nFLETCH I'd say charcoal. \nWALKER (straining for control) I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that? \nFLETCH Frank, you animal, I love it.

DOCTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM - DAY \nFletch, stripped to the waist. is being examined by Dr. Joseph Dolen, a rather imperious physician. \nDR. DOLEN So where do you know Alan from? \nFLETCH We play tennis at the club. \nDR. DOLEN Really. The California Racquet Club? \nFLETCH Yes. \nDR. DOLEN That's my club too. I haven't seen you there. \nFLETCH Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains. \nDR. DOLEN Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber? \nFLETCH That's Babar. \nDR. DOLEN Two bs? \nFLETCH One. B-a-b-a-r. \nDR. DOLEN That's two. \nFLETCH But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant. \nDR. DOLEN Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar? \nFLETCH I don't know. I don't have any. \nDR. DOLEN No children? \nFLETCH No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books. \nDR. DOLEN (eyes Fletch curiously) Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry. \nFletch's eyes drift to Dolen's side table with its unnerving assortment of medical paraphernalia. \nFLETCH Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt. \nDR. DOLEN Your aunt? \nFLETCH Mrs. Smith. \n", "test1_id": 2712, "test2_input": "He puts the bag over his mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation with her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g. looking over, but does not come into the records room or question what's happening). \nRECORDS NURSE Is there anything particular you're looking for? \nFLETCH My associates did a biopsy on this man recently. (thumbs through file) He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it. \nRECORDS NURSE (taking the file) Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. (searches) Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign. \nFLETCH That's it? \nRECORDS NURSE (shows him the file) That's it. \nFLETCH (reading it) This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer. \nRECORDS NURSE I guess not. \nFLETCH (very puzzled) He'll be so relieved. \n60 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nFletch pulls up in front of his building, a 1970's cinderblock apartment complex. Fletch parks his car halfway up the curb, gets out and spots a Mercedes coupe. He starts running toward the rear of his building. \n61 EXT. REAR OF THE BUILDING - DAY \nFletch starts climbing up the fire escape of his building. \n62 FIRE ESCAPE - DAY \nFletch reaches the second floor. He's huffing and puffing. \nFLETCH Christ. \n63 REVERSE \nAttorney Charles Gillett is waiting for him on the second floor fire escape. Gillett smiles. \nGILLETT Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch. \n64 MASTER \nFLETCH What about breaking and entering? (points to Gillett's coat) Are you wearing anything under that? \nGILLETT I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband. \nFLETCH I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside. \nFletch takes out a credit card and jimmies open the lock on the window. \n65 INT. FLETCH'S APARTMENT - DAY \nFletch climbs in through the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is just barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the wall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett. \nFLETCH One on one? \nGillett shakes his head. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic globe lamb crashing to the floor. \nFLETCH And the foul. \nFletch takes a second, successful shot. \nGILLETT You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars. \nFLETCH (still playing b-ball) She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it. \nGILLETT I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence. \nFLETCH It stinks. I thought woman were independent now. \nGILLETT Until she remarries, Fletch. \nFLETCH Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this. \nGILLETT I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out. \nFLETCH She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that.... \nGILLETT You should have proved that in a court of law. \nFLETCH My lawyer was a bum. \n", "test2_true": "Fletch puts down the basketball, picks up a stack of mail and rifles through it. \nFLETCH I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too. \nGILLETT You may be right. \nFLETCH Are you serious? \nGILLETT (shrugs) That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars. \nFLETCH Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved. \nFletch holds up an envelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it. \nFLETCH (continuing) I think I just won a million dollars! \nHe opens it and looks inside, feigning disappointment. \nFLETCH (continuing) Damn...lost again. Sorry. \nGILLETT This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages. \nFletch sighs, takes out the envelope given to him by Stanwyk. He hands a thousand dollars to Gillett. \nGILLETT Cash. I'm impressed. \nFLETCH Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month. \nGILLETT Till then. \nGillett smiles and exits. \n66 KITCHEN - DAY \nFletch opens the fridge. Inside are tow six-packs of Coors, a jar of Miracle Whip, a half a cucumber, and a brown head of lettuce. Fletch takes a beer and slams the door shut with such force that we hear breakage inside. \n67 MASTER - APARTMENT - DAY \nIn a foul mood, Fletch leaves the kitchen, and wanders into the living room. It has the personality of an Abbey Rents. \nHe picks up the TV remote control. The television clicks on. Chick Hearn is with Jabbar, during a Laker pregame warmup. \nFLETCH Thank God. \nFletch settles back. \n68 TELEVISION \nHearn is gushing over Jabbar. \n69 FLETCH \nHe watches contemplatively. He is bone tired. \n70 TELIVISION \nHEARN How about Fletch? \nJABBAR Well, Fletch has been great. He's super-strong, really clogs the middle for us, boxes out, gets the bounds.... \n71 FLETCH \nHe smiles and nods, deep in fantasy. \n72 TELEVISION \nHEARN Now here's a key play in Tuesday night's game.... \nHearn and Jabbar look down at a television monitor. \n73 FLETCH \nHe's half asleep. \nJABBAR (V.O.) Here I am dishing off to Fletch.... \nFletch raises an eyebrow. \n74 TELEVISION \n", "test2_id": 2713, "test3_input": "Fletch enters. \n213 FLETCH's POINT OF VIEW - LIVING ROOM \nThe shelves are bare. Furniture is in place. \n214 MASTER \nFletch enters the kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. Inside is a can of coffee, and some vegetables. Fletch leaves the kitchen and heads for the bedroom. We follow him as he enters the bedroom. \n215 INT. BEDROOM \nFletch opens the closet. It's bare. He pulls open the drawers. Nothing. Fletch gets down and looks under the bed. \nVOICE Who the hell are you? \nIn his surprise, Fletch bangs his head as he starts up. \n216 REVERSE \nAt the door stands a gruff-looking Man in a red and black hunter's jacket, overalls, and a hat with earflaps. He holds a rifle. \nMAN Get up. \n217 MASTER \nFletch gets up. \nFLETCH The door was unlocked. \nMAN Lock's busted. \nFLETCH No wonder. \nMAN I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place. \nFLETCH I commend him on his choice. \nMAN What? \nFLETCH I commend him on his choice \nThe Man stares at him, holding the gun. He's not the brightest guy in the world, and Fletch has already caught on to that. \nFLETCH I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh. \nMAN Who are you? \nFLETCH Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's. \nThe Man just stares at Fletch. Fletch starts to move ever so slightly, testing his freedom of movement. \nFLETCH Where is she? \nMAN Moved out. \nFLETCH She moved out? \nThe Man nods and cocks the weapon. Fletch stops his tentative movements and just looks around the room \nFLETCH I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything. \nMAN She moved out. \nFLETCH So you're saying she moved out. \nMAN This morning. \nFLETCH This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over. \nThe Man continues to gaze unblinkingly at Fletch, holding the rifle. \nMAN What did you want under the bed? \nFLETCH Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon. \nMAN I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops. \nFLETCH I'm her cousin. \n", "test3_true": "FLETCH Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first. \nThe man looks down at his shoelaces. Fletch kicks the gun out of his hand and runs through the house. \n218 EXT. HOUSE \nFletch runs out of the house and jumps into his car. \n219 INT. CAR \nFletch pulls out. The rear window is suddenly blown away. \nFLETCH I'm getting real tired of all this hostility. \n220 EXT. PROVO PIG FARM \nFletch pulls up, gets out of the car and addresses the couple sitting on the porch of the house. \nFLETCH Evening. (nods toward car) They oughta recall these things. One bump,the whole window goes. \n221 PORCH \nSitting on the porch is a couple in their late sixties, whom we are about to learn are Alan Stanwyk's parents -- Marvin and Velma. \nFLETCH (approaching the steps) Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk? \nMarvin nods \nFLETCH I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters. \nMARVIN (smiles) Harry S. Truman? \nFLETCH My parents were great fans of the former President. \nMARVIN Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two. \nFLETCH Sure did. Dropped the big one on them. \nMARVIN Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry? \nFLETCH Right. \nMARVIN Well, I'm fully covered. \nFLETCH I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son. \nMARVIN Yes. Where you from, Harry? \nFLETCH California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions? \nMARVIN Come on in. \n222 INT. MARVIN AND VELMA'S LIVING ROOM \nFletch and the Stanwyks face each other on couches that flank the fireplace. Fletch has a clipboard on which he will take notes. \nFLETCH First, a couple of routine things: are you and you wife currently alive? \nMarvin just stares at him. \nFLETCH Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named.... \nMARVIN Velma. \nVelma smiles. \nFLETCH Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation? \nMARVIN Check. \nFLETCH Okay. (makes notation) Now, the last time you saw your son was when? \nMARVIN Oh, about ten days ago. \nFletch is taken aback. \nFLETCH Ten days ago? \nMARVIN That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so. \n", "test3_id": 2714}

POV: Looking up CROSS-HAIRS at KONG, high on the side of the building - a SITTING DUCK. 
A SUDDEN BLOOM of FIRE erupts from the GUN BARREL speeding straight towards KONG and ANN! 
ANGLE ON: KONG leaps across 34th STREET just as BOOM! The MISSILE hits the BUILDING'S ROOF! 
WIDE ON: KONG smashes into the SIDE of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING! 
GLASS RAINS DOWN 12 STORIES TO THE STREET as KONG uses WINDOWS for HAND and FOOT HOLDS. He is ONE-HANDED - his other hand still holding ANN protectively to his CHEST. 
JACK runs forward amidst the noise and confusion he stares up at the long length of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ... 
USH IN: JACK staring at the unguarded, darkened entrance to the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ... 
EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING/MANHATTAN - PRE DAWN 
Looking at MANHATTAN from the HARBOUR ... the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING rises from the MIDTOWN area like a giant solitary finger, reaching for the heavens. 
WIDE SHOT ... KONG climbing the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, silhouetted against the LIGHTENING SKY. 
LOOKING DOWN ... ANN clings to KONG'S SHOULDER, a DIZZYING 1000 foot drop to the street below. 
KONG climbs onto the OBSERVATION DECK of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. He gently places ANN down ... a CHILL WIND catches at her DRESS. ANN looks up at KONG ... BLOOD slowly seeps from his numerous WOUNDS ... 
KONG sits still, staring out across the CITY ... 
To the EAST the sun is rising, casting an soft glow over buildings ... glinting off the WATERS of the EAST... 
ONG looks down at ANN ... he gestures with his hands ... touching his heart ... ANN looks at him confused, he repeats the gesture 
CLOSE ON: ANN, she understands ... 
ANN (whisper) Beautiful ... 
Here, high above the squalor and the noise and confusion, the city lies quiet, almost peaceful ... 
ANN (cont'd) Yes ... yes it is. 
WIDER ... KONG cradles ANN in his HAND as they SHARE the moment. 
WIDE ON: KONG and ANN sit on the LEDGE, watching the SUN RISE. SIX NAVAL BIPLANES suddenly ROAR INTO SHOT, sweeping low over the DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT ... and closing in on KONG. These are TWO-SEATERS, armed with TWIN MACHINE-GUNS for the PILOT, and a flexible MACHINE-GUN for the OBSERVER. 
CLOSE ON: PILOT'S FINGER on trigger. 
A COLD WIND blows ANN'S hair as she watches the PLANES approach. KONG is UNEASY about these BUZZING PREDATORS as they CIRCLE above him. 
The NAVAL PLANES peel off into an ATTACKING DIVE at KONG. 
DOWN GUN-SIGHTS ... drifting left and right as KONG grows in size ... LOCKED ON! 
KONG is suddenly FEARFUL ... he INSTINCTIVELY pushes ANN towards the BUILDING'S WALL! 
The PLANES split to either side of KONG, ZOOMING straight at him! 
KONG ROARS at the PLANES, as if issuing a CHALLENGE. 
ANN is screaming ... 
ANN (cont'd) No!!! 
THE SIX NAVAL PLANES fly at KONG from different directions! MACHINE-GUNS START FIRING! 
KONG ROARS ... and SNATCHES at the NAVAL PLANES as they ZOOM by ... he FLINCHES as he is HIT BY BULLETS! 
KONG clambers onto the SIDE of the BUILDING and begins climbing to the UPPER MOST LEVEL...attempting to DRAW the PLANES away from ANN ... 
CLOSE ON: The MASKED FACE of a PILOT as he heads straight for KONG. 
ANGLE ON: KONG swipes at the MOORING MAST and sends it crashing down to the streets below. 
WIDER ON: KONG stands atop the BUILDING, ROARING & DRUMMING HIS CHEST in ANGER. 
ANGLE ON: ANN as she desperately begins to climb up a SERVICE LADDER on the outside of the STEEL DOME ... 
EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING/MANHATTAN - DAWN 
NGLE ON: KONG ROARS in pain as the bullets hit ... As the PLANES fly past he SNATCHES at them ... 
CLOSE ON: A GUNNER ... 
ANGLE ON: KONG recoils in pain as each bullet hits... HE ROARS IN PAIN. 
ANGLE ON: KONG leaps into the AIR smashing at the last PLANE ... the GIANT APE falls through the AIR ... 
The CRIPPLED PLANE spins out of control ... plummeting towards the street! 
he PLANES continue their attack as KONG tries each time to SWAT at them. 
INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DAWN 
ANGLE ON: JACK RACES into a LIFT and hurriedly punches the BUTTON ... nothing happens ... 
LD SECURITY GUARD Hey, hey, nobody past this point. You can't go in there. 
JACK pushes past the OLD SECURITY GUARD!

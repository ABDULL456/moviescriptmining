From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel. We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on. 
KAY Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I should quit. I've tried. Never took, though. I'm beginning to think I lack self-control. 
And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel -- 
INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat. 
KAY Well, back to work. 
He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left. 
EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT 
Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window -- 
-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT 
EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top. 
LAUREL Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I'm not trying to impress you with this, I'm just letting you know. It could start a war. 
EDGAR Good. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness. 
LAUREL You're a wonderful dad. 
And with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS HERSELF out, into the air. 
Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the air -- 
-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground. 
Above, Edgar just keeps climbing. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds. 
AT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of latches, and opens it, revealing -- 
-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet. 
Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up the clip. 
JAY You know how to work that? 
Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence. 
KAY No idea whatsoever. 
He SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their columns in the distance. 
KAY (CONT'D) Let's bag us some bug. 
As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin, faster and faster. The ship begins to rise. 
JAY Oh, shit. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT 
Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement. 
EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT 
At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible. 
But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the ball is headed. 
All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops -- 
-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay. 
KAY Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor --

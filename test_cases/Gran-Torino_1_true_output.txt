BARBER No, no. That's fine. Let me heat up a towel. Walt hands Martin the Barber a twenty. 
WALT Here's a twenty. Keep the change in case you slip and hit my jugular. 
INT. OLD SCHOOL MEN'S CLOTHING STORE 
Walt gets fitted for a new suit. The OLD TAILOR carefully measures Walt's shoulders. 
WALT So you can take it in right here? 
TAILOR Yes, sir. Take about an hour. 
WALT That's great. Thank you. 
TAILOR Yes, sir. 
WALT Never had a fitted suit. 
INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH OFFICE 
Walt comes in and Father Janovich looks up. 
FATHER JANOVICH Mr. Kowalski, what can I do for you? 
WALT I've come for confession. 
FATHER JANOVICH Oh Lord Jesus, what have you done? 
WALT Nothing. Take it easy. 
FATHER JANOVICH What are you up to?

WALT Are you going to let me confess or not? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH 
Walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous, sweating Father Janovich sits on the other. 
FATHER JANOVICH How long has it been since your last confession? 
WALT Forever. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. 
FATHER JANOVICH What are your sins, my son. 
WALT In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the work Christmas party. Dorothy was talking with the other wives and it just happened. 
FATHER JANOVICH Yes. Go on. 
WALT I made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as stealing. 
FATHER JANOVICH Yes. Fine. 
WALT And lastly, I was never close to my two sons. I don't know them. I didn't know how. 
FATHER JANOVICH That's it? 
WALT Whatta you mean, That's it?' It's bothered me for years.

FATHER JANOVICH God loves and forgives you. Say ten Hail Marys' and five Our Fathers.' Are you going to retaliate for what happened to Sue? Walt says nothing. Father Janovich looks hard at Walt.

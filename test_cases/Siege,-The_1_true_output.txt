FINGERPRINT EXPERT Got one! 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
Hub and Tina address twenty agents. 
HUB Ladies and Gentlemen, meet the late Ali Waziri. 
He projects a PHOTO of the dead Terrorist onto the wall. 
HUB Tina talked to the Israelis and traced this sucker to a group operating out of Ramallah. That's the West Bank, not the West Side for those of you just joining us from Nebraska. 
A few appreciative CHUCKLES. They're all exhausted. This is the first good news in a bitch of a day. 
TINA Okay, we've pulled his landing card and his I-94. So now we know he came in three days ago, out of Frankfurt -- 
She points to where: A TIME-LINE has been created out of colored strips beneath a bank of silent TV monitors. 
TINA What we need now is to fill in the time between his arrival and the incident. All known associations, and most of all, we need an address. 
TWO HOURS LATER -- 
The TIME-LINE is progressing. PHONE TECHNICIANS add tie-lines, dedicated fax lines, wats lines and scrambled lines. Cable everywhere. Danny and Frank pore over Ali Waziri's I-94. 
FRANK IAP66. What's IAP66? 
DANNY Hold on, hold on, I'm looking it up -- 
FRANK -- Today, Danny... 
DANNY Wait, wait -- Here we go. Student Visa, J-1. 
Hub has been pacing, nearby. 
HUB Where's the original --? 
DANNY In his passport. 
FRANK Which is... vaporized. 
HUB Where's the copy? 
FRANK At the point of issuance. Could be the American Consulate in Tel Aviv. The American Consulate in Amman, Cairo, Alexandria, Riyadh -- all an easy drive from the West Bank -- 
Hub suddenly had to fight off a wave of nausea and dizziness. 
HUB What time is it --? 
DANNY Three-fifteen. P.M. (off Hub's blank look) When's the last time you ate? 
Fred Darius, the young agent, appears. 
FRED Sir. They want you in the lab. 
THROUGH A POWERFUL ELECTRON MICROSCOPE 
Hub peers through the eyepiece at a MAGNIFIED STRAND of fiber. 
FIBER EXPERT (V.O.) Pure, unadulterated, Egyptian cotton. 
FRED You're saying they're Egyptian? 
FIBER EXPERT No. No... I'm just saying -- See... 
HUB -- It's what they use for funerals. The guy was wearing a shroud. 
He looks at Frank. It's just as Elise said. The real deal. 
HUB Let's see if she's ready to talk. 
A HOLDING CELL 
Elise sits quietly with the stillness of those who have been there before. Hub enters. 
HUB I thought one phone call and you were out of here. 
ELISE I didn't make the call. 
HUB Why not? 
She just looks at him, entirely neutral. 
ELISE Are you alright --? 
HUB Just some tinnitus in my left ear -- 
They look across the professional chasm that divides them. 
HUB I need to know what I don't know. 
ELISE Life's too short. 
But there's a hint of some thawing in her tone.

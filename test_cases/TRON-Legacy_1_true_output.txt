Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd program called KROD. 
KROD I got a lock. Coordinate 32937! 
RX23 I'm on him! 
RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished. 
RX23 Which way did he go?! 
6   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY 
Rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode. 
A head shoots up from a cubicle. It's Rush Nortebi, 23, computer security expert. Real world version of the RX23 program. His cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and bleeding-edge computer gear. 
RUSH I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO? 
Dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system intruder. Everybody's stumped. Dangling from desk lamps, the company toy: Conical pyramid with a square stuck on top, labeled "X-NET RULES!"

6   CONTINUED: 
RUSH Come on guys! Nobody hacks X-Net. You gonna let him get away?! 
MILES Rush, I think I found him! 
In the adjacent cubicle: Overweight ultra-nerd MILES RABBISH - real world version of cyberworld Krod. 
MILES Check the old game grid! 
Rush jockeys an old Apple LISA computer.     On screen: a crude old vector graphics game grid. 
A RED FIGURE steps appears the grid. 
RUSH You get a cookie, Miles! 
Programmers gather to watch Rush in action. 
7   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID 
Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten. 
TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO- CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone. 
Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He skids and swerves, learning the funky surface. 
Search Engine flies onto the scene, hovering overhead. 
KROD Coordinate 6532.02!   There he goes! 
The chase is on. 
TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere... 
RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap. 
8   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM BETA TEST LAB - DAY 
Rush gets the hang of this old game. 
RUSH I haven't played this since I was 4. But I was mighty awesome. 
(CONTINUED) 
8    CONTINUED: 
RED LIGHTCYCLE turns hard 90 degrees, Rush maneuvers to counter. 
Co-workers lean over the cubicle walls from all sides: 
RUSH Score an ID on this leech? 
MILES Negative.    He's nobody. 
KELTER Rush, you've gotta nail him. 
PHLEGMAN Or you know we're all fired. 
Rush baits the RED LIGHTCYCLE. It anticipates his every move, goading him, tailing him. 
MILES Whoa, Rush! I groked a pattern in his moves! Fake left, go right! 
9    INT.   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID 
Search Engine flies overhead - Krod locks on Tron. 
RX23's Pulse Rider pulls the move, surges up beside red lightcycle. 
Tron pulls away, baiting his opponent. 
10   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY 
MILES You got him on the run, dude! 
OTHERS Crash him!   Rush RUSH RUSH. 
RUSH hits keys, jockeys mouse.      Feeling good.     Shifts drive status to: "TURBOJECT". 
11   INT.   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID 
RX23's Pulse Rider SCREAMS, gaining on Tron.         Neck-and-neck.

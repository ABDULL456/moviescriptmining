{"train": "BURLESQUE \nWritten by \nSteven Antin \nTITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high energy fast paced sexy choreography. Very provocative. Legs. Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins. Costumes. High heels. A kaleidoscope of images and colors. \nEND TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY, HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a loud DRUM ROLL. CAMERA is low, moving through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and the WINGS, flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us, blasting into camera as they form the word... \nBURLESQUE DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK. Then we hear an opening MUSIC \"INTRO\", a bawdy QUARTET. EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS... speaking directly into CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice. \nTESS Once upon a time ...a long, looong time ago... there was a good little girl...and they called her... REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes, theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with the AUDIENCE. \nTESS (CONT'D) Burlesque. MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass -- wearing bowler hats, suspenders and lots of ink. The crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage. \nTESS (CONT'D) Some say she up and died-of neglect. Abandonment. \n(WHISPER) .old age. The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd. Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows. \nTESS (CONT'D) But I say...no matter how hard you try, you can't keep a good girl down. And I've got a bevy of 'em. \nINT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA DOZEN gorgeous, leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror. Miles of skin. Heavy make-up. Lashes. Boobs. Butts. Fishnets. Boas. And SEQUINS. Oceans of them. It's definitely decadent. Completely cabaret. \nTESS (O.S.) Come to think of it, none of them are all that good, which isn't all that bad... SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so. \nTESS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Eight shows a week. Sixteen gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers of luscious legs... \nBACK ON TESS -- Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one. \nTESS (CONT'D) Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse. Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl. The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights, moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway. Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them. \nTESS (CONT'D) All of them the creme-de la creme. \n(CYMBAL CRASH) De la creme. The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc... \nTESS (CONT'D) Each one a bastion of bodacious... (Coco bends over, peers between her legs) Elegance. TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits. \nTESS (CONT'D) Not to mention their other... (smacks Coco on the ass) Ass-ets. Coco raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND. \nTESS (CONT'D) Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge, dead smack in the center of the Sunset Strip-- did I say \"strip?\" (cat calls from audience) I meant TEASE... FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their weight, hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to the MUSIC... \nEXT. MAIN STREET, GRUNDY, IOWA - NIGHT \nA small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&P. CAMERA MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on a broken neon sign that reads \"DWIG 'S BAR\" It flickers so you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG. \nINT. DWIGHT'S BAR - SAME \nChipped paint. Old beer posters. A few pathetic customers. Beer on tap. Pinball standing lonely in the corner. A REGULAR drains his beer, tosses down a quarter and starts to leave. Someone stops short at the table. \nALI Uh, excuse me? You forgot something. He turns. Sees: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts, white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 -- but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age. \nREGULAR No, that's your tip. \nALI Huh. See, now that's interesting -- you and I must do math completely differently, cause me? I start with the six beers I brought you, add the four spills I cleaned up, the five times I refilled your peanuts, plus the three times you \"accidentally\" touched my ass, then I tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for you, twice, and I come up with a sum that's a hell of a lot more than twenty-five cents. Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA -- 30's wearing every one of those years hard. \nLORETTA She's just teasing, Ike. You go on home now, and tell Kay I said hi. The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter. \nLORETTA (CONT'D) It's better than nothing. \nALI Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an insult. \nLORETTA It'll cover half a load down at the Spanky Clean. \nALI There's only one thing a quarter is good for. Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room, passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone. \nLORETTA Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight feels about that. \nALI Dwight isn't here. Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine. \nLORETTA He could come back any minute. \nALI Tough. I'm not working here for the tips Loretta. She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song. She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats, starts singing ETTA JAMES'S \"SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME\". \nALI (CONT'D) \nOOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD \nFEELING, Y-E-A-H And now we see where the confidence comes from. She's got a voice that's way too big for this town-- the kind that reaches way down inside you and rattles things loose. WE HEAR the same song continue as we INTERCUT with: \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT \nThe Girls undulate at the footlights as they sing the chorus: \nBURLESQUE GIRLS \nYEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH... \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - GRUNDY, IOWA - DAY \nAli is at the ticket counter. \nALI How much to Los Angeles? \nTICKET BOOTH GUY One way or round-trip? \nALI You're kidding, right? \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC \nCabaret chairs as they DROP FROM THE CEILING. The girls CATCH them, SPIN them around, SLAM them down and LAND ON THEM \nIN VARIOUS LAYOUTS. IN THE WINGS, Tess hands Sean her corset as she slips into a slinky dress. He takes her cigarette holder and grips it between his teeth as he zips her in. \nSEAN They're loving you tonight. \nTESS They're loving you. \nSEAN Oh, shucks, I just tell myself I'm writing for a big old drag queen. \nTESS Eat me. As he heads off with her discarded costume: \nSEAN A big old foul-mouthed drag queen! Tess looks in a mirror. As she makes the necessary adjustments, VINCE SCALI appears. 35, scruffy-handsome. \nVINCE Good show tonight. She glances up, sees him. Gets icy. Goes back to primping. \nVINCE (CONT'D) Too bad the club's half-empty. \nTESS Half-full. \nVINCE I got another call from Marcus Gerber. \nTESS And you told him we weren't selling. \nVINCE He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time. \nTESS Vince, I don't care what the number is; the only way Marcus Gerber will get this club from me is by prying it out of my cold, dead, heavily- jeweled fingers. She pivots away and sweeps into the club. \nBURLESQUE GIRLS \nOH, HONEY!!. Big finish, the number on stage ends. \nINT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT \nAli's on the bus, in a seat by herself. A LITTLE GIRL in front of her is peering over the chair, watching Ali. Ali smiles at her. The Little Girl's mother notices, gets the girl to sit down by tickling her. Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED PHOTO of the mom and girl, looks at it. Then she looks out the window and watches America fly by as DAY TURNS TO NIGHT. \nEXT. CITY FREEWAY - DAY - THE BUS - SPEEDING BY \nOver which we HEAR someone channel surfing radio static-- \nINT. BUS - SAME \nAli sits with her radio headset, searching stations as... \nRADIO 102.7 KIIS FM. Broadcasting from Hollywood and Vine... Ali perks up-- looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend and... THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN comes into view. NEW MUSIC UP: \nEXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. DAY - CARRY MUSIC \nThe rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: \"$49.00 a night.\" She looks up at it. Then heads across the street-- \nINT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nCramped, dingy carpet, chipped paint. Key in the door. The MIDDLE-EASTERN HOTEL MANAGER -- 40's -- leads Ali in, pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not understanding a word. When he stops: \nALI Okay! \n(THEN) Well. Good luck with that. He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting. \nALI (CONT'D) Oh, hang on. She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels one off and holds it out. \nALI (CONT'D) If I could just get a little -- But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves, closing the door behind him. To the closed door: \nALI (CONT'D) -- change. She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in. She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then she reconsiders. \nShe removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into: THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in. She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room. \nALI (CONT'D) Hey. I thought this was a single. The cat curls up next to her. She checks his junk. \nALI (CONT'D) Typical. First guy I meet is neutered. \n(THEN) You don't happen to know anyone in the music business, do you? \nCLOSE ON \"BACKSTAGE WEST\" MAGAZINE, Ali sips coffee from a paper cup as she reads TRADES and WANT ADS spread over the floor. She refills the lid of the cup, which the cat laps up. \nALI (CONT'D) Singer/Actress... Singer/Songwriter .Singer/Scuba diver? Perfect. ON ANOTHER AD: It says: \"SINGER/WAITRESS WANTED.\" MUSIC UP: \nEXT. THEME RESTAURANT - DAY \nTESS Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have the best view on the Sunset Strip! MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the back of the stage, where Three Girls stand, backs to the audience, Fosse-style. Coco, Georgia, and Nikki strut downstage. Behind them, Girls MOVE AND DANCE on cabaret chairs. Totally raunchy, completely timeless. \nThe girls hit the beats, turning upside-down on cabaret chairs, arched backs, legs reaching upward, bending over, asses to the audience, bodies writhing in air-tight choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet. Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a full on performance with the entire ensemble-- \nJACK Get you a drink? She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25, punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats. \nALI Only if you're buying. \nJACK (slides her a beer) Welcome to L.A. \nALI \n(DISAPPOINTED) Is it that obvious? \nJACK You still have that new-car smell. \nALI Not brand new. But still under warranty. \nJACK Where you from? She looks back at the stage, mesmerized. \nALI Iowa. \nJACK Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're practically related. \nALI I thought you looked familiar. He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She doesn't notice. He barks at her: \nJACK Hey_. Go. \nThe Waitress picks up the tray -- almost spilling the drinks - - then heads off. Ali looks around the place-- wowed... \nALI \n(TO HERSELF) Damn... \nJACK They don't build 'em like this in Iowa, huh? \nALI Hell no. I wouldn't have left. She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers. \nALI (CONT'D) So tell me -- who does a girl flirt with to get from here... (points to the stage) to there? \nJACK Is this you flirting? \nALI With someone wearing more eyeliner than me? He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading backstage. \nJACK Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt away. As she heads off-- \nJACK (CONT'D) Hey, Iowa-- use my name. He hands her a card. She looks at it: \nALI Thanks, Jack. She smiles, slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nAli enters into a frenzy. Legs, costumes, boobs, heels, eyeliners -- all flying around like a flock of birds. \nIn the middle of the maelstrom sits Tess, at a mirror, quietly applying lipstick. \nALI Excuse me. I'm looking for Tess. \nTESS (glued to the mirror) So am I. And sometimes, when the lights are dim, and I squint my eyes ...I can still see her. She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets, catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess: \"that's her.\" Ali steps closer to Tess. \nALI Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm- \nTESS New in town. \nALI Yes, and I'm-- \nTESS Looking for a job. \nALI Yes, and I-- \nTESS Want to perform here. \nALI Yes. Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her mascara, unimpressed. Silence. \nALI (CONT'D) I'm a singer. A good one. \nTESS This is a dance show. \nALI I can dance. \nTESS (a quick glance) Really? You a professional? \nALI I'm a quick study. \nTESS Not on my dime. Tess stands, a final check in the mirror. Ali sees her chance \nSLIPPING AWAY-- \nALI Okay, I get that you're busy so I won't waste any more of your time-- but this place-- I've just never seen anything like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of it? \nI GOT A DENTIST, HE'S OVER SEVEN FEET TALL. \nHIS NAME IS DR. LONG JOHN, \nAND HE ANSWERS EVERY CALL. \nI WENT TO LONG JOHN'S OFFICE, \nI SAID, \"DOCTOR, THE PAIN IS KILLIN' ME.\" \nHE SAID, DON'T WORRY BABY, \nIT'S JUST YOUR CAVITY, NEEDS A LITTLE FILLIN'.. . As she continues... ON THE FLOOR, Nikki is sitting in Marcus's lap, nibbling his neck. Vince sits down beside Marcus. Marcus pats Nikki on the butt, excusing her. As she heads off: \nVINCE She's on the verge. \nMARCUS That's what you said last time. \nVINCE She has no choice. We owe a balloon payment of 100 grand on the first, she took out a second to buy me out of the condo. And she just got turned down for another loan today. \nMARCUS There's a handful of these clubs around town, I could buy one of them tomorrow. \nVINCE But it wouldn't be in the heart of the Sunset Strip. \nON STAGE TESS AND THE GIRLS TOYING WITH THE AUDIENCE... \nTESS \n.HE TOOK OUT HIS TRUSTY DRILL, \nTOLD ME TO OPEN WIDE. \nHE SAID HE WOULDN'T HURT ME, \nTHEN HE FILLED MY HOLE INSIDE. \nLONG JOHN, DON ' T YOU EVER GO AWAY. \nCAUSE YOU THRILL ME WHEN YOU DRILL ME, \nAND I DON'T NEED NO NOVOCAINE TODAY. \nHE SAID IF IT EVER STARTS A'THROBBIN', \nCOME BACK AND SEE OL' LONG JOHN, \nAGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN:1: A RIM-SHOT and BLAST from the band as the audience laughs. From the stage, Tess notices Vince shake Marcus's hand and leave. A flicker of irritation-- nothing anyone in the audience would notice -- but it's there. \nAT THE BAR, Ali brings a tray of empties over. Sean is there. \nALI She's funny. \nSEAN Thanks. My lines. Our secret. Jack gives Sean his drink. He walks off. MUSIC UP: An insanely cool version of Sly and Family Stone \"Everybody Is A Star\" mashed up with a Fosse-esque Burlesque rap. \nJack notices Ali watching the stage... she lights up and melts, enraptured by the girls as they vamp to choreography in a tight group. \nBURLESQUE GIRLS \n(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE)... Song CONTINUES over a SERIES OF SHOTS: IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali plops down a bunch of BOOKS, OPENS The Golden Age of Burlesque\", lays on her bed, petting her cat with her foot. She locks in on a photo of 20's-era Burlesque dancers over which we HEAR-- \nSLY AND FAMILY STONE \nEVERYBODY IS A STAR ... IN THE CLUB, BURLESQUE GIRLS strike a similar pose \nBURLESQUE GIRLS \n(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) \nALI CHANNELING THE CHOREOGRAPHY AS SHE: - wipes down tables with Jack in the club after hours, - flips through old Soul records at a used LP store, - pokes her way through the scruffy street folks that hang out by her hotel. \nIN THE CLUB \nBURLESQUE GIRLS (CONT'D) \n(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) ON ALI'S BED, Ali flips to a picture of Mae West IN THE CLUB, Tess cracks up the crowd \nBURLESQUE GIRLS (CONT'D) \n(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali eats Chinese take-out as she pores over the book. Turns the page to a photo of OLD SCHOOL ACROBATS over \"Everybody Is A Star\"... IN THE CLUB, Daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille nail an \nAERIAL MOVE \nBURLESQUE GIRLS (CONT'D) \n(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) \nIN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali, in the bath, still reading, turns the page to a gorgeous image of Josephine Baker \nSLY AND FAMILY STONE \nALI I had to pee. Is that okay with you? \nCOCO Not when you're blocking my mirror it's not. Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside: \nCOCO (CONT'D) (re. the music) That's us. You okay, or are you gonna puke on me during the number? \nGEORGIA I can't make any promises. Coco drags her out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself in the mirror. Reaches into her shirt and does the boob-hoist that Georgia did. Looks again. Better. \nINT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAli trudges up the stairs, tired. Suddenly, TWO YOUNG THUGS barrel down the stairs, past her, almost knocking her over. \nALI Hey! They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees: HER HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken. \nALI (CONT'D) No. No! She runs down the hall. \nINT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nRansacked. Ali rushes in, goes straight into: \nINT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe lid is off the toilet tank. Her Ziploc of money is gone. \nALI No!!! God damn it!!! She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off, disappearing down the street. She kicks the trash can. It flies across the room. \nALI (CONT'D) Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it! She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed. \nALI (CONT'D) A lotta help you were. The cat creeps out, slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on the bed. \nALI (CONT'D) Shit. Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO she took from Nanna's. She picks it up. The glass has cracked, tearing the picture. \nShe takes the picture out of the broken frame, smooths it out -- then looks around her trashed room. Fighting despair. \nEXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREET - NIGHT \nFOLLOW a motorcycle up the street. The DRIVER has a KEYBOARD on his back. He parks, gets off, takes off his helmet. It's Jack. He heads for his apartment, but slows when he sees: ALI, sitting on his steps, her bags at her feet. Head low. \nJACK Ali? What's wrong? You okay? She tries to speak, but can't -- so she just nods. \nJACK (CONT'D) Really? Cause, in my experience-- when you're on someone's doorstep surrounded by everything you own, there's usually a not-so-good story \nTHAT-- \nALI \nI-- WAS-- And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry. \nALI (CONT'D) \n--RO-0-0-0-OBBED. \nJACK Shit. No way! \nALI (halting, gaspy sobs) Came in -- busted the lock-- and stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!! She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow-- \nALI (CONT'D) (more gaspy sobs) And there's no way I-- sleep there-- with-- like that-- the manager said- - not till Monday-- and I don't-- anyone else-- but then-- so I remembered I had...but it went straight to...so I... She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that he gave her in the club. It has his address on it. \nJACK Okay. I have no idea what you just said, but come on in here and we'll get it sorted out. She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest of her bags and leads her to: \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nTiny one-bedroom. Very \"done.\" Floral sofa. Curtains that match the area rug. Candle groupings. \nJACK Have a seat. I'll get us BOTH a drink. Here -- He hands her his phone. She looks at it. \nJACK (CONT'D) -- call whoever you want, long- distance, whatever-- \nALI I can't. \nJACK Sure you can. Go ahead. Her chin starts quivering all over again. \nALI I.. .don't ...have anyone. \nJACK What do you mean? \nALI To call. \nJACK No parents? (she shakes her head) Siblings? Aunts? Uncles? \n(NO AGAIN) Friends? \nALI \n(THROUGH TEARS) No one! No one, okay? Do I have to spell it out for you? I am -- completely -- alone! \nJack susses out the situation. \nJACK \nALI Fiancee? You're straight? \nJACK Of course I'm straight. You thought I was gay? \nALI Yes? \nJACK Why? \nALI I don't know, the...make-up? \nJACK It's a look. \nALI Okay. \nJACK A straight look. \nALI Okay. \n(THEN) And the floral couch...? \nALI/JACK Natalie. As Ali realizes she's barely dressed in front of a straight guy. \nALI I should put on pants. \nJACK Probably. She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her bag, bent over. She's in the doorway, so from the kitchen, all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out. \nALI Where is she? \nJACK New York. Doing a play. \nALI For how long? \nJACK Six more weeks. She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing him directly. He tries not to look-- \nALI \n(KEEPS DIGGING) Oh, God, now I feel bad about this. \nI'M SORRY-- \nJACK For what? \nALI I don't know. Now that you're straight and engaged, it feels weird that I came here. \nJACK Well, you did, and it was fine. Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He looks out. Her foot is caught in the pants leg. As she hops around, trying to untangle it-- \nJACK (CONT'D) Or at least it will be as soon as you get dressed. She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture. She appears in the doorway, pants on, pulling on a sweater. She slips her feet into her shoes. \nALI Alrighty then-- I'll get outta your hair now... \nJACK Wait, where're you headed? \nALI Oh, don't worry about me. I've got a plan. (scoops up the cat) Come on, cat. She zips the cat into the bag he came in. \nJACK Hang on, let me at least spot you some cash. I'm a little strapped, but I could -- \nALI No, I'm good, if you could just She nods at the door. He opens it for her. \nALI (CONT'D) Thank you. For everything. You are my knight in shining... eyeliner. \n(MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) (out the door) I'll see you at the club. \nJACK Cool. She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there. \nEXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nAli looks at the rain. Then marches out into it, lugging her stuff. Goes about 15 yards in one direction, then stops. \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - SAME \nJack watches her out the window as she marches 15 yards in another direction, then stops. Pondering. She sees a bus stop across the street. She crosses to it and sits. \nEXT. BUS STOP - DAY \nAli peers down the street for the bus. Jack appears beside her, getting soaked in the rain. \nJACK So, this plan of yours? \nALI .was to sit here at the bus stop and come up with a plan. \nJACK Come back inside. \nALI No, Jack, I-- \nJACK \nALI-- \nALI (CONT'D) I may not have been to a professional dance school, but I have a lot of talent and I came to this town to do something with it. And the only reason I've been putting up with all the bullshit \"attitude\" I get from you is cause I want to do it here. \n(BEAT) For the first time in my life, I don't want to be someplace else. So you're gonna give me MY shot. Right here. Right now. Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess just looks at her, blinks, incredulous. \nALI (CONT'D) One song. You don't like it, I'll quit and do us both a favor. \n(BEAT) Your call, lady. I know every number in the show. Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back \nAGAIN-- \nTESS \n(DOUBTFUL) You know every number. \nALI Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her in disbelief. \nALI (CONT'D) I said, which one do you wanna see? Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to DAVE in the sound booth-- \nTESS Tough Lover! Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly. ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality. After a few measures, Tess has seen enough. \nTESS (CONT'D) Okay then, next? \nALI Hang on. (to Dave in the booth) Start it again, please? As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down and shakes it loose. Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage-- \nNIKKI \n(TO GEORGIA) What the hell's going on? \nCOCO Shhhh. On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude. Then she looks up at the booth again. \nALI Anytime. The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive. She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She misses a step or two, but who the hell cares? On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced. Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow. At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms - - unable to tear his eyes away. \nAs the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound is Ali's heavy breathing. Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY. \nNIKKI What are so you happy about, that's your replacement. \nGEORGIA Yeah, but she's really good. Tess and Ali are in a stare down. \nTESS I want so badly to say something bitchy, but nothing's coming. \nSEAN There's a first. Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props. \nTESS You were off the whole second half. \nALI So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and RUNS to the bathroom to puke-- Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali. \nTESS Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in my ass. Ali tries hard not to beam-- \nALI Do I have the job, or not? \nTESS You're not great. What you are is lucky. Because I need someone tonight. \nALI And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves-- \nTESS Even in those shoes that time forgot. \nSEAN Theeeere's bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot. \nNIKKI Well-- this totally sucks ass. Sean jumps up on the stage. \nSEAN Congratulations. The last time someone showed Tess balls like that, she married him. (looks Ali over) You look like a checker at a Mal Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your salary. Get a new look. \nALI Hey, I happen to like the way I look. \nSEAN Really? That's a fascinating story. And then what happens? \n(ALL BUSINESS) Backstage in five. \n(WALKING OFF) Welcome to the family. Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms around him. \nALI Sorry for the short notice, I quit! (plants a big kiss on him) But hey-- with my raise I'll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him standing there, really turned on. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - DAY \nSean swings open A DOOR, revealing a room packed to the gills with costumes: feathers, sequins, fishnets, corsets, jammed up against each other. Sean tosses her clothes in a blur. \nSEAN First number, second number, third number... She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them, holding them up as he tells her what they go with: \nSEAN (CONT'D) With the sequined bustier. With the shorts and garters. With the beaded number. And those -- (points to hers) I never want to see again. \n(REMEMBERING) Oh! And -- He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN. \nSEAN (CONT'D) For \"Miss Otis Regrets\". Just be sure you don't -- Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM -- GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean. \nSEAN (CONT'D) Pull the trigger. \nMUSIC UP: \"RICH MAN'S FRUG\". CARRY MUSIC OVER: \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT \nJACK (CONT'D) I'm gonna suck it up and let you stay here a little longer. Just throw in a little something for rent. She looks at him, curious. \nALI What about the \"God damn\" cat? \nJACK Hey, I don't like the cat. And I don't like my towel being wet. I don't like the lack of privacy. But you're in a jam -- and I'm the kind of guy, if a friend's in trouble, I help. It's just who I am. \nALI \n(SUSPICIOUS) What did Natalie have to say? \nJACK Nothing, you know just... hi. She narrows her eyes at him. He concedes. \nJACK (CONT'D) And...her play got extended three more months, so since she has to pay rent there, she can't also keep up her part of the rent here. \nALI Ah-hah. \nJACK So if you could stick around and chip in, it would -- \nALI Save your ass? \nJACK -- help. Ali looks down at his shoes. \nALI Well, will you look at that? The shoe, on the other foot! \nJACK \nOKAY -- \nALI One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and \nEVICTION -- \nJACK Just -- yes or no? \nALI What's the proposal, exactly? Jack looks at her-- realizes he's screwed. \nJACK The bedroom, with private bathroom access, for 600 a month, including utilities. \nALI Closet? \nJACK Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad. \nALI Ooh, look! Hot tub! \nJACK Fine. The closet, too. She weighs it. Makes him suffer. Then: \nALI Okay. \nJACK Thank you. \nALI \n(MOCKING HIM) Hey, I'm the kind of girl, if a friend's in trouble, I help. That's just who I am. We HEAR an AUDIENCE laugh O.S. as we... \nEXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nSmall crowd outside. \nTESS (O.S.) So I said to the sailor, I may not be as good as I once was... \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nThrough a transparent scrim, the Puccini Triplets perform a sexy harem scene in silhouette, casting larger than life shadows-- Tess walks behind the scrim playfully, in and out of view. The Bumber Band plays off to the side. \nTESS But you can bet your sweet ass I'm better ONCE than I ever was... The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn't laughing. \nTESS (CONT'D) Drink up, sister! You're a tad behind. (to a waiter, re: woman) Be a dear and bring Mommy over there another scotch. The crowd chuckles as the Bumper Band kicks in and the harem scene evolves into a sexy tongue-in-cheek silhouetted dance. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nTess comes off stage. Sean bustles up to her. \nSEAN The distributor's holding back the booze unless we cut him a check. \nTESS Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett over to flirt, and try to finagle him down to a half. \nSEAN How's a third? He produces a check, all filled-out, for her to sign. \nTESS Have I told you lately that I love you? \nSEAN Got any brothers? \nHe bustles off with the check. Scarlett, Coco and Nikki approach the stage wearing leather, strappy Gaultier corsets with gloves and fishnets --post-modern Germanesque -- Nikki is carrying a glass of tequila. Tess eyeballs her-- \nTESS Drinking already? \nNIKKI Yes, Mommie. \nTESS You're drunk. \nTess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather. Sean looks at Tess. Scarlett looks at Coco. Jack stares at the stage. Everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this girl. And now the song really takes off! SUDDENLY, one of the BAND BOYS grabs his sax and plays. Ali jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in. Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her. \nALI (CONT'D) \nI WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I \nNEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A \nTOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. TOUGH \nLOVER. UH-HA... Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up. In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali. The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move. \nALI (CONT'D) \nWHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A THRILL \nAND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE, I WON ' T \nKEEP STILL ... ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages like we've never seen them. \nALI/GIRLS \nI WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I \nNEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A \nTOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. \nBARTENDERS/GIRLS \nTOUGH LOVER. UH-HA...

I \nNEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A \nTOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. \nBARTENDERS/GIRLS \nTOUGH LOVER. UH-HA::! The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a- lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling. Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she sees Tess beside him, stone-faced. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nThe Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating Ali -- a whirlwind of hugs, kisses. Ali reaches Tess. \nALI Tess, when the music stopped-- \nTESS DAVE Why didn't you tell me you I have no idea what happened. could blow like that? \nALI (CONT'D) I did. Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the door. \nTESS Do you boys know all the music? \nTATTOOED BAND GUY Hell, yeah. Nikki wanders in, drink in hand. Tess looks at them all. Plants her hands on her hips. \nJOURDAN. THE BAG NORTH AFRICAN, AND \nSO IS THE TAN. MY ADDRESS TODAY, \nFABER ST. HONERE, TOMORROW RIO, THE \nCONCORDE THE WAY. MY RING IS \nBULGARI, IT MAKES THEIR HEADS \nTWIRL, THEY ALL SAY, 'DARLING, WHAT \nDID YOU DO FOR THAT PEARL?' WHAT? I \nAM A GOOD GIRL. NEW YORK 54. CREON, \nCOTE D 'AZUR. L. A.

THEY ALL SAY MY \nFEET NEVER DO TOUCH THE GROUND. \nWHAT?. I AM A GOOD GIRL. Ali finishes the song to big applause. Takes her bow. Makes her way off the stage and ACROSS the club to... JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali. \nALI (CONT'D) Hiya, big boy. She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too much. \nALI (CONT'D) What do you think? \nJACK \n(FLUSTERED) It's...I think-you look...I mean, yeah... do you like it? Not the reaction she was looking for. \nALI Jack. It's okay for you to think I look hot. We're friends for chrissakes. It's not like we're brother and sister. \nShe rolls her eyes, gets up, and heads backstage. Jack watches her go-- \nJACK \n(TO HIMSELF) No. We certainly are not. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nThe Burlesque Girls are prepping for the show. \nNIKKI Why the hell is everyone having a conniption over her? She's just a tacky, pushy girl from a -- Ali -- sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous -- enters. \nNIKKI (CONT'D) -- fly-over state. Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection. \nALI \n(FAUX INNOCENT) What's a fly-over state? Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nTess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She turns and walks the other way. Vince catches up to her. \nVINCE \nTESS -- \nTESS Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no. \nVINCE Which made Marcus bump his offer up again. It's obscene, what he wants to give us. At least hear him out. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT \nTess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit across from her, watching. \nMARCUS It's very simple. I buy you out and pay you a million off the top. (motions to Vince) Five hundred grand each. Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus. \nTESS Why do you want this club so badly? \nMARCUS Best view on the Sunset Strip. \nVINCE Do you know what you could do with that money, Tess? \nTESS Do you know what you can do with that money, Vince? \nVINCE Be reasonable. We're rolling vendors ninety days out. \nMARCUS The club's not even worth what you paid for it. You've got a second mortgage, you can't get a third. Tess looks at Vince, betrayed. \nTAKES HIS TIME... \nTHE SONG CONTINUES OVER: - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali lies on her stomach on the floor perusing a Fashion Magazine. Across the room, Jack sits on the couch, PLAYING HIS KEYBOARD--UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare. Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there. - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DRESSING ROOM - Ali, the Girls and Sean getting ready. Georgia bursts into the room, showing off an ENGAGEMENT RING. Everyone jumps up, congratulates her. - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - The GIRLS and Ali vamp, singing: \nALI (CONT'D) \nA GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME, I'D GO \nFOR ANYTIME. A HASTY JOB REALLY \nSPOILS A MASTER'S TOUCH ... AT THE BAR, Jack watches as he pours drinks. - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack's motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the engine. Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in their hair. Her scarf tears away, lifting into the air... - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali and Burlesque girls continue... \nALI (CONT'D) \nI DON'T LIKE A BIG COMMOTION, I'M A \nDEMON FOR SLOW MOTION OR SUCH. WHY \nSHOULD I DENY, THAT I WOULD DIE, TO \nKNOW A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME ... - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali, Sean, Tess, Scarlett, Anna, Georgia, DAMON (her fiance), hanging out in the living room, decorated with party gear. The lights dim and Jack and Coco enter with a birthday cake. They set it in front of Ali. Ali looks around at her friends, drinking it in. She locks eyes with Jack -- then closes her eyes and BLOWS. - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali, still singing her song. \nALI (CONT'D) \nI CAN SPOT AN AMATEUR, APPRECIATE A \nCONNOISSEUR IN HIS TRADE, WHO WOULD \nQUALIFY, NO ALIBI, TO BE THE GUY, \nWHO TAKES HIS TIME... PULL BACK to reveal A PACKED HOUSE. The audience goes nuts. Marcus is at his table, clapping, whistling, her biggest fan. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - AT THE BAR - LATER \nAli walks up to the bar. \nALI Hey -- when can you cut out? I'm about to fall asleep standing up. \nJACK I have that gig, remember? In fact, I gotta head out or I'm gonna be late. (checking his watch) I can maybe swing you home before. \nALI No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab a ride with Coco. He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out: \nJACK By the way -- you killed. \nALI (looks at him, smiles) Thanks. \nHe disappears out the back exit. Ali turns around and finds herself face to face with Marcus. \nMARCUS You ready? \nALI For what? \nMARCUS I'll drop you off. \n(BEAT) Coco left five minutes ago. She realizes he was listening to her conversation. \nALI Excuse me? \nMARCUS Sorry-- I was coming to talk to you and caught the end of your conversation. \nALI (putting on her coat reaching for her bags) Talk to me about...? \nMARCUS Dinner. With me. Gimmie that. He swoops down and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and heads out. \nMARCUS (CONT'D) \n(WALKING AWAY) If you ever expect to see this bag alive again... you'll come with me. \nALI Hey...! Come back here...! \nINT. MARCUS'S BENTLEY - NIGHT \nON Ali, looking out the window with her arms crossed. WIDEN to REVEAL, she's in car with Marcus, zipping along Sunset. \nALI Where are you taking me? \nMARCUS I told you-- to dinner. \nALI Dinner? What about Nikki-- What's up with you and Nikki? \nMARCUS We're friends. \nALI Where I'm from friends don't chew each other's earlobes. \nMARCUS Aren't you glad you left? (then, remembering) Oh, damn! \nALI What? \nMARCUS I just remembered I have to make a quick appearance at a party. \nEVERY DAY. \n- INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - NIGHT \nAli moves in sync with the Girls. Tess watches from the wings, pleased. \nALI (CONT'D) \nSTRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING EVERY \nDAY, OOH EVERY DAY! \nBARTENDERS \nEVERY DAY! \nALI \nEVERY DAY. THERE ' S STRANGE THINGS \nHAPPENING EVERY DAY ... \n- INT.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nNikki watches from the wings, seething, as Marcus delights in Ali's performance. \nALI (CONT'D) \nI THINK I FOUND SOMEONE NEW ... \n- INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWee hours. Ali comes in, shuts the door as quietly as she can, then tiptoes past Jack, asleep on the couch. \nALI (O.S.) (CONT'D) \nAND I THINK IT'S THROUGH WITH \nYOU... After she passes... Jack's eyes open. \n- INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nAli, owning the stage and the room. \nALI (CONT'D) \nSTRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING EVERY \nDAY ... YEAAAAAHHH: STRANGE THINGS \nARE HAPPENING!! HAPPENING .1 The SONG ENDS in a flourish. There's a CAMERA FLASH! FREEZE FRAME on the image: ALI, belting onstage, with the Burlesque Girls striking a pose behind her. WIDEN to see it's a photo on the front page of the L.A. TIMES Calendar section. The headline: \"BURLESQUE HAS A VOICE:\". \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nJack, sleepy, in boxers, stares at the newspaper, bewildered. \nJACK Hey. Have you seen this? \nALI What? Ali wanders out of the bathroom, brushing her teeth. He shows her the paper. She SCREAMS. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - AFTERNOON \nThe Burlesque Girls (minus Ali) crowd around the paper. \nNIKKI That's bullshit. \nSCARLETT No. That's major. \nNIKKI (pointing to photo) Look again. The only thing major is the size of your ass. Nikki walks off-- Scarlett pick up the paper, looks closer-- Ali enters, dance bag over her shoulder, running late. The Burlesque Girls and Sean all APPLAUD (except Nikki) Ali smiles. Embarrassed. She curtsies sarcastically. Coco points to a BOUQUET OF ROSES at Ali's station. \nCOCO From Monsieur Louboutin, I presume. Ali reads the card: \"To the best view in L.A. - M\". Sean shoves her down in her seat, pulls her coat off. \nSEAN Shake your tail, Alicat, you still got a show to do. \nEXT. THE BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nA PACKED LINE of chattering hipsters snakes down the block. \nNIKKI I won't be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs! Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious. \nTESS So don't be! Leave! If you don't want to be a part of what's happening here, then I don't want you around. \nNIKKI \n(AGHASST) You'd destroy our friendship and break up the group over some girl you barely know? \nTESS Since when do you care about friendship? Or this group? You're a trainwreck, Nikki! You put tequila on your breakfast cereal! I'm struggling to survive here, and you show up too drunk to dance! You call that loyalty? Nikki just looks at her-- \nNIKKI Okay, then. I quit! Nikki stomps off. Tess sighs -- \nTESS \nNIKKI-- WAIT-- \nNIKKI Marcus says you're losing the club anyway! \n(MOCKING HER) \"They don't come to hear us sing\" \n(MORE) \nNIKKI (CONT'D) \n(SOTTO) Stupid bitch. Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns once more: \nNIKKI (CONT'D) By the way: I slept with Vince the day after your honeymoon. Tess's eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and HURLS it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of the head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see: TESS, running right at her. Nikki bolts, heading for her car. She jumps in, locks the door just as Tess SMASHES her fist on the window and KICKS the door. Nikki starts the car. \nNIKKI (CONT'D) You crazy bitch! Nikki screeches off, leaving Tess alone in the parking lot. Tess stands there a moment, then HEADS back into the club. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nThe club is totally empty. Everyone is gone. Tess ENTERS, GRABS her bag as she spots a cabaret chair lying on it's side on stage. She crosses onto the stage. Picks up the chair as... \nDAVE (O.S.) Night, Tess. Tess looks up, Dave is closing up the sound booth. \nTESS Night, Dave. Dave FLIPS a big lever, and almost all the lights go OUT, leaving one shaft of light across the stage. We HEAR Dave leave, as the street door closes shut. Tess alone on stage. \nBEGIN TESS SOLO SONG NUMBER. TO BE WRITTEN. \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAli enters quietly, all dressed up. She slips off her heels and tiptoes to the bedroom. She slowly opens the bedroom door, then stops when she sees: \nJACK, asleep in the bed. Ali looks at him, then looks at the couch. Empty. She closes the door, fluffs the pillow, lies down on the couch, and pulls the blankets up over her. She lies in the darkness. PUSH THROUGH the wall to see Jack, lying awake in the bed, the cat on his lap. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - WIDE PANORAMA - MORNING \nTHE SOUND OF A COFFEE GRINDER \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nCLOSE ON Ali, sleeping on the sofa-- abruptly wakes to the deafening grinding of coffee. She gets up, drags herself to the kitchen. Sees Jack, grinding the coffee way longer than is necessary. \nALI You really need to do that at 6 in the morning? He turns, sees her. \nJACK Little overdressed for breakfast. \nALI My pajamas were in my bedroom. Which was occupied. \nJACK Well, you're never here so... it's stupid for me to crash on the couch every night when there's a perfectly good empty bed. Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces. \nALI So -- you want the bedroom back? Is that what you're saying? \nJACK The bed should be used by someone. \nALI Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe not when you think I should be, but last I checked, you were my roommate, not my mother. \n(MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) However, since it's an issue, what the hell, take the bed, I'll sleep on the sofa. I don't care. \nJACK Fine. \nALI Fine. \nJACK You'll have to move all your shit. \nALI I realize that. \nJACK Cause the room's a total mess -- \nALI I'll move my stuff, God -- \nJACK Clothes, make-up, shoes, hair things. \nALI Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I started hanging out with Marcus, you've been acting like a class-A prick. Is there something you want to say? \nJACK What? No. What do I care? You're ambitious, he can make things happen, go ahead, make a deal with the devil, what's it to me? \nJACK (trying to be serious) The dog, or Nanna? Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door open, and they fall into the apartment. \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJack and Ali stumble in, Jack knocks the lamp over trying to turn on the light. It BREAKS. Ali giggles as she plops down on the couch, struggling to take off her leather boot. No luck. She holds her legs out. \nALI Help me. Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second -- it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp. \nJACK (like to a dog) Stay. He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows \nJACK (CONT'D) Good night. He backs away, into the bedroom. Ali looks confused. \nALI Oh. Okay. \n(BEAT) Good night. Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door. Ali stares at it, surprised. Then resigned. Oh, well. She undoes her bra, threads it through her top and out the arms. Then Jack's door opens. He stands in the doorway in matching \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" pajamas, leaning against the doorframe like Hugh Hefner in his finest silk smoking jacket. \nALI (CONT'D) Cute jammies. \nJACK A gift from my mother. Never worn them. \nALI Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the door. \nJACK Forgot to lock up. \n(HE DOES) Okay. Night. \nALI Night again. He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door. Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top. \nJACK Water. No hangover. He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap. After a moment he returns to the bedroom, nodding to Ali. \nJACK (CONT'D) Night. Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting. After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in boxers. \nJACK (CONT'D) Hungry. He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal, pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the fridge, pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom, crunching. He closes the door. Then -- very quickly -- he opens it again and walks out. \nJACK (CONT'D) I know I forgot something else, but I just can't remember what... \n(TO HIMSELF) Door locked, water, food... He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up. \nJACK (CONT'D) What's so funny? She covers her face. He glances down. \nJACK (CONT'D) Well I never! He strides back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a moment, he comes back out dressed in an old, flowered bathrobe and fur-lined orange hunting cap. \nJACK (CONT'D) I remembered what I forgot to do. \nALI What? \nJACK \n(SERIOUS) Kiss you goodnight. He crosses to her, takes her in his arms, and kisses her. She kisses back, making up for all their lost time. MUSIC UP: \"PRISONER\" a big, soulful ballad. \nPAN OFF THEM TO: \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT \nAli steps into frame on stage, singing: \nALI \nI ' LL NEVER BE LONELY. I'LL NEVER \nLOSE YOU. I 'LL NEVER BE BLUE \nOR BE ALL ALONE. JUST DON'T EVER \nLEAVE ME. SO MY HEART WON'T GRIEVE \nME. AND OUR GOOD LOVIN \nWON'T END IN VAIN... \nCARRY MUSIC AS CAMERA PANS UP OFF ALI AND DRIFTS BACK \nDOWN TO: \nJACK'S APARTMENT - DAY Jack and Ali in bed, in post-coital bliss. \nALI (CONT'D) Well, it's official. \nJACK What? \nALI You are definitely not gay. He smiles at her, drunk with lust. CAMERA PANS UP AND OFF OF \nTHEM... THEN DRIFTS BACK DOWN TO: \nTHE CLUB - NIGHT Ali on stage, lights blasting. \nALI (CONT'D) \nOH YOUR LOVE. HAS GOT ME IN \nJACK Is Ali here? \nMARK Just left. Mark continues down. Jack whips around, looks at him, then up at Sean, who nods. \nJACK Where'd she go? \nSEAN With Marcus. \nJACK What? \nSEAN I told you, opportunity doesn't knock forever. Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs. Sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside. Then pauses, noticing: Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out: \nSEAN (CONT'D) Hey! You! \nMARK \n(LOOKS UP) It's Mark. \nSEAN Mark. You wanna have breakfast? Off Mark's smile: \nINT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nAli follows Marcus through the kitchen, to the fridge. \nMARCUS My mother always said there's only one thing to do when you're feeling blue... He opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of CHAMPAGNE. \nALI She was a poet. \nMARCUS And a drunk. Ali smiles. Marcus pops the cork, fills two glasses, hands her one. Clinks. \nMARCUS (CONT'D) To your new place. \nALI What new place? \nINT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY \nA lavish, 1000-square-foot guest house. Marcus ushers Ali in. \nMARCUS All yours. (off her look) Unpack. Move in. \nALI Marcus, I can't just-- \nMARCUS Sure you can. Marcus plops her suitcase on the bed. \nMARCUS (CONT'D) Unpack. You're home. \nALI It's not even on the bus route. \nMARCUS Okay, that is the first and last time the term \"bus route\" will be spoken in this house. (motions out window) Four cars. Which do you want? \nEXT. MARCUS'S GAZEBO - SUNSET \nAli lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of L.A. against a fiery red sky. Marcus comes out of the house, with a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise. Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes. \nMARCUS Better? \nALI \n(SMILES) Better. She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level. \nMARCUS You're gonna be on one of those someday. \nALI Yeah, right. \nMARCUS Sooner than you think, too. Harold Saint called me today. You made quite an impression on him. \nALI Really? What'd he say? \nMARCUS He wants to make a demo with you. \nALI Are you serious? When?? \nMARCUS He found a little studio time on Tuesday. \nALI This Tuesday? \nMARCUS Too soon? \nALI No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing. You're amazing. \nMARCUS I like making you happy. Your whole face lights up. Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face. \nALI I think you're way too nice to me. \nMARCUS And that's a problem because... \nALI I've had a lot to drink. And my judgment is off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable. \nMARCUS Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means I'd never kiss a lady when she's... vulnerable. \nAs Eva performs and the Bartenders and Jack sing, SEAN looks up at Dave, and MOTIONS for the SPOTLIGHT on Jack. Dave nods, and SWINGS the SPOTLIGHT hitting JACK. The Bartenders push Jack up onto the bar as he TAKES THE LEAD-- \nJACK \n.I SAID THAT'S LIFE, AND AS FUNNY \nAS IT MAY SEEM \nSOME PEOPLE GET THEIR KICKS, \nSTOMPIN' ON A DREAM \nBUT I DON'T LET IT, LET IT GET ME DOWN, \n'CAUSE THIS FINE OL' WORLD IT KEEPS \nSPINNING AROUND... \nI'VE BEEN A PUPPET, A PAUPER, A \nPIRATE, A POET, A PAWN AND A KING. \nI'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN AND OVER AND \nOUT AND I KNOW ONE THING: \nEACH TIME I FIND MYSELF, FLAT ON MY \nFACE, I PICK MYSELF UP AND GET BACK \nIN THE RACE... The whole club is with him now, as Jack channels Sinatra, standing on the bar-- the Bartenders sing back-up. \nJACK (CONT'D) \nTHAT'S LIFE. THAT'S LIFE AND I \nCAN'T DENY IT. MANY TIMES I THOUGHT \nOF CUTTING OUT, BUT MY HEART WON'T \nBUY IT. BUT IF THERE ' S NOTHING \nSHAKIN' COME THIS HERE JULY... \nI'M GONNA ROLL MYSELF UP IN A BIG \nBALL AND DIE. MY, MY. Applause, hoots and hollers. Jack high-fives and fist pumps his buddies, hugs Sean, grabs his bag and suitcase and EXITS out the back as... Tess ENTERS. SEES Sean is at the bar. He looks up-- \nSEAN How'd it go? (sees her face) Oh, shit. \nShe grabs a bottle of Tequila and a glass, turns to walk off. \nSEAN (CONT'D) What are you gonna do? \nTESS Right now? Get really drunk. THE FRONT DOORS OPEN, and Ali ENTERS, spots Tess, rushes over to her. \nALI Tess! I have to talk to you! Tess keeps walking. \nALI (CONT'D) Marcus Gerber is trying to buy the lounge, and he's gonna tear it down and build a twenty-story skyscraper! Tess stops. Slowly turns and stares at Ali, who's suddenly embarrassed to admit... \nALI (CONT'D) I just saw the plans. Tess looks at Ali. Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless, waiting for her reaction. But Tess just turns, continues up to her office, and shuts the door. Ali turns to Sean-- then starts after her-- \nALI (CONT'D) She has to do something! She can't just let him -- \nSEAN \n(STOPPING HER) Let it go, girl. She just got turned down for another loan. It's either foreclose, or sell to Marcus. \nALI So that's it? It's over? \nSEAN The circle of life, baby. All good things must come to an end. \nALI But she can't just give up! \nSEAN She's not giving up. She's going down with her ship. With dignity. Ali sits on a barstool, in disbelief. \nSEAN (CONT'D) I've got something for you. He pulls out the photo of Ali with her mother. It's in a new frame. \nALI Where'd you get this? \nSEAN Jack. He dropped it off on his way to the airport. \nALI Where's he going? \nSEAN New York on the red-eye. \nALI To be with Natalie? \nSEAN Pedal faster, baby, he and Natalie are over.

Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have... (motions to the girls) .the best view on the Sunset Strip.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nTess is arriving in her office, defeated, as Ali bursts in behind her. \nALI Tess! \nTESS You could knock-- this is still my office--at least for another 48 \nHOURS-- \nALI But this is really, really -- Tess holds up a hand. \nTESS Not. Now. \nALI \nBUT-- \nTESS I said -- NOT -- \nALI Yes now! God damn, you are one stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now, when I have something to tell you, you listen! I told you I could dance, did you listen? No. Big mistake. I told you I could sing, did you listen? No. Big. mistake. This time you are going to hear what I have to say if I have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in your God damn ear.

Damnit, Nancy, get him back. Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns to Tess. \nBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) Back with more noise complaints? \nTESS You offered to buy my club a few years back. I said no. \nBUSINESSMAN And now you've changed your mind. \nTESS Not exactly. Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and sits herself down. Ali does the same. \nBUSINESSMAN I'm confused. \nTESS Go with me, there's a good ending, I promise. How much will these condos you're building sell for? \nBUSINESSMAN They start at one million and go up, depending on the view. \nTESS What if I told you a twenty-story high-rise was going up where my club is? \n(TO ALI) Would twenty stories block his view? \nALI Ten stories would. Twenty would decimate them. Leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows. \nTESS So. Mr. ? \nBUSINESSMAN Anderson. \nTESS Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million- dollar ocean views are going away because I'm selling my building to a developer tomorrow who'll have his twenty stories all framed up by the time you start selling -- \nALI Trying to sell-- \nTESS Trying to sell these condos. \n(BEAT) Or. I can put you in a position where your buyers could be guaranteed their million-dollar views forever. \nBUSINESSMAN I'm listening. \nTESS As am I.

She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out her arms as Sean slips her corset onto her-- Tess eyes Nikki's body-- \nTESS Hold it right there. Weigh in. Nikki unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head. \nTESS (CONT'D) Put on five pounds or I bump you. Nikki protests as Sean double-takes at Georgia -- who FLITS BY with a slightly protruding belly. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - IOWA - NIGHT \nAli winds her way through the trailers, carrying a bag of take-out, with a swing in her step -- moving to music playing in her head.

Ali rolls her eyes. \nLATER, The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali and Loretta alone. \nLORETTA You were real good to her, Ali. \nALI No, she was good to me. She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up. \nALI (CONT'D) And she wasn't even my real Nanna. \nLORETTA What...? \nALI Foster care. She took me in for the checks. When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could've kicked me out, but she didn't. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) She had a lot of pain at the end.

And you owe me for three weeks. \nDWIGHT I don't owe anyone anything till the end of the month. Ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him. \nALI You know what, Dwight? Contrary to what you've been told, there's no law in Grundy that says you have to spend every waking minute being a tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick -- \nLORETTA (trying to intercede) Ooh, hon, I'm not sure that particular approach is gonna -- \nALI I've spent three years of my life \nHERE-- \nDWIGHT --And you'll probably spend another three. You want to quit? Good riddance. I'll replace you before you hit the county line, but I sure ain't gonna pay for the privilege. He walks out the back door, slamming it behind him. \nANGLE ON: THE CASH REGISTER. Ali opens the drawer, pulls out a wad of cash. Peering out back to make sure Dwight isn't coming in, Ali counts out some money. \nLORETTA What are you doing? \nALI I'm only taking what he owes me. \n(THEN) How much was that bike you been wanting for little Keith? Ali STUFFS a few TWENTIES into Loretta's apron-- pockets the rest. \nLORETTA Ali-- where are you gonna go? \nALI Somewhere I can breathe. Now gimme a hug, I gotta get out of here before he gets back. Loretta hugs her tight, then looks Ali in the eye, concerned. \nLORETTA You can't just head off into the sunset without a plan. \nALI \n(RESOLUTE) Watch me.

Then... \nMARCUS (CONT'D) What do you want, Ali? In life. Girl like you, gives up everything, gets on a bus heading for total uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I want to know what it is. \nALI Why? \nMARCUS Because you're talented enough to get whatever you want. And I'm smart enough to help make it happen. So? What do you want? A beat. She thinks about it.

And I want to die knowing I made the most of every opportunity life gave me. \nMARCUS That's ...so beautiful. \nAL I There wasn't a dry eye in the house when I said it at the Grundy County Junior Miss Talent Show. His eyes narrow. \nMARCUS Why do you women always take advantage of nice boys? \nALI Oh, please. You are SO not a nice boy. He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy. \nINT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - WEE HOURS - NIGHT \nParty's over. Lights low. Ali walks through the almost- empty house, passes a COUPLE making out on a couch, a GUY who holds out a joint. She motions \"no thanks\", heads into the: LIVING ROOM, where Marcus is asleep on a Bertolli chair, drink in hand. An OLDER GUY is playing the piano quietly. Ali takes the drink from Marcus's hand, sets it on the table. She hears the pianist start a new song: (TBD). She smiles. Goes over to him. \nALI Ooh, I love this song. The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line. She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping, not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the middle of the night. \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC \nJack quietly lets himself in. He sets his keyboard down, then sees the bedroom door cracked, the light on. \nJACK Ali? He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock: 4:45. He hears a \"meow\", and sees the cat.

My Nanna used to call me her Ali-Cat. \nSEAN Yet another fascinating story. \nNIKKI Why doesn't Tess have a nickname for me? \nCOCO Oh, she does. A knowing look amongst the girls. \nNIKKI She never uses it. \nSEAN Sure she does. \nNIKKI When? \nSEAN Just after you leave the room. Nikki gives him the finger and walks out. A beat.

FREEZE FRAME on the image: ALI, belting onstage, with the Burlesque Girls striking a pose behind her. WIDEN to see it's a photo on the front page of the L.A. TIMES Calendar section. The headline: \"BURLESQUE HAS A VOICE:\". \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nJack, sleepy, in boxers, stares at the newspaper, bewildered. \nJACK Hey. Have you seen this? \nALI What? Ali wanders out of the bathroom, brushing her teeth. He shows her the paper. She SCREAMS. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - AFTERNOON \nThe Burlesque Girls (minus Ali) crowd around the paper. \nNIKKI That's bullshit. \nSCARLETT No. That's major. \nNIKKI (pointing to photo) Look again. The only thing major is the size of your ass. Nikki walks off-- Scarlett pick up the paper, looks closer-- Ali enters, dance bag over her shoulder, running late. The Burlesque Girls and Sean all APPLAUD (except Nikki) Ali smiles. Embarrassed. She curtsies sarcastically. Coco points to a BOUQUET OF ROSES at Ali's station. \nCOCO From Monsieur Louboutin, I presume. Ali reads the card: \"To the best view in L.A. - M\". Sean shoves her down in her seat, pulls her coat off. \nSEAN Shake your tail, Alicat, you still got a show to do. \nEXT.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT \nDaredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille, in striped stockings, corsets, and tons of cleavage, swing on a trapeze over the audience. Playing the comedy, grabbing each other in all the right places. Classic Burlesque, unusually bawdy. Equally suggestive, funny, and skillful. Tess, all dolled-up, weaves through the tables, greeting, welcoming, reveling in the crowd. FIND Ali as she strides over to Marcus's booth. He stands, hands her a glass of champagne. \nMARCUS To the girl of the hour. \nALI I'm starting to think you'll go to any length. \nMARCUS \n(INNOCENTLY) I just made a call to Greg at the Times. \nALI Well-- I appreciate the kudos. (re: crowded room) And Tess appreciates the business. \nMARCUS This has NOTHING to do with Tess. This is about you. And me. \nALI You are so full of it. He laughs-- takes her arm-- \nMARCUS I've got another friend I want you to meet. She sees HAROLD SAINT sitting in the booth. He's in his 60's, still dressing like Robert Evans in his heyday. \nMARCUS (CONT'D) Ali Rose, Harold Saint. \nALI \n(SHOCKED) Harold Saint? Shut up. You worked with Etta James. \nHAROLD Her, she chewed me up and spat me out, that one. But with her voice, I forgive her everything. \n(THEN) You got a set of pipes on you, too, little girl. I like your sound. \nALI Thank you. \n(SMILES) I like yours. \nHAROLD You ever recorded? \nALI Not yet. \nHAROLD We should do something about that. He stands. Turns to Marcus. \nHAROLD (CONT'D) See you round, kiddo. He points his finger, gun-style, which would seem cheesy, but he's old school, so instead it's weirdly cool. He leaves. \nALI Holy shit. Harold Saint. AT THE BAR, Jack watches Ali and Marcus talking excitedly. Not liking what he sees. Sean breezes by, grabs a drink. \nSEAN You snooze, you lose, pretty boy. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nSean grips the drink in his teeth as he bustles through the backstage, gathering costumes. He passes Tess going the other way. \nTESS Can you believe this crowd? He dumps the costumes in her arms. \nSEAN 'bout time. These poor babies are begging for your glue-gun. Tess walks off with the armful of clothes, so happy, humming to herself, passes her OFFICE-- OPENS the door to SEE-- VINCE is sitting at her desk. He flinches at the sight of her- \nTESS Can you believe the crowd out there? Never thought I'd see- She stops in her tracks, spotting Vince's PANTS on the FLOOR, and a TRAIL OF WOMEN'S CLOTHES to... THE NEW COCKTAIL WAITRESS, peering out, half-dressed, from behind the curtains-- \nTESS (CONT'D) \n(DISGUSTED) In my god damn office? She shakes her head-- GRABS HER PURSE-- and walks out. \nEXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nTess, pissed off, carries the damaged costumes out to her car. Nikki is behind her, following her out. \nNIKKI Tess. We need to talk. Tess rolls her eyes, doesn't slow. \nTESS Not now, Nikki. \nNIKKI Yes, now. I've been here since the beginning. We built this club together. And then some girl shows up out of nowhere-- who hasn't even paid her dues-- \nTESS I'll get her to write a check tomorrow. \nNIKKI And suddenly it's her show? \nTESS No, it's not her show. It's my show. But people want to hear her sing. She's bringing them in off the streets. You better believe I'm building a show around her! \nNIKKI I can sing too! And you know it. But you don't give a shit. You always say this is a dance troupe, now suddenly it's not? \nTESS \nNIKKI-- \nNIKKI And you expect me to dance behind a girl who struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with Marcus Gerber? \nTESS (unlocking her car) Nikki, you're wasted. Go home. \n", "test1_id": 3153, "test2_input": "NIKKI I won't be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs! Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious. \nTESS So don't be! Leave! If you don't want to be a part of what's happening here, then I don't want you around. \nNIKKI \n(AGHASST) You'd destroy our friendship and break up the group over some girl you barely know? \nTESS Since when do you care about friendship? Or this group? You're a trainwreck, Nikki! You put tequila on your breakfast cereal! I'm struggling to survive here, and you show up too drunk to dance! You call that loyalty? Nikki just looks at her-- \nNIKKI Okay, then. I quit! Nikki stomps off. Tess sighs -- \nTESS \nNIKKI-- WAIT-- \nNIKKI Marcus says you're losing the club anyway! \n(MOCKING HER) \"They don't come to hear us sing\" \n(MORE) \nNIKKI (CONT'D) \n(SOTTO) Stupid bitch. Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns once more: \nNIKKI (CONT'D) By the way: I slept with Vince the day after your honeymoon. Tess's eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and HURLS it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of the head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see: TESS, running right at her. Nikki bolts, heading for her car. She jumps in, locks the door just as Tess SMASHES her fist on the window and KICKS the door. Nikki starts the car. \nNIKKI (CONT'D) You crazy bitch! Nikki screeches off, leaving Tess alone in the parking lot. Tess stands there a moment, then HEADS back into the club. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nThe club is totally empty. Everyone is gone. Tess ENTERS, GRABS her bag as she spots a cabaret chair lying on it's side on stage. She crosses onto the stage. Picks up the chair as... \nDAVE (O.S.) Night, Tess. Tess looks up, Dave is closing up the sound booth. \nTESS Night, Dave. Dave FLIPS a big lever, and almost all the lights go OUT, leaving one shaft of light across the stage. We HEAR Dave leave, as the street door closes shut. Tess alone on stage. \nBEGIN TESS SOLO SONG NUMBER. TO BE WRITTEN. \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAli enters quietly, all dressed up. She slips off her heels and tiptoes to the bedroom. She slowly opens the bedroom door, then stops when she sees: \nJACK, asleep in the bed. Ali looks at him, then looks at the couch. Empty. She closes the door, fluffs the pillow, lies down on the couch, and pulls the blankets up over her. She lies in the darkness. PUSH THROUGH the wall to see Jack, lying awake in the bed, the cat on his lap. \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - WIDE PANORAMA - MORNING \nTHE SOUND OF A COFFEE GRINDER \nINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nCLOSE ON Ali, sleeping on the sofa-- abruptly wakes to the deafening grinding of coffee. She gets up, drags herself to the kitchen. Sees Jack, grinding the coffee way longer than is necessary. \nALI You really need to do that at 6 in the morning? He turns, sees her. \nJACK Little overdressed for breakfast. \nALI My pajamas were in my bedroom. Which was occupied. \nJACK Well, you're never here so... it's stupid for me to crash on the couch every night when there's a perfectly good empty bed. Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces. \nALI So -- you want the bedroom back? Is that what you're saying? \nJACK The bed should be used by someone. \nALI Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe not when you think I should be, but last I checked, you were my roommate, not my mother. \n(MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) However, since it's an issue, what the hell, take the bed, I'll sleep on the sofa. I don't care. \nJACK Fine. \nALI Fine. \nJACK You'll have to move all your shit. \nALI I realize that. \nJACK Cause the room's a total mess -- \nALI I'll move my stuff, God -- \nJACK Clothes, make-up, shoes, hair things. \nALI Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I started hanging out with Marcus, you've been acting like a class-A prick. Is there something you want to say? \nJACK What? No. What do I care? You're ambitious, he can make things happen, go ahead, make a deal with the devil, what's it to me? \n", "test2_true": "(JACK SCOFFS) Second: I'm gonna take the couch, and you're gonna 86 the attitude. Or I'm finding another place to live. She storms out of the kitchen, tripping over the cat-- a LOUD MEOW! as the cat scurries away, Jack intercepting him-- \nJACK And try not to kill the cat! \nA SLAM of the bedroom door.

He looks at her, then away. \nEXT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC \nThe reception is underway. GUESTS are drinking, dancing with the iconic backdrop of Hollywood behind them. Ali, Sean, Coco and Tess stand together drinking, overlooking the city. ACROSS THE TERRACE, Jack is talking on his cell phone. \nJACK What do you mean, you're still in New York? ...So you just -- decided not to come? You think you might've wanted to, I don't know, let me know??? We haven't seen each other in six months. ACROSS THE TERRACE, Ali sees Jack yelling into his phone. Sean sees her watching. \nBACK ON JACK \nJACK (CONT'D) .why does every conversation we have end up being about YOUR future... Jack looks across the terrace at Ali. Moonlight on her shoulders. A breeze in her hair. \nJACK (CONT'D) .you know what, you're right. We both should be thinking about our futures. And I might just be looking at mine right now. Break a leg baby. Jack hangs up with finality and marches toward the bar-- His cell phone immediately rings again. \nHe sees it's Natalie, sends it to voicemail, and shuts off his phone. As he PASSES Sean and Coco-- \nJACK (CONT'D) I guess Natalie's not coming after all. \nSEAN Oh, please, that girl? Show up at a party where she's not the center of attention? AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack drains one drink and orders another, getting very drunk. Ali sidles up to the bar. \nALI \n(TO BARTENDER) Shot of Patron. Jack raises his brow. Ali drinks the shot, and without looking at him-- \nALI (CONT'D) Lookin' kinda lonely. \nJACK \n(BOOZEY) No. Not lonely. Liberated, yes. Libated, absolutely. But never lonely. Cheers, baby-- He raises his glass-- she rolls her eyes, walks off-- he follows her, playfully PUSHING her from behind. \nALI Hey-- what're we, in junior high? \nJACK You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon. Bring it on. She starts to say something as-- THE SHIRELLES start to sing \"BABY IT'S YOU\"-- Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers at him and YELLS: \nJACK (CONT'D) \nI LOVE THIS SONG, MAN!!! Everyone stares at the drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and walks off-- Jack swings her around, PULLING her close-- she just looks at him. Starts to laugh at how drunk he is-- Jack wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear. \nJACK (CONT'D) .Many many many nights go by, I sit alone, at home and cry, over you... \nALI Well, you're quite the crooner. He looks her in the eye. \nJACK I'm sorry for being a class A prick. Ali smiles, surprised at his candor. He breathes a sigh of relief. \nJACK (CONT'D) And as of about... (bleary look at his watch, \nCAN'T FOCUS) .some time ago, I am officially a single man. \nALI You and Natalie split up? \nJACK That we did. So. That explains what I'm doing here all alone. What are you doing here all alone? \nALI Do I look alone to you? They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She laughs. AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them. \nCOCO That DJ's hot. \nSEAN You think? \nCOCO He keeps looking at me. Coco smiles up at him, flirty. The DJ smiles back. \nCOCO (CONT'D) Hmmm...I think he's cuckoo for Coco- puffs. They look at each other, then crack up like giggling schoolgirls. \nEXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: A KEY TRYING TO GO INTO A LOCK. Then it disappears from view. We hear it CLANK to the ground. Then giggles. \nALI (O.C.) Whoopsie daisy -- PULL BACK to find Jack and Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on the ground. \nJACK Whoopsie daisy? \nALI My Nanna used to say that all the time. That and upsie jumpsie. \nJACK Upsie jumpsie? (running it together) Upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy, upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy, upsie jumpsie -- \n(ABRUPTLY STOPS) When would she say that? \nALI When she wanted her dog to get on the bed with her.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - LATE NIGHT \nSean's car whips into the parking lot. Ali jumps out and heads for the front entrance. The CONSTRUCTION WORKERS from the towering building across the street HOOT and CAT-CALL at her. She waves to them and nods: that's right, boys. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nAli enters just as Tess, in a spotlight on stage, turns toward the audience. She looks fabulous. Only someone who knows her really well could tell she's dying inside. \nTESS Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have... (motions to the girls) .the best view on the Sunset Strip. The audience hoots as the Burlesque Girls ENTER the stage dancing. (SONG TBD) ON ALI-- a lightbulb going on! As Tess exits the stage, Ali pushes through the crowd and races backstage. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nTess is arriving in her office, defeated, as Ali bursts in behind her. \nALI Tess! \nTESS You could knock-- this is still my office--at least for another 48 \nHOURS-- \nALI But this is really, really -- Tess holds up a hand. \nTESS Not. Now. \nALI \nBUT-- \nTESS I said -- NOT -- \nALI Yes now! God damn, you are one stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now, when I have something to tell you, you listen! I told you I could dance, did you listen? No. Big mistake. I told you I could sing, did you listen? No. Big. mistake. This time you are going to hear what I have to say if I have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in your God damn ear. For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a breath. \nALI (CONT'D) Have you ever heard of air rights? \nEXT.

Damnit, Nancy, get him back. Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns to Tess. \nBUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) Back with more noise complaints? \nTESS You offered to buy my club a few years back. I said no. \nBUSINESSMAN And now you've changed your mind. \nTESS Not exactly. Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and sits herself down. Ali does the same. \nBUSINESSMAN I'm confused. \nTESS Go with me, there's a good ending, I promise. How much will these condos you're building sell for? \nBUSINESSMAN They start at one million and go up, depending on the view. \nTESS What if I told you a twenty-story high-rise was going up where my club is? \n(TO ALI) Would twenty stories block his view? \nALI Ten stories would. Twenty would decimate them. Leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows. \nTESS So. Mr. ? \nBUSINESSMAN Anderson. \nTESS Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million- dollar ocean views are going away because I'm selling my building to a developer tomorrow who'll have his twenty stories all framed up by the time you start selling -- \nALI Trying to sell-- \nTESS Trying to sell these condos. \n(BEAT) Or. I can put you in a position where your buyers could be guaranteed their million-dollar views forever. \nBUSINESSMAN I'm listening. \nTESS As am I. As long as you're telling me you'll have a check to me by 5:00 today. \nINT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - EVENING \nThe BUMPER BAND PLAYS. Vince sits with his POSSE. His cocktail waitress/girlfriend approaches with an empty tray. She whispers to him: \nCOCKTAIL WAITRESS Sorry, baby, they cut you off at the bar. Said you have to pay cash. \nVINCE What? I co-own this goddamn place-- \n", "test3_true": "TESS Not anymore you don't. I'm buying you out. \nVINCE You can't do that. \nTESS Actually, according to page 4 of our contract, I can. \nVINCE \n(SCOFFING) In the next 48 hours? \nTESS Why postpone joy? She hands him a CASHIER'S CHECK. Vince stares at it. \nVINCE What the hell is this? \nTESS I realize it's been a while since you've seen one, but it's called a check. He stares at it, stunned.Then at her. \nVINCE Where'd you get this? \nTESS Not your business anymore. And neither is the lounge. \n(POINTS) I'm sure you know where the door is. It used to be half yours. (re. the waitress) And take HER with you. Tess turns and goes over to the bar, where Ali spins around on her barstool, having heard the whole thing. \nALI How'd that feel? \nTESS Not half bad. \nTess parks it next to her. Looks at Ali. Smiles, then breaks into a giggle. Ali smiles. Tess laughs even harder, tears in her eyes now. They are just two girls laughing hysterically at the bar, Tess keeps trying to say something, but can't get it out, until she looks Ali square in the eye... \nTESS (CONT'D) It felt pretty God damn awesome! And they crack up again. Then... \nALI And to think, you didn't even want me around. \nTESS Oh, Jesus, here it comes. \nALI .What was it you said to me that first night? \"Twenty bucks at the door will make all your dreams come true.\" That was sweet of you. \nTESS Are you finished? \nALI (loving needling her) Kinda ironic, when you think about it. I started off begging you to make my dreams come true, and here we are -- \nTESS All right already! You want me to say it, I'll say it. She looks at her. \nTESS (CONT'D) This place is the love of my life. The only dream I've ever had. I don't know what I would have done if I had lost it. \n(HEARTFELT NOW) Thank you. A moment between them... as Tess SPOTS NIKKI ENTER the club carrying her dance bag--a little fresher than we've seen her before, and sober. Nikki looks over at Tess... then approaches. Ali turns away on her bar stool, respectfully. \nNIKKI \n(SHEEPISH) I crossed the line. Tess crosses her arms, and with a smirk on her face-- \nTESS Again. \nNIKKI Again, and I wanna come home-- \nTESS \nAGAIN-- \nNIKKI Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or what...? \nTESS What do you think? Tess and Nikki share a look. \nTESS (CONT'D) Curtain's up in 20. Shake a leg. Nikki smiles, hikes her dance bag over her shoulder and heads \nBACKSTAGE-- Ali looks at Tess quizzically-- \nALI Just like that? \nTESS If I had a dollar for every time she's quit... \nALI Really? \nTESS We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate. And then make up. Just like sisters. \nALI I never had a sister. \nTESS Me neither. THANK GOD. \n(THEN) \n(MORE) \nTESS (CONT'D) Now get your cute little ass and big ole' voice up on stage, cause this is Burlesque, baby girl, where the women are always on top, and the men like it that way. Like I've always said -- \nALI/TESS You can't keep a good girl down. \nBACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM Ali walks into the dressing room. Sits down in front of her mirror. Across the room, Nikki is sitting at hers. Ali looks at Nikki in the reflection of her mirror. Their eyes meet. Then Nikki nods. And Ali nods back. For the first time, a mutual respect. All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room. Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs, fishnets, etc. Things back the way there were, and the way they'll always be. ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make- up brush Tess gave her. Dips it in water. Then applies a line on her eye expertly. She smiles to herself.

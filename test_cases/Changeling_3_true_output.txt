Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings, announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk. 
CHRISTINE Hey, sport. 
WALTER Hey, mom. 
CHRISTINE So how was school? 
WALTER Okay. We learned about dinosaurs, and I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski. 
CHRISTINE What happened? 
WALTER He hit me. 
CHRISTINE Did you hit him back? (he nods) Good. Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit you? 
WALTER Because I hit him. 
She stops, looks at him. 
CHRISTINE Wait...you hit him first? (he nods) Why? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    5. 
WALTER He said my dad ran off because he didn't like me. 
CHRISTINE Your dad never even had a chance to meet you...so how could he not like you? 
WALTER Then why did he leave? 
Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk. 
CHRISTINE Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. You know what was in that box? (he shakes head) Something called responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world. 
WALTER So he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box? 
CHRISTINE Yup. 
WALTER That's dumb. 
CHRISTINE That's what I thought. 
She turns and crouches down in front of him. 
CHRISTINE Walter, I decided a long time ago that I would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up. I can't expect you to respect me unless I respect you. (beat) I've never lied to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box. 
WALTER Pinky-swear? 
CHANGELING A True Story                                       6. 
CHRISTINE Pinky-swear. 
She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug.    He smiles. 
CHRISTINE First one to the corner store gets ice cream! 
He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him stay ahead of her the whole way. 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her. 
WALTER Did I miss Amos and Andy? 
CHRISTINE I'm afraid so, sport.   Come on now, time for bed. 
She picks him up and carries him up the stairs. 
WALTER Are we still going to the movies tomorrow? 
CHRISTINE Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman. 
WALTER Who's that? 
CHRISTINE I don't know. Nobody does. That's what makes him so mysterious. 
WALTER Oh.   Am I too heavy for you to carry? 
CHRISTINE Not for years yet, Walter.     Not for years. 
And she disappears upstairs. 
EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING 
Just enough to bring us into 
CHANGELING A True Story                                     7. 
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
She's getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room when the phone rings. She hesitates, then picks it up. 
SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 10, 1928 
CHRISTINE Hello? (beat) Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine, thanks. No, I was just -- (beat) You're kidding. When did she call in sick? (checks watch) What about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's just...I promised Walter I'd take him to the movies today. There has to be somebody else.... (beat) All right, I...guess we can do it tomorrow. I'll get there as soon as I can. But just until four, okay? See you in a bit.

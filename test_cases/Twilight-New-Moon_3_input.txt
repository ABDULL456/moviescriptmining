Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder. 
HARRY CLEARWATER We'll find her, Charlie. 
Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends. 
JACOB Charlie! 
Charlie spins to where Jacob points -- 
THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS 
SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella. 
BILLY It's Sam Uley. He found her. 
Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life. He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms. 
CHARLIE Thank you, Sam. Thank God. 
Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs away, avoiding any accolades. 
ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable, quickly looks away. 
ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house -- 
CHARLIE What were you thinking, Baby?   Why were you out there? 
BELLA He's... gone. 
Off her as Charlie carries her inside -- 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps her in blankets... A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA 
She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed. Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In various different arrangements. Meanwhile... 
A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed, higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness...

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her -- 
OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or- treating. DISSOLVE INTO... 
NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern... WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare... 
DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house... worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains unchanged... 
BELLA (V.O.) Dear Mom... I'm... (beat) ... lost... 
PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone are all traces of Edward... 
BELLA (V.O.) Edward took everything with him. Including my life. He promised it would be like he never existed... 
... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone. INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee. 
BELLA (V.O.) ... But I need to know he did. 
A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER: 
-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie watches her, concerned. 
BELLA (V.O.) It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest... 
-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor. 
BELLA (V.O.) But the pain is my only reminder that he was real... that they all were... 
-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

BELLA (V.O.) I miss them. Especially Alice...

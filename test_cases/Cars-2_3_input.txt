CARS 2

A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel room. 
LELAND TURBO This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn McMissile.

LELAND TURBO Finn. My cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped.

LELAND TURBO You won't believe what I've found out here. 
He angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which we can see flames rising in the distance. 
LELAND TURBO This is bigger than anything we've ever seen. And no one even knows it exists. Finn, I need backup. But don't call the cavalry - it could blow the operation. And be careful. It's not safe out here! 
ANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go. 
LELAND TURBO Transmitting my grids now. Good luck!

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC - NIGHT 
A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells. 
CRABBY Alright buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why? 
A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the 
shadows. Cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any intersection in the world. Meet FINN MCMISSILE. 
FINN I'm looking for a car. 
CRABBY A car? Hey pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here. 
FINN Exactly where I want to be. 
CRABBY Well I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us. 
Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight. 
COMBAT SHIP What are you doing out here? 
CRABBY What does it look like, genius? I'm crabbing! 
COMBAT SHIP Well turn around and go back where you came from. 
CRABBY Yeah? And who's gonna make me? 
A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes. 
CRABBY Alright, alright! Don't get your prop in a twist. (as he turns to leave) What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks like it's the end of the line. Buddy? 
ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone. CUT TO: 
FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine. 
We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn, the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK. 
THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force WHEN --- 
--- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP... 
From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear. 
EXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER 
Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about. 
FINN (INTO RADIO) Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile. I'm at the rally point. Over. 
No response. 
FINN (INTO RADIO) Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over. 
AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP. 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (in German and English) Too many cars here. Out of my way! 
FINN Professor Zundapp? 
PACER (O.S.) Here it is, Professor. 
Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE. 
NOSY PACER You wanted to see this before we load it? 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP Ah, yes. Very carefully... 
A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY. 
NOSY PACER Oh. A TV camera. What does it actually do? 
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP This camera is extremely dangerous.

It's like she is in a trance and can't wake up. \nJimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging. \nStill no movement. \nIt looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original position facing the TV. \nThen... no movement. \nStill no movement. \nThen Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor crying hysterically. \nJudy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard, and loud. \nJimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera. \nShe rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into the camera. She tries to collect herself. \nJUDY Why did you do that? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I had to. \nJUDY Why? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I did it for you. \nJUDY I don't understand. \nJudy tries hard to stop, but just sobs harder and louder than before. \nJUDY Please tell me. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I felt like if I didn't save you then no one else would. \nJUDY (screams) Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA! \nA muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs. \nJIMMY'S DAD (O.C.) Jimmy!

JIMMY'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY/ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into the party. \nA generic \"Happy Twentieth Anniversary\" sign hangs above the front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing. \nGifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner is yet to start. As Jimmy moves into the... \nENTRY-WAY \nPeople at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on their faces as Jimmy walks through. \nMore and more people react with gasps and revulsion at camera, but we can't tell why. Jimmy moves camera to the... \nLIVING ROOM \nThe place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize... \nJimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY SILVER. \nCamera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run from the room. \nOne of the Female Party Guests (#1) SCREAMS. \nFEMALE PARTY GUEST #1 (covers her mouth) Oh my God! \nJimmy keeps filming, catching people's reactions. \nHe points the camera at a Female Party Guest #2. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Hey, great party, huh? I'm making a tape for my parents. Want to say something to them? \n", "test1_true": "JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.) Jimmy! \nJimmy turns the camera at his mother who is completely shocked to see him like this. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You want to say anything to yourself? \nJIMMY'S DAD That's enough. \nJimmy's Dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over Jimmy's head, body and the camera. All we see is black and flashes of light from under the blanket. \nJIMMY'S DAD (O.C.) (muffled) Get out! Now! \nCamera's under the blanket as we hear Jimmy's Dad pushes him from the room. Camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nCamera is being removed from the camera bag. As the lens pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking, holding the camera. He's way too close to the lens. \nHe flips it around until it locks on DR. WALTERS, MFCC (40), Jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. Walters seems to have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office. Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first session together. \nDR. WALTERS Jimmy, we discussed this. You can't tape our sessions. It's not allowed. \nThe camera doesn't move. \nDR. WALTERS You know, you can't film someone who doesn't want their image and voice recorded. Technically, you're actually breaking the law. \nJimmy (O.C.) doesn't respond. \nDR. WALTERS Does your defiance make you feel more powerful? \nStill no answer. \nDR. WALTERS Filming people makes you feel like you're in control of the situation doesn't it? \nStill no answer. \nDR. WALTERS I can sit here as long as you can. You're not going to be able to force me to participate in your little game here. \nNo movement from the camera. \nDR. WALTERS Jimmy, this isn't something that friends do to each other is it? \nDr. Walters sits in front of the camera, trying to stay perfectly still and calm. \nDr. Walters is so nice and so calm, that we start to feel sorry for him. \nNo movement. \nNo movement. \nDr. Walters fidgets. \nThen holds still. \nThen fidgets, trying to stay calm. \nDR. WALTERS Jimmy, put the camera away, please. \nNo movement. \nDR. WALTERS You're wasting your time and mine, Jimmy. We could be doing something productive. \nThe camera shakes a bit.     Jimmy's laughing. \nDr. Walters is doing his best to stay calm. \nDR. WALTERS That's enough. \nNo movement. \nDR. WALTERS Put it away. \nNothing. \nDR. WALTERS Now Jimmy! \nDr. Walters gets up and comes towards the camera.   He grabs it just above the lens and tries to take it away. \nDR. WALTERS Come on Jimmy. \nA fierce battle of tug of war breaks out.      We see Dr. Walters becoming increasingly pissed off. \nThe back and forth is suddenly getting violent, until... \nDR. WALTERS Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera! \nDr. Walters finally gets the camera free from Jimmy.     Camera shuts off. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT.

She sees Jimmy come in with the camera and freaks out. \nJUDY No. No filming.     I'm leaving, I swear. \nJudy gets up to go. \nJIMMY Okay, okay. Wait. \nAs Jimmy gets up to stop her, camera shuts off. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJimmy is filming Judy, who is sitting on his bed. Her face is red, her eyes have watered up, and her nose is snotty and running from after an intense session of crying. Jimmy is catching her seconds after she's has finally composed herself. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Say what you said to me before. \nJUDY I don't know how I said it. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Paraphrase it then. \nJUDY Do what? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Say it like you did before but it doesn't have to be exactly the same. \nJUDY You mean paraphrase it. \nJIMMY (O.C.) That's what I said. \nJUDY I didn't hear you. \nJudy stares off camera. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Are you ready? \nJUDY I'm waiting for you. \nJIMMY (O.C.) OK. \nJUDY Tell me when. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Now. \nJUDY You want me to paraphrase it? \nJIMMY (O.C.) (impatient) Yes! \nJudy thinks for a beat. \nJUDY I can't remember what I said. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Then just ad-lib. \nJUDY Ad-lib? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Yes. \nJudy thinks for a beat. \nJUDY I don't know what that means. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (getting frustrated) It means make it up. \nJUDY (confused) Do you want me to make something up or paraphrase what I did the first time? \nThis isn't working.   The camera drops from Judy. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Let's take a break. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCamera's on a tripod. Jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his shoulder foregrounds Judy. \nJUDY I'm not good on camera.    It makes me nervous. \nJIMMY Forget about the camera.   Talk to me. \nJUDY OK. \nJIMMY Tell me what you said earlier. About me about how you felt when you saw the video. \nJUDY (relaxes) It felt like someone had been reading my mind. \nShe stops. \n", "test2_true": "JUDY It was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected. \nNow Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there. \nJIMMY And earlier, what you said about God. \nJimmy zooms in the camera by remote.    Judy's distracted. \nJIMMY (off her look) Tell me. \nJudy refocuses. \nJUDY I said that it felt like God had sent someone to protect me, and to look out for me. \nShe looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel. \nJUDY And I said that you are the only person in my life who has ever looked after me like that. \nJudy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow again. As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP, leaping from her chair. \nJUDY God, I hate it when you film me crying! \nJudy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy. \nJUDY (O.C.) How do you like it, huh? How do you like having a camera shoved right up your ass? \nCamera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out of focus, etc. \nJUDY (O.C.) Do you like it? Do you? \nJIMMY I don't like it or dislike.   I'm used to it. \nJudy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is millimeters away from his nose. We see an extreme close up of his nostrils. \nJIMMY Generally I'd place the camera further away from my nose, but if this is your preferred shooting style then I guess I'll have to adjust to it. \nJimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens. \nJIMMY How's this work for you? \nJudy pulls back and continues filming him. \nJUDY (O.C.) Give me a break. \nJIMMY OK. \nNow Judy's the interviewer.   Her framing is not quite as adept as Jimmy's. \nJUDY (O.C.) So... why do you have to film everything? \nJIMMY I don't film everything. \nJUDY (O.C.) Why do you like to film me crying? \nJIMMY I don't. \nJUDY (O.C.) Then why do you? \nJIMMY Because it's rare that I get to find someone that lets their emotions go. When a person is crying, I mean truly crying, or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping. For a few seconds or minutes I get a chance to see that person's soul. And really, now that you've forced me to think about it. I think it's a very rare and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity. \nJudy is shaken and speechless. \nJIMMY Anything else? \nJudy's moved and forgets herself.   Camera drops from Jimmy. \nJUDY (O.C.) Why me? \nJimmy helps her put the camera back up on him. \nJIMMY Because. \nJimmy sits still.    Judy doesn't know what to do with that. \nJIMMY Why do you think? \nJudy doesn't have an answer. \nJimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and turns the interview around. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Why you and why me? Why are we together right now? \nJudy doesn't know what to say. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Go ahead say it. I want you to.     I know what you're going to say so just say it. \nJUDY Stop. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (soft) Tell me. \nJudy fidgets. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (bullies her) Tell me! \n", "test2_id": 1921, "test3_input": "Judy pushes harder. \nJUDY (O.C.) Tell me. Look at the camera and tell me how it feels! \nJIMMY You're not getting it. It doesn't matter how it feels right now. (MORE) \nJIMMY (cont'd) What matters is that you're seeing what's inside of me and your taping it. Can you understand that? \nJudy doesn't know how to respond. \nJIMMY Can you? \nJUDY (O.C.) I don't know. \nJIMMY Well can you at least try? \nJimmy is still crying.   This weighs on her. \nJUDY (O.C.) Yes.    I can most definitely try. \nJIMMY And you can never, ever, ever ask me to not film you or anything we do. That's the only thing I'll ever ask of you. Agreed? \nJUDY (O.C.) Okay.   I'm sorry. \nJIMMY Will you swear to it?     On camera, will you swear to it? \nJimmy has talked himself into a good mood.       Before we hear Judy's response, we... \nJUMP CUT TO: \nI/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY \nMoments later, Jimmy is now taping Judy.

Please raise your right hand. \nJudy raises her right hand. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Please repeat after me.    I Judy... \nJUDY I Judy... \nJIMMY (O.C.) Do hereby solemnly swear... \nJUDY Do hereby solemnly swear... \nJIMMY (O.C.) That I will never ask, request, or even insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation. \nJUDY That I will never ask, request, or even insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation. \nJIMMY (O.C.) And furthermore, I do hereby solemnly swear to commit myself to giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and will continue to perform various sex acts with the skill and enthusiasm that he has become accustomed to. \nJudy laughs, then screams with embarrassed excitement.    Her laughter and happiness is infectious. \nShe pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again. \nWe can hear Jimmy laughing off camera as well. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Keep your right hand up. \nJudy lifts her right hand back up.   She looks at the camera with a huge smile. \nJUDY I do hereby solemnly swear to g... \nTHWACK! Someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of Jimmy's car. He pans and zooms the camera over and sees a car full of Three Teenagers laughing at them. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Mother fuckers. \nSuddenly the TEENAGE DRIVER of the car appears, as if out of nowhere, running to the passenger side. Jimmy zooms out. \nThe frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge LOOGIE into the car, hitting Judy right in the face. \nJudy screams. The car full of Three Teenagers laugh hysterically at her expense. \nJimmy hands Judy the camera. \nJIMMY Here, you're definitely going to want to tape this. \nJimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through the window. We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries not to cry softly off camera. \nJimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a baseball bat. \nWe see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid who spat in Judy's face. Then... \nWHAM! \nJimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with the bat. The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car. \nJimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins bashing in the windshield. \nJUDY (O.C.) (to herself) Oh my God. \nNow rage has taken over Jimmy over entirely.   He's bashing in the windshield with all of his might. \n", "test3_true": "JUDY (O.C.) (to herself) Oh, God Jimmy... \nJimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves to the front of the car. He now begins smashing the other windows. \nNow a sizeable crowd is formed. Jimmy is seemingly oblivious to them and continues bashing the car. \nJUDY (O.C.) (to herself) I love you Jimmy. \nNow it's to the point of overkill. But Jimmy won't stop. It's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his entire life is now coming to the surface. \nWe hear sirens in the distance as Jimmy continues to bash the car. The car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in the distance. \nJudy begins screaming. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy... oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it, fucking stop! \nJimmy doesn't. He pounds the car harder as a police cruiser pulls up. Two policemen get out of the car. They are temporarily paralyzed with indecision. \nWe see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy. He just ignores them. The policemen are oblivious to the fact they are being filmed. \nOne of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in Jimmy's face. \nNow Jimmy is completely freaking out. We hear him scream, but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. One of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards them. He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now completely blinded. A huge crowd has now amassed outside of the grocery store. \nJUDY (O.C.) Oh, God Jimmy, oh God... \nNow the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. Lights are flashing all around Jimmy. He is surrounded but sill continues to swing the bat. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy... \nThree cops tackle Jimmy from behind. Judy throws down the camera and runs out the door. The camera is face down on the seat. \nWe hear Judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. The sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming. \nWe hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are pulling up. More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard. We hear police chatter: \nPOLICE CHATTER (O.C.) (over the police radios) We're going to need an ambulance stat at the parking lot of the grocery store on Route 18... \nMore screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the car. We don't know who it is. They turn off the camera. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. SANITARIUM PARKING LOT/JUDY'S CAR - DAY \nJudy is filming. She sits behind the wheel pointing the camera at the front door of a HIDDEN VALLEY Mental Hospital. She zooms in on a sign. \nJudy flips the camera around to herself. \nJUDY Hi baby. I miss you. (blowing a kiss) Mwaa! I'll be waiting for you when you get out. Be good and don't wait too long. Look what I did for you! \nJudy opens her mouth wide.   She's got a tongue stud on her tongue. \nJUDY I can't wait to use it on you! \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT DRIVE THRU/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY \nJimmy's pulled forward to the drive thru while Judy tapes from passenger seat. A voice squawks at Jimmy, asking for his order. \nJIMMY Can I get a double cheese burger, no pickles, large fries and a coke? \nJimmy looks at the camera. \nJIMMY That's what I fucking missed more than anything. Fast food. \nHe turns back to order more. \nJIMMY And a number two. \nThe Drive Thru window voice rattles off a price and tells him to pull up. Jimmy continues to camera. \nJUDY (O.C.) What did you do in there all day? \nJIMMY Masturbated mostly. \nJUDY (O.C.) (jokingly) You cheated on me! I want to be the only person responsible for making you cum. \nJIMMY I hope you're willing to be on call twenty four hours a day. \nJUDY (O.C.) Seriously, what did you do? What was a day in the life of Jimmy in the nut house? \nJIMMY Well, besides masturbating, I talked and talked and talked and fucking talked until they were satisfied. But basically I told them what they wanted to hear. I said shit like... \nJimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech. \nJIMMY \"Now that I'm finally able to talk about my problems, I now realize that my behavior was inappropriate and harmful to others.\" \nJudy laughs. \nJIMMY Then I figured it out. I had to cry as much as possible. Whenever someone would cry they'd call it a \"break through.\" So I'd be like. \n", "test3_id": 1922}

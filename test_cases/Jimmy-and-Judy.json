{"train": "JIMMY AND JUDY \nWritten by \nRandall K. Rubin & Jon Schroder \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. BACKYARD - SUBURBAN HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPOV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of teenage girl's bedroom. \nThe door inside opens. In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties. As she heads to the mirror we hear... \nSound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing. Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE GOPHER. \nJudy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious. \nThe camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he... \nCAMERA OPERATOR (O.C.) Oh, mmph. \nHe's climaxed. \nThe sounds have stopped, but the tape keeps rolling.    Judy stops combing her hair as... \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY \nCamera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight. \nShe's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids pass her. \nSuddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face. \nWe can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated, Judy holds back tears as... \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK \nLate summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a bit awkward, but not at all unappealing. \nHe throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing it at the back of his house. \nThrough the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone, preparing dinner. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing the nasty last night. Thanks for that one. By the way, who the fuck is Nancy? \nCamera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube, munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling her friends that you're hung like a light switch. \nDad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch. Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes the reach and... yes! Both balls at the same time! One heck of a double play! \nEyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and sniffs them. \nJIMMY (O.C.) And the sniff to finish it off. \nSatisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad, each through different windows. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Fucking freak show. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote. It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute. \nAs he pounds into her... \nJIMMY Do you like that nigger?   Come on nigger, do you like it? \nPROSTITUTE (humors him) Oh yeah baby, I like it. \nBy remote, Jimmy shuts down the camera. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy's behind   the camera interviewing the Prostitute who sits up in his   bed holding the sheets to cover herself. With the lights on,   we can see that she's clearly unattractive. Jimmy asks his   questions with a gentle confidence. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Okay, so. What was going through your mind when I called you a nigger? \nPROSTITUTE This costs you an extra fifty. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. JUDY'S HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror. She stops when she hears... \nA Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom. This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues combing her hair as though he's not even there. \nHe comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her, giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right. The masturbation sounds STOP. \nJudy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom light. The room goes dark. \nCamera flips down, then OFF... \nThen COMES BACK ON AGAIN \nOnce again we're looking through the camera pointing at the window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white of \"Nite Shot\" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found. \nWhatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame, away from the view of the window. Camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy films once again, hidden camera style, long lens from far away. Frame is close on Judy sitting at the dining room table. \nAs camera pulls back, we HEAR but don't see Judy's Parents talking to Jimmy's Mom and Dad at the table. Judy is bored, completely uninterested in their conversation. \nJIMMY'S MOM (O.C.) So Melissa talked Gary into the SL instead of the seven series. I couldn't believe it. \nJudy looks over at camera, catching the fact that she's being videotaped. Jimmy keeps filming. \nJIMMY'S DAD (O.C.) They paid way too much. \nAs Jimmy zooms in, she clandestinely flips off the camera. \nJUDY'S DAD I strictly buy American anyway. \nJudy gets up.   Her mom stops her. \nJUDY'S MOM (O.C.) Where you going honey? \nJUDY Bathroom. \nAs Judy leaves the table she walks towards camera as it shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJudy sits on Jimmy's bed, staring into the camera.   She's uncomfortable sitting there. It's poorly framed. \nJUDY Can we start already? \nJIMMY (O.C.) One second. \nCamera shuts off. \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJimmy films Judy again, better framing this time.      Judy looks annoyed and uncomfortable in front of the camera. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Who do you hate most in the world and why? \nJUDY (kind of bitchy) Why? Who cares? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I do. \nJUDY God, I just wanted to come up here to say \"hi\" and get away from my parents' bullshit for like two seconds and you have to put the stupid camera in my face. \nJimmy takes delight in Judy's displeasure of being filmed. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Now we're onto something. \nJudy wants to go and then doesn't. \nJUDY You're weird Jimmy. You were weird when we were kids and now you're just getting weirder. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Is that why you had a crush on me? \nJUDY (scoffs) Yeah right. \nJIMMY (O.C.) You didn't have a crush on me? \nJudy fidgets, he's got her. \nJUDY You're a loser. You're twenty one and you're still living with your parents. \nShe's waiting for a response.    Jimmy doesn't bite. \nJUDY I heard that you got kicked out of college because you tried to talk your roommate into killing himself. \nNo movement. \nNo movement. \nNo movement. \nShe begins to breath heavily. \nThen no movement. \nShe leans her head down towards the floor. \nThen no movement. \nStill no movement or any reaction for that matter.   It's like she is in a trance and can't wake up. \nJimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging. \nStill no movement. \nIt looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original position facing the TV. \nThen... no movement. \nStill no movement. \nThen Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor crying hysterically. \nJudy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard, and loud. \nJimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera. \nShe rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into the camera. She tries to collect herself. \nJUDY Why did you do that? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I had to. \nJUDY Why? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I did it for you. \nJUDY I don't understand. \nJudy tries hard to stop, but just sobs harder and louder than before. \nJUDY Please tell me. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I felt like if I didn't save you then no one else would. \nJUDY (screams) Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA! \nA muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs. \nJIMMY'S DAD (O.C.) Jimmy! What the hell are you guys doing up there? \nJudy stops, realizing suddenly that she's been screaming. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY/ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into the party. \nA generic \"Happy Twentieth Anniversary\" sign hangs above the front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing. \nGifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner is yet to start. As Jimmy moves into the... \nENTRY-WAY \nPeople at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on their faces as Jimmy walks through. \nMore and more people react with gasps and revulsion at camera, but we can't tell why. Jimmy moves camera to the... \nLIVING ROOM \nThe place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize... \nJimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY SILVER. \nCamera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run from the room. \nOne of the Female Party Guests (#1) SCREAMS. \nFEMALE PARTY GUEST #1 (covers her mouth) Oh my God! \nJimmy keeps filming, catching people's reactions. \nHe points the camera at a Female Party Guest #2. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Hey, great party, huh? I'm making a tape for my parents. Want to say something to them? \nJimmy's behind the camera, moving quickly down the hall to... \nJIMMY'S BEDROOM \nJudy is sitting on his bed.   She sees Jimmy come in with the camera and freaks out. \nJUDY No. No filming.     I'm leaving, I swear. \nJudy gets up to go. \nJIMMY Okay, okay. Wait. \nAs Jimmy gets up to stop her, camera shuts off. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nJimmy is filming Judy, who is sitting on his bed. Her face is red, her eyes have watered up, and her nose is snotty and running from after an intense session of crying. Jimmy is catching her seconds after she's has finally composed herself. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Say what you said to me before. \nJUDY I don't know how I said it. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Paraphrase it then. \nJUDY Do what? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Say it like you did before but it doesn't have to be exactly the same. \nJUDY You mean paraphrase it. \nJIMMY (O.C.) That's what I said. \nJUDY I didn't hear you. \nJudy stares off camera. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Are you ready? \nJUDY I'm waiting for you. \nJIMMY (O.C.) OK. \nJUDY Tell me when. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Now. \nJUDY You want me to paraphrase it? \nJIMMY (O.C.) (impatient) Yes! \nJudy thinks for a beat. \nJUDY I can't remember what I said. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Then just ad-lib. \nJUDY Ad-lib? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Yes. \nJudy thinks for a beat. \nJUDY I don't know what that means. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (getting frustrated) It means make it up. \nJUDY (confused) Do you want me to make something up or paraphrase what I did the first time? \nThis isn't working.   The camera drops from Judy. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Let's take a break. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCamera's on a tripod. Jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his shoulder foregrounds Judy. \nJUDY I'm not good on camera.    It makes me nervous. \nJIMMY Forget about the camera.   Talk to me. \nJUDY OK. \nJIMMY Tell me what you said earlier. About me about how you felt when you saw the video. \nJUDY (relaxes) It felt like someone had been reading my mind. \nShe stops. \nJudy fidgets again, then... \nJUDY (blows her top) Because we're both fucking weird! \nJudy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her feel like she has to give him more. \nJUDY Because we're the two weirdest kids in the world. And God made us for each other and I fucking love you, and you did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything that doesn't get it! \nJudy's out of breath.    Camera still points at her. \nJUDY That's right, right? \nJudy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from Jimmy. She told him she loved him. Camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY \nJimmy is driving in his car with Judy in the passenger seat. Judy has the camera and she is interviewing Jimmy as he drives. \nJUDY (O.C.) Where are you taking me? \nJIMMY To a beautiful place. \nJUDY (O.C.) Where? \nJIMMY Chuck E. Cheese. \nJudy and Jimmy laugh together. \nJUDY (O.C.) No seriously. \nJIMMY I can't tell you.    It'll ruin it. \nJUDY (O.C.) Fine. \nJudy sulks for a second. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy, can I ask you something? \nJIMMY Anything. \nJUDY (O.C.) Do you hate your parents? \nJIMMY Yes, but I understand them. \nJUDY (O.C.) What's to understand? \nJIMMY Lots of things. \nJUDY (O.C.) Like what? \nJIMMY I understand that my ascension into young adulthood triggered their descent into mid-life crisis. Generally when an only child leaves the nest, the parents begin reassessing their own lives. They see us as a younger, better version of themselves. (MORE) \nJIMMY (cont'd) They feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval. They used to take us to baseball games and cover our scrapes with bandages, but once we no longer need Mom to nurture our bruises or Dad to be our hero it puts their roles and subsequent sense of self worth into question. \nJUDY (O.C.) How do you know all these things? \nJIMMY When you don't have any friends, don't play sports, don't go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have to figure things out by yourself. And without any of those things I have nothing but time to think about stuff. \nJUDY (O.C.) You are SO smart. \nJIMMY You are so beautiful. \nLong pause.   Judy doesn't know how to react. \nJUDY (O.C.) You think I'm pretty? \nJIMMY I think you're the most beautiful person I have ever met. The most beautiful person in the universe. \nJUDY (O.C.) No one has ever told me that. \nJIMMY Get used to hearing it. \nJUDY (O.C.) Do you think I'm smart? \nJIMMY Yes. \nJUDY (O.C.) Do you think I'm fat? \nJIMMY Yes. \nJUDY (O.C.) How could you say that? I only way a hundred and ten pounds. \nJIMMY Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said flat. As in flat chested. \nJUDY (O.C.) I am not FLAT! \nJudy smacks him. \nJIMMY Prove it. \nJUDY (O.C.) I don't have to prove it.   Here look. \nJudy's devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of way. \nJUDY (whispers) I wanna see your smiley face again. \nWe see and hear Judy whispering, her lips placed gently on the inside of Jimmy's ear. \nJUDY (whispering) Turn the camera off. Turn the camera off. Turn it off. \nCamera goes off. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY \nJudy films Jimmy driving the car.   He has a huge shit eating grin on his face. \nJUDY (O.C.) How do you feel? \nJIMMY Relaxed, happy, confident, studly, excited, relieved, delighted... I love you Judy. \nJUDY (O.C.) You do? \nJIMMY Very much so. I always have. \nJUDY (O.C.) Me too. \nLong pause filled with sexual tension takes over. \nJUDY (O.C.) Do you want to pull over again? \nJimmy smiles.   Of course he does.   Camera goes off. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. BEAUTIFUL FARM - SHOTGUN SCENE - DAY \nJudy films Jimmy as he FIRES a twelve gage pump action shot gun off into the distance. After each shot he pumps then FIRES again. \nJIMMY Are you getting this? \nNo response. \nJimmy FIRES another shot. His muscles are flexing as he pumps the gage. He looks extremely violent and determined. \nJIMMY Come on.   Are you getting this? \nA very turned off Judy replies. \nJUDY (O.C.) This is where you wanted to take me? \nJIMMY Yeah, what's the matter? \nWe can hear Judy crying.   The camera shakes out of control. \nJUDY (O.C.) I wanna go home. \nJimmy looks over towards the camera/Judy. He knows that he's fucked up and he feels like complete shit. \nJimmy walks over to her, takes the camera and shuts it off. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy is standing in front of a mirror and is videotaping his own reflection. \nHe is talking to himself and into the camera. \nJIMMY Don't fuck this up.    Please don't fuck this up. \nNow he is pleading with himself. \nJIMMY Just try to be normal. (screaming) Just be normal! God damn it why do you have to fuck everything up? \nHe hasn't convinced himself. \nJIMMY Be normal.     Be normal.   Be normal! \nJimmy takes a breath, then shuts the camera down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy films Judy who lies next to him in the bed. Her face is sweaty and red and he is still a tad out of breath. Jimmy is capturing her literally seconds after they had sex. \nShe's somewhat bewildered, then she notices the camera. She's starting to get used to it. \nJUDY (big smile) Hi. \nJIMMY (O.C.) So how do you feel now, right at this moment? \nJudy just sighs, basking in the afterglow. \nJimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble some sort of undergarment. \nJimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame. \nAfter a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking. He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on. \nWhen he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of the hose over his hands and fingertips. \nHe seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the room for a few seconds. \nNow Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on, with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest, hairiest, Cher look-a-like. \nSomeone else enters the room. \nJIMMY'S DAD Hi sweety. \nHoly shit. It's Jimmy's Mom, and she's wearing a leather dominatrix outfit! \nJIMMY'S MOM Are you ready for me, you fucking slut? \nJIMMY'S DAD Not quite. \nJIMMY'S MOM I don't feel like waiting. Hurry up bitch. What do you have left to do? \nJIMMY'S DAD I just need to put on my makeup. \nAs Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a little makeup bag. \nJimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's hat, carrying a riding switch. \nJIMMY'S MOM Come on slut. \nJimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if they've gone through this routine a thousand times. \nJimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's Dad on his ass with the switch. \nHe lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the air until she stops. \nJimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while he waits for her return. \nShe comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an enormous strap on dildo. \nDisappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed. \nFrom behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as she rips his fishnets off screen. \nThere's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up. Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind. \nJimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder. \nCamera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening. Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on. \nJIMMY Hi mom.     Hi dad.   What are you guys up to? \nJimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined dress and wig. \nJIMMY'S DAD What the fuck are you doing here? \nJimmy's Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmy's Dad. \nJIMMY'S MOM (to his dad) I told you he would find out you fucking freak! No wonder he's a fucking psycho. Look a his father. \nJimmy's Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his wig. \nJIMMY'S DAD Turn off the that fucking camera! Turn off that fucking camera right fucking now god damn it! \nJimmy is loving it. \nJIMMY Gee dad, what do you say the two of us go out to the front yard and throw some ball together? We'll have a nice friendly game of catch. \nJimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy. \nJIMMY'S DAD You little mother fucker.     Turn off that fucking camera! \nJimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating Jimmy's Dad with it. \nJudging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest and heaviest of materials. \nJIMMY'S MOM Stop it!     You're going to kill him. \nJimmy's Dad lets go.    The dildo's doing the trick. \nJIMMY'S DAD Bitch! \nJimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even though he's let go. \nJIMMY'S MOM Fuck you! You think you know me? You don't know me! You piece of shit! \nJIMMY (laughing) Mom! \nJimmy's Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy. She screams at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the camera. \nJIMMY'S MOM You little beast! You want to film something? Film this! \nJIMMY I'm thinking. \nJUDY (O.C.) Just let it go, be free. \nJIMMY (adoringly) You're such a hippie all of sudden. \nJUDY (O.C.) Come on. \nJIMMY No. \nJudy's not getting what she wants from him.   Camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. FOREST/MEADOW - RUNNING NAKED - DAY \nJudy films Jimmy. The camera is close and intimate as they lie on their sides staring into each other's eyes. Judy is still naked, but is being shot in an extreme close up. \nJUDY (O.C.) Okay, go. \nJimmy's still not up for it.   Judy grabs the camera and turns it on him. \nJUDY (O.C.) Come on! \nJimmy's turns the tables. \nJIMMY Okay, you really wanna hear something? \nJUDY (O.C.) Yeah. \nJimmy takes a deep breath, a touch of intensity flashes in his eye, then... \nJIMMY I want to go one day without masturbating. I want to liberate my penis. I want to clone you so we could have a three way and neither of us would be cheating. I want you to scrape my balls with a cheese grater... \nJudy starts laughing.   The camera's shaking. \nJUDY (O.C.) That's gross! \nJimmy suddenly gets serious. \nJIMMY And I love you. I love you so much it hurts. \nJUDY (O.C.) It hurts? \nJIMMY Like God is stabbing me in heart with a thousand knives at the same time and you're the only one who can make the pain go away. Do you love me that much? \nJUDY (O.C.) I love you so much, I'd rather die than be without you. \nJIMMY Here. \nJimmy grabs the camera and points it at Judy. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Make me a promise... the way a husband and wife make a promise... that we will be together always and forever. \nJUDY You mean get married? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Something more powerful than marriage. It's a bond. It's our bond. It's transcendental. \nJUDY What? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Transcendental. (grabs the camera) Here. \nJimmy hands Judy the camera as she starts to frame him up, but they're really engaging each other's eyes over the top of the eyepiece. \nJIMMY It's transcendental because it transcends everything. Life, love, law, people, things... A bond so strong that our souls will become one and it can never end, even in death. If you swear on the bond, it means you'd rather die than break your promise. \nJudy is moved. \nJUDY (O.C.) That's so beautiful. \nJIMMY You're so beautiful.    I want to love you forever. \nJUDY (O.C.) Swear on the bond. Swear we'll be together forever, that you'd rather die than be apart. \nJIMMY I swear on the bond. \nJUDY (O.C.) And we'll never let anything come between us, not even death. \nJIMMY Not even death. I swear. Nothing will come between us, ever. \nJimmy stares at her, then slowly leans in for a kiss... a long, wet, toe curling kiss. Jimmy finds a way to point the camera at the kiss. \nThey break apart. Judy sighs, staring into Jimmy's eyes, then leans into him, his lips touching her forehead, their eyes closing as they feel the energy of true love. \nJUDY We'll be together forever. \nJIMMY (whispers) Together forever. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY \nJudy pushes harder. \nJUDY (O.C.) Tell me. Look at the camera and tell me how it feels! \nJIMMY You're not getting it. It doesn't matter how it feels right now. (MORE) \nJIMMY (cont'd) What matters is that you're seeing what's inside of me and your taping it. Can you understand that? \nJudy doesn't know how to respond. \nJIMMY Can you? \nJUDY (O.C.) I don't know. \nJIMMY Well can you at least try? \nJimmy is still crying.   This weighs on her. \nJUDY (O.C.) Yes.    I can most definitely try. \nJIMMY And you can never, ever, ever ask me to not film you or anything we do. That's the only thing I'll ever ask of you. Agreed? \nJUDY (O.C.) Okay.   I'm sorry. \nJIMMY Will you swear to it?     On camera, will you swear to it? \nJimmy has talked himself into a good mood.       Before we hear Judy's response, we... \nJUMP CUT TO: \nI/E. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY \nMoments later, Jimmy is now taping Judy. She has her right hand up, like a witness about to be sworn into the stand. She's all smiles as Jimmy gives her the oath to repeat back to him. \nJAMES (O.C.) Please raise your right hand. \nJudy raises her right hand. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Please repeat after me.    I Judy... \nJUDY I Judy... \nJIMMY (O.C.) Do hereby solemnly swear... \nJUDY Do hereby solemnly swear... \nJIMMY (O.C.) That I will never ask, request, or even insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation. \nJUDY That I will never ask, request, or even insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation. \nJIMMY (O.C.) And furthermore, I do hereby solemnly swear to commit myself to giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and will continue to perform various sex acts with the skill and enthusiasm that he has become accustomed to. \nJudy laughs, then screams with embarrassed excitement.    Her laughter and happiness is infectious. \nShe pounds her fists on the dashboard and laughs again. \nWe can hear Jimmy laughing off camera as well. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Keep your right hand up. \nJudy lifts her right hand back up.   She looks at the camera with a huge smile. \nJUDY I do hereby solemnly swear to g... \nTHWACK! Someone has thrown a full soda can on the hood of Jimmy's car. He pans and zooms the camera over and sees a car full of Three Teenagers laughing at them. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Mother fuckers. \nSuddenly the TEENAGE DRIVER of the car appears, as if out of nowhere, running to the passenger side. Jimmy zooms out. \nThe frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge LOOGIE into the car, hitting Judy right in the face. \nJudy screams. The car full of Three Teenagers laugh hysterically at her expense. \nJimmy hands Judy the camera. \nJIMMY Here, you're definitely going to want to tape this. \nJimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through the window. We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries not to cry softly off camera. \nJimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a baseball bat. \nWe see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid who spat in Judy's face. Then... \nWHAM! \nJimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with the bat. The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car. \nJimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins bashing in the windshield. \nJUDY (O.C.) (to herself) Oh my God. \nNow rage has taken over Jimmy over entirely.   He's bashing in the windshield with all of his might. \nJimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy.   He looks directly into the lens. \nJIMMY You start out slow, then you build it up like this... \"Now I know that using violence is not the answer.\" \nJimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top with his self impersonation. \nJIMMY Then you go like this: (snaps back into the impersonation) I was wrong, I know I was wrong and I'll never do it again. I don't want to hurt people or myself. \nJimmy does an obnoxious fake cry. \nJIMMY Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo, waaaaaaa. (snaps out of it) Then you always give them the obligatory hug at the end. After a couple of weeks, then they officially diagnose you with something, give you a prescription, then you're done. \nJUDY (O.C.) God, you're a genius. \nJimmy pulls up to the drive through window and pays the Cashier who hands him the a paper bag of food. \nJimmy pulls away and parks. Judy continues to question him as he goes through his bag of food. \nJUDY (O.C.) So what did they say you have? \nJimmy munches on some fries. \nJIMMY ODD. Oppositional Defiance Disorder. \nJUDY (O.C.) You're so lucky. I wish I was diagnosed with something. What does it mean? \nJimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50's industrial spoof style. \nJIMMY ODD is a disorder characterized by an overwhelming pattern of negative, hostile, and defiant behavior which causes severe delusions where the patient can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality. \nJUDY (O.C.) Wow.   I love that! \nJimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag. He then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got his order correct. They didn't. \nJimmy playfully begins to act crazy. \nJIMMY You see. They fucked up my order. I specifically asked for no pickles. \nJUDY (O.C.) (playing along) Oh, no! How will ODD Boy handle this? Will his ODD brain be able to withstand a pickle screw up at the drive thru? \nJimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character. \nHe begins by taking the pickles off of his burger. He puts the burger down, quickly lifts his shirt, holding it up with his chin while he places two pickles over top of his nipples. \nJimmy yells. \nJIMMY Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt my nipples with the pickles. \nJudy cracks up laughing. Jimmy takes a pickle off of his left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens. \nHe then feeds it to Judy. We hear Judy chomping on the pickle and giggling off camera. The camera shakes then shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. GHETTO/JUDY'S CAR - NIGHT \nJudy is driving through the ghetto as Jimmy shoots out of the window. On the sidewalk, he catches glimpses Drug Dealers, a Crack Whore, a Drunk stumbling along, and Other Pretty Sketchy Characters. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I love the ghetto. I don't know what it is about it. I fucking love it. It's always the first place I go to when I get out. \nJUDY I love it when you're out of the looney bin. Do you think you might be able to try to avoid the place for a while? \nJIMMY (O.C.) (joking) If they don't send me to the bin, maybe they'll send me to jail. \nThis upsets Judy. \nJUDY I'm serious. You act like it's no big deal when you go away! \nJIMMY (O.C.) (tired of it) All right. \nJUDY No it's not all right! When you're in there I have to be out in the real world alone, by myself Jimmy. You go away and come back like it's no big deal. Well it is a big deal. I don't want to spend another day without you. Do you understand me? I'd rather die. \nJudy's holding back tears. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I'm not going back. \nShe doesn't believe him. She's really starting to cry despite herself. He pulls his eye from the lens to look at her. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy. \nJudy looks over at him. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I promise. I swear on my life and I swear on our bond, I'll never go back. \nHer freak out subsides. \nJUDY If you swear on our bond, then I believe you. \nJudy lets out half cry and half yelp.   Her emotions are a bit out of control. \nJUDY I love you so fucking much. \nJIMMY    (O.C.) I love you too. \nWe hear Jimmy struggling. \nThe camera is still on the floor of the car. \nMore struggling as Jimmy is clearly outside putting the body into the trunk. \nJUDY (O.C.) (to self) I want to go home. \nWe hear Jimmy slam the trunk. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (screams; frustrated) Fuck! \nWe hear Jimmy come around to the driver's seat and open the door. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy, I... \nJIMMY (O.C.) I'm driving. \nWe hear Judy get out of the car and walk around to the passenger side and open the door, but she doesn't get in. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Get in. \nJudy doesn't respond. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Are you gonna fucking get in! \nJudy is hysterical. \nJUDY (O.C.) We should just leave him here. \nJIMMY (O.C.) We can't leave him in the middle of the fucking ghetto. Get in before someone sees us! \nJudy's losing it. \nJUDY (O.C.) I don't want him in my fucking car! I want him out! \nBefore Jimmy can respond, we see the reflection of police lights. Red and blue lights flicker against the lens. \nJUDY (O.C.) Oh shit! \nWe hear Judy get in the car and close the door. \nJUDY (O.C.) It's the fucking cops. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Just shut up. \nShe's hysterical. \nJUDY (O.C.) It's the cops. It's the cops. It's the... \nJIMMY (O.C.) Shhhhhh! \nJimmy kicks the camera. We still can't see any of this.     We can only hear what's happening. \nJIMMY (O.C.) You gotta play it cool, okay? \nJudy's crying gets louder. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Stop fucking crying. Please, I'm begging you. Stop it. \nWe hear the cop open and shut his patrol car door. \nJUDY (O.C.) Oh God. He's getting out of the car. We've got a dead homeless guy in our trunk and he's... \nJIMMY (O.C.) SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! \nJUDY (O.C.) Oh, my god Jimmy, he's walking towards us. \nJIMMY (O.C.) SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool. \nThe Cop is close, we can feel his footsteps coming towards the car. Judy collects herself as best as she can. \nThe cop taps his flashlight against the window. \nWe hear Judy roll down her power window and we hear the voice of the Cop. \nCOP (O.C.) Good evening. License and registration please. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Certainly, sir. \nThe light from the Cop's flashlight reflects off the floor of the car and into the lens of the camera. \nThe reflections stop.   The wait is unbearable. \nCOP (O.C.) Could you please step out of the vehicle? \nJimmy gets out of the car as Judy trembles in the passengers seat. \nWe only hear the sounds of Judy sniffling and repressing herself from crying and idle chatter of the Cop's radio. \nIt seems like forever, then... \nTHUMP! \nWe see and hear a huge roaring fire. Jimmy has zoomed the lens in so close that we can't tell what it is that's burning. \nAs he pulls out, it's revealed that the dead homeless guy is roasting in the fire. \nJUDY (O.C.) (coughing) Oh, my god. The hair burning is making me nauseous. \nJudy coughs more violently before. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies fucking stinks. That bum's body odor is being cooked right off him. \nJimmy pokes the flaming skull with his stick. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy! \nJimmy pokes some more at the body, then flips the camera up at Judy. \nJUDY What?    I'm not in the mood. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (making light) Don't have to be in the mood. Doesn't matter. The camera's on, it's on. (changes the subject) You wanna know where we're gonna go? \nJUDY Okay, where are we gonna go? \nJIMMY (O.C.) We're going to Lincoln to visit Dinko. \nJUDY Who's Dinko, Jimmy? \nJIMMY (O.C.) He's cool. And he's got his own place, and he said I could stay there whenever ever I wanted. Plus he knows about you and he wants to meet you. And he doesn't like cops, so he's not gonna call 'em. Okay? Now gimme a smile. \nJUDY No. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Gimme a smile, and I'll let you see my smiley face again. \nJudy begins coughing. \nJUDY I can't get sexy with that smell. I just can't. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. DINKO'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nMusic is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as Judy dances with DINKO (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit. \nEmpty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to a ridiculously low ceiling. \nJudy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is dancing like a complete dork. Dinko has no moves, rhythm, or beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on crack. \nJimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front of him. Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to be heard. He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmy's turned on the camera. \nDINKO Hey! The video-man. I remember that shit when we was in together. Said you video-ed everything. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Yep. \nDINKO Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay here for a while, but I have a small business to run man. There's going to be some people knocking on the door and shit. I can't have you guys answering the door or the phone. That's the only rule. Other than that man, we're going to getting fucked up together all the time. I got a shit load of crank dude, that shit is off the fucking hook. Here, take a hit. \nDinko tries to hand off some crank to Jimmy. \nJIMMY (O.C.) No thanks, I just want to film Judy dancing. \nJimmy pans the camera over towards Judy.    She's doing her best sexy dance into the camera. \nWe can still hear Dinko talking to Jimmy. \nDINKO (O.C.) Right man. That's cool. Hey um... If I tell you to stop taping though, man, you gotta stop. I got some hard core junkies coming over here. Sometimes, if they see shit like that, they fucking flip. Crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man. They're fucking hard core mother fuckers. You don't know what they're gonna fucking do. This one guy got paranoid about something. He used to climb on his roof to take a dump. That's the only place he would shit! How fucked up is that? \nDinko laughs at his own joke. \nJUDY You're not even paying attention to me Jimmy. \nJudy takes her dancing up a notch to get Jimmy's attention. \nJUDY Don't I look sexy? \nJimmy doesn't get a chance to respond. \nDINKO (O.C.) Yeah, you look real sexy baby. Real nice. \nDinko starts in with Jimmy again. \nDINKO (O.C.) Hey, I may have some work for you if you're cool with that. \nJimmy turns the camera back to Dinko while he goes to the kitchen to get a beer. \nJIMMY (O.C.) What kind of work? \nDINKO You know some hustling, some good money. I'll teach you how to mix the shit. Your girlfriend too if she wants. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (sarcasm) Yeah. That's what I've always wanted to do. Learn to make and sell crystal methamphetamine. You're a fucking genius Dinko. \nDinko is too stupid to recognize sarcasm. \nDINKO (big smile) Yeah, man! Fuckin' high five. \nDINKO You're into chicks aren't you Hazel? \nHAZEL Um, I really just want to get some stuff and get out of here. \nHazel is trembling.    The party atmosphere has come to a complete halt. \nDINKO Shut up you fat fucking junkie and take your clothes off or you ain't getting shit. \nHazel's not moving.    She's reluctant. \nDINKO Come on! \nHAZEL I don't... \nDinko smacks her square in the face. \nDINKO (screaming) Just do it, you fucking whore! \nHazel starts to take her clothes off reluctantly. \nJUDY Jimmy. \nJimmy doesn't do anything.     He just keeps filming. \nJUDY Jimmy, stop him! \nJIMMY (O.C.) He's a big boy, he can do what he wants. \nThis gives Dinko an added boost of confidence. Hazel is now in her bra and panties and is standing in front of them. \nDINKO Ever made a porno? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Not with you. \nDINKO Well all right! Keep filming mother fucker, I'm gonna fuck this junkie for you. You guys are free to join in whenever you like. \nJudy is now borderline hysterical. \nJUDY I swear to God Jimmy if you let him go through with this I'll never talk to you again! \nJimmy ignores her. \nDINKO You ready?     You filming? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I'm filming. Are you going to fuck her or are you just gonna talk about it? \nJUDY (screaming) Jimmy! \nDinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can. Hazel begins to cry as Dinko pushes her into position on all fours. \nDINKO (to Jimmy) How's this? You getting good camera angles and shit? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Turn her ass towards the camera. \nDINKO (laughing it up) Take off them panties bitch...   Oh yeah! Come on bitch. Move. \nJudy is crying profusely in the background as Dinko pushes Hazel to the ground. Jimmy zooms in on Dinko, framing out Hazel as Dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind. \nDINKO That's it.     Just like that. \nDinko looks directly at the lens of the camera. \nDINKO We're going to be doing this shit all the time brother. \nJIMMY (O.C.) You think so? \nDINKO Fuck yeah! \nDinko sees something O.C. from Jimmy, we can't see that surprises him. \nDINKO You don't have to hold a gun to her head man. There's plenty of other chicks we can do that to. If that's what you're into, then fuck it, I'll... \nBAM!!! \nDinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto Hazel. Jimmy's shot him. \nJudy has stopped screaming. Hazel on the other hand is freaking out, trapped under a squirming Dinko. \nJimmy sets the camera on top of something, stands up and brings the gun to Judy. \nJIMMY Take it! \nJudy doesn't know what to do.   Jimmy puts the gun in her hand. \nJIMMY Finish him off! He deserves a bullet right in the fucking face, doesn't he? \nJudy's in a weird cranked out place. \nJUDY (nervous, cranked out) Yeah. Yeah. He does. \nJIMMY Then do it. \nJudy points the gun at a still squirming Dinko.   She can't bring herself to pull the trigger. \nThe Cher bridesmaids giggle. \nJUDY I do. \nELVIS Do you Jimmy promise to always fuck Judy with enthusiasm, to take a shower once a day, and promise not to inject your penis into any part of another person's body as long as you both shall live? \nJIMMY I do. \nELVIS Can I get the rings? \nSiegfried gives the rings to Jimmy who places one on Judy's finger and vice versa. \nELVIS With the power vested in me by the great state of Nevada... I do herby pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. \nJimmy and Judy grab each other by the ass and begin making out. \nThe freak show audience claps while they are making out. The applauding dies down but Jimmy and Judy continue to make out. Jimmy puts his hand up her dress as she begins unbuckling his pants. It looks like they may start fucking on the alter. \nElvis jumps in to break it up. \nELVIS All right you two.     We got a schedule to keep. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy is running through    the motel room with the camera. Flashes of snorted lines    of crank dust and rolled up bills are in the background as    Jimmy moves through the room. We hear Judy screaming with    excitement about something on the TV. \nJUDY (O.C.) Hurry up Jimmy, hurry, hurry, hurry, shit Jimmy. You're going to miss it. \nJimmy settles camera on the television. \nBEGIN TV NEWS REPORT \nOn TV, Jimmy and Judy's high school year book pictures are on the screen. \nINT. TV NEWS STUDIO - (FOR VEGAS MOTEL TV) - NIGHT \nAn ANCHORMAN is mid-sentence, talking about Jimmy and Judy. \nANCHORMAN ...press conference in a few moments. The suspect's names are James Wright and Judy Elizabeth Oaks-Kellen... \nJUDY (O.C.) No it's not! I'm Judy Wright now! (sing songy, like a little girl) I'm Judy Wright now! \nJIMMY (O.C.) Shhhh...     Shut up! \nANCHORMAN ...from Burlington, Kentucky are wanted for questioning in the alleged murder of a Hamilton County Sheriff's Deputy that was killed two nights ago while on Patrol in the Over the Rhine section of Cincinnati. On a very serious note, the producers here at KPX-TV 4 would like to warn you that the images we are about to show are violent and graphic in nature and may not be suitable for young children. Once again, these are the images that were taken from a video camera that was mounted on board the patrol car. Viewer discretion is advised. \nJudy gasps involuntarily as... \nINT. LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at Judy to get her reaction. Her eyes are locked on the screen. \nJudy's face drops. We, on the other hand, are dying to see what she's looking at. \nJimmy swish pans back to the TV and zooms in tight.   The television fills the frame. \nEXT. GHETTO - COP CAR CAM (FOR VEGAS MOTEL) - NIGHT \n(From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely new. It's a black and white security cam style video image. Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text, etc. \nOn TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits. \nThe Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight. \nCOP (on TV) Go ahead and open it. \nJimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by. \nThere's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps forward, raising his voice. \nCOP (on TV) Put your hands on the vehicle. \nJimmy's reluctant. \nCOP (on TV) On the vehicle, now! \nThe Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff.    Jimmy finally leans over and puts his hands on the trunk. \nThe Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt. \nAt that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the Cop. \nHe takes the Cop to the ground and off screen. \nAll we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going on and neither can we. \nAbout 5 seconds go by. \nBOOM! \nJIMMY Yeah, but you look fucking great. \nJUDY This was your idea Jimmy. \nJimmy thinks. \nJIMMY Fuck it.     Let's do this thing. \nJudy starts the shaver back up and proceeds to shave Jimmy's head. She starts right down the middle. \nHair falls into Jimmy's face as Judy slides the buzzer from front to back. Jimmy now has a reverse Mohawk. He laughs at himself along with Judy. \nJIMMY This is the look. \nJudy then shaves the entire top of Jimmy's head, giving him the quintessential male pattern baldness look. \nHe looks ridiculous. \nJIMMY (joking) Let's just leave it like this. \nJudy laughs. \nJUDY Don't be stupid. \nJudy shaves the rest of his head and now Jimmy is completely bald. \nJimmy checks himself out in the mirror. \nJIMMY I am one ugly mother fucker. \nJudy is stroking the top of his head with her hands. \nJUDY It feels funny. \nJimmy gives it a feel for himself.   He sticks his pinky in the side of his mouth. \nJIMMY I look like Dr. Evil. \nJudy laughs, then kisses the top of Jimmy's head. \nJIMMY Come on. Let's go across the street and get a shit burger. \nJimmy shuts down the camera. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. BUN BOY - DINER/PARKING LOT/DINKO'S CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY \nIn a booth at the motel diner, Judy is filming Jimmy while he stuffs a burger into his face. \nJUDY (O.C.) You're such a fucking pig when you eat. \nJimmy opens his mouth full of food and comes towards camera. \nJIMMY Aaaaaaaaaahhh! \nJUDY (O.C.) Gross. That's it. I'm not taking you to the country club, ever! \nThat didn't quite sit right with him, but he covers it up with a mock pout while he chews. \nJUDY (O.C.) (mocking) Awww... I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings? \nJimmy won't respond, playful. \nJUDY (O.C.) I'll take you to the country club. I promise. \nJimmy looks up smiling. \nJIMMY When? \nJUDY (O.C.) I don't know. \nJudy pauses.   Jimmy keeps chewing. \nJUDY (O.C.) Thanks for marrying me. You're my prince charming that came and swooped me off me feet. \nThe irony is thick. Bald, lanky, 21 year old Jimmy with a mouth full of food looks like anything but Prince Charming. \nJUDY (O.C.) And one day, we're gonna have a house and a white picket fence and a baby. Tell me what you think we should name the baby. \nJimmy stops smiling.    She really believes that's going to happen one day. \nJUDY (O.C.) What's wrong? \nJimmy doesn't want to answer.    While he thinks... \nSomething out the window distracts him. \nJUDY (O.C.) What? \nJIMMY Shhhh. Shut up. (grabbing camera) Give it to me. \nJimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking through the window. Finally, we see... \nI/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - BACKROAD ENTRY/PARKING AREA/DINKO'S CAR - DAY \nJudy drives up a gravel road as Jimmy films.    They travel through the back roads in Northern Kentucky.    It's nothing but woods outside the window. \nJUDY What am I gonna see? \nJimmy doesn't answer. \nJUDY I hate it when you do that.    Tell me! \nJIMMY (O.C.) Nope.    Keep looking. \nJudy drives some more.    The camera is bouncing as they drive across dirt roads. \nJudy tries to maintain her composure, but she can't contain herself. \nJUDY How much further!    Aaa! \nJIMMY (O.C.) Shhh.    Just drive. \nJudy bites her lip and drives.    Slowly, she comes around a bend as they arrive at... \nUNCLE RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND/PARKING AREA \nJudy's eyes go wide. \nJUDY Oh my God.     Is that it? \nJimmy doesn't say anything. He just keeps the camera trained on Judy. By the look on her face, what she's seeing looks pretty cool. \nJUDY Is this where your friend lives? \nJimmy points the camera through the front windshield. Now we see what Judy was seeing... about thirty trailers, all along the water's edge. \nIt looks like a commune for run-away teenagers with crank addictions and budding/wannabe drug dealers. The kids are throwing a combination party, barbecue, and drug festival. \nJIMMY (O.C.) This is where we live. \nJUDY We do? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Maybe. If you want to.       For a little while. \nJudy doesn't respond. She just drives. Her eyes are starting to well up a little bit. She's getting emotional. \nJUDY This is sooo amazing.       It's like a dream. \nJudy's on cloud nine.    The place has exceeded her expectations. \nJudy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less the same age as Jimmy and Judy. Some live in trailers, some in tents. They watch as Jimmy and Judy drive in. Clearly new faces are of interest to them. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Go over here. \nOut the window, they approach another trailer.      Clearly this trailer is more important than the others. \nOutside, a dorky looking douche bag type, BUDDY (20's) talks to some of the Younger People in intense language. They all look over to see Jimmy and Judy approaching. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Stop here. \nYou can hear the excitement in Jimmy's voice as Judy stops the car. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Take it. \nJimmy hands off the camera to Judy, who retrains it on the Buddy and the Wunderland Teenagers he talks to. \nJimmy gets out of Dinko's car and heads up to him while Judy films. We don't hear the conversation between Jimmy and Buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see Jimmy. \nBuddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them. \nJimmy comes running back over to the car. \nJUDY (O.C.) Is that Uncle Rodney? \nJIMMY No, that's Buddy. He said Rodney's been expecting us. We're, like, celebrities or something Judy. \nJUDY (O.C.) Really? \nJIMMY Yeah!   He wants to meet you. \nJUDY Wow. \nCamera shakes as Judy starts out of the car.    Camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY \nBuddy is standing outside of a Piece Of Shit Trailer. He's the douche bag type that we saw from a distance give Jimmy a hug in the previous scene. \nHe's surprisingly charismatic and gracious and does his best to make Jimmy and Judy feel at home. \nJimmy films as Buddy gives them a walking tour of the group of trailers by the river. Judy's with them as well. \nBUDDY We got like thirty five trailers here. Long as we've got some that's empty you can stay in one. Sometimes people come in and we got get you a tent or-- fuck, everybody's friendly--- you can always find a bed to crash in. \nThey mock her in a high pitched wining voice. \nBUDDY (O.C.) (mocking) Jimmy. Jimmy say something. \nRODNEY'S BIG GUY #2 (O.C.) Get her clothes off. \nJUDY (O.C.) (screaming) Noooooo! Noooooo! \nJudy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as we hear them tearing at her clothes. Then they pick her up and start pulling her away from camera. \nHer screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter. \nJUDY (O.C.) (extremely faint) Jimmy! \nFinally there's silence. The camera isn't moving.    It's on the ground and in the dark. Camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARKING AREA - DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT \nIt's completely pitch black dark. We can see nothing.    We can only hear the sound of Jimmy fumbling around and breathing heavily and nervously. \nBEGIN NITE SHOT \nSuddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his wrist. \nThe image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT/OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAIER/INSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER/PARKING AREA/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT \nBy the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in sleeping bags and in tents. \nJimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera. \nHe sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag   with her back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to    Judy's, but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over    passed out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken   anyone. \nJimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes a loud clanking sound of glass on glass. \nJimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking up. No one does. \nJimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY. \nKneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the camera. The girl flips over. \nIt's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely intoxicated that she doesn't wake up. \nJimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of the tent. \nJimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground. \nNo luck. \nJimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer.   He decides to make his way up. \nHe walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of bodies until he gets up to the entrance... \nOUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER \nThere's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent beating. \nMoving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door. \nINSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER \nIt's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music. \nJimmy is scared shitless. \nIn the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a spooning position. There's no doubt this time. \nIt's definitely JUDY! \nThey are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them. \nOnce Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared himself for this particular situation and doesn't know exactly what to do. \nHe continues filming them until he finally musters the courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing. \nTHWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney! \nThe camera shakes out of control.   Uncle Rodney screams at the top of his lungs: \nUNCLE RODNEY Who the fuck...! \nIntense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies out of frame then, in a split second: \nBAM! \nA gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse, followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to rest on... \nUNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE \n", "test1_input": "Sam laughs at his own dumb joke.     Jimmy shuts off the camera. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DOE RUN CREEK - DAY \nJimmy films a naked Judy swimming in the river the reflections of the water obscuring her body. She's free, cleansed, relaxed, enjoying the sun, and having the time of her life. She suddenly notices the camera. \nJUDY Jimmy, come swimming.      The water's warm. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Is it? \nJudy smiles, then slips her head under the water, coming back up with a smile. She looks up at him. \nJUDY Come on. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Later.    I just want to look at you now. \nJUDY Why? \nJimmy thinks.    She smiles an oh so sweet smile. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Because you look happy, happier than you've looked in a long time. \nJudy smiles even wider. She floats towards camera while Jimmy zooms in on her smiling face. \nAs she comes closer... \nSHE SPLASHES towards the camera, trying to get Jimmy wet. \nCamera shakes as Jimmy hops up to avoid be splashed. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Hey! \nJudy LAUGHS.   Camera goes off. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - JIMMY & JUDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT \nFaint moonlight comes into the trailer from outside. Jimmy is filming Judy as she's just gotten into bed. She sees the camera's on. \nJUDY Hey again. \nJIMMY (O.C.) So you like it here? \nJudy smiles again.   Then... \nJUDY How long will they let us stay? \nJIMMY (O.C.) It's up to Uncle Rodney. \nJudy smiles at the thought of Rodney. \nJUDY What's he like? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I never met him. He's supposed to be cool, though... and weird. Weird as hell. \nJUDY Well if he's weird, he's great weird, whatever he is. (MORE) \nJUDY (cont'd) If we could stay here forever, like Buddy said, I wouldn't need anything else. \nJudy's looking right over the lens into Jimmy's eyes. Then... \nJUDY The cops won't come will they? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Buddy said Rodney's cousin's the Sheriff or something. Do you want to meet him? \nJUDY (surprised) The Sheriff? \nJIMMY (O.C.) No!   Rodney. \nJUDY (lights up) Can I? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I'm gonna see him tomorrow. Buddy says he wants to talk to me. Maybe he wants to talk to you too. \nJUDY He does? \nJIMMY (O.C.) I don't know. Buddy said he thought you were pretty. \nJUDY Oh my God! \nJudy puts her hand over her mouth.   She can't believe it. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I told you you were. You're the prettiest girl in the world. \nJudy's on such a cloud nine high, she's almost in tears. She wraps her arms around him and SQUEALS with delight, pushing the camera into an awkward position as she smothers him with kisses, then squeezes him tight, like she's going to squeeze the life out of him. \nShe whispers in his ear. \nJUDY (whispers) I love you Jimmy. \nJIMMY Me too. \n", "test1_true": "CAMERA ON: \nEXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY \nHead to toe shot on Jimmy. Buddy, we'll find out in a second, is behind the camera. Jimmy looks at a trailer off screen. He's excited, a little off center and a little nervous. \nBuddy tries to film Jimmy as he's walking towards Rodney's trailer. \nBUDDY (O.C.) You nervous? \nJIMMY (lying) No. \nBUDDY (O.C.) I would be. \nJIMMY He's suppose to be cool. \nBUDDY (O.C.) He's more than cool man. God, you really don't have a clue do you? \nJimmy stops for a second. \nJIMMY Um... Judy wants to meet him.   I don't know if I can ask. \nBUDDY (O.C.) Shit man. Don't have to. She's one of his girls, man. She'll meet him. \nJimmy stops in his tracks and looks at Buddy. \nJIMMY What the fuck does that mean? \nBUDDY (O.C.) Relax dude... Just like you're one of his boys. Shit man, I'll give you two weeks and you'll WANT her to experience him. You may even want to, too. \nJimmy looks at Buddy, not quite sure what to do with any of it. Buddy senses the tension. \nBUDDY (O.C.) Just go see him. Here, take your camera. \nBuddy extends the camera, lens forward.   We can see Jimmy's puzzled look. \nBUDDY (O.C.) He wants you to film him, man. With the camera. He'll tell you when to turn it on, then you video. \nJimmy's puzzled, but he reaches forward and takes the camera, shutting it down. \nCAMERA ON: \nINT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - UNCLE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY \nImages of UNCLE RODNEY (50) going in and out of focus as he sits on the side of a king sized bed. Scars and tatoos litter his arms and neck. His eyes are bit maniacal like Charles Manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up the camera. \nLike a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second. \nJimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the interior of the trailer. It's an ELABORATE triple combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic motif, and white trash/junk-yard memorabilia. \nJUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly, whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it completely. \nCamera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally nervous. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Just one second. \nUNCLE RODNEY Take your time man. I want you to feel comfortable. More importantly, I want you to get this right. \nFinally, the camera stops shaking. Jimmy zooms out to a medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next to him on the bed with her head on his lap. \nUncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog. Hazel, in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals, cries and whimpers like a child, oblivious to Jimmy, the camera, and everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney. \nShe is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she can barely speak. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I'm ready whenever you are. \nUncle Rodney looks down upon Hazel. \nUNCLE RODNEY Just a second. I have to take care of my baby. \nUncle Rodney admires his work. \nUNCLE RODNEY She's beautiful isn't she? \nHAZEL (begging, pleading) Please... \nHazel, entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic episode, can only gasp in unintelligible spurts. \nUNCLE RODNEY Some people come here too far gone. Like Hazel here. The only thing I can do for her is ease her pain. \nHazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed, all the while keeping her head in Uncle Rodney's lap. \nHAZEL Please... \nUNCLE RODNEY (to Hazel) Shhhhh... How about a baby one? \nUncle Rodney's tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her. He's having way too much fun treating her like a baby. \nHAZEL Yes. \nUncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic bag of powder. He then places it to Hazel's nostril. \nShe quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger. \n", "test1_id": 1920, "test2_input": "UNCLE RODNEY (to Hazel) There you go... \nHazel begins whimpering again.   It wasn't nearly enough to satisfy her. \nUNCLE RODNEY There's something about addiction that brings out something beautiful in a person. Addiction is pure. Addiction reduces a person to an infant. And there's nothing more pure and beautiful in the world than an infant. \nHe puts his finger to Hazel's nostril again, but this time, without any meth on the tip. She snorts with all of her might then starts crying. Uncle Rodney is toying with her. \nUNCLE RODNEY Hazel is no longer an adult. She's an infant and I'm the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed breast milk. It's a role that both of us have accepted and embrace. \nHe leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then gently holds Hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into her vein. \nNothing happens for several seconds. \nHazel's breathing accelerates. Suddenly she sits up, her eyes go wide. Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a roller coaster. \nUNCLE RODNEY (proudly) That's my girl! \nThen, she makes eye contact with Jimmy. \nA curious, frightened look comes over her face.   Clearly, she recognizes him. \nShe suddenly JUMPS from the bed and runs out of the room. \nUNCLE RODNEY She's a little jumpy. \nUncle Rodney smiles, amusing himself with his own joke. \nUNCLE RODNEY Let's begin shall we? And please... I'm going to use this tape for my fans, so let's try to get this right. \nJIMMY (O.C.) OK. \nUNCLE RODNEY I apologize if any of this frightens you or makes you uncomfortable. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I'll be fine. \nUNCLE RODNEY No. You won't be fine. What I'm going to teach you will be frightening. The truth is an acquired taste but once you get to it, it's all you'll ever want. \nUncle Rodney starts in on his mantra.   It's obvious that he's well versed in his meandering rant. \nUNCLE RODNEY Those kids out there... we, the so called \"undesirables\" - you and me, we know the truth. You know that society doesn't want you, your parents don't want you, corporate America sure as fuck doesn't want you... You wouldn't be here otherwise. (MORE) \nUNCLE RODNEY (cont'd) If this government had a choice, they'd gas us all in a heartbeat, exterminate us like the Jews, enslave us like niggers, cuz don't kid yourself, WE ARE the new niggers in this country. No one respects us... No one sees what we have to offer... No one has compassion for us.... They don't care, or they're too naive to see that we're a by-product of a wasteful society that has failed to educate, embrace, influence, or inspire any of us. We're societal garbage. The counter culture no longer exists. It's dead... It's been replaced by us-- \nLong pause. \nUNCLE RODNEY The garbage culture... thrown aside, imprisoned, institutionalized, systematically abused, executed, and enlisted into wars started by government ass- fuckers just to kill us off. JUST TO KILL US OFF. And every week one of you shows up here, disillusioned, addicted, angry, pissed 'cuz they tossed you aside... into the garbage. Every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker. Until the \"them\" and the \"they\" of this country run out of places to put us, to put its garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS into their cities from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us. \nA pause, then... \nUNCLE RODNEY (biblical) And we will SET FIRE to their world! And we will burn it, until a living HELL REIGNS over what was their former world, and we will fornicate in their ashes! \nRodney stops, almost out of breath. \nUNCLE RODNEY That's what's here for you.   That's what's here... \nRodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as Jimmy begins zooming out. Uncle Rodney lights a cigarette to calm himself. \nJimmy keeps filming, not knowing whether Rodney is finished or just taking a break. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT - NIGHT \nSomeone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch. They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions. \nMost of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums. They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be allowed. \nCamera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming. Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums. \nJIMMY Where's Judy? \nBuddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit. We now see Jimmy see Judy. \nShe dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you might about the attendees to the event, this party is a FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of everyone's attention. \nEveryone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session. \nJimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does. \nJUMP CUT \nWho knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are dancing are drunk, stoned or both. \nIn the background, while it's too dark and hectic see anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in the foreground. \nCamera zooms in on Uncle Rodney. \nStanding just behind him, we see of flash of someone recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness going on. \nShe turns her head to look over at Rodney. \n", "test2_true": "HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of rolling on crank. \nAND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely pissing him off. \nBodies wipe the frame. \nJUMP CUT \nMoments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of the drum beats is ever present. \nUncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking. \nJimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation intensely. \nIt's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but something doesn't seem right here. \nUncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy. With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying. \nNow Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to get the feeling that something ominous is afoot. \nFinally, they approach camera and we can hear them. \nUNCLE RODNEY I'm so glad you guys came down here. We never would have guessed you'd come and see us. \nJIMMY You've been awesome.   Judy loves it here. \nUncle Rodney's got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed side hug. \nUNCLE RODNEY I knew she would. By the way. \nRodney's face drops. \nUNCLE RODNEY I know what you did to Dinko. \nThis hits Jimmy like a lead weight. Before he can react at all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney. \nOff camera, something similar is happening to Judy. \nJUDY (O.C.) (screaming) What the fuck are you doing?! Jimmy, Jimmy! \nJudy screams his name over and over. \nJUDY Jimmy!   Jimmy! \nBUDDY (O.C.) (laughing) Shut it, bitch! \nSMACK!   Judy's been hit by Buddy off screen. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nEXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DARK WOODS - NIGHT \nWe hear intense struggling and laughter. By the sounds we hear, we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodney's Bigger Guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in fact is happening. \nSomeone unidentified is running the show and operates the camera. It's impossible to see, but it's definitely Buddy's voice. \nBUDDY (O.C.) Here, here, here. Right here. \nJudy is screaming and crying. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy! \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy? \nTwo or three guys, it's too dark to tell, start laughing. \nJUDY (O.C.) (screams) Please somebody help us! \nJimmy grunts, trying to break free. \nJIMMY Judy! \nRODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.) Shut up, asshole! You wanna fucking talk! \nMUNCH. Somewhere in the darkness Jimmy's been kicked in the gut. The camera hits the ground. It lands right in front of Jimmy. We can still barely see what's going on, but we're close enough and there's enough flashes of light from flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody. \nJIMMY (defiant) Fuck you! \nJimmy gets kicked again just once. Then suddenly, a barrage of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other. \nLeaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmy's face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly. \nThe process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds. \nWe can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but Jimmy's not moving. He's either unconscious or dead. \nWith one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't see Jimmy's face anymore. \nRODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.) Is he fucking dead? \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy!   Jimmy say something! \n", "test2_id": 1921, "test3_input": "JUDY (O.C.) Nooooo. It reminds me of when we first met. Just you, me, and the camera. God, do you remember how you used to freak me out? \nJIMMY Yeah, those were the good old days. How much money do we have? \nJUDY (O.C.) I don't know, why? \nJIMMY How do you feel about Canada?   It's closer. \nJUDY (O.C.) Are we going together? \nJimmy looks over at her. \nJIMMY I think I should take you home. \nJudy doesn't answer. \nJIMMY I could write you a letter. Or I could make a video saying I made you do everything. They'd believe you. You could tell them it was all my fault. You could tell them I was going to Mexico and I'd really go to Canada. \nJimmy swallows. \nJIMMY We swore on the bond we'd never be apart... but... (MORE) \nJIMMY (cont'd) I'll let you out of it... If you want to be out of it, I'll let you out. \nJUDY (O.C.) You're never leaving me, and I'm never leaving you.

She likes looking at him through the lens. \nJUDY (O.C.) You're so handsome, you know that? \nJimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up. Then his eyes get droopy and close. \nHe's not responding. He's as punch drunk as you can get. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy? \nJimmy's obviously in a concussion induced daze. The car starts to drift. Judy drops the camera on the seat as we hear her leap forward to take control of the car. \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy! \nJIMMY (O.C.) (snaps to) What? \nJUDY (O.C.) Jimmy, stop the car. You're too fucked up to drive. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (groggy) Huh? Oh... okay. \nCamera shuts down. \nCAMERA ON: \nI/E. HIGHWAY FINAL-SCENE/DINKO'S CAR - DAY \nJudy drives.   There isn't much talking going on. \nJUDY You wanted to ask me something? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Do you love me? \nJUDY You know I do. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I do. \nThe car drives. Judy just cruises along, music playing on the radio. Jimmy (O.C.) looks in the mirror but keeps the camera trained on her. \nJIMMY (O.C.) You know I love you, right? \nJUDY Yup. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy? \nJUDY Yes? \nJIMMY (O.C.) We're fucked. \nJUDY What do you mean? \nJIMMY (O.C.) Look in the rearview mirror. \nJudy looks up immediately.    Her face drops. \nJimmy flips the camera around out the back window. There's a Ohio State Trooper with its lights flashing tailing them. A lone trooper is on his radio. \nJIMMY (O.C.) That's it baby. We're done. \nJudy doesn't answer.    She's short circuited. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Just pull over. It's not worth it. \n", "test3_true": "The cop car CHIRPS its siren. \nJudy looks up. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy, what are you doing?      You know this is... \nJUDY Don't do this. \nJudy looks up into the rearview mirror. Her eyes are welling up. She looks out the front windshield. \nJimmy senses that she sees something. He flips the camera around through the front only to see a row of cop cars blocking the highway up ahead. \nHe flips the camera back at her. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy? \nJUDY (freaks) Shut up! \nJudy looks straight ahead, determination on her face. \nShe won't answer.    Then... \nShe turns the wheel hard to the right, almost carrying Jimmy into her, and takes the car onto a side road. \nJIMMY (O.C.) I love you. \nJUDY I love you too. \nJudy is on her own mission. \nJIMMY (O.C.) It's over. \nJUDY (soft) No. \nJIMMY (O.C.) It is. \nJUDY No. \nThe car stops short. Jimmy turns the camera to point out the windshield. They're stuck. The road has come to a dead end. \nJIMMY (O.C.) It's a dead end. \nJudy ignores Jimmy. She throws the car into reverse and tries to turn it around and head back the way she came. \nA faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the background. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Do you hear that? \nJudy doesn't respond.    She's determined. \nJUDY (lying) No. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Come on, it's over. I'll do what I said before. I'll tell them I made you do it. It'll be okay. \nJUDY No.   I want us to be together. \nJIMMY (O.C.) (screams) Well we fucking can't, so pull the fuck over! \nJUDY Yes we can. I won't give you up. I won't let you go. No way. \nJimmy pans the camera out the front windshield. In the distance, we catch sight of a road block that's been set up at the end of the dirt trail. They're screwed. There's nowhere to go. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Come on. \nJudy doesn't answer. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy? \nShe still doesn't answer. \nThen the car thrusts itself forward. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy!     Stop it. \nJudy's got a look of determination in her eye. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy, what are you doing? \nJudy doesn't respond. O.C., she's murmuring something to herself that Jimmy can't hear or understand while she has the throttle to the floor as they barrel toward the roadblock. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy! \nJudy keeps going.    Jimmy flips the back camera towards her. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy!     Stop! \nJudy's murmurs grow louder. \nJIMMY (O.C.) Judy! \nJimmy braces himself as the car continues toward the roadblock. \nSuddenly, Judy's murmurs get loud enough or us to hear. \n", "test3_id": 1922}

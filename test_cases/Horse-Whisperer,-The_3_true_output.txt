Grace can't help but be impressed. Joe nods. Annie is shaken. 
ANNIE Mr. Booker, I'm not at all comfortable with you taking those kinds of chances... 
As Tom leads Pilgrim out, the horse suddenly whirls, bolting, knocking Tom down... 
ANNIE Oh, God! 
Pilgrim runs off, pulling the wet rope behind him. Joe runs over and grabs for the rope. 
TOM NO... LET HIM GO! 
Joe obeys. Pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill out onto a pasture, He keeps on running into the distance -- running across the pasture, not knowing where he is going... 
Tom, arms folded across his chest, watches him run. A concerned Annie approaches. 
ANNIE She's running away! How are you going to get him back? 
Tom doesn't respond. He walks off down the hill out onto the pasture, stops, arms folded and watches Pilgrim. Annie turns when she hears Smokey, who appears behind her: 
SMOKEY He don't really want to run. Don't know where he's going. All this open space scares the daylight out of him. 
Confused, Pilgrim stops running and walks, in no particular direction. 
SMOKEY My guess is he's spent his life in a six-by-eight stall... He's forgot what it's like to be a horse... 
Smokey ambles off and she turns back to see Tom crouching on his haunches, sitting in the grass, just waiting. Pilgrim walks back towards the ranch, stops a distance from Tom, looks at him... Annie, needing to know exactly what's going on, crosses down the hill to him. 
ANNIE So what now? Should we leave? 
Tom continues watching Pilgrim. Annie looks at him, sitting there motionless and feels like an idiot. Clearly she doesn't understand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the time to explain to her. 
ANNIE Well, we're going to go then... 
Without looking at her, Tom just nods. Annie, awkwardly, walks back up the hill to where Grace is... 
ON THE GRASSY HILLSIDE, Grace is watching the scene by herself as Joe appears, staring at her leg... It makes her uncomfortable. She turns to him with a curt, impatient tone; 
GRACE What? 
Their eyes meet. Joe is so guileless, Grace is taken off guard when he asks in such a compassionate voice; 
JOE Does that hurt you? 
Grace tries to think of an answer -- and of how to say it: 
GRACE Only when I kick somebody. 
Her gentle delivery makes him smile. She smiles, then: 
GRACE Don't you go to school? 
JOE Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch. 
He tips his hat down as he looks out to Pilgrim with respect; 
JOE Look at him out in the pasture -- Yeah, he must've been a big, beautiful looking horse. How was he to ride? 
Grace is uncomfortable again. She looks away, just struggling. Joe senses she's done talking; 
JOE Excuse me. I got chores to look after. 
He tips his hat and walks off, passing Annie as she arrives. 
ANNIE You ready to go? 
Grace hesitates. Then mother and daughter take one more look -- 
POV -- Pilgrim standing in the pasture with Tom crouching in the grass waiting for him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PASTURE - LATER THAT DAY 
Tom is still sitting in the grass, just where we left him -- waiting patiently. Pilgrim is still out in the pasture. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PASTURE - STILL LATER THAT DAY 
Afternoon shadows cross the ranch. Tom is in the exact same spot and position. Pilgrim is somewhat closer -- but still at a distance -- watching him. 
Frank rides back from work. As he passes Tom, the two nod as if nothing usually is going on. Frank rides up to the barn. 
INT. PETERSON'S MOTEL - 
Grace is flicking the television -- repeating the only three channels over and over... 
Annie works at her computer, surrounded by work. She notices the time, gets a thought and dials the phone... 
ANNIE Hello, Mr. Booker... Oh, hello, Frank. This is Annie MacLean... I was wondering, has-... (listens) Uh-huh... And Pilgrim?... (listens) Still?... Uh-huh... (politely cheery) Okay then. Thank you. 
She hangs up, pauses, then speaks to the window out loud enough for Grace to hear -- 
ANNIE He's still sitting in that damn field. 
GRACE (w/o looking at her) I think they call it a pasture. 
Annie looks at her as if to say the last thing I need to know is a lesson on the local lingo... 
ANNIE Let's go see what's going on, then get something to eat. 
EXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH - DUSK 
The sky is changing colors, the temperature has dropped. Tom is still sitting in the grass, although someone has brought him a blanket for his shoulders. Pilgrim is in the pasture, but now -- he too is motionless, looking back at Tom. 
The sound of a car makes Tom turn to see Annie driving up. She gets out, stands by the car with a proprietary air, watching Tom and Pilgrim. Grace remains in the car. There's a sound. She turns to see Diane coming out of the house... 
DIANE There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom. 
ANNIE Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him. 
Diane, knowing full well Tom ain't in a talking mood, hands her a cup...

LISA What? 
DELANEY Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor Mixter's office? I've got to check the boiler, there's been complaints about the heating not working. 
LISA No problem. 
Lisa grabs a roll of bin bags from the shelf. 
CUT TO: 
33.EXT.MIXTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Lisa knocks on the door. 
LISA Doctor Mixter? Hello? 
She knocks again. No answer. Lisa tentatively turns the handle. The door slowly creaks open. The office is empty. Lisa walks in. 
CUT TO: 
34.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE Â­ CONTINUOUS 
She looks around for the bin, finally locating it by the side of the desk. Lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up before replacing it with a new bag. With her task complete, Lisa's curiosity gets the better of her. She looks around the office. There is a shelf full of psychology books and a filing cabinet. Lisa touches the top drawer of the filing cabinet and it opens. 
Lisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one marked 'Patient X'. She reaches for it and suddenly a HAND grabs her shoulder! A startled Lisa turns around. An orderly in his thirties is stood in front of her. He is thin but muscular, with slicked back hair. This is PEMBERTON. 
PEMBERTON What the hell are you doing in here? 
LISA Uh... I was just emptying the garbage. 
PEMBERTON Funny, I don't remember Doctor Mixter keeping the garbage in the filing cabinet. 
LISA Look I... it was just open and I ... I dunno. 
PEMBERTON Well, y'know I'm gonna have to report this. 
LISA Oh please don't, I didn't see anything I just opened it. 
Pemberton smiles. 
PEMBERTON Well new girl, it's hospital policy to report this kind of thing. 
LISA But I've only just got this job and I really need it. 
Pemberton looks her up and down. 
PEMBERTON Perhaps we can come to some arrangement. 
LISA What do you mean? 
PEMBERTON Well, I'd be doing you a big favour if I kept this to myself. So perhaps you can do me a favour.

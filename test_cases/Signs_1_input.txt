Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow Graham up the 
STAIRS. 
MERRILL That roof is over ten feet high. 
GRAHAM He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high. 
They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his bedroom.  He moves into his 
BATHROOM. 
They all move in with him. 
OFFICER PASKI They got women's high jumping in the Olympics.  They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over me. 
Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open the back. 
GRAHAM Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I have double A's in here. 
Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the bathroom. 
GRAHAM I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is. 
They moves down the STAIRS. 
OFFICER PASKI Yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. Scared a couple of customers.  No one's seen her since... My point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw.  We should just keep all possibilities available. 
They move through the FAMILY ROOM. 
Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. 
BO Dad, where's the remote? 
Bo starts looking around the couch. 
Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over to the television. 
There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen. 
GRAHAM Bo, you're too old to still be doing this.  The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it. (beat) Now what's wrong with this one? 
Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her father.  Looks at the glass. 
BO There's dust in it. 
GRAHAM This one? 
BO A hair. 
GRAHAM This one? 
BO Morgan took a sip.  It has his amoebas in it. 
Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads towards the kitchen. 
MERRILL Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a possibility? 
OFFICER PASKI I'm not done asking questions and I don't appreciate the sarcasm. 
They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into the KITCHEN. 
Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio. 
OFFICER PASKI Do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you? Maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church? 
Graham looks at Edgar. 
GRAHAM I don't think so. 
OFFICER PASKI Do you owe anybody money?  You can tell me off the record if you need too. 
GRAHAM No. 
MERRILL No. 
Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts replacing the batteries. 
OFFICER PASKI Is anything missing? 
GRAHAM No.

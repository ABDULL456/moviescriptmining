BETH Is it? Because I know about the two-day rule, I know about the headshots and the secrets. She tells us everything. (beat, then) You really don't have to stay Kumail. You have already done a lot. 
Kumail is speechless. After a beat of awkward quiet-- 
KUMAIL I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this seat- ? 
Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she throws her sewing on it and turns away. 
Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down, facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next to him. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Is that lady still looking at me? 
INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA- LATER 
Kumail carries his tray, spots Terry and Beth together having a hushed conversation. He sits at a different table. Terry waves at him. Kumail heads over to them. 
TERRY No reason you should eat there by yourself. Right, hon? 
BETH (barely looks up) It's a free country. 
Kumail nods. Sits down. They eat. It's awkward. 
KUMAIL How's your sandwich? 
BETH Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had. 
TERRY Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble. You know, we're not by the water. Well, we are by the water, but it's a lake. There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever. I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I guess. Whatever the good dice number is. 
More silence. 
TERRY (CONT'D) So, uh, 9/11? 
Blank looks from Kumail and Beth. 
TERRY (CONT'D) No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a conversation about it with...people. 
KUMAIL You've never talked to people about 9/11? 
TERRY No, uh, what's your stance? 
KUMAIL What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm... Anti. It was a tragedy. (a beat) I mean we lost 19 of our best guys. 
BETH Huh? 
KUMAIL That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to joke about it. 
Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly gather up their things and get up to leave. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Hey, can I come? 
TERRY                            BETH Yeah.                         No. 
Terry gestures for Kumail to get up and follow them. 
BETH Whatever. 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER 
Kumail, Beth, Terry, and Dr. Cunningham. 
DR. CUNNINGHAM I know this isn't the news you were hoping for but we aren't ready to bring Emily out of the coma yet. 
BETH Oh. I- 
TERRY What happened? 
DR. CUNNINGHAM The antibiotics aren't doing exactly what we'd hoped they would, and we don't want to mess around. So we're going to perform surgery tomorrow morning to remove the infection. 
BETH Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us that the antibiotics would work. He didn't say anything at all about surgery. 
TERRY What does that mean? What kind of surgery? 
DR. CUNNINGHAM It's called thoracentesis, it's a very common procedure. We're going to go in between the ribs and remove the infection. 
TERRY (scribbling in his notebook) How do you spell that please? Thora- ? What's the last part? 
DR. CUNNINGHAM -Centesis. 
BETH And where is the infection?

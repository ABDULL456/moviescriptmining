DOLORES I shut the door with one hand, and released the brake with the other, and waited for a second for Risa to cross in front of the bus.  There was a sixteen wheeler behind me, and I heard his air brakes hiss as the driver chunked into gear.  I looked into the side view mirror, and saw him move into line behind me.  Then suddenly Sean shrieked... 
CUT TO 
INT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING 
SEAN leaps to the front of the bus. 
SEAN Mommy! 
MITCHELL (voice over, from the court chamber) What happened then? 
DOLORES (voice over) Sean was all over me, scrambling across my lap to the window.  I glimpsed  Risa off to my left, leaping out of the way of a red Saab that seemed to have bolted out of nowhere. 
The scene is horrifying, as SEAN watches his mother just missing a terrible accident with the speeding vehicle. 
DOLORES (CONT'D) Sean!  Sit down!  Your Mom's okay! Now sit down! 
SEAN sits back down beside NICOLE.  DOLORES slides open her window, and speaks to RISA. 
DOLORES (CONT'D) You get his number? 
RISA is stunned. 
DOLORES (CONT'D) (voice over) She was shaken, standing there with her arms wrapped around herself. 
DOLORES She shook her head, turned away, and walked slowly back to the office.  I drew a couple of breaths and checked Sean, who was seated now but still craning and looking after his mother.

The deposition continues. 
DOLORES 
I smiled at him, but he only glared back at me, as if I was to blame. 
CUT TO 
EXT. SCHOOL BUS -- MORNING 
AERIAL VIEW of the bus as it makes its way through the mountains.  NICOLE'S voice is heard reading The Pied Piper from the scene with the ANSEL children. 
NICOLE (voice over) For he led us, he said, to a joyous land, Joining the town and just at hand, Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, And flowers put forth a fairer hue, And everything was strange and new...

CUT TO 
INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY 
The deposition.  DOLORES is trying to control her emotions. 
DOLORES I remember wrenching the steering wheel to the right and slapping my foot against the brake petal.  I wasn't the driver anymore. 
DOLORES The bus was like this huge wave about to break over us.  Bear Otto, the Lambston kids, the Hamiltons, the Prescotts, the teenaged boys and girls from Bartlett Hill, Sean, Nicole Burnell, Billy Ansel's twins, Jessica and Mason...all the children of my town. 
CUT TO 
INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT 
SAM and JENNY are watching television.  Lumberjack log- rolling. 
NICOLE, in her wheelchair, is reading a book off to one corner.  MARY comes into the room.

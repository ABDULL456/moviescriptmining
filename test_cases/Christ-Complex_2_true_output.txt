JENNIFER What are you thinking about? 
ZOEY I've had a great life. A wonderful husband, children, grandchildren... (motions to Jennifer) ...great grandchildren...I spent so much of my youth being angry. I wish I could relive my life now, knowing what I know. 
JENNIFER You do have a lot of wisdom. 
ZOEY I've tried to pass it on to you. 
JENNIFER You've taught me a lot. 
ZOEY Just remember, you can believe what you want to believe Jennifer. Live by what ever moral code you want to live by. Just make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem from anger or past tragedies. (beat) Let it come from your heart. 
Jennifer turns around. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) What is it? 
JENNIFER My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to meet. 
Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot like Quinn. 
Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey. 
BOYFRIEND (nervous) Nice to meet to ma'am. 
ZOEY (shakes his hand) Likewise. 
Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with Zoey. 
JENNIFER We better get going. We're going to grab something to eat. 
ZOEY (to the boyfriend) I didn't catch your name. 
BOYFRIEND I'm so sorry. I'm being rude. 
JENNIFER (laughs) He can be like that. 
BOYFRIEND I'm Louis. 
Zoey is stunned. 
JENNIFER (to Zoey) You OK? 
ZOEY Yeah I'm fine. (snapping out of it) Enjoy dinner. 
JENNIFER See you later on. 
BOYFRIEND (making eye contact with Zoey, smiling) Nice to meet you. 
ZOEY (returning contact, and smiles) Likewise. 
The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.

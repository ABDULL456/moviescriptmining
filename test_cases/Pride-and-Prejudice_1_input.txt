JANE Lizzie! 
ELIZABETH You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes. 
Â¢ JANE Not his friend. I still cannot believe what he said about you. 
ELIZABETH Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again. She blows out the candle. 
8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8 
Mrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work, whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat. 
MRS BENNET And then he danced the third with Miss Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss King of little standing. And the fifth again with Jane. 
MR BENNET â¢ If he'd had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance. 
MRS BENNET Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance. Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this speech many times before. 
MR BENNET 
(NOT LISTENING) Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter. 
MRS BENNET As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you die, which may in fact be very soon, our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name. 
ELIZABETH Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's â¢ babbling. 
MRS HILL â¢ A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn. From Netherfield Hall. 
MRS BENNET Praise the Lord! We are saved. Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane. 
MRS BENNET (CONT'D) Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy day! 
JANE It is from Miss Bingley. Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks. 
JANE (CONT'D) She has invited me to dine with her. 
(PAUSE) Her brother will be dining out. 
MRS BENNET This is most unfortunate. 
LYDIA I didn't think he was so good looking anyway. 
JANE Can I take the carriage? 
MRS BENNET Certainly not my dear, you will go to Netherfield on horse back. 
JANE Horseback?! Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.

12 EXT. GARDEN - DAY. 12 
A louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls clothes from a line...it's bucketing down heavily now...

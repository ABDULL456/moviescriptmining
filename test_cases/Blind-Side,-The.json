Cotton sighs, considers what to do. \nCOTTON They'd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews. \nBIG TONY I was hopin' you might just interview 'em now. \nCOTTON They're here? Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven and Michael are playing one on one basketball. \nBIG TONY The little ones Steven and the big \nONE'S -- \nCOTTON Big Mike. \nBIG TONY Yeah. That's right. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n15 EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY 15 \nFor a boy his size Michael can really move. He dribbles, fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer. Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches -- Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men aren't supposed to move like this. Cotton's lips are almost quivering -- \nCOTTON Mother of God... \n16 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE BOARD ROOM - DAY 16 \nThe Board of Admissions, eight or so men and women, are seated around a large conference table. By himself, at one end, sits Bert Cotton. \nCOTTON Are there spots available or not? PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before... \nSANDSTROM Technically, yes, in both grades. But we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms. Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable and I believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid -- Sandstrom looks through papers for the name. \nCOTTON Big Mike. \nSANDSTROM Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe, based on his record, that he would be successful here. \nCOTTON How bad could it be? Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file, which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out --- \n(CONTINUED) \n16 CONTINUED: 16 \nMRS. SMITH We're not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records. He has a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th percentile. He's been enrolled in seven different institutions, including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didn't attend school at all. He repeated first grade as well as second, there's no record of attendance in third, and in fourth grade -- \nCOTTON So they moved him ahead without going to third grade. That says something. \nMRS. SMITH \n(IGNORING COTTON) His attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero. Zero-point-six- Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and science teacher, looks to the others. \nMRS. BOSWELL Everyone passed him along - gave him D's so they could hand their problem off to the next school. \nCOTTON Brave kid. (off their confusion) For wanting to come here. For wanting a quality education. An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place. \nMRS. SMITH Coach Cotton, we understand your interest in the young man's athletic abilities. \nSANDSTROM He wouldn't be able to play until he got his grades up anyway. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 10 \n16 CONTINUED: 16 \nCOTTON Forget sports! Look at the wall. He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: \"NEIGHBORLY, \nACADEMIC, CHRISTIAN\". \nCOTTON (CONT'D) Christian. We either take that seriously or we paint over it. You don't admit Michael Oher for sports, you admit him because it's the right thing to do. Their faces announce that he's made a point. \n17 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 17 \nFirst day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue- eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with friends they haven't seen over the summer. Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the arch. Beneath the school name we read \"WITH MEN THIS IS. POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE\". Michael takes a deep breath and enters. He carries his \"school bag\" - a plastic grocery sack. \n18 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 18 \nJust as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to the fact that he doesn't belong here. Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone. \n19 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 19 \nIt's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then... \nMRS. BOSWELL Class, this is Mike Oher and he's new here so I expect you all to make him feel welcome. (with a warm smile) Mike, take any empty seat. \n(CONTINUED) \n19 CONTINUED: 19 She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat. Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As students pass them back to others... \nMRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D) This is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum. \n(OVER GROANS) Don't worry. It won't be graded. I just want to see how much of the information we need to hit again. \n", "test1_true": "few seconds before turning back to her work. \n20 INT. WINGATE - HALLWAY - DAY (LATER) 20 \nA bell RINGS and kids leave classrooms. \n21 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 21 \nMichael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top. She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for -- \nMRS. BOSWELL It's okay. \nMICHAEL Can I leave now? She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances down at the sheet, turns it over and sees... A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a third grader drew it. \n22 INT. BIG TONY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 22 \nMichael lies on a tattered sofa. The lights are out but Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from beneath a closed bedroom door. We hear voices... \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S) Why he gotta always stay here? \nBIG TONY'S VOICE (0.S) Ain't got nowhere else. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S) And how's that your problem? You the Red Cross all of a sudden? Michael tries to shut his eyes. \n23 EXT. WINGATE - PARKING LOT - DAY \nSchool is out. Steven walks up to Michael... \nSTEVEN Hey, Big Mike, um... my Pops' girlfriend... she don't really want you to stay with us no more. Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) We can still give you rides if you want? \nMICHAEL Naw, it's aright. Steven gets in the Taurus. Michael watches it drive away. \n24 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM FOYER - NIGHT \nA girl's volleyball game is in progress in the bg. As latecomers move en masse for entry into the gym, a small pretty lady on a cell phone moves.against the crowd; a salmon on a mission. This is LEIGH ANNE Tuohy. And she's pissed. \nLEIGH ANNE (on cell phone) I don't care if Patrick Ramsey did approve the chair. He's an NFL quarterback not Martha frickin' Stewart. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 13 \n24 CONTINUED: 24 She arrives at the concession stand and waits impatiently. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) There's a difference between Bunny Williams and Lazee-boy. \n(TO VENDOR) Three large popcorns and two large diets. \n(INTO CELL) When MTV Cribs comes to his house he'll be showing off his home theatre but all I'm gonna see is a brown Barca-lounger. I'm his designer, my name's on it. Deliver what I ordered!!! She hangs up angry, spots a friend nearby and her frown turns into a smile that could light up a cave. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT`D) Hi, sweetie! We're on the Kidspace committee together, aren't we?! It'll be a hoot! \n25 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT 25 \nLeigh Anne's husband SEAN TUOHY, handsome, confidant, and their 10-year-old son, SJ, sit, watching the game. During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd. In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself, rubbing his knees. Others around him, all white, have moved away. He's a very large island in the lily white gym. \nSEAN S.J., you know that kid? \nSJ What kid? \nSEAN Black kid. Up in the corner. \nSI Be goes to high school here. His name is Big something... Big Mike. Sean eyes Michael suspiciously. \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: 25 \nSEAN He look like a volleyball fan to you? Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the stands to her family. She has a nod, a smile, a bon mot, for everyone she passes. As she sits... \nLEIGH ANNE What'd I miss? \nSEAN Collins got a dig. \nSI It's girl's volleyball, Mom. You didn't miss anything. Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts -- \nLEIGH ANNE Collins! Move your feet! ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs and gives her mother a look - \"Don't embarrass me!\" \n26 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT (LATER) 26 \nThe scoreboard tells us that the game is over. Fans file out. The Tuohy family waits in a group as the volleyball team exits the court. \nLEIGH ANNE Collins, we'll wait outside. And don't double condition in the shower - you still have homework! \nCOLLINS I'm going over to Cannon's house to study. \nSI Can I go.to the Johnson's for dinner?

Michael walks to a sink in the back, opens his plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash it. A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets down the magazine and walks outside. It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things. \n39 EXT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT (LATER) 39 \nMichael sits in the corner, his head resting against the window, trying to sleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n40 EXT. WINGATE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 40 \nA banner over the arch reads: THANKSGIVING PAGEANT TONIGHT! Kids in costume - Pilgrims, Indians, turkeys - race out the door to greet their proud parents.

SEAN'S BMW - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 43 \nAs they exit the parking lot-- \nLEIGH ANNE Turn on the heat! \nSEAN I don't know where it is. \nLEIGH ANNE It's fifteen degrees, you've had this car a month and you don't know how to turn on the heat?! (as she turns it on) What would you do without.me? \nSEAN Lots of things you'll never know about. \n(CONTINUED) \n43 CONTINUED: 43 They trade a look and a smile. Sean puts a.hand on her lap. \nSI Get a room. \nLEIGH ANNE Si, don't let this go to your head but I thought you were very convincing in the role of... uh... \nSI Indian Number Three. I tried out for the Chief but they gave it to Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I think there was some multi-cultural bias thing working. \nSEAN Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better Chief. \nSI Dad, he's like Chinese. \nLEIGH ANNE And you're Irish. If you weren't the Chief how come you got the headdress? Si hesitates a bit before -- \nSI Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of those free Quesadilla tickets. \nLEIGH ANNE \n(LAUGHS) And where does the acorn fall? \nSEAN Don't laugh too hard. The Quesadilla saved our ass. \nA44 EXT. STREET - NIGHT A44 \nSean's car stops at a red light and Michael crosses in front of them, wearing just his shorts and short sleeved shirt. \nB44 INT.

STREET - NIGHT 44 \nThe BMW pulls to a stop alongside Michael. Leigh Anne gets out, walks up to Michael. \nLEIGH ANNE Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate.

Michael eyes the ground, then nods. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Don't you dare lie to me. \n45 INT. SEAN'S BMW - NIGHT 45 \nSean and SJ watch the discussion without hearing any of it. Leigh Anne looks to Sean, then back to Michael. \nSEAN I've seen that look many times. She's about to get her way. Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in tow. She opens the back door and he gets in next to SJ in his headdress. Leigh Anne climbs into the front seat, closes the door. Sean is looking at her. \nSEAN (CONT'D) Where we going? \nLEIGH ANNE Home. \n46 EXT. RITZY NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 46 \nThe car enters the driveway of a beautiful home and stops. \n47 INT.

There's a powder room right there and we're upstairs if you need us. The two share a look, then... \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Sleep tight, honey. She leaves.

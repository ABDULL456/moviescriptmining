{"train": "THE BLIND SIDE \nWritten by \nJohn Lee Hancock \nBased on the book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game \nBy \nMichael Lewis \n1 OVER BLACK... 1 A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE... \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE There's a moment of orderly silence before a football play begins. Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything's possible. Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide. From the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five. \n2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2 \nWe're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the ball. As the play begins -- \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the Redskins quarterback, takes the snap and hands off to his running back. JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann. The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Two Mississippi. It's a trick play, a flea flicker, and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback. HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and to the side and Carson flies past. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Three Mississippi. Up to now the play's been defined by what the quarterback sees. It's about to be defined by what he doesn't. LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins lineman trying to block him. \n(CONTINUED) \n2 CONTINUED: 2 The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses. Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann. The image FREEZES. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the NFL and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie. The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes Theismann's body. PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating. TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) He will also change the game of football as we know it. WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES. \nFRANK GIFFORD (V.0.) Again, we'll look at it with the reverse angle one more time. And I suggest if your stomach is weak you just don't watch. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE Joe Theissman never played another down of football. \n3 TEAM PHOTO OF THE 2005 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 3 \nLEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE Now, y'all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an NFL team is the quarterback. The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) And you'd be right. What you probably don't know is that more often than not the second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle. The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle. \n(CONTINUED) \n3 CONTINUED: 3 \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Because, as every housewife knows, the first check you write is for the mortgage and the second is for the insurance. The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side. \n4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4 \"Famous\" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists, etc., corresponding with --- \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big. He is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs. He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup. \nEXT. WEST MEMPHIS -- DAY 5 \nA street anchored by project housing and littered with broken down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed. He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER. \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE This is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that Monday night game and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that day he not only altered Joe Theismann's life, but mine as well. As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS -- \nINVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here? \n(NO RESPONSE) Mr. Oher?... \nMICHAEL (V.0.) \n(CONTINUED) \n5 CONTINUED: 5 \nINVESTIGATOR'S.VOICE (V.O.) Do you know, do you understand why I'm here? \nMICHAEL (V.0.) To... investigate. \nINVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.0.) Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament. \n6 INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY 6 \nLooks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African- American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees - a nervous trait of his. \nGRANGER Do you find it odd? Your predicament? \n(NO RESPONSE) Michael?... \nMICHAEL Iono [I don't know]... Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more. \nMICHAEL (CONT'D) Can I... can I leave now? \nGRANGER \n(WITH FINALITY) No. You can't. \nBIG TONY Yeah, sure, why not. Cotton sighs, considers what to do. \nCOTTON They'd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews. \nBIG TONY I was hopin' you might just interview 'em now. \nCOTTON They're here? Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven and Michael are playing one on one basketball. \nBIG TONY The little ones Steven and the big \nONE'S -- \nCOTTON Big Mike. \nBIG TONY Yeah. That's right. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n15 EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY 15 \nFor a boy his size Michael can really move. He dribbles, fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer. Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches -- Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men aren't supposed to move like this. Cotton's lips are almost quivering -- \nCOTTON Mother of God... \n16 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE BOARD ROOM - DAY 16 \nThe Board of Admissions, eight or so men and women, are seated around a large conference table. By himself, at one end, sits Bert Cotton. \nCOTTON Are there spots available or not? PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before... \nSANDSTROM Technically, yes, in both grades. But we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms. Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable and I believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid -- Sandstrom looks through papers for the name. \nCOTTON Big Mike. \nSANDSTROM Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe, based on his record, that he would be successful here. \nCOTTON How bad could it be? Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file, which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out --- \n(CONTINUED) \n16 CONTINUED: 16 \nMRS. SMITH We're not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records. He has a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th percentile. He's been enrolled in seven different institutions, including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didn't attend school at all. He repeated first grade as well as second, there's no record of attendance in third, and in fourth grade -- \nCOTTON So they moved him ahead without going to third grade. That says something. \nMRS. SMITH \n(IGNORING COTTON) His attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero. Zero-point-six- Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and science teacher, looks to the others. \nMRS. BOSWELL Everyone passed him along - gave him D's so they could hand their problem off to the next school. \nCOTTON Brave kid. (off their confusion) For wanting to come here. For wanting a quality education. An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended. Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place. \nMRS. SMITH Coach Cotton, we understand your interest in the young man's athletic abilities. \nSANDSTROM He wouldn't be able to play until he got his grades up anyway. \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 10 \n16 CONTINUED: 16 \nCOTTON Forget sports! Look at the wall. He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: \"NEIGHBORLY, \nACADEMIC, CHRISTIAN\". \nCOTTON (CONT'D) Christian. We either take that seriously or we paint over it. You don't admit Michael Oher for sports, you admit him because it's the right thing to do. Their faces announce that he's made a point. \n17 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 17 \nFirst day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue- eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with friends they haven't seen over the summer. Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the arch. Beneath the school name we read \"WITH MEN THIS IS. POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE\". Michael takes a deep breath and enters. He carries his \"school bag\" - a plastic grocery sack. \n18 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 18 \nJust as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to the fact that he doesn't belong here. Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone. \n19 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 19 \nIt's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then... \nMRS. BOSWELL Class, this is Mike Oher and he's new here so I expect you all to make him feel welcome. (with a warm smile) Mike, take any empty seat. \n(CONTINUED) \n19 CONTINUED: 19 She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat. Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As students pass them back to others... \nMRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D) This is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum. \n(OVER GROANS) Don't worry. It won't be graded. I just want to see how much of the information we need to hit again. \nLEIGH ANNE What's so awful about our house? Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave. \n(CONTINUED) \n26 CONTINUED: 26 Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael, alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process. Picking up left-over bags of popcorn. Sean considers this for a second before leaving. \n27 INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 27 \nTeachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts. \nFIRST TEACHER (BOB) Well, the big guy's been here a month and he ain't cutting it in my class. \nSECOND TEACHER (APRIL) Why would Admissions do this? It's not fair to us or the boy. \nTHIRD TEACHER (GLENDA) Just setting him up to fail. \nBOB I don't think he has any idea what I'm teaching. \nGLENDA And how would you know if he did? He won't even talk. Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself. \nMRS. BOSWELL He writes. \nAPRIL His name. Barely. Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page. \nMRS. BOSWELL He threw this in the trash can. (reads from the page) \"I look and I see white everywhere: white walls, white floors, and a lot of white people. The teachers do not know I have no idea of anything they are talking about. I do not want to listen to anyone, especially the teachers. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n27 CONTINUED: 27 \nMRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D) They are giving homework and expecting me to do the problems on my own. I have never done homework in my life. I go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say, \"This is not Michael Oher.\" (a pause for effect) He entitled it \"White Walls.\" The room is dead quiet. \nBOB How's the spelling? Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves. \n28 INT. WINGATE - CAFETERIA -- DAY 28 \nSean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who sits by himself without a tray in front of him. \nCOTTON If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring. \nSEAN If he makes his grades. \nCOTTON But boy-hidey, just look at him. Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up. \nSEAN What did you eat for lunch today? \nMICHAEL Here in the cafeteria. \nSEAN I didn't ask where you ate, I asked what you ate. \nMICHAEL A few things. \nSEAN Do you need some money? For lunch? \n(CONTINUED) \n28 CONTINUED: 28 \nMICHAEL I don't need any. Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton. \nSEAN Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill. (off Cotton's look) He's hungry. \nCOTTON You could tell that by looking at him? \nSEAN - I didn't grow up all that different from him. At public school they \ngive you free lunch, Bert. And when food is finite, you'd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it.. \n29 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 29 \nMrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class. \nMRS. BOSWELL You'll have one hour. If you finish early put it on my desk and sit quietly. She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a decision, rises and walks over. \nMRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D) Mike, come with me. \n30 INT. WINGATE - SMALL ADJACENT ROOM - DAY 30 \nFilled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points and he sits. \nMRS. BOSWELL You can take the test back here away from everybody else. I'll sit \nin there so if there's anything you don't understand you can ask. \n(CONTINUED) \n30 CONTINUED: 30 Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat then scoots her chair over next to him. \nMRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D) Mike, how about I ask the questions and you tell me the answers or as much as you know. She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads: \n37 OMITTED 37 \nThe Blind Side -- Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 22 \n38 INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT 38 \nPretty seedy. Michael walks to a sink in the back, opens his plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash it. A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets down the magazine and walks outside. It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things. \n39 EXT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT (LATER) 39 \nMichael sits in the corner, his head resting against the window, trying to sleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n40 EXT. WINGATE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 40 \nA banner over the arch reads: THANKSGIVING PAGEANT TONIGHT! Kids in costume - Pilgrims, Indians, turkeys - race out the door to greet their proud parents. Si, in an ornate headdress looks for and spots Sean and Leigh Anne waving. They walk away together toward the parking lot. \n41-42 OMITTED 41-42 \n43 INT. SEAN'S BMW - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 43 \nAs they exit the parking lot-- \nLEIGH ANNE Turn on the heat! \nSEAN I don't know where it is. \nLEIGH ANNE It's fifteen degrees, you've had this car a month and you don't know how to turn on the heat?! (as she turns it on) What would you do without.me? \nSEAN Lots of things you'll never know about. \n(CONTINUED) \n43 CONTINUED: 43 They trade a look and a smile. Sean puts a.hand on her lap. \nSI Get a room. \nLEIGH ANNE Si, don't let this go to your head but I thought you were very convincing in the role of... uh... \nSI Indian Number Three. I tried out for the Chief but they gave it to Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I think there was some multi-cultural bias thing working. \nSEAN Or maybe they just thought he'd make a better Chief. \nSI Dad, he's like Chinese. \nLEIGH ANNE And you're Irish. If you weren't the Chief how come you got the headdress? Si hesitates a bit before -- \nSI Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of those free Quesadilla tickets. \nLEIGH ANNE \n(LAUGHS) And where does the acorn fall? \nSEAN Don't laugh too hard. The Quesadilla saved our ass. \nA44 EXT. STREET - NIGHT A44 \nSean's car stops at a red light and Michael crosses in front of them, wearing just his shorts and short sleeved shirt. \nB44 INT. SEAN'S CAR - NIGHT B44 \nLeigh Anne notices Michael -- \n(CONTINUED) \nB44 CONTINUED: B44 \nLEIGH ANNE What is he wearing? It's below freezing. What's his name again? \nSEAN AND SJ Big Mike. \nLEIGH ANNE Where's he going? She gives Sean a look. Sean rolls down his window. \nSEAN Hey, Big Mike! Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car. \nSEAN (CONT'D) Where you headin'? \nMICHAEL Gym.._. Sean nods, rolls his window back up and drives as the light turns green. \nLEIGH ANNE The gym? It's nine o'clock. No answer to this. They drive another half block,before -- \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Turn around. Sean sighs, knowing better than to argue. \n44 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 44 \nThe BMW pulls to a stop alongside Michael. Leigh Anne gets out, walks up to Michael. \nLEIGH ANNE Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You said you're going to the gym? Michael slowly nods. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) The school gym's closed. Michael takes this in but doesn't respond. \n52 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' BEDROOM - DAY 52 \nLeigh Anne enters Collins' bedroom. Very \"teenage girl\" but a mess - clothes everywhere. Leigh Anne opens the curtains throwing light into the room. \nLEIGH ANNE Up and at 'em. Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes. on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to -- \n53 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S BEDROOM - DAY 53 \nJust as messy but not all clothes. Leigh Anne almost trips on a series of wires connecting games to a large screen TV. \nLEIGH ANNE Sean Junior! She opens the shades. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Clean this place up before you come downstairs. You hear me? Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts down the stairs, almost afraid of what she'll find. \n54 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 54 \nLeigh Anne stops, stares -- The couch is totally back to normal and the sheets, blankets and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision. No sign of Michael. \nLEIGH ANNE Mike? Big Mike?! Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and moves to the window to look out. \n55 EXT. TUOHY HOUSE - DAY 55 \nMichael, plastic sack in hand, walks away. Leigh Anne exits the front door, spots Michael and tries to catch up. \nLEIGH ANNE Big Mike! \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 29 \n55 CONTINUED: 55 He stops, turns. Leigh Anne walks over. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Where are you going? \nMICHAEL Iono. \nLEIGH ANNE Are you spending Thanksgiving with your family? Michael shakes his head. \n56 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN -- DAY (LATER) 56 \nLeigh. Anne carves turkey onto a tray and takes it into... \n57 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM -- DAY 57 \nLeigh Anne sets the turkey on a serving table alongside the rest of the Tuohy Thanksgiving feast. \nLEIGH ANNE Come and get it! Sean sits at the TV,\"watching an Ole Miss football game, while SJ plays.video games on another. Collins chats on her cell. Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in. \nSEAN SJ, Ole Miss is about to score! \nSI Which means they're about to fumble. They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food. Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch. \nSEAN Looks great, hon. Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned. \nCOLLINS I see a lot of starch. SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce - creating an easy to eat sandwich. He walks away. \n(CONTINUED) \n57 CONTINUED: 57 Michael stares - he's never seen so much food. Leigh Anne hands him a plate. He gingerly puts a slice of.turkey on it. \nLEIGH ANNE As much as you want. \n(WALKS AWAY) Oh, the potato salad! With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his pants pocket and finishes filling his plate. Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room table, alone, not touching his plate. Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and playing games. She makes a decision, grabs the remote and turns off the TVs. \n58 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 58 \nThe entire family sits at the table. Rockwell would be proud. \nSI Why are we eating in here? Leigh Anne holds out her hands. \nLEIGH ANNE Shall we say grace? The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands. Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's. As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without closing his eyes, taking it all in... \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Heavenly Father. We thank you for all your many blessings on this family. We thank you for bringing us a new friend. And we ask that you look after. us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are. Amen. A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at first how to correctly use the silverware. He picks up the fork and Leigh Anne nods, \"that's right\". She eyes Michael's stained shirt. \n(CONTINUED) \n58 CONTINUED: 58 \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Big Mike, do you like to shop? (off his look) Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna have to show you how it's done. \n59 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR -- DAY 59 \nLeigh Anne drives and Michael sits shotgun. \nMICHAEL I qot clothes. \nLEIGH ANNE You \"have\" clothes.. And an extra T- shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make. He looks out the window. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Okay, fine, let's go get 'em. Just tell me where I'm going. No answer. Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb and puts it in park. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Tell me everything I need to know about you. He still stares out the window. \n(CONTINUED) \n65 CONTINUED: 65 \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) And before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself: Is this me? \nShe finds one shirt, holds it out. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) \nWhat about this? \nHe shakes his head, \"no\". \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) \n(ANOTHER SHIRT) This isn't atrocious. \nSHE He shakes his head again. After a beat he points. almost laughs. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) This one? This is the one you like? He nods, completely sure. \n66 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 66 \nDrop off area. Leigh Anne's car pulls up and SJ, Collins and Michael get out. \nLEIGH ANNE Have a great day. Learn something! They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch. Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN \nORANGE AND MAROON STRIPED RUGBY SHIRT. Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away. A car behind her HONKS. She checks the rear view mirror -- \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Don't get your panties in a wad. \n67 INT. TONY RESTAURANT - DAY 67 \nLadies who lunch. The right sort doing their thing. Leigh Anne sits at a table with three friends, BETH, ELAINE and SHERRY. They sip on lemon water and nibble at salads. \nBETH The best part about Paris was the food. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 36 \n67 CONTINUED: 67 \nBETH (CONT'D) They use sauce like we use gravy. I had to join a gym the day'we got back. \nLEIGH ANNE Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town? \nELAINE On the freeway. \nSHERRY Where exactly are you talking about? \nLEIGH ANNE Alabama Street... Hurt Village. \nBETH Hurt Village -- that sounds like a threat. \nLEIGH ANNE You're not far off. \nSHERRY It would \"hurt\" me to go there. \nELAINE It would certainly hurt your reputation to go there. \nBETH (tongue in cheek) I'm actually from there but didn't mind hard work and look where I am now. \nLEIGH ANNE Eating an eighteen dollar salad. \nBETH And it's a little soggy to be honest. \nSHERRY Such a shame. \nBETH (re: her salad) Yes it is. \n(CONTINUED) \n67 CONTINUED: 67 \nSHERRY Civil rights was responsible for some good things but those programs - building ugly, low cost housing. I mean how could you be creative if you lived there? It's stifling. \nELAINE Did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs? It's a fact. \nBETH They're not \"black\", Elaine. The term du jour is African-American. \nELAINE And what if they're from Jamaica, or like Bermuda. \nSHERRY Then they're BerMUDian-Americans. They all cringe and laugh. \nELAINE So, why are you asking about the projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one of your charities? \nBETH A project for the projects. That's catchy. Money would raise itself. (off their laughs) Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh Anne. And they laugh harder. Leigh Anne smiles, biting her lip. \nLEIGH ANNE Who was that boy you were talking to, Michael? At the restaurant. \nMICHAEL Marcus. \nLEIGH ANNE He works there? \nMICHAEL Yeah. \n(CONTINUED) \n86 CONTINUED: \nLEIGH ANNE And how do you know Marcus? \nMICHAEL He's my brother. Complete silence in the car. Leigh Anne finally breaks it -- \nLEIGH ANNE Well, I'd like to meet him someday. Would that be okay with you? \nMICHAEL I don't know where he stays. \nLEIGH ANNE When's the last time you saw him, Michael? \nMICHAEL When I was little mebbe. \n87 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nCollins sits on the floor in the hallway near a door, smiling sadly and secretly listening to --- \nLEIGH ANNE'S VOICE \"Once upon a time in Spain, there was a little bull --\" \nA88 \nA88 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME \nA strange sight. Leigh Anne, SJ and Michael all sit on Michael's huge futon as Leigh Anne reads THE STORY OF FERDINAND. No one enjoys this more than Leigh Anne... \nLEIGH ANNE \"...and his name was Ferdinand. All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers\"... \n88 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLeigh Anne and Sean sit in bed. Sean puts his book on the night stand and leans over to give Leigh Anne a kiss. He notices her smile... \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 49 \n88 CONTINUED: 88 \nSEAN What? \nLEIGH ANNE Huh? \nSEAN Why are you smiling? \nLEIGH ANNE I don't know. I'm just happy. Really happy. \nSEAN Does. this happiness have anything to do with Michael? \nLEIGH ANNE No. It has everything to do with Michael. Sean smiles, kisses her, turns off the light. She snuggles next to him and kisses the back of his neck. \nSEAN Oh... He gets the message, rolls over and kisses her on the lips. \nSEAN (CONT'D) Happy's good. As their amorous activities continue... \nLEIGH ANNE I think we should start a charity. For kids like him. \nSEAN (his mind elsewhere) Sure, okay. \nLEIGH ANNE Maybe fund a program at Wingate. \nSEAN Absolutely... \nLEIGH ANNE Are you even listening to me? \n(CONTINUED) \n88 CONTINUED: 88 \nSEAN I try to concentrate on one thing at a time. \nLEIGH ANNE You knew I was a multi-tasker when you married me. She kisses him and they roll over, laughing. \n89 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 89 \nThe Tuohy family, dressed nice, poses in front of a blue'and red artificial Christmas tree adorned ENTIRELY WITH OLE MISS ORNAMENTS. They are posing for a photograph. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Okay, big smiles everyone! FLASH! Leigh Anne smiles but notices --- Michael sitting on the couch by himself. \nLEIGH ANNE Michael! Come over here and get in the next one. Sean gives her a look like she's crazy. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) We don't have a single picture with him. (off Sean's sigh) Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna put it on the Christmas card. Michael moves in behind the family, dwarfing them. \nBETH Does Michael get the family discount at Taco Bell? Because if he does Sean's gonna lose a few stores. More laughter. \nLEIGH ANNE Look, he's a great kid. \nELAINE I say just make it official and adopt him. Big laughs at the \"crazy\" idea. \nLEIGH ANNE He'll be eighteen in a few months. (off their confusion) So, I mean it wouldn't make much sense to legally adopt him, right? They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After an awkward beat of silence... \nSHERRY Is this some kind of white guilt thing, Leigh Anne? I mean charity's the Lord's work but... \nELAINE What will your daddy say? \nLEIGH ANNE Before or after he turns over in his grave? Daddy's gone five years now, Elaine, and to make matters worse you were at the funeral. You wore Chanel with that awful black hat. Before Elaine can attack -- \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Look, here's the deal. I don't need any of y'all to approve of my choices. But I do ask you to respect them. You have no idea what this boy's been through. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n91, CONTINUED: 91 \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) And if this is going to be a running diatribe I can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home. \nSHERRY I'm so sorry, Leigh Anne. We didn't intend to -- \nELAINE No, we didn't, really -- \nBETH I mean, what you're doing is so great. To open your home to him. You're changing his life. Leigh Anne smiles to herself, realizing... \nLEIGH ANNE No. He's changing mine. \nELAINE That's awesome for you, but... what about Collins? \nLEIGH ANNE What about Collins? \nELAINE Aren't you worried, even just a little? (off Leigh Anne) I mean he is a boy, a large, black boy, sleeping under the same roof. Leigh Anne stares at them, shakes her head then grabs the \nCHECK --- \nLEIGH ANNE I've got this. (rises; to the group) Shame on you. And strides away. \n92 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' ROOM - NIGHT 92 \nCollins is reading in bed. Leigh Anne knocks, enters and sits on the edge of the bed. \n(CONTINUED) \n92 CONTINUED: \nLEIGH ANNE Be honest with me now, okay? Collins nods, having no idea what her mother is about to say. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Is Michael being here weird for you? \nCOLLINS They're stupid kids, who cares what they say. \nLEIGH ANNE What kids? \nCOLLINS At school. They're juvenile. \nLEIGH ANNE And what do the juvenile kids say? \nCOLLINS It's really not worth repeating. And don't worry about SJ - he loves the attention. He introduces Michael as his big brother. \nLEIGH ANNE What about you? \nCOLLINS It's fine. (off Leigh Anne's look) I mean, you can't just throw him out on the street. \nLEIGH ANNE I can make other arrangements. (off Collins' hesitance) Just let me know. Okay?... Leigh Anne kisses Collins goodnight. \n93 EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY \nMichael walks up to the two little Kindergarten girls from before, sitting in the swings. He smiles. They smile back. \nFIRST LITTLE GIRL Hi Mike. \n(CONTINUED) \n93 CONTINUED: 93 \nMICHAEL Hi. Need a push? They giggle and Michael pushes them, one arm each until they're flying high and squealing. \nNEARBY Collins watches. \n94 INT. WINGATE - LIBRARY - DAY 94 \nCollins is sitting with her friends, laughing and whispering. She notices Michael enter and walk to a table with a book. He sits alone while every other table is full. Collins sighs, makes up her mind and stands with her books. \nFRIEND Where are you going? Collins walks away toward Michael. \nFRIEND (CONT'D) Collins? They are aghast when they see Collins set down her books across from Michael and sit. \n(CONTINUED) \n98 CONTINUED: 98 \nMICHAEL Okay... Michael moves to the line. Si raises his whistle and blows. \n99 EXT. WINGATE PRACTICE FIELD -- DAY \nSERIES OF SHOTS - DIFFERENT DAYS: SJ holds a blocking dummy and Michael fires out, hitting the dummy and sending Si flying. Michael does ten yard \"back and forths\" as Si times him. Michael does push ups as SJ lowers himself to count. Michael does crab crawls. WIDE - SJ runs Michael through his workout.

Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else. \nMICHAEL Will you help get me something? \nLEIGH ANNE What? \nMICHAEL Driver's license. \nLEIGH ANNE Why do you need a driver's license when you don't have a car? \nMICHAEL You have a car. \n(CONTINUED) \n100 CONTINUED: \nLEIGH ANNE That I use to haul y'all all over creation with. He doesn't say anything but doesn't leave either. Leigh Anne puts down the swatches, turns to him.. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Why do you want a license, Michael? \nMICHAEL Something to carry. With my name on it. She locks eyes with him. This time he holds her gaze. \nDMV EMPLOYEE (V.0.) Address?... \n101 INT. DMV OFFICE - DAY 101 \nLeigh Anne and Michael sit across from a DMV EMPLOYEE typing on her computer.

He lives with us. \nDMV EMPLOYEE Are y'all his foster parents? \nLEIGH ANNE No. \nDMV EMPLOYEE His legal guardians? \nLEIGH ANNE oh... no. The Employee does a search on the computer. As she types... \nDMV EMPLOYEE Does he have a Social Security card? Leigh Anne looks to Michael, who shakes his head. \nDMV EMPLOYEE (CONT'D) Birth certificate? \n(CONTINUED) \n101 CONTINUED: 101 \nLEIGH ANNE We tried to find one for school, but... \nDMV.EMPLOYEE You don't know which city, which county, which hospital?... \nLEIGH ANNE How big a problem is this? DMV Employee looks to Leigh Anne. \nDMV EMPLOYEE There's nobody named Michael Oher in the system. Another last name perhaps? Leigh Anne again turns to Michael, who shrugs. \nLEIGH ANNE Look, I'll sign something saying he lives with us and we'll pay for the insurance; whatever it takes. (off her look) What's it gonna take? Off the Employee's look -- \n102 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S MASTER BATH - NIGHT 102 \nAs they get ready for bed.

And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school. \n(CONTINUED) \n102 CONTINUED: 102 \nSEAN There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone. Someone we barely know. \n104 CONTINUED: 104 \nLEIGH ANNE How many children does she have? \nRONALD At least a dozen, probably more. With her drug arrest record my guess would be she can't even remember. Leigh Anne absorbs this. \nLEIGH ANNE We'd need her permission though, .right? \nRONALD No. Michael is a ward of the state. Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it. \nLEIGH ANNE So you would give him away without even telling his mother? Ronald shrugs. \n105 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 105 \nLooks the same as before except for the'blonde woman walking between the buildings. Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted. She can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled \"C Block\" on it. \n106 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 106 \nThe one Michael visited before. Leigh Anne summons her courage and knocks on the door. And again. No answer. A VOICE comes from the apartment behind her -- \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Who you lookin' for?! Startled, Leigh Anne turns and sees Alton approaching... \nLEIGH ANNE I'm looking for Denise Oher. \nALTON Dee Dee don't stay there no more. \n(CONTINUED) \n106 CONTINUED: 106 \nLEIGH ANNE Do you know where she might be? \nALTON Chances are she ain't gone far. \n(SMILES) I seen you before.

(after a beat) When did you move from the other building? \n(CONTINUED) \n109 CONTINUED: 109 Denise emerges from the back of the apartment, adjusting a wig on her head, making herself \"presentable.\" \nDENISE OHER Awhile back. This is temporary. Friends let me stay here. \nLEIGH ANNE When did you last see Michael? \nDENISE OHER Iono. We might have some wine in the kitchen, if... \nLEIGH ANNE No, no that's very kind but... \nDENISE OHER How many foster kids you got living with you? \nLEIGH ANNE Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael. We were just helping him out. \nDENISE OHER State don't pay you nothing? \nLEIGH ANNE No. \nDENISE OHER And he lives with you? (Leigh Anne nods) And you feed him?. \n(ANOTHER NOD) Buy him clothes, too? \nLEIGH ANNE When I can find them in his size. \nDENISE OHER You a fine Christian lady. \nLEIGH ANNE I try to be. \nLEIGH ANNE I suppose they can be on the team, too. Are you going to protect the family, Michael? \nHe nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Yelling at him won't help. He doesn't trust men. In his experience they pretend to care about you 'til they disappear. Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has the video camera in his lap. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) You're gonna wanna get this. \nINTERCUT VIDEO AND LIVE ACTION: At the snap Michael drives the defender into the dirt. Michael drops back, knocks down one defender, then takes on another while Tony completes a pass. On a sweep to his side, Michael pushes three defenders away, clearing an alley for Bobby to blast through. \nBert shakes his head, turns to Leigh Anne -- \nCOTTON What'd you say to him? \n(CONTINUED) \n120 CONTINUED: \nLEIGH ANNE You should get to know your \nplayers, Bert. He tested 98 percent in protective instincts. \n(off Bert's look) I told you you.could thank me later. (a beat for effect) \nIt's later, Bert! \nCOTTON \n(BY ROTE) Thank you, Leigh Anne. \n121 EXT.

WINGATE - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT \nCoach Cotton is addressing his team before the game. \nCOTTON On the schedule it says this is a home game but don't be deceived, gentlemen. Three fourths of the people in the stands are here from Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your helmets on 'til you're on the sidelines. I don't want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey bottle. \n(BEAT) Grab a knee. And the team huddles for their prayer... \n(CONTINUED) \n122 CONTINUED: \nCOTTON (CONT'D) For we can... (team repeats each phrase) Do all things... Through Jesus Christ... Who strengthens us... Each and every day... \nAnd may God... Bless the Crusaders! As they rise to leave-- \nCOTTON (CONT'D) Oh, one more thing. The reason Milford traveled all that way to come here is they expect to whup your ass. Whup your ass and have a party in your house. Whup your ass, have a party in your house and piss on your mama's new couch. Is that gonna happen? The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s. \n123 EXT. WINGATE - EDGE OF STANDS - NIGHT 123 \nAs the Wingate Crusaders exit the dressing room they find themselves next to the Milford Lions ready to take the field. The cocky Milford players eye the Crusaders. \nMILFORD PLAYER \nHey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn the other cheek or just bend over?! Another Milford player, #66, spots Michael. \nMILFORD #66 Would y'all look at the size of that buck! \nMilford takes the field. Jay Collis, to Michael... \nJAY COLLIS Pay 'em back on the field. Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to squeeze through an entrance onto the field.

They got a big ole' black bear playing for 'em! What is this, a circus?! \nIN THE STANDS \nLeigh Anne, Sean and SJ cheer as Wingate runs onto the field. A chorus of BOOS comes from the stands behind them. \nMILFORD DAD (CONT'D) There's the Lions and here come the Christians! SJ turns and gives a dirty look -- \nLEIGH ANNE SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and stones... \nON THE FIELD \nThe ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty. \nCOTTON Let's go 0! The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford defense waits, slapping each other and building to a frenzy. Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side. Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him. \nTONY Coach called a pass. \nMICHAEL Gap. \nAT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE As Wingate lines up, 66 is at it again. \nMILFORD #66 Your coach always do your fightin' for you? He your Massa?- Michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers forward. We've never seen him so quick, neither has 66 who dips a hip to keep from being plowed over. The ploy rights 66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him \"in the fit\" grabbing his jersey, \"between the tits.\" -- Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary -- Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a toe to the ground like a ballerina -- Bobby cuts to the sideline -- Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going past the sideline-- Past Collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while -- Bobby makes the opposite corner and heads for the end zone --- \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Yellow Draft 04/15/09 87 \n124 CONTINUED: 124 Si is on his feet, filming Michael -- Michael keeps going, past the track and toward the fence separating the field from the parking lot -- Just as Bobby races into the end zone -- Michael chucks 66 into the air. 66 hits the fence hard and lands in a heap. Michael turns and walks back to the field. As he passes Collins she gives him a high five. \nCOLLINS Way to go big bro! A referee signals touchdown then notices Michael walking back and 66 lying slumped at the fence. The Ref throws a flag. \nCOTTON Now what?! Was he holding? \nREFEREE Uh, no. \nCOTTON Did he hit after the whistle? \nREFEREE I don't believe so. \nCOTTON Then what's the flag for? \nREFEREE I dunno... . Excessive blocking. \nCOTTON You're kidding me. The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the penalty. 66, now on his feet, limps back onto the field. Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt. Cotton walks up to Michael. \nMICHAEL Sorry, Coach. I stopped when I heard the whistle. \n(CONTINUED) \n124 CONTINUED: \nCOTTON Where were you taking him, Mike? \nMICHAEL To the bus. It was time for him to go home. Cotton smiles proudly and slaps Michael on the ass. \nCOTTON Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy! \nIN THE STANDS \nLeigh Anne stands and turns to face the Milford fans \nLEIGH ANNE See number seventy-four? Well, that's MY son.! The Milford fans don't know what to make of this. Leigh Anne sits down with a self-satisfied smile. \nON THE FIELD - A SEQUENCE: Tony throws a touchdown pass -- 66 submarines and Michael pushes him down with one hand -- Bobby is off to the races with a screen pass. Touchdown! --- And another touchdown -- Scoreboard reads: VISITORS 7 HOME 35 66 limps off the field, shamed and another player takes his place. The SCRUB, terrified, looks to Michael.

TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S ROOM - DAY \nSi has the video of Michael up on his computer. A \"burned DVD\" pops out and SJ puts it in a distinctive case. \n126 INT.

An ASSISTANT hurries up. \nASSISTANT Have you filled all the slots for the Army All Star Game? \nTOM LEMMING Yeah, why? The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL \nOHER - THE TERMINATOR! \nASSISTANT You might want to open one up. \n127 EXT. SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 127 \nLemming walks along with Sean and Coach Cotton toward Sean's \noffice. \nTOM LEMMING Every year there are a dozen running backs in the high school ranks who will make it to the NFL. Quarterbacks maybe three or four. But left tackles, true left tackles, they're freaks, gifts from the gods. A great one only comes around every four or five years. Mike's the best I've seen in ten. \n(CONTINUED) \n127 CONTINUED: 127 \nCOTTON You're kidding? \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 93 \n138 CONTINUED: 138 She strides toward the football practice field. \n139 EXT.

They chat and watch as the Wingate football team finishes calisthenics. One ASSISTANT COACH, from. Southern Miss, sees Fulmer racing up. \nSOUTHERN MISS COACH Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might as well go home. Fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches, shakes a few-hands. \nFULMER Drove all the way from Knoxville to come see for myself. Leigh Anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro \nCLEMSON ASSISTANT COACH Heck, I drove from Clemson, that's nine hours! Bert cotton walks over, shakes Fulmer's hand, leaving the other coaches shaking their heads. \nCOTTON Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor. \nFULMER Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye on your program. Y'all doing a fine job down here. Wouldn't be a bit surprised to see you coaching at the next level real soon. Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot. \nFULMER (CONT`D) Is that him? Is that O'Hair? \nLEIGH ANNE It's Oher. Like a paddle in a boat. Fulmer notices Leigh Anne, grunts then turns back to Cotton. \n(CONTINUED) \n139 CONTINUED: 139 \nFULMER If you could run him through a few drills, we'd sure appreciate it.. .Cotton gives Leigh Anne a look that says, \"get out of here.\" She shakes her head -- \"I'm not going anywhere.\" Cotton blows his whistle and the team approaches. \nCOTTON \nBoard drill. Big Mike and Jay \nCollis. Best on best. An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael slowly moves into position opposite him. The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see. Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives her a look that says,,\"Who the hell are you?\" Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in \nan instant. Collis is pancaked under Michael, who gets up and offers a hand. The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle. \nFULMER (almost to himself) Force equals mass times acceleration. Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and start poking digits and jabbering: \"You won't believe it!\" \"You gotta see this!\" \"He's a freak of nature!\" The Clemson coach strides away. \nCOTTON Where are you going, Coach? \nCLEMSON COACH Back to South Carolina. I've seen more than enough. If he can qualify with his grades you tell Michael Oher that Clemson wants him. \nFULMER Good luck with that, Brad! Fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at Michael. \n(CONTINUED) \n139 CONTINUED: 139 Leigh Anne watches him watch Michael. \n140 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 140 \nLeigh Anne, distressed, has books and pamphlets spread out in front of her. Sean walks in, takes in the sight. \nLEIGH ANNE Did you know that to be eligible for a Division One scholarship Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA? \nSEAN Really? \nLEIGH ANNE His ACT is low and I don't see him doing any better if he retakes it. \nSEAN What's his GPA now? \nLEIGH ANNE \nSEAN Not bad really, when you consider where he started. \nLEIGH ANNE He needs to make A's this year. (off Sean's laugh) I'm serious. And that might not even be enough. \nSEAN So he goes to Junior College. \nLEIGH ANNE Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in a year. His shot at the pros would go out the window. \nSEAN Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna get college offers? She walks over to the answering machine, presses \"Play.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nThe Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 96 \n140 CONTINUED: 140 \nON THE MACHINE Hello, my name is Nick Saban and I'm the head football coach at Louisiana State University...

But none of it matters unless he makes his grades. \nLEIGH ANNE It breaks my heart but they're still in the hunt. Fulmer offered SJ a sweet deal. \nED ORGERON I hear the kid can really pepper the gumbo. \nLEIGH ANNE He's his daddy's boy. \n163 INT.. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (LATER) 163 \nOrgeron sits with Michael and SJ. \nED ORGERON You a Ole Miss tackle, son. I'm buildin' my line, buildin' my team aroun' you. Make your parents proud, come to Oxford, get that sheepskin and help us win the SEC. Michael nods, turns to SJ. Before SJ can raise his hand -- \nED ORGERON (CONT'D) And for you, Si, here's what I can do. At Ole Miss we have The Grove by the stadium. And the team walks it before the game, surrounded by thousands of fans. It's a sacred ritual. And I'm in front. \nSI (\"that's it?\") Seen it a thousand times. \nED ORGERON Ever seen it from the front of the line? Next year, you and me -- leading the team. \nSI Tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin. \nED ORGERON I'll throw in a sideline pass. Si considers this, smiles and nods. \n164 INT. WINGATE - LIBRARY -- DAY 164 \nA press conference is under way.

What's he gonna have to do to \"deserve\" that? \nBOB Right now Michael's doing C minus, D plus work. His best chance at improving is with the written essay at the end of the year. It counts for a third of his grade. \nLEIGH ANNE That's it. We're sunk. \n167 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 167 \nMiss Sue works with Michael at the table. \nMISS SUE Why not write about \"Great Expectations\"? You're a lot like Pip. He was poor, an orphan and someone sort of found him. You should be able to relate to that. Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball. \nMISS SUE (CONT'D) Fine, let's go through the reading list. But you have to pick one, Michael.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson is writing about Ole Miss-LSU. \nMICHAEL You're kidding? \nSEAN No. It's a great story. \nMISS SUE It's a poem. \nSEAN \"Forward the Light Brigade!\" That's like the offense. \"Charge for the guns'he said.\" That's the end zone. \"Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred.\" He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed. \nSEAN (CONT'D) \"Forward the Light Brigade!

He takes a moment, looks right at Sean. \nMICHAEL They all gonna die, aren't they? \nLEIGH ANNE Excuse me young man, but I think I need a proper hug. He smiles and moves to her.

Michael starts rubbing his knees, nervous as hell. \nLEIGH ANNE Michael, I'll be outside. Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last look before she leaves. \n186 EXT. BUILDING - DAY 186 \nLeigh Anne sits on a bench, talking on the phone. \nLEIGH ANNE I've got a bad feeling about this, Sean. This broad is tough. Oh,. Susie's on the other line. \n(CLICKS OVER) Hey... . what does the client want?... But that's tacky... You know what, fine, if she wants her living room to look like a bordello make it happen.

(no response from Michael) Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian went to Ole Miss. \nMICHAEL He played basketball. \nGRANGER And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as well. \nMICHAEL She was a cheerleader. \nGRANGER Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is their favorite school? \n(MICHAEL NODS) Do they like any other Universities? \n(MICHAEL SHRUGS) What about, say Tennessee? \nMICHAEL They can't stand Tennessee. \nGRANGER So they wouldn't be happy if you chose to play football there? \nMICHAEL No. \nGRANGER And your tutor... \n(CONTINUED) \n187 CONTINUED: 187 \nMICHAEL Miss Sue. \nGRANGER Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too. \n(MICHAEL NODS) Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to attend Ole Miss? \n(MICHAEL NODS) Did you know that the Tuohys make generous donations to Ole Miss? That even Miss Sue makes donations? That the:Tuohy's have a condo in Oxford so they can attend as many athletic events as possible? That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy are by our definition \"boosters.\" \nMICHAEL What's that mean? \nMICHAEL I'm not stupid! He turns and walks away. \nLEIGH ANNE Michael?!

(off Sean's look) What he said about us? \nSEAN Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts. We gave him a bed. To hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) \nA191 CONTINUED: A191 \nLEIGH ANNE What about the rest of it - all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship? A scholarship to Ole Miss. \nSEAN He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that. \nLEIGH ANNE Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I know for sure I never did. Sean considers this, then beckons. \nSEAN Come here, honey. She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her forehead. \nLEIGH ANNE Am I a good person? (off his look) Not a joke. Not rhetorical. \nSEAN You're the best person I know. Everything you do, you do for others. \nLEIGH ANNE Why is that? \nSEAN (with a smile) I have not a clue. You obviously get some sick satisfaction from it. She looks at him. There's truth in his words. \nLEIGH ANNE Sean... what if he never comes back? \n191 EXT.

I heard you playin' some ball. \nMICHAEL Yeah. \nALTON But you know that rich kid football ain't like the public school league. People packing knives in their socks.

CURB - DAY 202 \nLeigh Anne sits on the curb with Michael. \nLEIGH ANNE I'd imagine the last thing anybody at Hurt Village wants is cops snooping around. (after a beat) I swore I'd never ask but... how'd you make it out of there, Michael? \nMICHAEL When I was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n202 CONTINUED: 202 \nMICHAEL (CONT'D) She was tryin' to keep me from seeing her do drugs or other bad things. And she'd say, \"keep 'em closed till I say so.\" And then when she was finished or the bad things were over she'd say, \"now when I count to three, you open your eyes and the past is gone, the world is a good place, and it's all gonna be okay.\" \nLEIGH ANNE You closed your eyes. He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare out at the street, then... \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) You know, when I was driving all over Kingdom Come looking for you I just kept thinking about one thing. \n(BEAT) Ferdinand the bull. Everyone assumed because he was big that he wanted to fight in the ring. But he just wanted to sit under a tree and smell the flowers. (right at him) I know I should have asked this a long time ago but do you even wanna play football? I mean, do you even like it?' Michael considers this. \nMICHAEL I'm pretty good at it. \nLEIGH ANNE Yeah, you are. \n(A BEAT) Sean and I have been talking and Michael, if you're gonna accept a football scholarship we think it should be from Tennessee. (off his look) And I promise you I will be at every game cheering for you. \nMICHAEL Every game? \n(CONTINUED) \n202 CONTINUED: 202 \nLEIGH ANNE But I will not wear that gaudy orange of theirs because it's not in my color wheel. \nMICHAEL You want me to go to Tennessee? \nLEIGH ANNE I want you to go wherever you want. It's your decision, Michael. It's your life. \nMICHAEL What if I wanted to flip burgers? She takes this in, swallows hard and \nLEIGH ANNE Your decision; your life.

You never asked why I wanted to go there. \nGRANGER Alright, fine, Michael... why do you want to go to Ole Miss? \nMICHAEL It's where my family goes to school. It's where they've always gone to school. Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just almost, smiles. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n204 EXT.

Alarm clock. Bed. Sean says a lot of pro athletes use futons if they can't find a big enough bed. Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Well, try it out. See if it feels okay. He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it. \n(CONTINUED) \n71 CONTINUED: 71 \nMICHAEL It's mine? \nLEIGH ANNE Yeah.

WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 114 \nStudents seated, including Michael, listen to Bob, who stands at the front of the classroom. \nBOB You are now seniors. Congratulations. But with that distinction comes responsibility. This will be one of your tougher courses because my job is to prepare you, at least most of you, for the rigors of college Freshman English. You are each holding a class study guide which details assignments. I won't remind you what is due and when. Read the materials and come prepared. At the end of the year you will each choose one of our literature assignments and present a written dissection of the piece. The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course. \n115 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 115 \nDozens of.condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the table. SJ has the football playbook open and is explaining formations to Michael. \nSI See, you're the ketchup, here at Left Tackle. On the weakside. \nMICHAEL I'm not that weak, SJ. \nSI it just means there are more blockers on the other side. It's a compliment, really. \nMICHAEL A compliment for a condiment. \nSJ \n(CHUCKLES) Good one. (back to work) So the first play is simple. \"Gap.\" It just means you block whoever is in front of you, or the person on your inside shoulder if you're not covered by a defender. (points to condiments) I'll be the running back and you show me what you're supposed to do. Ready... . Hike! SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then \"hands off\" to Cinnamon who \"runs\" toward Michael (Ketchup). Michael moves the bottle forward, pushing back Mustard, then Relish, as well as toppling a bottle of Vanilla Extract. \nSJ (CONT'D) Open lane to the end zone. All there is to it.

Michael got moved to offense.. \nLEIGH ANNE Well, when you're finished, put the players back in the spice cabinet. \nSJ No problem. Actually, Mom, we were waiting for you. The new Madden came out and me and Michael want to go get it. \nLEIGH ANNE Honey, I've got a meeting in ten minutes. \nMICHAEL I'll drive. off her look -- \n116 INT. MICHAEL'S TRUCK - DAY 116 \nMichael drives while SJ searches for music on the radio. \nSI Look for Walker Street. That's where we take a left. Si finds a hip-hop station and they both groove to the beat, dancing in the seats. \nSJ (CONT`D) That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

She passes stopped cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to: \nTHE COLLISION INTERSECTION As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end is smashed -- The Van - its side caved in -- And -- Michael sitting on the curb, crying. She races over -- \nLEIGH ANNE Michael! He looks up, sobbing. \nMICHAEL I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry! \nLEIGH ANNE Where's SJ?! \nMICHAEL \n", "test2_true": "SI Mom, do you think the blood will come out of my shirt? \n(CONTINUED) \n119 CONTINUED: \nLEIGH ANNE AND PARAMEDIC - MINUTES LATER \nWhile the paramedics attend to an obviously fine SJ, Leigh Anne and a FIREMAN eye the deflated airbag. \nFIREMAN An airbag deploys at 200 miles per hour. Your son's too small to sit in the front seat. \nLEIGH ANNE He's okay, though, right? \nFIREMAN Busted lip, some facial bruising. \nWhen an airbag strikes a child his size it usually means a fractured face, a broken neck or worse. It's almost like the airbag started at him then changed direction. Defective or something. Very, very lucky. Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down. \nLEIGH ANNE Michael, it wasn't your fault. It could have happened to anybody.. He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices -- HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the way up to the sleeve, which is also singed. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Michael, your arm... what happened? He looks up and into her eyes... \nMICHAEL I stopped it. \n120 EXT. WINGATE - STANDS/PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nSJ sits in the stands videotaping -- [NOTE: We integrate SJ's video with live action].

Michael backpedals. When the Defender tries. to go around him, Michael grabs him.with one big paw and throws him to the ground. A WHISTLE BLOWS. \nCOTTON Holding - left tackle! He gets right in Michael's face, grabs his jersey. \nCOTTON (CONT'D) You can only grab in here -- at the tits, you got it?! You grab out here or here, we're gonna get flagged and I'm gonna get pissed. Leigh Anne grimaces, shakes her head. \nNEXT PLAY At the snap of the ball Michael tries to pass protect, pushes the Defender who tries left, right, then slides past Michael and sacks the quarterback. \nCOTTON (CONT'D) Move your feet, son! Keep 'em moving! Back to the huddle! Cotton addresses an ASSISTANT COACH... \nCOTTON (CONT'D) Well at least he'll look good coming off the bus. The other team will be terrified 'til they realize he's a marshmallow. \n(CONTINUED) \n120 CONTINUED: As they chuckle, Leigh Anne strides past, onto the field. \nLEIGH ANNE Gimme a minute, Bert. \nCOTTON We're in the middle of practice, Leigh Anne! \nLEIGH ANNE You can thank me later. Bert just watches as Leigh Anne walks straight to the huddle and pulls Michael aside. The other players turn to watch. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Do you remember just after we met, and we went to that horrible part of town to buy you those dreadful clothes? \n(HE NODS) And I was a little scared and you told me not to worry, that you had my back?. Do you remember that? \nMICHAEL Yes ma'am. \nLEIGH ANNE If anyone tried to get to me you would have stopped them, right? \n(HE NODS) And when you and Si were in that car wreck, what did you do to that airbag? \nMICHAEL I stopped it. Leigh Anne points to the offense. \nLEIGH ANNE This team is your family. And you have to protect them -- (points to defense) --from those guys. She walks over and grabs the QB, pulls him out. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Tony is your quarterback. You protect his blindside. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n120 CONTINUED: \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) When you look at him, think of me. How you have my back. How you have his. She grabs BOBBY, a short stump of a running back. \nLEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) oomaloompah here is your tailback. When you look at him think of SJ and how you'd never let anything or anyone hurt him. Do you understand me? \nMICHAEL What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins? \n", "test2_id": 733, "test3_input": "SEAN Who'd a thought we'd have a black son before we knew a Democrat. \n144-145 OMITTED 144-145 \n146 INT.

Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand. \nSI Can I ask a question? \nSABAN Sure. \nSJ My brother and me are very close. I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so... \nSABAN Go on. \nSI I guess I was just wondering how much access I'd have to him. Saban smiles at the kid's moxie. \nSABAN Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes to LSU I'll get you an all-access pass.

Not at the academic level of Ole Miss but they do have an outstanding science department. You know one of the things they're famous for? (he shakes his head) They work with the FBI to study the effects of the soil on decomposing body parts. Michael is a bit lost. \nMISS SUE (CONT'D) When they find a body the police want to know how long they've been dead. The fine department at Tennessee helps them. They have lots of body parts - arms, legs, hands - from hospitals and medical schools. Do you know where they store them? (Michael shakes his head) Right underneath the football field. Michael's eyes widen a bit. \nMISS SUE (CONT'D) So, while it's fine and dandy to have 100,000 fans cheering for you, the bodies you should be worried about are right underneath the turf. Set to poke up through the ground and grab you. She raises a clawed hand (think \"CARRIE\") to make her point.

Ole Miss is my dream job. \nLEIGH ANNE Coach 0, you're coming a little late to the party but we're diehard Rebels so I'm gonna give you a frickin' road map, okay? \nED ORGERON Yes 'm. \nLEIGH ANNE LSU is out. Everybody knows Saban's going to the NFL. So when he comes for his visit to Ole Miss, don't take him to some titty bar and give him tequila shots. He'll have nightmares for weeks. Feed him Italian - he likes Fettucine Alfredo - take him to a movie - but not Chainsaw massacre because he'll just cover his eyes - and put him to bed by ten. You got it? \nED ORGERON Yes'm. What about Tennessee? \n", "test3_id": 734}

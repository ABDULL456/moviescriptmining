Blaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down: 
THEIR POV: We can see the main compound of the quarry from here. Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse. 
NOMI You think she's in there? Blaze nods. 
NOMI (CONT'D) Then let's go -- Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back. 
BLAZE No. We'll wait. 
(POINTEDLY) Dawn's less than an hour away. 
NOMI (taking out her gun) You wait. I'm heading in. 
BLAZE Look, they're not going anywhere. 
NOMI You don't know that. This is probably the best chance we'll get. They're sitting ducks. We can do this if you -- 
BLAZE If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their spirits? 
(DRAWING CLOSER) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE (CONT'D) You still get it, do you? The Ghost Rider whales on whoever's got it coming, but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to remember their faces. And I Lb remember them. Every last one. Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES. Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up the service road on ratted-out Harleys. 
NOMI They know we're coming, don't they? Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him. 
NOMI (CONT'D) I'm going in. You with me or not? 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Landsdale opens the main gate. The bikers THUNDER into the compound -- low-rent Hell's Angel types culled form the shallow end of the gene pool known as the Gray Gargoyles. ARLO SKINNER, the Gargoyle's CEO, climbs off his hog, adjusts his nut-sack. As he approaches Landsdale. GUNT and CHESTER PULSIFER, his identical twin lieutenants, fall in behind. 
ARLO Brotherman. 
LANDSDALE Arlo. 
ARLO 
(GRINNING) I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers, Chester and Gunt? 
EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT 
Blaze and Nomi scramble over a fence, then drop down, crouch- running to avoid a security camera. They hug the shadows. At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging around, shooting the shit. 
BLAZE I'll find her. You stay here. Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAZE (CONT'D) If things go South and the Ghost Rider takes over, I can't guarantee he won't -- 
NOMI I know. I'm on my own. (beat, more plaintive now) , Just bring her back to me. That's all I care about. 
BLAZE 
(NODDING) Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires --- Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto the ground. 
BLAZE (CONT'D) 
(CHAGRINED) -- or you could do that. As Blaze creeps away: 
NOMI 
BLAZE -- (as he turns back) Whatever happens -- 
BLAZE You're welcome. Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes.

{"test1_input": "LARRY CROWNE \nWritten by \nTom Hanks \nFrom a story by \nTom Hanks & Nia Vardalos \nNov. 2009 \nFADE IN \nSUNRISE \nBig and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as promising as, well, this new day... Sun is rising over... \nA flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse. A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with... HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building. In fact this kind of building... A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy... \nPARKING LOT \nEmpty thus far. A few EMPLOYEE autos arriving in their assigned slots far from the entrance. One of those cars is a old, not so vintage nor classic convertible... KARMANN GHIA -- Belonging to... \nLARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that rising sun. \nActually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and Company Polo. \nLarry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the cover into place. \nHe doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount. He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and squeezing shoulders... \nDOROTHY GENKOS (PRE-LAP) A seven-speed Mix-o-Meter Food Processor! $21.69! \nAVERY (PRE-LAP) Sweatpants! Two pair! $6.69! \nINT. UNIMART - DAY \nThe morning Circle of Sales! Employees and their wares. Larry stands, yet to speak, ready for his moment of pronounced enthusiasm... \nTEAM LEADER #1 Fifteen foot jumper cables - 69 cents a foot! \nTEAM LEADER #2 Chocolate turtles! 69 cents a pound bag! Go, Larry! Wave that merchandise! \nLARRY CROWNE Three-pack of men's elastic waist mid-thigh boxer shorts! $2.69! \nFREEZE! \nWords fill the screen. \nTHIS IS LARRY CROWNE \nHold. Hold. Hold. AND...CONTINUE. \nALVAREZ (TEAM LEADER) Four Toby Jug beer steins - $2.69! \nTEAM LEADER #3 MP3 Player the size of a bottle cap! Something and 69 cents! \nTEAM LEADER #4 Duck Blind print sheets for a queen size bed. $7.69. \nALL Shop UniMart! Where United, you save! Larry Crowne leads the High Fives. \nMENSWEAR DEPT - LATER \nLarry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle Map... stacking a mountain of tube socks... stocking those briefs ... hanging \"Metallica\" Speedos on little hangers... helping CUBBY - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor - clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again. \nMOMMY Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug! \nLARRY CROWNE They do love the comfort food. Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug... Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done... \nEXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - LATER \nLarry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart pen like a Trail Boss... \nLATER \nThat same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up- chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up. A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the Handicapped Space. \nLARRY CROWNE \nBuddy. Park there and you'll get a ticket. \nPIZZA KID Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds. (a dozen pizza boxes) You guys having a party? \n", "test1_true": "The BIG STORK PIZZA BOXES have been raided for slices. \nA RETIREMENT PARTY is going on. A SIGN reads \"Good Luck Dorothy Genkos!\" The name has been printed over the last person to retire. People are cutting loose as best they can at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete. None more than Larry. Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady. This is a fun group. Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: COX, STRANG, ANDREWS and HURLEY (Female). \nSTRANG Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two- K a year are history. Who else would do us that favor? \nANDREWS Wish they'd all sail off like her. Save us some grief. \nSTRANG The \"R\" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place. Hurley is shocked! \nHURLEY \"R-Bomb\"? Oh my god! Restructuring? \nCOX Separating the chaff from the wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff, right? \nHURLEY \nChaff is the waste matter, correct. \nWhen are we restructuring? \nCOX Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders. Hurley looks sick. She hates this. \nSTRANG What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd? \nANDREWS How? \nSTRANG Firing someone. \nCOX Someone they'd never expect to be let go. To look fair. I like it. \nSTRANG Like a Team Leader. \nHURLEY Team Leader? \nSTRANG \nCOX Suggestions on who it should be? \nSTRANG I say Crowne. \nHURLEY Larry Crowne? Strang rolls his eyes. \nSTRANG Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit. AVERY - Old. Black. Happy. \nSTRANG (CONT'D) Alvarez is about to drop a kid. She'll go part time in a week. ALVAREZ - Heavy with child. \nSTRANG (CONT'D) \nCrowne's pink slip will save 'da \n\"U\" big green backwash. \nCOX What Salary Tier is Crowne at? \nANDREWS Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year. \nCOX Sweet. We'll need Actionable Cause, of course. They all agree: \"Yeah. Sure. Of course...\" \nCOX (CONT'D) How's his review record? \nHURLEY He's a candidate for Employee of the Month. His 22nd time. \nCOX Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a reason... Larry has organized a Limbo Contest. \nHURLEY We could use the Limited Horizons strategy. \n(EXPLAINING) Larry will always be passed over for Management. He never went to college. \nCOX You're that familiar with his record? \nSTRANG She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick? \nHURLEY That was before the New Employee Covenants. That you even remember... \nSTRANG The memory haunts me. \nANDREWS \nHe'll sock us for severance. \nSTRANG Big brick in the pond, though. \n", "test1_id": 774, "test2_input": "P.O.V. \nStan has broken down much of Larry's bike using Lamarr's tools. Lamarr is standing over him, pointing out what he thinks needs to be done. Stan is ignoring him. \nDELL GORDO (CONT'D) Let's go lift iron, Monkey. It's a shoulders and arms day \n(MORE) \nDELL GORDO (CONT'D) Lance, raise your right hand and say something patriotic. Larry does, just for fun. \nLARRY CROWNE 'We'll be right back after these messages.' \nDELL GORDO You're in the Street Patrol. A full-time mission for beauty and justice. Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips -- no romance at all, but still... \nTALIA That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear. She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers. \nDELL GORDO \nLance. All men fall in love with \nTalia. You will too, if you haven't already. But I love her the most. Know that right now. \nLARRY CROWNE Capice. \nDELL GORDO Seriously. Don't make me keep my eyes on you. What's your real name? \nLARRY CROWNE L rry. \nDELL GORDO Mine's Don. Shake hands. \n(EXPLAINING HOW) Look each other in the eyes. Firm grips. No contest, but firm. Hold. Stack it. \n(THEN) One word, Lance. Peace. \nLARRY CROWNE Peace indeed. \nEXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MORNING \nNEIGHBORHOOD KIDS are in school uniforms, heading to the bus stop. Dressed for school as well, Larry kick starts his scooter, now a humming bit of mechanical perfection. \nLARRY CROWNE Speck-tack-alar. He peels out, on his way to school. \nEXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW \nLamarr, and his percolator, give Larry a wave. \nEXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - DAY \nLarry walks to Speech 217 like any other student. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (OVERLAPPING) Even business can break down into a Shakespearean Five-Act Structure! \nINT. SPEECH 217- LATER \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH is a former student of Mercedes with \nbraces on her teeth. Her name is printed in perfect block letters behind her on the board. She is giving a polished, well-prepared \"off the cuff\" presentation: DYNAMIC SEMINARS \nPRESENTS: SHAKESPEAREAN ECONOMICS. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Act I: Inventory. What do you sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of accounting. Receivable. Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward planning. Plan to grow. Act Five? Final Profitability. What do you clear on bottom-line? \n(THEN) In other words: \"To be or not to be... in Business.\" It's all nonsense, but it looks nice in PowerPoint form. \nLarry is taking notes. \nCalimeris has drawn her Pyramid of ideas. Mack sleeps with his head straight up. \nPinedo is listening intently, counting the ideas out on her hands. Dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D) For business, social, and self- improvement workshops, email me: Francestaylor-briegh@dynasem.com. Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her classroom. She is preoccupied. The applause for the speaker jolts her. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) White, Siler and Koss, you are up \nnext time. \n(THEN) You did good, Fran. Thanks. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in Frances Taylor-Briegh. \n(THEN) I used you as a Focal Reference but you weren't there for me. What's wrong, Mercy? Mercedes signals Frances: \"Not yet\", then points to Larry, still finishing up his notes. \n", "test2_true": "(WHISPERING) I broke up with the Orthodontist. Now I have to get a new boyfriend and a new orthodontist. You ever do that? Get crushes on people you see every day after ignoring them and then find out they're creeps after all? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Mr Crowne? Can you move along \nLARRY CROWNE That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Super. \nLARRY CROWNE Smart stuff. Super smart. The women watch him go. As soon as he's out the door: \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going on? \nMERCEDES TAINOT When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation? \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Mercy. You're an idol to me. Hearing you talk like that is \ncrushing my dreams. \nMercy wants to take it back. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Well I'm joking of course!!! She pretends to laugh. A little too much. \nINT. ECON. 1 - LATER \nDr. Matsutani is diagramming on the board. \nDR. MATSUTANI If the balance on Axis A is the same metric as Axis B you're in deficits because of overhead, taxes, and re-investment. \n(THEN) Translation? Ms. Francesco? \nTALIA Something complicated. \nDR. MATSUTANI Ms. Pinedo? \nDR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) Mr. Crowne? \nLARRY CROWNE Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. Talia is amused while sizing him up, from shoe to collar. Bad shirt... pleated pants, too short... running shoes. \nDR. MATSUTANI Someone's been reading my book. \n(THEN) The Break Even Paradox creates a new metric... Talia makes a decision and palms her phone, punching in a text. In a second, Larry's phone vibrates. He struggles to get it before he gets caught with his mobile on. TALIA: \"Scoot? You/me?\" \nLarry nods at Talia. \nTurning back, Dr. Matsutani is there again. Larry hands him his mobile phone again. \nPalm out again. DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D) \nI am growing tired of this game, Mr. Crowne. Aren't you? \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nLarry and Talia. Scooting along like Elvis and Ann-Margret in Viva Las Vegas. \nEXT. SQUARE HOLE SELF-STORAGE - LATER \nThey swing into the complex. \nEXT. SQUARE HOLE NO. 114 - SAME \nTalia is unlocking the grate. \nLARRY CROWNE So what happens here? \nTALIA You ready? Re-invention Big Boy \nLARRY CROWNE I have no idea what that means, but you betcha. \nINT. SQUARE HOLE NO. 114 - SAME \nPitch black as the grate rolls up and open, revealing Talia, Larry and their parked scooters. \nLARRY CROWNE Holy smokes! The place is crammed with vintage clothes. Racks and boxes and stacks of every fashion. \nLARRY CROWNE (CONT D) You got inventory. She disappears in the back, rummaging around. \nTALIA I started in the smallest unit. \nLARRY CROWNE \nThis is just sitting here? Talia! This is unproductive capital! Sell it on eBay. \n", "test2_id": 775, "test3_input": "FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP) \nSo. You're a mess. \nINT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME \nThey sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Yep. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right? At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee. Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus. \nPERRY Ladies. Bring an appetite? \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie. Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat. \nPERRY \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH No Key Lime? \nPERRY Cream pies I got. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Boston Cream? \nPERRY Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Phooey. Peach. Peach pie. \nPERRY Ma'am? \nMERCEDES TAINOT I'll have the French Toast. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH French Toast? \nMERCEDES TAINOT \n(on the menu) Breakfast all day. Perry leaves to put in the order. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) You won't believe how far I fell on the Hooch-o-meter. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH I have seen it happen a time or two. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I kissed a boy. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH When, third grade? \nMERCEDES TAINOT One of my students. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH You Hoor. \n(THEN) Gimme the friggin' details! He's not a minor is he? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Older than me. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down? \nMERCEDES TAINOT He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH He a fireman who bakes bread? \nMERCEDES TAINOT I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Bold. Who is he? \nKITCHEN \nPerry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook. \nPERRY \nYou're slipping, Larry. \n(THE TOAST) Lady says it's not French Toast as she knows it. \nLARRY CROWNE She's insane. \nPERRY Take it up with her. Larry heads out of the kitchen. \nPERRY (CONT'D) No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment. \nBOOTH \nHere comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes. \n", "test3_true": "MERCEDES TAINOT \nKnock Larry over with a feather. \nLARRY CROWNE Mrs. Tainot. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH \n(TO MERCEDES) The student of yours!? \nMERCEDES TAINOT This is Larry Crowne. \nLARRY CROWNE There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast. \nMERCEDES TAINOT It was fine, actually. \n(THEN) I wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there. And say, howdy. Howdy doody. During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of Larry -- to find out how he smells. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) \nReady for the final? \nLARRY CROWNE You'll be the judge of that. The is a beat of silence. \nLARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) So, your meal is satisfactory? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Absolutely. \nLARRY CROWNE Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Yes indeed. \nLARRY CROWNE Shall I prepare you another batch? \nMERCEDES TAINOT No. Thanks. \nLARRY CROWNE Then I will return to my station.. Mercedes watches him go. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH You kissed the cook... \n(THEN) I got a whiff. He smelled like bell pepper. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Look at the men in my life. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Blame it on the booze... and collect yourself. \n(THEN) You hoor... \nMERCEDES TAINOT That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor. \nKITCHEN FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH \nThat ends... right now. \n(THEN) Check please? \nLarry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his face. He tosses the French Toast down the disposal. \nINT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - LATER \nMercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums, cleaners, and fortitude. BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled, just chucked. \nKITCHEN \nThe cupboard is open. Where there was once booze go coffees and teas. MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's life... \nEXT. LARRY CROWNE'S CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT \nThe street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around and around and around the block that he will soon leave. He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV. This was Larry's street... \nCUT TO: \nSUNRISE \nEXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING \nMercedes exits the door, crisp, clean -- like we've never seen her in the mornings. See the way she holds, not clutches, her Thermo-Cup? \nEXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - MORNING \nHe's wearing a zipped up jacket. Kids and dog-walkers pass as his scooter starts pronto, he is off... \n", "test3_id": 776}

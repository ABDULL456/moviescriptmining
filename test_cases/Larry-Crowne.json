{"train": "COX Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm. \nEXT. UNIMART - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nLess cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift. \nINT. UNIMART - ELECTRONICS - LATER \nLarry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is fastidious in his work. The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by. \nVASQUEZ LC Why still here? \nLARRY CROWNE Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy. \nVASQUEZ I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of. \nLARRY CROWNE Probably to clean up after the party. \nVASQUEZ Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be. \nLARRY CROWNE Speck-tack-alar. Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps. \nVASQUEZ \nYou're the only one around here who deserves it. How many will this be? \nLARRY CROWNE Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two! \nINT. MEETING ROOM #2 - SAME \nLarry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats. \nLARRY CROWNE Remember how we saw \"The UniMart Way\" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile. \nSTRANG Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves \nLARRY CROWNE I think I know what this is about. \nSTRANG I don't think you do. \nCOX Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us. \nLARRY CROWNE Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking. \nSTRANG I take it back. \nCOX Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas. \n(THEN) \nIt is touchas, right? Where you get kicked? \nHURLEY Yeah. A yiddish word. \nANDREWS Like the buttocks. \nHURLEY Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous. \nCOX Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it. \nLARRY CROWNE UniMart is firing me... \nSTRANG Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job. \nLARRY CROWNE Why me? \nANDREWS Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so. \nLARRY CROWNE Why not Strang? Strang snorts. \nLARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form. \nHURLEY Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Larry Crowne has no idea what that means. \nCOX \nHere's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder. \nSTRANG Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded. \nLARRY CROWNE I won't make the Front Office? \nSTRANG Never. (shows his college ring) S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true. \n(THE PAPERS) This is some kick in the head. Not sure what to tell you, Mr. Crowne. \nLARRY CROWNE I m hoping not to lose my house. \nLAURIE GAMMELGAARD You're carrying what on the house? \nLARRY CROWNE \nLAURIE GAMMELGAARD Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble. Three years ago I'd have loaned you $700,000, but I think you read the papers. \nLARRY CROWNE \nLAURIE GAMMELGAARD No. She gets a brochure: \"The RiverBank Survival Plan!\" \nLAURIE GAMMELGAARD (CONT'D) But RiverBank does have a plan for you. \n(THE BROCHURE) In a few weeks your financial base will tell us what we can do. Find new employment. Liquidate everything low on the Value Index. Stick to a budget. Clip coupons, buy in bulk, you know the drill. Then come back and we'll work with you. \nLARRY CROWNE That's RiverBank's plan for me? \nLAURIE GAMMELGAARD It is Friday, Mr. Crowne... \nEXT. DERBY COURT - EVENING \nThis is Larry Crowne's street. \nThis is Larry Crowne's house. \nHis car parks in the driveway and he steps out, taking a minute to survey what he may lose. KIDS play down the street under a streetlight... An ELDERLY NEIGHBOR is watering his lawn with a hose... A GUY is playing with his DOG... One house always has Christmas lights. Another has a handicapped ramp up to the front door.... \nEXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW - SAME \nLamarr lives across the street from Larry, and is looking out the window as he prepares to light a scholarly looking pipe \nLAMARR Larry's home a little late tonight. His wife, PATIENCE, is sitting at the table, pouring over catalogs.. \nPATIENCE Maybe he was out on a date. \nLAMARR We'd see that on the news. He is about to light up with a match... \nPATIENCE Don't even think about lighting that up in my house. \nINT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - EVENING \nHIS UNIMART POLO SHIRT \nHe is holding it in his hands. \nTHE LAUNDRY ROOM \nLarry is about to throw the thing away, but then puts it and some fabric softener in his washer. \nLIVING ROOM - LATER \nMood music plays from the Crowne Vinyl Library, a complete wall of LP's. Alphabetized... We can see into the... \nKITCHEN \nLarry sits in his breakfast nook with an old laptop computer \nand a pot of coffee. \nAn on-line job application... Mega-Save. Larry is entering his data. He comes across that part of any application that will forever be daunting to him. \nEDUCATION/ COLLEGE \nWhat can he do, but enter the truth? \nNONE. \nMore On-line Applications flash by.... \nPlug-It-In Center...Education/ College -- Didn't Go \nWhite Front House and Home ... Education/ College -- High School! Go, Navy! Furniture Planet ... Education/ College -- Is it necessary? \nPatterson's Appliances ... Education/ College -- Masters Degree: School of HARD KNOCKS!!! \nLarry stops. This may be futile. He looks about to give up. But then, he thinks. He stands. Thinks some more... \nIRONING BOARD Unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment. The iron breathes hot fumes... spray starch plumes like jet exhaust. Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection. He is focused. Intense. And good at ironing... \nEXT. MEGA-SAVE - MORNING \nGPS VOICE Please Enter your destination. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Jerk! \nLARRY CROWNE Sorry! Parking's impossible today! \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nAre you new to the Faculty? \nLARRY CROWNE New to the Student Body. \nMERCEDES TAINOT This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars. \nLARRY CROWNE I'm going to be late for my first day of school. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I bet it won't be the first time. \nEXT. E.C.C.C. - PORTABLE CLASSROOMS \nSTUDENTS search for their new classrooms. Mercedes does too, among these 'portable' classrooms that have not moved in 7 years. \nINT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - SPEECH 217 - LATER \nMercedes stops at the doorway. \nMERCEDES TAINOT This is it? \nP.O.V. \nNINE STUDENTS sit self-consciously, including PINEDO, DIBIASI, MACK, and CALIMERIS Mercedes quickly does a head count. \nMERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D) \nShe laughs. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) My day has just been made and it's only 8:02 in the morning! \n(THEN) This class...is CANCELLED!! Mercedes explains. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) \nThe city charter requires a minimum \nof ten students per class, otherwise it costs more to have us here than not. Did you really want a class at 8 AM? I didn't. Throw out those alarm clocks! Larry Crowne bursts through the door - panting for breath. \nLARRY CROWNE Please tell me this is Speech 217. Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne. She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in large, shaky-yet-feminine script: \nCARE. \nShe underlines it four times. \nMERCEDES TAINOT While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this \n(THEN) \n(MORE) \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Participate. Show up on time. (Larry gets a eye on that) Care. And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care. (a name on the board) My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie- knot'. Tay-no. You will each address the class on Wednesday. A procedure. How. To do. Something. Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her. Dibiasi raises his hand. \nDIBIASI Ms. Tie-knot? Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him. \nDIBIASI (CONT'D) Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo... \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nWho are you? \nDIBIASI Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me Nomad. Only two days before I gotta get up and give my address? You may be dreaming. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Why are you here, Steve? \nDIBIASI Counsellor Busik said this class would change my life. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Busik. Of course... Dibiasi's cell phone rings. \nDIBIASI I gotta take this... Mercedes Tainot may kill this kid. \nEXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME \nINT. ECON. 1 - LATER \nLARRY CROWNE That's a hunk of junk. \nLAMARR This is classic. \nLARRY CROWNE It doesn't work. \nLAMARR It will for eight hundred dollars. \nLARRY CROWNE \nTwo hundred. \nLAMARR Seven hundred. \nLARRY CROWNE Two hundred. \nLAMARR Six fifty. \nLARRY CROWNE Two hundred. \nLAMARR Six thirty. \nPATIENCE Gonna be a long night with you two. \nLARRY CROWNE Forget it. \nLAMARR Larry! The secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win Talk to me How much do you \nEXT. DERBY COURT - LATER \nLarry is carrying his Flat Screen TV, wires, box and all, from his house to Lamarr's garage. \"Wing Ding Ding!\" goes the scooter Lamarr has been working on with his tools. He lets it idle as he takes the TV. \nLAMARR Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet. \n(SHOWING HIM) Gas. Brake. Light's busted. Tires are low. You'll need a special license. Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved). \nLARRY CROWNE All I need is the open road. Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge. \nLAMARR You break it, you bought it. \nLARRY CROWNE \nIt still works. \nLAMARR Talking about the hedge. \nCOMPUTER SCREEN Images of an EROTIC SUPER-HEROINE -- busty and hot -- and others, are being studied, and saved one after another. \nEXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - DEN - EVENING \nDEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own books line the shelves. When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics. \nDEAN TAINOT Well, hey! Who's home early! He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe. Mercedes calls from the other room. \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nHe covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk. \nKITCHEN \nMercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour. \nDEAN TAINOT First day of term calls for a celebration! \nMERCEDES TAINOT You'd think so. \nDEAN TAINOT What's your burden this go round? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise \nDEAN TAINOT I built a Flamethrower of a posting for WarriorWeb which, if I do say, will feed nicely as an outline for \nAs the blender BLARES, husband and wife eye each other. She's looking at him. He's smiling like a guilty idiot. \n\"Carrier: Second Angel.\" And, I \nwas a guest blogger on CyberShare. \nBlender off. She starts pouring. \nDEAN TAINOT (CONT'D) Y u don't believe me. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Why wouldn't I believe you? \nGot me here for a nickel's worth of \ngas. \nTALIA You're in Matsutani's Econ with me. \nLARRY CROWNE I am? \nTALIA That class is straining my coconut. \nLARRY CROWNE It's only been one day \nTALIA Didn't know you scooted. \nLARRY CROWNE New to the sport. \nTALIA (pulls out mobile phone) Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts. \n(THEN) Name please? \nLARRY CROWNE Larry Crowne. With an 'e'. \nTALIA 'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia. (then in her phone) Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting. \n(THEN) Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a polo shirt into khakis makes you look like a cop. \nLARRY CROWNE Not much fashion sense. \nTALIA I know! Gotta change that... Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and doesn't want to be late again. \nLARRY CROWNE \nGotta go! \nTALIA Then get going!! Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far... \nINT. SPEECH 217 - LATER \nMercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls from her Thermo-cup. Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes. \nIn front of the board that says \"PHONES OFF!!\" Calimeris is demonstrating an exercise for her speech. \nCALIMERIS With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps. It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning. The \n6-COUNT BURPIE \nThe class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a fan. \nMERCEDES TAINOT We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you. \n(THEN) Who's next? No one volunteers. Though Pinedo is about to... \nMERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D) Make me the bad guy. \n(HER ROSTER) Ms. Crowne? \nLARRY CROWNE You mean me? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Mr. Crowne. My bad. Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's. \nBusik shoots him a 'thumbs up.' \nHe looks at Mercedes for the starting cue. \nMERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D) Go. \nLARRY CROWNE My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. \"How to make French Toast\", but I'll speak English... Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way... \nMERCEDES TAINOT M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut. \nLarry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking, only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)... \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about Larry. She is a stone face. \nLARRY CROWNE Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (still talking to herself) Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. Larry still has a dozen cards to go. \nBut the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) \nAh-ooo-gah! Time's up. \nLARRY CROWNE That went fast... \nSTAN We hit those last week. \nTALIA If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales. \nLARRY CROWNE I know where a yard sale is, like everyday. \nTALIA Lead the way. \n(YELLING) Monkey! Lance knows a yard sale! \nDELL GORDO Take point! \nLARRY CROWNE Follow me, boys and girl! \nEXT. DERBY COURT - LATER \nThe Scooters pull around the corner. Lamarr shouts. \nLAMARR We're being invaded! One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The stuff that Larry was selling is now part of Lamarr's operation, being sold 'On Consignment'. . \nLAMARR (CONT'D) Larry, what kind of thugs you get in with? \nLARRY CROWNE College buddies. \nLAMARR \nIf they're college buddies why aren't they in college? \nTALIA You have any old clothes? \nLAMARR Speak to my bride inside. Dell Gordo, Stan and the others are going through hardware, tools, appliances. \nDELL GORDO Oh man! These TV trays are too much! \nLAMARR Bargains at $100 apiece. \nDELL GORDO For these? Are you nuts? \nLAMARR I'm joking, kid. Let's get to haggling. \nDELL GORDO I get it. \n(THEN) A buck apiece. \nLAMARR \nYOU Ninety-nine dollars apiece. see how this is working? \nDELL GORDO Two bucks apiece! \nLAMARR Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this every day. \nINT. GARAGE -- SAME \nTalia and Patience are putting outfits together from off the hangers. \nTALIA Layer this... with this. \nPATIENCE \nAdd this belt? \nTALIA I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT? \nPATIENCE Reeled it in like tuna from the Atlantic. \nTALIA Diamonds in a diamond mine. \n(ANOTHER OUTFIT) Take this... under this...unbutton that. \nPATIENCE You and I are going to spend some time together! \nEXT. LAMARR HOUSE - SAME \nLarry stands alone, nothing to do as the Scooters poke about the sale. He drifts towards his house, a forgotten man. \nINT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER \nHe is entering some of his choice, rare LP's up for auction on eBay. \nDOORBELL RINGS \nINT. LARRY'S HOUSE - SAME \nP.O.V. \nStan has broken down much of Larry's bike using Lamarr's tools. Lamarr is standing over him, pointing out what he thinks needs to be done. Stan is ignoring him. \nDELL GORDO (CONT'D) Let's go lift iron, Monkey. It's a shoulders and arms day \n(MORE) \nDELL GORDO (CONT'D) Lance, raise your right hand and say something patriotic. Larry does, just for fun. \nLARRY CROWNE 'We'll be right back after these messages.' \nDELL GORDO You're in the Street Patrol. A full-time mission for beauty and justice. Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips -- no romance at all, but still... \nTALIA That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear. She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers. \nDELL GORDO \nLance. All men fall in love with \nTalia. You will too, if you haven't already. But I love her the most. Know that right now. \nLARRY CROWNE Capice. \nDELL GORDO Seriously. Don't make me keep my eyes on you. What's your real name? \nLARRY CROWNE L rry. \nDELL GORDO Mine's Don. Shake hands. \n(EXPLAINING HOW) Look each other in the eyes. Firm grips. No contest, but firm. Hold. Stack it. \n(THEN) One word, Lance. Peace. \nLARRY CROWNE Peace indeed. \nEXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MORNING \nNEIGHBORHOOD KIDS are in school uniforms, heading to the bus stop. Dressed for school as well, Larry kick starts his scooter, now a humming bit of mechanical perfection. \nLARRY CROWNE Speck-tack-alar. He peels out, on his way to school. \nEXT. LAMARR'S HOUSE - KITCHEN WINDOW \nLamarr, and his percolator, give Larry a wave. \nEXT. E.C.C.C.

She is giving a polished, well-prepared \"off the cuff\" presentation: DYNAMIC SEMINARS \nPRESENTS: SHAKESPEAREAN ECONOMICS. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Act I: Inventory. What do you sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of accounting. Receivable. Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward planning. Plan to grow. Act Five? Final Profitability. What do you clear on bottom-line? \n(THEN) In other words: \"To be or not to be... in Business.\" It's all nonsense, but it looks nice in PowerPoint form. \nLarry is taking notes. \nCalimeris has drawn her Pyramid of ideas. Mack sleeps with his head straight up. \nPinedo is listening intently, counting the ideas out on her hands. Dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D) For business, social, and self- improvement workshops, email me: Francestaylor-briegh@dynasem.com. Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her classroom. She is preoccupied. The applause for the speaker jolts her. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) White, Siler and Koss, you are up \nnext time. \n(THEN) You did good, Fran. Thanks. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in Frances Taylor-Briegh. \n(THEN) I used you as a Focal Reference but you weren't there for me. What's wrong, Mercy? Mercedes signals Frances: \"Not yet\", then points to Larry, still finishing up his notes. \nTALIA No one should ever buy clothes off the internet. You have to feel the fabric and test the drape... \nLARRY CROWNE What is all this worth? Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes. \nTALIA A lot to me. Try these on. \nLARRY CROWNE Where? \nTALIA Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip. He does. \nLARRY CROWNE \nTALIA This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now. Larry is taking off his pants just as Dell Gordo has pulled up on his scooter. \nDELL GORDO Monkey! Thought you might be here. \nTALIA Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on! Larry, in fact, has his pants off. \nDell Gordo has a look in his eyes of, well, \"What the fuck?\" \nINT./EXT. - MERCEDES' CAR -- AFTERNOON \nShe is driving home. \nGPS VOICE \nPlease enter your destination. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Go to hell... \nINT TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - LATER Dean is opening take-out containers to put the food on plates.

If you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- I could help you out. \nMERCEDES TAINOT How? \nDEAN TAINOT I'd read your stuff. Make comments to make it web-savvy. Pieces need \nto pop, you know. Takes a little \nPRACTICE \nMERCEDES TAINOT Okay. \nDEAN TAINOT See? You can't stay mad at me. No reason to be mad at me... He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back. \nDEAN TAINOT (CONT'D) I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy... Mercedes' eyes: She didn't like hearing that... \nINT. LARRY'S HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING \nLarry -- in new, vintage clothes with his morning coffee -- is at his computer entering his financial record into a program - Ed Matsutani's SmartPlanning MoneyWorks.

But you know how complimentary coffee is always lousy? Your chances are, too. \nLARRY CROWNE I can't make the payments on the house.

Talia hops up to sit on a butcher block. \nRAUL (CONT'D) This is my kitchen and I am the boss. \nTALIA Is he, Lance? \nLARRY CROWNE \nRaul's my boss, yeah. \nTALIA Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul? \nRAUL Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair, too. \nTALIA As boss, do you make up the menu? \nL \nRAUL \nA N . But I do the purchasing. \nR \nTALIA Is that a tough but fair job? \nR \nRAUL \nY It makes me crazy, you kidding? But it's gotta be done every day or guess what? No food. I'll show you how much I gotta do... \nP \nU And just like that, Talia has seduced another man. telling her the secrets of purchasing orders s fries into the deep fryer. \nRAUL IS \nLATER Talia is with Perry at the register. She's seduced him now, as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever. \nJANET As soon as I saw you, I said, \"I want to go out with that man.\" \nTONY What did you say when I asked you out? \nJANET I said \"Yes.\" You were there, remember? \nTONY I saw you and I thought \"I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me.\" \nJANET Yes you are. \nTONY Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it? \nJANET \nDisaster looms on most first dates, but I'm talking to you like you're a friend I want to make out with. \nTONY Hold that thought. Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car. \nMercedes is out of the car before it even stops. \nDEAN TAINOT I take it back. I take it back. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Drive, asshole! Drive away! \nDEAN TAINOT I've been drinking, too. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline! \nDEAN TAINOT You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and \nWIN! \nMERCEDES TAINOT LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER! \nDEAN TAINOT Screw you, you washboard! \nMERCEDES TAINOT Oh, chillax!!! \nGPS VOICE Please enter your destination. Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know what to do with each other now. \nEXT. BUSINESS STREET - LATER \nMercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She sits and removes her shoes. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does cry, for so any reasons. In the distance, we hear... \nThe ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time 'Scoot'. All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and Talia. Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the bus stop. She slows. \nTALIA Lance! Chick alert! Larry is beside her. They stop. \nTALIA (CONT'D) You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused. \nBUS BENCH \nMercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to her. \nLARRY CROWNE Ms. Tainot? \nMERCEDES TAINOT No. He takes off his helmet. \nLARRY CROWNE \nLarry Crowne. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Jesus Christ. \nTALIA And I've been calling you 'Lance'. \nLARRY CROWNE Do you need a ride? Hop on. \nMERCEDES TAINOT And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi? \nTALIA Hey. Bambi was a boy. \nLARRY CROWNE I was heading home. \n(TO TALIA) Right? We're done scooting? \nTALIA Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff! \nEXT. CEDAR HILLS TOWNHOMES - NIGHT \nIn through the gates come our night crawlers. Mercedes is \nEXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME \nLarry shuts off the motor. Mercedes is half asleep. She doesn't remember to take off Larry's helmet. \nLARRY CROWNE Unit 114. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I can see the Alarm Pad. I know the code. But my hands aren't working. \n(THEN) Help me. \nLARRY CROWNE You don't want to give me your pass code. \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nJust hold my hand up to the numbers. I'll manage from there. Larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Look away now. \n(HE DOES) Two two two two. Pound. Larry heard every word. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car. The key please? It's buried in that plant. Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it. \nLARRY CROWNE This it? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Why I think it is! \nLARRY CROWNE I'll get the door for you Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Take one step inside and I call security. Larry steps away from the door. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) And forget this ever happened. \nLARRY CROWNE What? \nMERCEDES TAINOT This whole sorry chapter tonight. \nLARRY CROWNE What? \nMERCEDES TAINOT You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me. \nLARRY CROWNE What are you talking about? \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nWhat, you have no short-term memory? Larry has been tying to be polite. \nLARRY CROWNE When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home. \nLARRY CROWNE Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that? \nLARRY CROWNE I assumed you preferred Ms \nMERCEDES TAINOT When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that. \n(THEN) Why aren't you married? \nLARRY CROWNE That's a long story and it's late. \n(THEN) My helmet? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Help yourself. She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might kiss right now. Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I noticed something on the ride. \nLARRY CROWNE \nWHAT \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nIT MAY You smell good. \nAmid the others... \nTALIA \nOh, come on! I left you all set up! What went down? \nLARRY CROWNE Epilog. School today. \nTALIA Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel. \nLARRY CROWNE If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play... \nMERCY \nConvinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class. \nINT. SPEECH 217 - DAY \nMercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is looking at Larry. Larry is listening to Lala with delight. \nPINEDO Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me. \n(THEN) That is something I will remember forever. The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala, who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who rises in applause for the once quiet classmate. Then the applause is over. \nThe teacher says nothing. DIBIASI \nThat was a knockout speech, Lala. Made the news. Caused riots downtown. School's out til 2019. The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and head ou . \nMERCEDES TAINOT Mr. Crowne? A moment please? \nCALIMERIS Why doesn't she just throw herself at him? \nPINEDO This is bordering on harassment now. \nDIBIASI Quiet down. I'm watching the TV show... \nMACK Why doesn't this ever happen to me? \nMERCEDES TAINOT I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you. \nDIBIASI Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours. \nMACK You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? We hear them cackling like geese in the hall. \nLARRY CROWNE How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short \na time span. \nLARRY CROWNE Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished. \nLARRY CROWNE I wouldn't want that. \nMERCEDES TAINOT happened before. \n(MORE) \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student. \n(THEN) I hope the entire thing will be forgotten. Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher. \nLARRY CROWNE Sure. Nothing happened. At all. \nMERCEDES TAINOT So there will be no bravado among you and your pals? \nLARRY CROWNE None. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Thank you, Mr. Crowne. \nLARRY CROWNE \nI'd better scurry along to Dr. \nMatsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with him. Larry leaves - a good mood ruined... Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark glasses? \nEXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON \nLarry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play down the street. They run back and forth in front of them with a soccer ball. They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light up. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I knew you'd be on the computer. \n(THEN) Working... \nDEAN TAINOT Point made. \n(THEN) So. What up. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Are we making a mistake here? \nDEAN TAINOT \nMERCEDES TAINOT Point made. We could change things. We could start right now. \nDEAN TAINOT We could. Why should we? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure. \nDEAN TAINOT I'd like that too. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Really? \nDEAN TAINOT You're not a pleasant woman after a \nfew glasses. Mornings with you are \nto be survived. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short. \nDEAN TAINOT I see. I'm what this is all about. \nMERCEDES TAINOT There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here. \nDEAN TAINOT You're talking about you but you really mean me. \n(THEN) I am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. So you don't get to either. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I'm not saying that. \nDEAN TAINOT We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working. \n(THEN) I'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually I will be fine and you will too. But I am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults. \n(THEN) I just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting. He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself. \nDEAN TAINOT (CONT'D) I don't think there is anything else to talk about. Do you? \nMercedes looks at him. She has been a fool... \nEXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO \nMercy -- Margarita pitcher handy -- is still writing words on paper, and drinking. Alone. Not good. \nEXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING \nThe sign reads \"FINALS WEEK: ENROLL FOR SPRING QUARTER.\" \nINT. SPEECH 217 - MORNING \nShe is in the front of the class with a small box. Hungover? A bit, yes... \nMERCEDES TAINOT Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid. \n(THEN) Ms Pinedo Draw \nMs. Pinedo pulls a paper from the box. \nMS. PINEDO 'Potatoes?' \nMERCEDES TAINOT Spuds. Can't wait. Dibiasi draws a paper. \nDIBIASI 'Disraeli'? What is that? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Who is that? \nDIBIASI It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done. Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events. \nLARRY CROWNE 'Consumerism'. \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nThat's supposed to say 'Communism.' \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP) \nSo. You're a mess. \nINT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME \nThey sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Yep. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right? At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee. Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus. \nPERRY Ladies. Bring an appetite? \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie. Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat. \nPERRY \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH No Key Lime? \nPERRY Cream pies I got. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Boston Cream? \nPERRY Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Phooey. Peach. Peach pie. \nPERRY Ma'am? \nMERCEDES TAINOT I'll have the French Toast. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH French Toast? \nMERCEDES TAINOT \n(on the menu) Breakfast all day. Perry leaves to put in the order. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) You won't believe how far I fell on the Hooch-o-meter. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH I have seen it happen a time or two. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I kissed a boy. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH When, third grade? \nMERCEDES TAINOT One of my students. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH You Hoor. \n(THEN) Gimme the friggin' details! He's not a minor is he? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Older than me. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down? \nMERCEDES TAINOT He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH He a fireman who bakes bread? \nMERCEDES TAINOT I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did. \nFRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH Bold. Who is he? \nKITCHEN \nPerry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook. \nPERRY \nYou're slipping, Larry. \n(THE TOAST) Lady says it's not French Toast as she knows it. \nLARRY CROWNE She's insane. \nPERRY Take it up with her. Larry heads out of the kitchen. \nPERRY (CONT'D) No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment. \nBOOTH \nHere comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes. \nThe FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW \nINT. SPEECH 217 - LATER \nOn the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI. \nDibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes... \nMERCEDES TAINOT What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought. \n(THEN) Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place.. \nMERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) I was tough on him. But he learned fast. How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. I'll never forget about the Value Index now. He gave a perfect speech. \n(THEN) And... He's polite. Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? He could have ravaged me. I misread this guy and if I had a brain I'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. I wonder if he'd like that, if he would... What did I just say? \n(THEN) What did I just say about Larry Crowne? The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each other. The men stifle laughs. \nDIBIASI \nNothing. And I was just wrapping up here. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I'm so sorry. Please go on. \nDIBIASI Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods. \nDIBIASI (CONT'D) Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh? Dibiasi is done. Applause. \nPINEDO Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last? \nDIBIASI Fourth quarter dramatics. \n(THEN) Not that it mattered to my Speech professor... \nMERCEDES TAINOT Congratulations all of you. \nMACK Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Not me, I have to stay objective. \nMACK I say... Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. \"La la! La la! La la!\" -- embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding. \nIt's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of. \nAs she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne leading a parade around the room. \nINT. ECON. 1 - LATER \nEveryone is taking the final. \nDr. Matsutani. Looking around the class. Using his hands like a pair of binoculars. Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers. \nLarry is finished. He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his Blue Book. \nDR. MATSUTANI The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry leaves. \nINT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - KITCHEN \nThe final utensils are going into a box. Larry is doing this part himself. He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's. \nMACK This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records. \nLARRY CROWNE Priceless at a buck apiece. \nEXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - LATER \nHis furnishings are out on the lawn. Lamarr and Patience are looking them over. Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of his things into Mack's huge SUV and Larry's car. \nPATIENCE \nA two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture? \nLAMARR Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing. \n(THEN) What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff? \nLARRY CROWNE You'll get me top price. \nLAMARR You did learn. \nDIBIASI Pizza at last! \nLARRY CROWNE Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign. \nLARRY CROWNE Cars not much. Devices some. They rise. \nEXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - SAME \nMercy is opening her door, starting her car. \nGPS VOICE Please enter your destination. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Oh be quiet. That's a MapGenie. \nMERCEDES TAINOT It is Hellspawn. \nLARRY CROWNE In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit. \nMERCEDES TAINOT It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons. \nLARRY CROWNE Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him. \nLARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) \nHow long was this broken? \nMERCEDES TAINOT Seemed like years and years. \nLARRY CROWNE All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye. \nThey hear a pounding. \nRaul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is over. \nLARRY CROWNE (CONT'D) My Boss. Back to work. \n(THEN) Thanks for the good news... \nINT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME \nPerry greets him at the door. \nPERRY Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act. Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away. \nEXT. E.C.C.C. PARKING LOT - MORNING \nThe sign says \"New Term Beginning! $20 a unit! Ask about Financial Aid!\" Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up... \nINT. PORTABLE CLASSROOM - DAY \nMercedes has just written \"Care\" next to \"Welcome to Shakespeare!!\" up on the board. She turns. And does a quick head count. Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one, again. Clumps up the wooden steps are heard... \nCalimeris, Mack, Pinedo, and Dibiasi come tramping in. Twelve \nstudents now. \nDIBIASI (on his phone) I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo... Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Is Larry with you? \nCALIMERIS Um, no. Should we track him down and drag him in here? Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment. \nMERCEDES TAINOT I... Seeing you all... I just thought... \n(THEN) Choose a seat and lets get started! The four smile at each other... \nPINEDO Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands... \nEXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - LATER \nMercedes is walking to another building, another class. \nShe may not realize it, but she is looking for Larry Crowne. Busik is busy chatting her up. Seriously chatting her up. \nBUSIK All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment. Do you? I need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time. Don't you? \nDR. MATSUTANI (O.C.) Ms. Tainot? She turns. \nMERCEDES TAINOT \nDr. M. \nDR. MATSUTANI Larry Crowne is taking six units from me, devouring the material like a starving man. \nMERCEDES TAINOT Larry's enrolled? \nDR. MATSUTANI He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you. That your class changed his life. Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming... \n", "test1_input": "LARRY CROWNE \nWritten by \nTom Hanks \nFrom a story by \nTom Hanks & Nia Vardalos \nNov. 2009 \nFADE IN \nSUNRISE \nBig and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate. A dawn as promising as, well, this new day... Sun is rising over... \nA flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse. A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with... HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building. In fact this kind of building... A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy... \nPARKING LOT \nEmpty thus far.

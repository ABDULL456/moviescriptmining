PICARD Nothing for me. (brusque, to Soran) I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me. 
SORAN Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star. 
Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't sound that imperative to him. 
PICARD Doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then -- 
SORAN The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost. 
PICARD We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me... 
Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks. 
SORAN (cryptically) They say time is the fire in which we burn... and right now, Captain, my time is running out. (beat) We leave so many things unfinished in our lives -- I'm sure you can understand. 
For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard. 
He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper. 
PICARD I'll see what I can do... 
Picard walks away without a word before Soran can thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...

A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS.

she begins to sense something, as though someone is watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is talking to Riker. 
Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram of sensor information. 
WORF One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium. 
RIKER Trilithium? 
WORF An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it. 
RIKER Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense. 
Riker considers. 
RIKER (cont'd) Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team...  tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium. 
WORF Aye, sir.

The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are scanning the room with tricorders. 
GEORDI (off tricorder) There's no sign of any trilithium in here. 
Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him. Data giggles louder. 
DATA (laughing, to himself) I get it. I get it. 
GEORDI You get what? 
Data laughs again. 
DATA When you said to Commander Riker... (imitating Geordi's voice) "The clown can stay, but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go." 
Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment. 
GEORDI What? 
DATA During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punch line.

MILLER (into radio) They're all inside. We're going to get something to eat. We'll be back before they finish dinner. They drive off. CUT TO: INT. NOGO RESTAURANT - LATER Seated at a table are Ben and    Laura, Vitti and Sheila, Jelly, and the producer RAOUL BERMAN    and his uptight, downtown GIRLFRIEND. Jelly inspects a     piece of raw octopus, while Raoul gushes over a platter of    sushi and sashimi. RAOUL I adore this place. Best sushi in town. Have you tried the yellowtail, Paul? Raoul picks up a floppy piece of raw fish with his chopsticks. VITTI (makes a face) No. We gettin' any real food?     This is like eatin' fuckin' bait. Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend. Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. He's suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and he's oddly thick-lipped. BEN Bait! That's funny. Honey, did you hear what Paul just said? He said this is like eating bait. LAURA (not amused) I heard him. And I think it was 'effing bait.' 
VITTI Why you talkin' like that? 
BEN Like what? VITTI Like a fuckin' retard. BEN (pointing to his lower lip) Oh -- this? I took a couple ibuprofen before we got here -- I shouldn't have had the saki. I'll be fine. It only lasts a couple hours. (to Raoul) Rah-oo. Row. Rowl. I guess you need both lips for that name. You know what I love about Paul? He was born without a filter. He says exactly what he's thinking -- just lays it right out there. He doesn't edit himself. VITTI (quietly) You wanna shut the fuck up? BEN See? He just told me to shut the fuck up. No filter. I love that. (to Raoul) Isn't he great? LAURA (aside to Ben) Too much buffering. Way too much. RAOUL (eyeing Ben oddly) Yes. Paul, I'm such a huge fan of yours -- not a fan, but you know, an admirer. VITTI Don't admire me too much. RAOUL Is there any chance you might be interested in working on 'Little Caesar' as a consultant? Give us technical advice, coach the actors, make sure the dialogue rings true -- 
BEN Wow. That would be incredible. Did you hear that, Paul? Raoul wants to know if you'd be interested in working on his show as a consultant. You know, give technical advice, coach the actors -- VITTI (quietly to Ben) In two seconds I'm gonna put a fork in your eye. BEN (suddenly cowed) Got it. RAOUL So what do you think, Paul? VITTI Yeah, sure, whatever. RAOUL Fantastic! 
SHEILA This is so exciting. Mr. Berman, I love your show. Anthony Bella, the guy who plays Nicky Caesar -- I think he grew up in Bensonhurst next door to my cousin's friend's husband. VITTI That's her claim to fame. (to Sheila) I hate to bust your bubble, but he's not from Bensonhurst. He's a professional Italian. He grew up in Connecticut or something like that. SHEILA Well, wherever he's from, I think he's a wonderful actor. JELLY Yeah, I bet he gets a lot of pussy. Laura chokes on her drink. VITTI What's the matter with you?   We got women at the table. JELLY You said 'fuckin'.' 
VITTI That's different. It's colorful. 
BEN Hey, speaking of colorful -- this peacock walks into a bar -- LAURA Oh, my god. (to a passing waiter, rising her half-empty drink) Could I get another one, please? BEN And one for me. LAURA No.    No more for the Buffer. She glares at Ben as the table descends into silence. VITTI (tries a desperate save) So. I see in the paper where Oklahoma! might win the Tony award. 
Vitti's eyes suddenly go wide. VITTI (shouts) Down!!! He grabs Sheila and pulls her down as GUNFIRE rakes the wall behind them. Everybody else at the table hits the floor. Other diners scream in terror.    Jelly pulls a GUN and SHOOTS back. A LONE GUNMAN runs from the restaurant. After a long beat, the frightened patrons start to get up and chatter nervously.

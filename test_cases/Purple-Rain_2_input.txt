Suddenly a HORN BLARES off screen. Billy looks up -- a BEAUTIFUL BABE in a black BMW waves-- 
BILLY Go around the block! 
The Babe pulls into the flow of traffic- 
BILLY It won't be The Time -- they're playing backup to Vanity.  So it's either you or the Modern Aires. (a beat) What would You do in my position? 
Prince has a sinking feeling in his gut- 
BILLY (musing) I like the Modern Aires.  They have a good following -- they show up for practice -- and the kids like all their music. 
The BMW sweeps up to the curb.  Billy opens the door, slides in-- 
BILLY 'Nough said.  Get smart. Straighten up your shit. 
(76) INT. REHEARSAL HALL -- DAY 
The PLACE is JUMPING!  Once again The Time is deep in the guts of "Sex Shooter," but now there's a difference. The MUSIC is fiercer and crisper -- the BEAT tailored, more defined. 
Morris and Jerome stand off to the side sporting huge grins.  They're avidly watching... 
...Vanity, Susan, and Brenda dancing up a fierce storm.  Vanity fronts the two Girls and moves panther-like in front of the mirrors... 
She's a dynamo, her face drawn tightly, her movements crisp and precise.  She urges the Girls on, suggests and cajoles, strengthening their resolve. Sweat lathers their bodies and forms rings on their Danskins.  The act is still very rough, but the potential for success can be felt. 
PRINCE suddenly enters the hall.  Morris spots him immediately and halts the MUSIC.  The Girls dance on a moment, then stop perplexed.  Vanity catches Prince's look, shakes her head in disbelief-- 
PRINCE I want to talk to you. 
She's out of breath, waves him off-- 
VANITY Not now,  I'm busy. 
PRINCE Now. 
A TITTER goes through the Band Members - - Vanity wipes her face, fixes him with a glare-- 
VANITY I said I'm busy -- we'll talk later. 
PRINCE Uh, uh... 
He grabs her suddenly, pulls her to the door-- 
VANITY Leave me alone!  I've got a show to do! 
She pulls away savagely-- 
VANITY YOU can't just come in here and take me away!  We'll talk later! 
Morris is enraged-- 
MORRIS Man -- why don't you just do the walk? 
Prince glares at him, cups his genitals- 
PRINCE Why don't you kiss the one- eyed snake? 
The Band lets out a condescending GROAN -- the tension rises 
MORRIS Jellybean! 
Jellybean, 6'4", 210 pounds, steps from behind the drums, moves up behind Prince- 
JELLYBEAN Let's go, Jack. 
PRINCE Fuck you! 
He lunges, grabs Vanity again -- she SHRIEKS-- 
VANITY Leave me alone, dammit!  Get out of here!

INT. DISNEY - OUTER OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Tommie and Dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and broken Walt Disney appears in front of them. 
WALT She's gone? Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt apologetically. 
TOMMIE Flight left 10 minutes ago. Tommie hands him the itinerary, he glares at it. 
WALT (expecting to read her 
NAME) 
PAMELA TRA-- 
(BEAT) Goff? Who's Helen Goff? 
TOMMIE Her. That's her real name. Walt is confused. 
DOLLY Yuh, didn't you know? She's all hoity toity. British this and British that and she's really an Aussie called Helen Goff. Stuck up-- 
WALT Then who's Travers? Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug. 
WALT (CONT'D) (smiles to himself) I've been talking to the wrong person. 
EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY 
Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She ruffles Andrew's fur before entering the house. 
INT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY 
Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and emotional voices in the hall. She pokes her head into the hallway. There, huddled together, whispering are her mother, the doctor and Aunt Ellie. Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets. Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of her heart. Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo. There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen, shattered. She comes down to Ginty's level. 
MARGARET 
DADDY-- Ginty cannot react. Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor. Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the chair, drawn into its beady black eyes. 
GINTY I want to see my father. 
MARGARET No, you mustn't. 
GINTY I want to see him! Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing, biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers. 
AUNT ELLIE Let her go Margaret. Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father's bedroom. 
INT. TRAVERS' BEDROOM - DAY 
Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. She stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing. 
GINTY I dropped the pears. She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand. 
GINTY (CONT'D) I'm sorry daddy. Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without turning around. 
GINTY (CONT'D) You promised you would fix everything. 
EXT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY 
A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out too. 
INT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY 
Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase. 
PAMELA Hello house. 
INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in darkness. She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and a lifetime's despair. There's a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn't know how long she's been asleep but it's black outside. She gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will take her. She swings it open. 
PAMELA Oh dear god! Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite literally, speechless. 
WALT It was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight, let me tell you. 
PAMELA But, you always get what you want eventually. Isn't that right Walter? He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking. 
WALT How about you show me how to make one of those nice English pots of tea?

There are only a couple of results that include both terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and blue, and reads - 
... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ... Hmmm. 
31   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1960                           31 The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white - 
VANGER V/O This is Harriet. The granddaughter of my brother Richard. 
32   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                 32 The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger shows Blomkvist. VANGER Richard, who I may as well start with to get it out of the way, was a Nazi of the first order - joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17. 
A page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young man in a uniform with a Nazi pin. 
VANGER Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom. (Blomkvist checks his watch) The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried. 
We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man. 
VANGER Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie. 
BLOMKVIST They're still called that. VANGER Are they?   Okay. INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried. 
VANGER He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on. 
BLOMKVIST Someone has to do it. VANGER That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children. 
VANGER His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet. 
A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet. 
VANGER She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person. BLOMKVIST And beautiful. Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...

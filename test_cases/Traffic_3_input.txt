INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY 
A packed, tense courtroom listens to testimony from a government witness, FRANK, 50's, very matter-of-fact and truthful. 
FRANK He first came to me in January. That would've been nineteen eighty- seven.  He wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor.  I didn't ask too many questions; I'm a businessman also. 
INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY 
Another witness, MRS. BERRY, 40's, pedantic on the stand -- 
MRS. BERRY I told Mr. Ayala there were irregularities in his tax return. And I couldn't represent him unless we could explain this... 
INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY 
SHEILA, 38, a mousy secretary, is on the stand.  Carlos sits at the defendant's table listening raptly.  Gordon and Castro sit in the back watching Helena who pays close attention to the witness -- 
SHEILA I was the company secretary from 1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked for all six companies.  But... they weren't... I mean, it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone.  We never sold anything the whole time I was there.  Sometimes people came and got paid.  I don't really know what we did. 
PROSECUTOR Did Mr. Ayala say where the money came from? 
SHEILA No, and I didn't ask. 
PROSECUTOR Where do you think it came from? 
Carl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet -- 
KAUFMAN This speculation -- 
PROSECUTOR I'll rephrase.  Did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise? 
Sheila is reluctant to answer. 
SHEILA No, not really. 
Helena catches Carl's eye and they share a grim moment.

INT. CARL'S UPSTAIRS STUDY - DAY 
Helena sits at Carl's office desk.  On the desk in front of her are the lists she found and an encrypted cell phone. 
Helena picks up the phone.  Her hands are shaking.  She is crying as she dials.  A voice on the other end answers. 
FRANCISCO (V.O.) Who is this? 
Helena gathers her courage, then... 
HELENA A friend... of Carlos Ayala. 
There is a long pause. 
FRANCISCO (V.O.) Yes. 
HELENA I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely? 
FRANCISCO (V.O.) You may speak. 
HELENA I have a job for you and I don't have much time. 
EXT. BOTANICAL GARDEN - DAY 
Helena watches David look at the wide variety of plants and flowers.  All around them a GROUP of 3rd graders, in identical T-shirts, enjoy a field trip. 
FRANCISCO (V.O.) I love this place.  Don't turn around. 
Behind her Francisco Flores takes a photo with an instant camera. 
FRANCISCO You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb. 
HELENA You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something? 
FRANCISCO I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive. 
HELENA When will you do it? 
FRANCISCO I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way. 
HELENA There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him. 
Francisco laughs. 
FRANCISCO Careful... You're sounding like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

INT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Anna sits in the living room, staring.  She appears too upset to speak.  The apartment is cleaner.  There have been other changes.  There's a new rug. 
JAVIER What?  What is it? 
ANNA It's very hard for me to come and tell you this. 
Javier just watches her.

Whip steps toward the box. 
CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door. 
WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS. 
COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like jewels in a chest. 
WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time -- vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER, CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY. 
WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it. 
Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists the tiny cap back on. 
With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away. 
WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly... 
WHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!! 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING 
The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and head down the hallway. 
We follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of WHIP's door. 
EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - HALLWAY - WHIP'S DOOR - DAY 
OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach carrying coffees. 
CHARLIE Good morning, how's our man? 
OFFICER EDMONDS Not a peep. 
CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again. 
CHARLIE I think your pilot overslept. 
HUGH You didn't let any girls in there last night did you? 
OFFICER EDMONDS No sir, not a soul. No one came in or out. 
They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks on the door. More silence... 
OFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D) I have a room key. 
CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in. 
INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING 
CHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room. He is spooked by the silence. HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found. 
HUGH LANG Did he disappear? 
CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look. 
CHARLIE Whip? Hello? 
CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open. 
INT. ADJOINING ROOM -- SAME TIME 
CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime. Smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room. HUGH joins him... 
HUGH Where is he? 
CHARLIE Whip? WHIP! 
CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom... 
BATHROOM -- ADJOINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
CHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIP's lifeless body wedged between the tub and the toilet. 
CHARLIE WHIP?!!! WHIP!!! 
CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH arrives and freaks out. 
HUGH Is he dead? 
CHARLIE I DON'T KNOW!!! 
HUGH IS HE DEAD?! 
WHIP Yes!!! I'm dead!!! 
CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing. OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them. 
OFFICER EDMONDS Should I get an ambulance? 
CHARLIE Yes! 
HUGH Wait!...just wait, Charlie...let's think about this. 
The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament. 
CHARLIE Get him to the bed... (to the Officer) 
Can you wait outside and don't let anyone in here? Thank you. 
EDMONDS leaves. CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the bathroom and flop him on the bed. HUGH explodes.

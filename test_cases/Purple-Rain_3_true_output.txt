FATHER (shouting) What's the matter with this house?  Isn't it nice and warm here?! 
The Mother stands on the bed SHRIEKING-- 
MOTHER You're crazy! 
FATHER Shut up! 
MOTHER. Asshole! 
FATHER Shut up! 
MOTHER (triumphantly) Motherfucker!! 
The Father lunges, drags Prince along the floor, WHACKS! the Mother in the face.  She topples in a heap to the bed. He's over her now, breathing fire, flailing about savagely-- 
FATHER Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! 
PRINCE (desperately) Dad! 
He lunges, drop KICKS his Father with everything he's got!  His Father SMASHES backwards against the wall, slides to his buttocks on the floor.  He sits there dully, exhausted...spent. 
Prince crawls up along the side of the bed.  His Mother buries her head in the pillow, choking back sobs-- 
MOTHER I'm just trapped here... 
His Father's eyes well with tears.  He leans close to her, speaks softly-- 
FATHER You always got a roof overhead... 
MOTHER You don't let me have any fun... 
His Father sighs wearily, pulls himself to his feet.  He moves to the door-- 
FATHER I could make you happy.  Just believe in me... 
MOTHER You never... 
FATHER I would die for you. 
He leaves the room, closes the door behind him. 
PRINCE stares at  the door a moment, tears welling in his eyes.  His Mother is motionless, whimpering softly.  A scent of liquor permeates the air. 
He moves toward her, reaches out tentatively... 
Suddenly she jumps up, starts pacing franticaily-- 
MOTHER It's nice here.  It's a nice house.  Nothing wrong. (a beat) It's a good family.  Believe me, I know.  Nothing wrong here. (a beat) Your father is okay.  He's a good man.  You could learn somthing. 
She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror, stops-- 
MOTHER My, my!  Don't you think I have a good figure?  Your Father did. 
She sits in front of the mirror, studies her face, her eyes...her breasts-- 
MOTHER I was beautiful when your Dad met me.  I was out-a-sight! 
She giggles, starts applying makeup-- 
MOTHER I looked just like a movie star.  The minute he saw me singing, I knew just what he wanted. 
She fixes him with a conspiratorial look, whispers-- 
MOTHER He wanted to get into my panties. 
She makes funny, "jazzy" eyes at him, then stops suddenly, staring.  His face, mouth, eyes...a sudden stirring in her loins.  Her lips part, she moistens them unconsciously... 
She turns from the mirror and stares at him -- his look connects with her groin. She rises suddenly, walks slowly toward the bed, sits facing him-- 
MOTHER You look so pretty.  Just like me, honey.  You coulda been a girl.

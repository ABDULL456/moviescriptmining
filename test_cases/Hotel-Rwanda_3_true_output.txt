Of course, the BBC, five rooms. (lies) They are being prepared as we speak. I have ordered fresh flowers and complimentary champagne. 
Gloria picks up her bag. 
GLORIA Great, I really need a shower. 
PAUL Just give me a moment to get your keys. 
Paul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter Benedict hovering at the door. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (to Gloria) Excuse me for one second. 
Paul hurries over to Benedict. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Benedict, you should meet the BBC people. They could use your expertise. 
Benedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (whisper) Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here any moment. The BBC should talk to him. 
They join the BBC team. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of our best journalists. He covers all the big stories. I thought you should meet. 
Gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm. 
GLORIA Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria Fleming. BBC. 
Paul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure. 
GREGOIRE There are no more rooms. 
PAUL Give me the phone. 
Gregoire hands it over. Paul dials. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Madame Denver. I have very good news. I have a present for you, in return for the cancellation of your gorilla expedition I have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no extra charge. A luxury coach will leave in one hour. I'll send maids up to help you all pack. You're welcome. 
Paul hangs up, turns to Gregoire. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him I need three rooms. And send a team of maids up to the Americans. I want those rooms turned around in twenty minutes. 
PAUL heads for the glass doors and sees: 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
General Bizimungu, briefcase in hand, gives the tv interview, He's confident, controlled Benedict stands close by as Gloria interviews. 
GLORIA There are rumors, General, that your army, the Hutu army, consider these peace accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (laughs) Nonsense. At this moment we are making plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into our armed forces. 
GLORIA Then the army fully supports the president as he signs the peace agreement. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Of course, the president is a clever man, he knows what he is doing. Thank you for coming to Rwanda. (on the move). You will see what a beautiful country this is. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his hand out. Gregoire hands him keys. 
Paul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal. 
He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity. 
He wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'. 
He returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage. 
PAUL Forgive the hurry but I do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake. It is the most spectacular sight in all Africa. 
OB Lunch? All we do is eat. I thought there was famine in Africa. 
PAUL Exactly, we can't have our guests starving. What would they think of the Mille Collines back in the United States? 
Gen. Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty briefcase. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Keep that cockroach Benedict away from me. 
As the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check, hands her the briefcase. 
PAUL Same as last time. 
She nods, hurries off just as the BBC crew appears. Paul hands out keys, greets each. 
PAUL (CONT'D) The fifth room is your broadcast room. 
GLORIA Good. I'd like to book a massage. 
PAUL Of course. 
Jock, the Scottish cameraman, hangs behind as the others leave, takes his key. 
JOCK Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know? 
PAUL I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here. 
JOCK Can we phone them in, Paul? 
PAUL I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish. Ah, Zozo. 
Paul calls Zozo over. 
PAUL (CONT'D) You remember Zozo, from the Diplomat?

Elijah glops Rick. His skin starts to smoke. 
RICK AHHHHRRRGGG! 
Stuey Monster stalks Elijah onstage. Rick is smoking and shaking violently on the table. 
HERTZ 
turns to his EES cronies in the audience. He looks bored. 
HERTZ What a waste of twelve bucks. Let's get the machine and go. 
The other executives nod. 
RICK 
starts to transform. FWOOP! His ears spring out into huge monster ears, kinda like in Pinocchio. FWAAP! His mouth grows into a massive, Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth. FWEEP! His upper head does the same. 
His body follows suit. He bursts' out of the straps and grows into a drooling TEN FOOT TALL RICK MONSTER. He snarls at Stuey Monster. 
RICK MONSTER TIME TO DIE, TROLL! 
The crowd and the other freaks look on, tense. Stuey Monster instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo and a pen. 
STUEY MONSTER Rick! Rick! Could you sign this!? 
Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face. Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back. 
THE CROWD FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! 
Even Julie is screaming "Fight! Fight," beside herself with bloodthirsty glee. Ernie smacks her. 
The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche pro-wrestling moves. Stuey bashes Rick. Rick bashes Stuey, etc. 
ELIJAH Give him the skull cracker, ya big goon! 
ERNIE No way! The skull cracker is an illegal move! 
Stuey grabs Rick's hair and marches him around the stage. The crowd is taking sides, screaming out advice, and foaming at their mouths. 
ELIJAH Let's get this over with. Hey Hertz, tell your goons to (he turns to Hertz and is STUNNED) What the hell-!? 
HERTZ 
stands in front of the a group of EES HARDHATS who are using forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit. He notices Elijah and taps his executive ASSISTANT. 
ASSISTANT (TO ELIJAH) Ahem. At this point in time we at EES regret that we must leave this performance prematurely. 
ELIJAH What are you saying!? 
HERTZ What we're saying is... get stuffed, yokel. 
ELIJAH I figured I couldn't trust you corporate greaseballs! 
Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads "BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS." He breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside. 
A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises out of it. Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret nozzle atop the tank. He aims the nozzle at the EES group. 
ELIJAH Let me proudly introduce the latest in our product line, Noxon 25--now available in a convenient pump! 
HERTZ Bullshit! The Everything Except Shoes corporation releases no new products unless I give the order! 
ELIJAH I think it's time EES branched out a little. 
He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of yellow glop on the EES people. They scream in agony as their bodies melt together into one big mutating blob. 
Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--he's got a head bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show. 
ALISTAIR COOKE Ahhh! Head for the hills before he gets all of us! 
The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits, trampling poor Cooke like a roach. 
RICK MONSTER

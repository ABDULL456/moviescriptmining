OLIVERAS (V.O.) You want us to pick him up? 
LT. KELLAWAY Don't do a thing until I tell you. Just keep the SWAT team standing by. If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be we'll need all the help we can get. 
LT. KELLAWAY 
fires up his engine and pulls away. 
EXT. PARK - SUNSET 
Topiaried ivy reads: "Welcome to Peninsula Park." A small sign below that reads: "No dumping." 
Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park. 
EXT. BENCH 
Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into Tina. 
TINA Stanley, what are you doing here? 
STANLEY Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early. 
TINA A little. 
STANLEY I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay. 
TINA That's nice. (sits down) You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap. 
STANLEY (looking at the sky) It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors. 
TINA Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens. 
STANLEY Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way. (RISES) I guess I'll get going. 
TINA No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian. 
STANLEY Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel? 
TINA Yeah. He's sort of my manager. 
STANLEY Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal. 
TINA You really mean that, don't you? 
STANLEY Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories... 
TINA No, I mean, you're really worried about me. That's... real sweet, Stanley. 
STANLEY C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy? 
TINA I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have. 
STANLEY Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed? 
TINA Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian. 
STANLEY And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride. 
That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds. 
STANLEY (CONT.) (SIGHS) I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better get going. 
Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees. 
TINA (RISES) Stanley... wait! 
But he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the leaves all around her. 
The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust out he romances Tina in a deep syrupy French voice. 
THE MASK Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je' taime, Je any old tame! At last we are together mon petite bon bon! 
ANGLE ON THE BUSHES 
Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a distance. He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones. 
KELLAWAY This is Kellaway. I need back up and I need it now! Every available man down to Peninsula Park. 
INT. NEWSROOM - BULLPEN 
MURRAY, an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his notebook and pulls on his coat. 
MURRAY Looks like it's gonna be a long night. My wife is gonna kill me. 
PEGGY What is it, Murray? 
MURRAY The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Peninsula Park. We just picked it up over the police band. 
PEGGY Let me cover it, Murray! You go on home to Claire. 
MURRAY I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said... 
PEGGY (grabs her coat) I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I owe you one.

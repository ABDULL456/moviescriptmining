CASEY Dial someone else, okay? 
MAN You getting scared? 
CASEY No-bored. 
CLICK.  She hangs up.  The phone RINGS again.  She grabs it. 
CASEY Listen, asshole... 
MAN (deadly serious) NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND? 
Total silence.  He has gotten her full attention. 
CASEY Is this some kind of a joke? 
MAN More of a game, really. 
Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front doors...moving to it.  It's unlocked.  She bolts it. 
CASEY I'm two seconds from calling the police. 
MAN They'd never make it in time. 
Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking through the peephole. 
ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE. 
A distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a bit, relieved. 
CASEY What do you want? 
MAN (pure evil) TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. 
Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the phone, throwing it down on a side table when... 
THE DOORBELL CHIMES. 
Casey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes again. 
CASEY (calling out) Who's there? 
Another CHIME.  She moves to it. 
CASEY (louder) Who's there? 
No answer.  Fuck this.  It's time for the police.  She goes for the portable phone. Just as she picks it up... 
IT RINGS. 
Casey almost drops it, losing her breath... 
She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying nothing...listening, waiting... 
A long silence.  And then. 
MAN You should never say "Who's there?". Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. 
Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her damndest to hang tough. 
CASEY Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. 
MAN Or else what? 
CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating... 
CASEY My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... 
MAN I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. 
Busted.  She holds steady. 
CASEY I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone. 
MAN Sure... 
CASEY I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you. 
MAN I'm getting scared. 
CASEY I'm telling you the truth. I lied before... 
MAN I believe you... 
CASEY So you better leave. 
MAN His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? 
Silence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it. 
CASEY How do you know his name? 
MAN Go to the back door and turn on the porch light--again.

{"test1_input": "DUNBAR Let me help you. \nShe's too weak to run and falls face first in the grass. She starts to crawl. \nDunbar slips off Cisco and reaches down tentatively for her shoulder. She screams at his touch and he pulls away. But he follows on foot as she crawls. \nDUNBAR You're hurt... you need help. \nHe takes her again, this time holding her firmly. She struggles mightily, twisting onto her back. She lashes out at his face but he grabs her hands, holding them tight. They're nose to nose. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Don't... \nHe can't believe he heard it and she can't believe she said it. \nShe spits out a Stream of Sioux curses, throws her head back and wails like a wolf. Then she passes out. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nShe's lying in the same spot, still unconscious. The cuts on her arms have been bandaged up with strips of Old Glory. \nModestly, Dunbar lifts her dress to get at the bad thigh wound. As he ties it off, the lieutenant notices how white her skin is. He runs a finger over it. She is very still and he presses an ear to her heart. She's still breathing. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nDunbar is on Cisco. His big impression is gone. The uniform, and his hands and face are smeared with Stands With A Fist's blood. The girl is slung in front of him. \nHis arms are holding her. Her face is pressed against his chest. They've come a good distance and are approaching a smokey cloud. \nEXT. PONY HERD - DAY \nSmiles A Lot, Worm and Otter (who now sports a crude splint on his arm) are occupying an open space in the midst of a huge pony herd. \nThey should be on guard against enemies but the three boys are sitting on the ground, absorbed in a gambling game. \nEXT. PONY HERD - DAY \nDunbar is skirting the edge of the herd. Leaving the horses behind him, the lieutenant makes his way up a gentle slope. \nA powerful vision is upon him. \nTen Bears' village is rising slowly, like a curtain going up. The smoke from many fires, the willow poles fanning against the sky, the conical houses covered with well-used hides, the horses along the river, the children, the women, the men. An ancient tableau, fully alive before his eyes. \nEXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY \nDunbar has stopped on the slope leading down to the village, taking it all in. No one has seen him. He can hear human voices drifting up from the camp. \nStands With A Fist coughs lightly against his tunic and the lieutenant moves Cisco ahead at a walk. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nA woman and her children have come out of the breaks along the river and are marching back to the village when one of the kids sees him. With an ear-splitting shriek, the woman grabs up her children and runs screaming for the safety of the village. \nThere's pandemonium amongst the lodges. Everyone seems to be running everywhere at once. \nDunbar pulls Cisco to a halt a hundred yards from the first of the conical houses and slides off, taking the girl up in his arms. \nThe people of Ten Bear's village, realizing now that there is only one white man and that he is carrying someone, are massing with great curiosity on the outskirts of the town. \nWarriors, some of them mounted, have taken the front ranks. The women and children and elderly are standing just behind. \nInitial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone jockeys for a better look. \nStill holding Stands With A Fist in his arms, Dunbar suddenly stops on a familiar face... Wind In His Hair. \nHe lifts the girl resting in his arms and holds her out... as in offering. \nDUNBAR She's hurt. \nThe Sioux buzz is stronger now. The mounted warriors are getting excited. \nSuddenly, Wind In His Hair breaks ranks and starts for Dunbar at a determined walk. A nasty war club is held tightly in hand. \nDunbar stands his ground. \nWind In His Hair halts only a few steps in front of Dunbar. He barks at the intruder as he takes another step or two. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR You are not welcome here. \nAnother step and he is close enough to touch the white man. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR Go away from us... \nDunbar doesn't flinch. And Wind In His Hair's harangue is definitely part bluster. He's very curious about the woman in Dunbar's arms and now he peers down at her face. \nThe lieutenant looks down too and in a flash she is torn out of his grasp. \nHolding her in one strong arm, Wind In His Hair backs a pace or two and shouts once more at the lieutenant. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR Go away from us... go now. \nHe raises his club and shakes it at Dunbar. \nThough he doesn't understand the words, Dunbar gets the message. As he goes for his horse, Wind In His Hair marches back to his people with Stands With A Fist. \nThere is great commotion as the crowd surges in around Wind In His Hair. \nWith a look of profound disappointment, Dunbar walks away on Cisco. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nOtter, Worm and Smiles A Lot are riding in, drawn by the ruckus in the village. They see the white soldier oh his horse leaving the camp. They see the tumult in the village and realize they are in trouble, again. \nSome of the young, mounted warriors are shouting taunts at the departing soldier, calling for him to come back and fight. They seem set to take out after him when Kicking Bird suddenly appears in front of their ponies. \nKICKING BIRD The soldier did not come to fight -- he is going away and we will let him. \n", "test1_true": "The medicine man glances after the boys who just came in. Each boy, confronted now by an angry father or uncle, is being jerked off his pony. There's going to be discipline. \nKicking Bird looks back at the lieutenant. \nDunbar's head is down and his shoulders are slumped. It is a sight that makes the wheels in Kicking Bird's head turn. \nINT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - NIGHT \nAnother council is in progress. As before, the leading men are seated around Ten Bears' fire while the other warriors stand packed in the shadows. Wind In His Hair is seated close to the elders. \nTEN BEARS I am in agreement with Kicking Bird. We will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white man he is. \nWind In His Hair jumps into the conversation. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR If this council decides to talk with the man at the soldier fort then it will be so. But in my mind it is not right that a Sioux chief, a chief as great as Ten Bears, goes to ask the business of a puny, trespassing white man... a white soldier who has only a smart horse and a few white man clothes. \nThere are many yeses in response to this. As is his custom, Ten Bears lets the outburst subside, seeming unruffled all the while. Casually, he pops a piece of meat into his mouth and begins to chew. \nTEN BEARS I will not go... you will go... you and Kicking Bird. That is all I have to say. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nDunbar is sitting cross-legged in the grass. His mouth is occupied with chewing. In one hand is a knife, in the other is a chunk of slab bacon. He saws off a slice and extends it, waiting patiently. \nThe wolf is sitting only a few feet away. He wants the offered meat but cannot bring himself to eat from a human hand. Finally, Dunbar flips the bacon into the grass and Two Socks pounces on it. He takes his prize toward the river and out of view. \nDunbar starts for his quarters. He stops. The hair on the back of his neck is standing straight up. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nSix Sioux warriors, THE ESCORT, are sitting atop their ponies high on the ridge. \nDunbar buttons his tunic and casts a quick, backward glance at the quarters. A rifle is standing near the door. \nDunbar decides not to go after it. He straightens his bearings and he watches the approaching riders. It's only two -- Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird. The lieutenant bows at the waist. \nDUNBAR Welcome... (gesturing at them) Come... please... sit down. \nThe two men slide off their ponies. Dunbar throws an unreturned wave to the escort warriors. \nThere is a moment or two of silence. \nDUNBAR Would you like some coffee? Coffee? \nThere is no response. \nDUNBAR I'll get some cups. \nDunbar disappears inside his quarters. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nWind In His Hair and Kicking Bird are sitting comfortably under the awning, each holding steaming army-issue cups. They are staring straight ahead with a curious expression. \nDunbar is turning a handle on a machine. It is a coffee grinder. \nThe last of the beans goes down and Dunbar pauses for dramatic effect. Then he pulls out the drawer containing the fresh grounds and passes it to the medicine man. Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair both sniff the contents. \nDunbar gestures at their still full mugs -- neither one of them has taken a drink. \nDUNBAR Is the coffee not good? Too strong maybe? Here... \nDunbar reaches for a sack by the fire. Holding it in front of him, Dunbar suggests that Wind In His Hair put some of its contents into his mug. \nWind In His Hair finally does, but his blank expression indicates that he doesn't know what difference this could make. \nDunbar takes a lick at his fingers, suggesting that Wind In His Hair should do the same. A smile creeps over his face as the universal appeal of sugar is taking hold. Wind In His Hair has licked every bit off each finger. \nDUNBAR (to Kicking Bird) Do you want some? \nWind In His Hair doesn't wait for Kicking Bird's answer. He reaches over and dumps a good amount in Kicking Bird's cup, adding some more to his own for good measure. \nDUNBAR So what are you guys doing? Looking for buffalo? \nThere is no response. Wind In His Hair's attention is now on Cisco. \nDUNBAR He's a good one... good horse. My horse. \nWind In His Hair's interest borders on rude. Prompted by a light tap on his leg from Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair turns his attention back to Dunbar. \nDUNBAR Good horse. \nNo argument from Wind In His Hair. \nDUNBAR My horse. You see any buffalo? \nKicking Bird and Wind In His Hair are baffled. \nThe lieutenant is trying to jam a wadded blanket under the back of his tunic. \nDUNBAR Wait just a bit. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR (to Kicking Bird) His mind is gone. \nKicking Bird doesn't respond. He's still intent on the lieutenant. In wedging the blanket under his tunic, Dunbar has become a hunchback. He bends over in a weird attitude, and with a finger peeking over each side of his head, he begins a bizarre display of dancing, punctuated with snorts and bellows. \nKICKING BIRD Buffalo. \nDUNBAR (incorrectly in Sioux) Buffalo? \nKICKING BIRD (slowly) Buffalo. \nDUNBAR (getting it right) Buffalo. \n", "test1_id": 243, "test2_input": "The band's best hunters, two dozen of them, are making ready to chase the buffalo. It's the big time, no event is more important. The villagers -- mostly women, children, and elderly -- have gathered around each of the hunters. \nThe largest audience has gathered around Lieutenant Dunbar and Wind In His Hair. Wind In His Hair's pony is ready. Great bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump. Right now the warrior is drawing the same design along Cisco's rump. \nDunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by silently. Wind In His Hair is finished. He looks at Dunbar and nods at the paint as if asking for a response. \nDUNBAR I wish I knew what to say. \nA Sioux voice, using english words, sails out of the circle of watchers. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Say... thank you. \nStartled the men turn to the sound. The other Sioux are stunned too. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST (indicating the paint) His speed... his power... you have. \nDUNBAR Thank you. \nHe takes the warrior's hand in his own and shakes it crisply. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nIt's the first time we've seen the buffalo up close. They're fantastic creatures, powerful, brutish, untameable animals from another age. A great bull turns away from the others and lifts his purple, horned head to sniff the breeze. He can detect no sign of trouble and eventually returns to his browsing. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe hunters are advancing across the prairie, spreading out in a formation that will encircle part of the herd. \nThe lightning bolts on Wind In His Hair's pony are in motion. Cisco's bolts are moving too. \nThere's a lump in Dunbar's throat. He knows nothing of what is expected of him but he's doing it anyway. He glances to -- his right at Wind In His Hair and to his left at Kicking Bird. They're both concentrated on what lies ahead. \nFrom the corner of his eye, he sees Kicking Bird look back. The lieutenant looks too. \nIt's a minor flap. Three or four youngsters, eager to distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the hunters and are being turned back. Dunbar recognizes one of them as the boy who took charge of Cisco at the village... Smiles A Lot. \nLike Kicking Bird, Dunbar swings his face back to the front. They're close enough now to hear the low bellowing of the herd. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nA strike far up on the horned formation. Their ponies leap forward. The mad dash is on. \nDunbar's hat flies off at first spurt and now the lieutenant and his horse are hurling over the prairie. The little buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has put every ounce of his muscle to speed. They're burning up the ground. \nWhen Dunbar looks back over his shoulder, he's shocked to find that the best buffalo ponies the Sioux's have are far behind. He and Cisco are on their own. \nThe herd is in full flight and the sound of their stampede is overwhelming. The buffalo are very fast but Cisco is gaining with every stride. They've formed a great running wall in front of him and now Dunbar can see their rumps and tails and flying hooves. \nDunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his eyes as if in prayer. The sound of thousands of hooves is deafening. \nDunbar and Cisco have caught the buffalo. A few more strides and they'll be in. \nDunbar and Cisco are running with the buffalo. A shaggy head moves in and swipes at Cisco, but the little horse is too quick and too smart. He dodges away, nearly dumping the lieutenant in the process. \nDunbar rights himself and fires. It's a wild shot, only grazing the buffalo's shoulder. The report of the gun instantly scatters the herd and Dunbar pulls up, dust swirling all around him. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nSioux hunters stream past him, every man for himself zeroing in on targets. \nDunbar starts to dismount but something he sees stops him. \nA hundred yards away a small hunter is after a handful of buffalo who have splintered off from the rest. It's Smiles A Lot, trying to make a kill of his own. As Dunbar watches, the boy's inexperienced horse shies away and bucks, pitching the kid to the ground. \nA big bull breaks away from the splinter group, lowers his head and charges. \nDunbar kicks Cisco into a run, spits a spare bullet from his mouth and rams it into the chamber. \nSmiles A Lot is picking himself off the ground. The bull is in full charge. \nDunbar is riding with his knees. Both hands are holding the rifle. He'll never make it to the boy in time. He's got to make the shot. He squeezes the trigger. \nThe bullet plows home, exploding the bull's heart. The big buffalo's legs collapse but the momentum of his charge puts him into a skid. He comes to rest only a few yards away from Smiles A Lot. \nThe boy stands as the lieutenant rides up. Smiles A Lot is dazed but he's okay. \nDunbar hops off next to the dead buffalo. He's a huge one, a real grandfather and the lieutenant loses himself for a few moments in contemplation of this tremendous kill. Now he looks back to check the boy. \nSmiles A Lot has caught his pony and is racing away from the scene of his humiliation. \nThe sounds of approaching riders turns Dunbar's attention in a different direction. \nThe entire village is streaming onto the plains for the butchering. \nThe riders bearing down on him are being lead by Wind In His Hair. \nWind In His Hair jumps off his pony and, smiling broadly, slaps Dunbar's back with a good-natured blow of congratulations. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe buffalo has been split open and Wind In His Hair, kneeling at the bull's side, is feeling around in the cavity. He finds what he's looking for and gives it a jerk. \nIt's the liver, still warm and steaming. He offers it to Dunbar but the lieutenant, not having the faintest idea, only looks at it blankly. \nA sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual. \nWind In His Hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and happily bites off a chunk, letting the juices run from the edges of his mouth. Now he figures the lieutenant knows what to do, and hands the liver back to him. \nDunbar doesn't want to do this, but with the pressure of so many eyes and so much good will, he has little choice. Tentatively, he bites off a small piece and chews it thoughtfully. It's good. \nEncouraged by this good taste, Dunbar takes a man-sized bite. Shrill Sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the lieutenant. Dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his head. \nEXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY \nLittle butchering parties cluster around each fallen buffalo. \n", "test2_true": "Flame begins to lick at each of the bodies and we match dissolve -- the clusters of people have become groups surrounding fires at the temporary camp. \nEXT. FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT \nAll over camp people are crowding around fires, feasting on fresh meat. Children are playing everywhere, the dogs are having a field day with scraps and the voices of the people are happy. \nAt a little distance, we see Lieutenant Dunbar and Wind In His Hair excusing themselves from one of the fires. They start toward us. Wind In His Hair is sucking on a rib bone and seems to show no sign of slowing down his celebrating. Dunbar, following a couple paces behind, is a different story. He's had it. He spreads his hands to indicate an over-sized belly. \nDUNBAR Look I'm full... I can't tell the story again. \nWind In His Hair doesn't seem to hear. He points at the epaulettes on Dunbar's tunic. \nDUNBAR Go ahead. \nWind In His Hair reaches out and fingers the gold lieutenant's bars. He fingers a couple of the brass buttons as well. The tunic is something he obviously puts much store in. \nDUNBAR (signing) You want to try... put it on. \nHe unbuttons the tunic. \nDUNBAR Here. \nHe sloughs off the tunic and hands it over. Wind In His Hair slips out of the magnificent bone-pipe breastplate he's wearing and gives it to Dunbar as he wriggles into the tunic. The fit is too tight, the material too scratchy but those things are of little consequence to Wind In His Hair. He loves the tunic. \nWith urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the breastplate. Dunbar slips it over his head and Wind In His Hair helps him with the ties. \nNow it's the lieutenant's turn to be amazed. The breastplate as craftsmanship at its finest. He runs his fingers over the ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist. He looks up at Wind In His Hair. \nThe warrior nods approvingly, as though a good deal has heen struck. \nDUNBAR This is too much... I can't take this... \nBut for Wind In His Hair it is already a trade. \nWind In His Hair spots the next fireside and veers toward it. Dunbar holds him back. \nDUNBAR I can't... No more... \nWind In His Hair grins. He holds up a single finger. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR One more... eat... \nDUNBAR I can't, I'm full... very full... \nStill holding up the finger, he guides Dunbar into the firelight of the next party. \nImmediately, men jump up to greet the celebrities. Women begin to saw off more meat. \nEXT. FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT \nAs Dunbar gnaws on a rib, he glances at the friendly faces around the fire. His eyes suddenly stop their roving. \nA BIG WARRIOR is wearing the military hat he lost on the hunt. It's a little too big. The brim touches the top of the big warrior's ears. \nNow the Big Warrior notices that Dunbar is staring at him. Their eyes meet. \nDUNBAR That's my hat. \nAt the sound of these words the cheerful talk around the fire begins to fade. \nDunbar touches the top of his head and points to his hat. \nDUNBAR My hat. \nBIG WARRIOR I found it on the prairie. It's mine. \nA silence falls between the two men. wind In His Hair speaks. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR That hat belongs to my friend here. \nBIG WARRIOR He left it on the prairie. He didn't want it. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR You can see that he wants it now. \nThe Big Warrior shakes his head. He won't budge. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR We all know that is a soldier hat. We all know who wears it. If you want to keep it that's alright. But give something for it. \nThe other men around the fire murmur their assent. The Big Warrior thinks for a moment then abruptly gets to his feet. \nHe looks at his waist and unfastens a knife in a beautiful worked scabbard. He tosses it across to Dunbar. \nThe lieutenant examines the trade item a moment. Now he looks back at the big warrior. A smile breaks slowly across his face and Dunbar nods. At last he smiles back. It's a trade. \nAnd at that, the cheerful voices around the fire are at it again. \nDunbar takes his new knife out and as he watches the light flicker off the blade a voice comes into his ear. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR (pointing to his head) Good trade. \nDunbar looks into his smiling face. He laughs. \nDUNBAR Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep. \nHe excuses himself and walks away from the light of the fire, finds himself alone in the shadows, still marveling at his breastplate. \nEXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT \nWind In His Hair finishes sucking on the rib bone and tosses it to a dog that's been trailing him. Kicking Bird is walking toward him. He notices the new tunic and gives wind In His Hair a dubious look. \nKICKING BIRD Where is loo ten tant? \nWIND IN HIS HAIR I ate him. \n", "test2_id": 244, "test3_input": "DANCES WITH WOLVES Wait. \nSmiles A Lot stops. Dances With Wolves squints into the feeble light. He can see the outline of the village below, but upriver the light is still too murky to make anything out. \nAnother bolt of lightning flashes. There they are. A long line of horsemen crossing river a mile or so upstream from the village. The Pawnee. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN \nIn front of Ten Bears' lodge, Dances With Wolves is passing out the last of the rifles. Warriors are grabbing handfuls of bullets out of an open ammo box. \nTen Bears is watching this procedure. And while he watches, he thinks. \nThe guns have been passed out and, except for a slight murmur among the warriors, it's strangely quiet. The band's best fighters are gone and many men don't know what to do next. They're looking to Ten Bears for leadership. \nBut the old man is looking at Dances With Wolves. He holds up a hand for quiet. \nTEN BEARS Hear us now. (to Dances With Wolves) A white soldier with many far-shooting guns... how would he fight the Pawnee? \nEveryone is waiting. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I would hide in the village. \nThe warriors send up a chorus of derisive cries but Ten Bears angrily quiets them. \nTEN BEARS Dances With Wolves has not finished. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I would let the enemy think we are asleep... let him come close. Then we would shoot together and run to fight them, drive them into the river and kill so many that they would never trouble us again. \nTen Bears smiles. \nTEN BEARS I am of the same mind as Dances With Wolves... we should kill so many that they never trouble us again. \nEXT. RIVER - DAWN \nTwo of the camp dogs are lapping water at the river's edge, behind them lies the quiet village. Suddenly both heads jerk up. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nDances With Wolves steps into the lodge, followed by Smiles A Lot. They both have rifles and Dances With Wolves' old long-barreled revolver is holstered at his waist. \nBefore him is a quiet, tense scene. \nThe women are huddled together on a single sleeping platform. Kicking Bird's three children nestled between them. Two of the kids are crying softly. \nBlack Shawl grips a hatchet and Stands With A Fist has a rifle. They will both fight. But they are both scared. Everyone in the village has a life at stake. In one glimpse, Dances With Wolves understands what he will be fighting for. \nHe looks once more at the women and children and ducks out of the lodge. \nEXT. RIVER - DAWN \nThe feet of the enemy are moving past the dogs, whose bodies are still and riddled with arrows. In front of them the river is full of Pawnee crossing over toward the village. There is no sound. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN \nIt has stopped raining but the ground is still soaked and an early morning fog is swirling through the camp. Clumped in groups of five or six, behind the lodges nearest the river, are Sioux warriors with rifles. They're absolutely quiet as they wait for the enemy. \nDances With Wolves looks across a clearing that slopes down to the breaks fronting the river. Nothing. \nWait. A movement. And another. Another. The heads of men lurking in the fog. He glances at the defenders. \nMost of the warriors are huddled behind the line of lodges watching him. Ten Bears raises a hand. \nThe Pawnee are visible now, a war party at its fiercest, painted and feathered and armed to the teeth. \nComing on foot, the first of them have reached the edge of the clearing. They start into a stealthy trot, more and more of them breaking into a run. \nA Pawnee war cry goes up and, as the others join in. Ten Bears lowers his hand. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN \nIn ragged formation, the Sioux pour from behind the lodges and thirty rifles fire into the vanguard of the Pawnee charge. \nThe smoke of many rifles mixes with the ground fog as the Sioux run screaming down on the Pawnee. Dances With Wolves screams too as he runs flat out down the slope. \nA Pawnee warrior suddenly looms out of the smoke and they crash together violently. \nThe two fighters tumble over the ground, each grappling for an advantage. The hand to hand fighting all around them is furious and, shrouded in smoke and fog, it has a surreal quality. \nDances With Wolves works the Navy revolver from its holster and shoots the Pawnee in the face. \nEXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nA child sticks his head out from under the edge of the lodge. Momentarily he is jerked back into the lodge out of sight. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nNow there's a ripping at the lodge entrance. The flap is being torn away. Black Shawl is desperately pulling the child back from the edge of the lodge. \nSuddenly, there he is... a Pawnee warrior. But now it's his turn to be surprised. He sees Stands with A Fist taking aim, and it's too late. She fires the rifle and the Pawnee explodes back out of the lodge. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAWN \nThrough the smoke, Dances With Wolves can just catch a glimpse of Ten Bears. He is moving through the village at a trot, loading his gun. \nHe spots a Sioux warrior grappling with a Pawnee, sights and shoots the Pawnee point blank. He trots off, reloading once more. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN \nDances With Wolves is bumped from behind and is knocked to his knees. It's a frantic Pawnee war horse, loose on the battlefield. Dances With Wolves grabs a hunk of mane and swings onto his back. \nHe has a real view now. The Pawnee are taking a terrible licking. Already they are being beaten back to the river. \nA turbaned enemy is falling back to the river, firing arrows as he goes. Dances With Wolves goes after him. \nEXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN \n", "test3_true": "INT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN \nPretty Shield stands in front of a group of children, ready to defend them. \nThe Pawnee is inside now. He has a wild desperate look and in a moment his hatchet will be flailing its way through these people. \nBut he never takes a step. Instead he suddenly sinks to his knees and we see another arrow join the one that is already buried in his back. The warrior keels over and Pretty Shield looks through the open flap to see the grinning face of Stone Calf. \nWithout hesitation, Pretty Shield snatches a half-burned log from the fire and finishes the Pawnee. \nThe children watch, their faces a mixture of horror and intrigue. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN \nComing off the pony like a rodeo bulldogger, Dances With Wolves crashes through the river taking the Pawnee in a headlock. \nSomehow they both keep their feet and hurtle down the hill at a weird run. A small cottonwood stops their momentum, the Pawnee taking most of the blow. \nDances With Wolves grabs either side of the man's head and starts banging his skull against the tree trunk. Shortly, he notices that the man's eyes are dead. \nThe Pawnee was impaled on impact by the stub of a broken branch low on the trunk. \nDances With Wolves shrinks back from this gruesome sight and staggers toward the village. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAWN \nStone Calf, his bow and arrow at the ready, is looking for more enemies to kill. \nSuddenly from the corner of his eye the old man senses an attack. But he is too late. A Pawnee war club crushes his skull and the old man collapses. \nNow we can see his attacker. It is the fierce Pawnee warrior who killed Timmons the wagon driver. He glowers down at the body of Stone Calf and swings his club toward the old man's head once again. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN \nDances With Wolves squints toward the village just in time to see the Toughest take another shot at the prostrate, white- headed form of Stone Calf. \nDances With Wolves begins to run. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAWN \nThe Toughest has his knife to Stone Calf's forehead and is preparing to scalp his victim when something strikes him in the lower leg. \nHe looks down to find a small arrow imbedded in his calf. He looks up to see three boys, Otter, Worm, and Smiles A Lot, huddled at the edge of the battlefield. \nHe turns back to finish the job when another arrow hits him. Enraged he breaks off the arrow, leaps onto a horse and charges the kids. \nTheir faces go ashen as the Toughest bears down on them. \nOtter's arrow flies weakly into the air. The boys turn and run for their lives. \nThe Toughest would catch them with ease but now, he sees half a dozen howling Sioux warriors angling in to cut him off. He knows in a glance that the fight has been lost. He also knows that he can still escape if he changes direction. He veers for the river. \nThe Sioux are distraught. The Toughest will get away. \nBut wait, Dances with Wolves is at full speed now. He is streaking across the battlefield. \nSuddenly, the Pawnee himself is hurtling through space, driven there by the full force impact of Dances With Wolves' shoulder which has caught him rib high. \nBoth men hit the ground grappling and rolling. \nA knife flashes in the Toughest's hand and Dances With Wolves can only react quick enough to keep the knife from a vital spot. As it is, the blade lays open a huge gash on his arm. \nThey square off. The Toughest knows the advantage is his. He smiles grimly at Dances With Wolves and grunts sadistically. \nBut the sound from his throat is cut short by the simultaneous arrival of five Sioux arrows. Before the Pawnee can fall, six Sioux warriors are on him tearing him to pieces. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY \nDances With Wolves climbs to his feet and discovers that the battlefield is no longer so. The fighting has stopped. \nIt's a scene of carnage and joy. The Pawnee attackers lay where they fell. \nSIOUX 1 I killed this one. \nSIOUX 2 This one still breathes. \nThe Sioux victors are in high spirits as they hop around finishing off the wounded and counting coup on the dead. \nDances With Wolves looks down at himself. His body is streaked with blood, much of it his own. His arm is bleeding freely but he is too repulsed to move forward and too exhausted to retreat into the breaks. \nDances With Wolves now looks up to see the lifeless body of Stone Calf. Ten Bears is hugging him. Pretty Shield starts to kneel beside her mourning husband. \nSIOUX 3 (O.S.) Dances With Wolves... \nBefore he knows it, Sioux fighters are moving all around him, chanting his name. Like ants rolling a pebble up a hill, they push him into the middle of the battlefield. In a daze he allows himself to be carried along. \nWhen he looks up again he can see women and children emerging from the lodges. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.) It was hard to know how to feel. I had never been in a battle like this one. This had not been a fight for territory or riches or to make men free. This battle had no ego. It had been fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through winter, to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away. I felt a pride I had never felt before. \nDances With Wolves looks down and recognizes the face of a man he has just killed. Several warriors are crowding around him now. Dances With Wolves points at the body. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I shot this one. \n1ST WARRIOR Yes, I saw you shoot him. \n2ND WARRIOR You killed that one too. \nAs the sun breaks fully through the clouds, the little knot of warriors, Dances With Wolves in their midst, continues its triumphant tour of the battleground. The men are hugging and slapping each other on the back. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES (V.O.) I had never really known who John Dunbar was. Perhaps because the name itself had no meaning. But as I heard my Sioux name being called over and over, I knew for the first time who I really was. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \n", "test3_id": 245}

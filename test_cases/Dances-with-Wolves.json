{"train": "DANCES WITH WOLVES \nWritten by \nMichael Blake \nMAY 23, 1989 Final Draft \nINT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY \nA black screen. \nThe sound of a knife cutting through boot leather. \nFade in on the waists of two men (THE SURGEONS) hovering around a crude operating table. \nIn the extreme background, TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are just leaving. \nSURGEON 1 (O.S.) Is this the last one? \nOne of the bearers stops and looks back. His face is numb. And he nods hollowly. \nWe cannot see the patient stretched out on the table. But we do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting the man's boot off. \nSURGEON 2 (O.S.) God, what a mess... at least there's no gangrene. \nSURGEON 1 (O.S.) There will be if it doesn't come off. \nSURGEON 2 (O.S.) Well I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.  Let's coffee up... he can wait a few more minutes. \nAs the TWO SURGEONS duck through a tent flap in the background we see a mangled foot, torn by shrapnel, it oozes blood from a cut clear to the bone. \nLIEUTENANT JOHN J. DUNBAR'S eyes are now open. He's a young man, his features sharp and handsome. With effort, he lifts his head and searches the room. \nHis eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man lying in bloodsoaked sheets. He's whimpering like a child. \nDunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating table. As his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a crate filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs. \nA cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of the boots. \nLieutenant Dunbar brings the boot onto the operating table. He tries to pull it on his mangled foot, but the pain makes him cry out. Deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks a piece of it between his teeth. \nTears of pain are rolling down his face. A sweat has broken out on his forehead and with great determination he pulls the boot on. \nEXT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY \nThe two weary surgeons sip on steaming mugs of coffee, their white coats spattered with blood. Their brief respite is interrupted by the sound of a muffled scream. \nTogether they turn and rush back into the tent. \nINT. FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY \nThe operating table is empty save the broken cane and a small pool of blood. Dunbar is gone. \nLEGEND: ST. DAVID'S FIELD, TENNESSEE - 1862 \nEXT. CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY \nIn a natural valley below is a peaceful field.  And on either side of the field, seperated by a hundred yards of green, are low rock walls. \nSeveral dairy cows are lying dead in the field. \nA group of MOUNTED UNION OFFICERS, ride onto the crest of the hill and look down at the field. The distinguished man with a long grey beard is GENERAL TIDE. \nEXT. CONFEDERATE WALL - DAY \nRagged CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS crouch sullenly behind one of the walls. \nEXT. UNION WALL - DAY \nAnd just behind the other wall are UNION MEN, better equipped perhaps, but just as weary as their enemies. \nWe hold on one man, an enlisted soldier, SERGEANT PEPPER. He chances to glance behind and squints at a strange sight. \nA solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him. The sun is at his back, giving him a ghostly feel. Eerily he takes a step or two forward. He's limping badly. \nThe sergeant recognizes him. It's Dunbar. \nPEPPER Lieutenant... izat you? \nDunbar says nothing. He just stands and stares. It unnerves the sergeant. \nPEPPER What're you doing here lieutenant? \nDUNBAR This is where I belong... this is my outfit. \nThe sergeant stares at Dunbar's foot. \nPEPPER You went to hospital? \nDUNBAR It was no good... what's going on here? \nA ping of riflefire flies overhead and the sergeant dives for the wall. He calls over his shoulder. \nPEPPER Better come to cover lieutenant... those boys are shooters. \nDunbar settles next to the sergeant. \nPEPPER What's goin' on here... seems to be the question alright... you could ask the major but he don't know. He's busy tryin' to figger out how come the officer's mess run outta peach ice cream... \nThe sergeant nods at the distant hill and Dunbar looks too. \nPEPPER General's come up to see the show but all he knows is there ain't no show... \nNow he nods toward the trees behind them and the lieutenant follows. Several union men are clustered around a huge hunk of material attached to a gondola. \nThe sound of men's voices is coming near. Suddenly, General Tide is peering down at him. Dunbar stares back, glassy eyed. \nDUNBAR Don't take off my foot. \nGeneral Tide stares down into Dunbar's blank face. He kneels next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear. \nGENERAL TIDE You rest easy son... you'll keep you're foot. As God is my judge, you'll keep it. \nThe general looks up at one of his aides. \nGENERAL TIDE Bring up my ambulance... \nAIDE Sir? \nGENERAL TIDE Bring up my ambulance. And bring my surgeon with it. We've got an officer who's worth something lying here. \nThe aide dashes off to do what he's told, as General Tide gently removes Dunbar's foot from the stirrup and lays it carefully on the ground. The image fades out. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe image of a boot fades in, pull back to see that a lone rider is coming toward us. He has had a long and dusty trip. It's Lieutenant Dunbar. He's still riding the little buckskin. \nLEGEND - FORT HAYS. KANSAS - 1863 \nDunbar pulls up short. He stares thoughtfully at something in the distance. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) The strangeness of this life cannot be measured. In trying to produce my own death, I was elevated to the status of a living hero. \nDunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to cover his back. In the distance we can see an isolated and dreary military post. \nThe sky is very blue. The sun is bright. A rough-hewn, unfenced fort is straight ahead. \nThere are several miscellaneous stone structures, a well- stocked stable, barracks, officer's quarters and in the center of it all, a headquarters building. \nLieutenant Dunbar, riding straight and tall on his powerfully built buckskin, Cisco, passes into view. He's headed for the center of the fort. \nINT. FORT HAYS HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nSilhouetted against the outside, Lieutenant Dunbar pauses in the wide doorway of headquarters. We can hear the distant sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here it's strangely quiet. \nA SERGEANT sits at a desk in the foyer. Across the way, at another desk, is an enlisted CLERK. Both men glance from their paperwork at the man in the doorway. But it's only a glance and they go right on shuffling paper. \nFootfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer with slick, black hair swings into the foyer. He too has a slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post. \nThe blue-eyed officer, LIEUTENANT ELGIN, and Dunbar meet at the doorway. Dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his hand. \nDUNBAR Where can I find Major... Fambrough? \nELGIN Turn right... all the way to the end of the hall. \nBeing roughly the same age and rank these two might idle awhile, but Dunbar is eager. He's already moving. \nFAMBROUGH (O.S.) Lt. John J. Dunbar. \nDUNBAR Sir? \nDunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. No one is there. \nINT. FAMBROUGH'S OFFICE - DAY \nSitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is MAJOR FAMBROUGH. \nFAMBROUGH Lt. John J. Dunbar. \nLt. Dunbar is standing in front of the desk. \nDUNBAR Yes sir? \nFAMBROUGH Indian fighter, huh? \nDUNBAR Excuse me? \nFAMBROUGH (indicating paper) Your orders say you are to be posted on the frontier. The frontier is Indian country. I quickly deduced that you are an Indian fighter. \nHe arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. He has sad swollen eyes. He is an army lifer passed over too many times for promotion and right now does not look like a well man. \nFAMBROUGH I did not ascend to this position by being stupid. \nDUNBAR No sir. \nFambrough returns to the order. Dunbar watches him in silence. \nThe major's tunic is covered with food stains. Sweat has broken out all over his head. His grooming is awful. His hands are trembling slightly. Something is very wrong with him. \nNow the major sees something on the official paper. He looks quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving his lips but making no sound. \nFAMBROUGH It says here you've been decorated. \nDUNBAR Yes sir. \nFAMBROUGH And they sent you out here to be posted? \nDUNBAR Actually sir, I'm here at my own request... I want to see the frontier. \nFAMBROUGH You want to see the frontier? \nDUNBAR Yes sir... before it's gone. \nThe major fixes Dunbar with a sly look. \nFAMBROUGH Such a smart lad coming straight to me. \nStill sly, Fambrough digs into a side drawer. There is the distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. Now Fambrough has what he wants, a blank official form. He begins to fill it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way. \nFAMBROUGH Sir Knight, I am sending you on a knight's errand. You will report to Captain Cargill at the furthermost outpost of the realm... Fort Sedgewick. \nLooking over his shoulder at the journal, we see that this latest entry is one of many and Dunbar is embellishing it with a drawing of a star. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nDunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of supplies. He is writing in his journal. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) We have been gone four days now and still we have seen no signs of life. Only earth and sky. \nDunbar stops his writing. \nDUNBAR How far do you make the fort? \nTIMMONS Far. \nDUNBAR How far? \nTIMMONS Forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's the big hurry on Sedgewick? \nDUNBAR It's going to be my post... my home. \nTIMMONS You ain't hard to please, I'll say that. \nTimmons slows the wagon and stops.  He has seen something. \nTIMMONS Look yonder. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nA cluster of bones bleached white, are lying in the tall grass. Human bones. Dunbar is squatting next to them. Timmons' head dips into view over his shoulder and the teamster's mouth splits into a toothless grin. \nTIMMONS Somebody back east is sayin'... \"why don't he write?\" Stupid bastard. \nThe teamster spits and starts for the wagon. Dunbar comes to his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon. Then, he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel. Looking off he can only guess at the drama here. The sun is sinking fast below the great expanse of prairie. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAWN \nA hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat, CAPTAIN CARGILL, is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope. One hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw. He sticks the telescope in his overcoat pocket. He wedges a hand into his mouth and wiggles a loose tooth. He gives it a tug but it is not ready to come out. \nThe breeze is coming up and Captain Cargill pulls his overcoat closed. As he slips his last button through the hole, it breaks off, bounces off of his foot and rolls a few feet down the bluff. \nCaptain Cargill watches the button forlornly, making no move to go after it. He raises his head once more and looks to the east. Nothing is out there. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK CUT BANK - DAWN \nCargill is walking along the base of the cut bank. He stops, staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff. Their entrance covered with \"found\" draperies of all description. He works up the courage to call out. \nCARGILL Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest, you don't have to talk to me... just please come out. \nAt last there's some real movement behind one of the holes and CORPORAL GUEST crawls through one of the curtains. He neither salutes nor speaks. He blinks down at Cargill, looking more like a hobo than a soldier. \nCARGILL It's the end... assemble the men in front of my quarters. \nEXT. CARGILL'S QUARTERS - DAY \nThe \"MEN\" have lined up in front of Cargill's sad, sod hut; pitiful men. Sick, moth-eaten, crushed in spirit. There are nine of them. Just behind Cargill is a half-collapsed supply house and a broken down corral holding two bony horses. \nCargill has a brave face and a broken heart. \nCARGILL You hate me... but I feel none of the same for you... you men stayed. You stayed after they took all our horses. You stayed after all the others deserted. You stayed on the promise that the army would resupply us. I've looked for that wagon from Fort Hays just as you have... day after miserable day. All I can say is that I'm proud of you. Get your things men, we're leaving this place. The army... can go to hell. \nThe zombie troops have already broken ranks, lurching back to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks. \nCargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down sign that hangs askew above his quarters: \"Fort Sedgewick.\" \nEXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DUSK \nA solitary WOLF trots along the top of a bluff overlooking the river. He has two white socks running up his front legs. An old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle. He's watching the ruins of Fort Sedgewick. \nThe little band of troops, all on foot, with their two lame horses trailing behind are fading in the distance. \nEXT. WAGON CAMP - DAWN \nThe wagon is parked in a shallow depression, its team unhitched. Under the wagon the forms of two men lay curled up in blankets. \nDunbar is sleeping peacefully, his nose pressed against a jacket. Now his nostrils begin to twitch. His face turns sour and he wakes to find that he's been sleeping against the stink of Timmons. Flies buzz about the teamster's sleeping body. \nDunbar quickly pulls away from the bad smell. He rolls out from under the wagon and clambers to his feet. \nLieutenant Dunbar looks out over the prairie. It's going to be a spectacular day. \nIn the far distance, a column of buzzards is circling. Dunbar has paused to watch them. He ducks back under the wagon. \nDUNBAR Timmons... Timmons. \nNo response from the deep-sleeping driver. Dunbar starts to move closer to shake him awake but the odor under there makes him think twice. He snatches up the arrow and probes under the wagon. \nDUNBAR Timmons. \nThe teamster comes awake with a squeal, he joins Dunbar staring up at the circling birds. \nDUNBAR Something's out there... \nTIMMONS Somethin' dead. \nDUNBAR Might have a look. \nTIMMONS Might stay clear of whatever did the killin'. \nTimmons' mood is different now. He begins to hitch the team with a new sense of urgency. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nFrom a high point on the prairie we can see the wagon moving west. And no more than half a mile away we can see Cargill's column, moving east. Neither is aware of the other's presence. \nSeveral buzzards are settling on a half-butchered horse. It's one of the animals that was with Cargill's command. We can hear men singing. The shaky little column from Fort Sedgewick is marching east for Fort Hays. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nThe spectacular face of Kicking Bird is staring at something. \nHe's looking thoughtfully at the \"new\" Fort Sedgewick; the tidy grounds, the great awning, the repaired corral. The beautiful, buckskin standing inside. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nComfortable with his nakedness, Dunbar is meandering along the stream in no particular hurry. He's very white. His skin practically sparkles in the sun. \nDunbar is making his way up the bluff. The steepest part is at the lip and here he drops to all fours. \nDunbar's face comes into view. He freezes. \nSomeone is creeping under the shade of the awning... an aboriginal man. \nDunbar's head pops down behind the bluff. \nThe lieutenant is down on his naked haunches. His heart is pounding in his ears. Sweat has broken out on his face. His mouth is dry as ash. \nHe's playing back images in fragments. A deerskin shirt, strands of hair sewn along each sleeve. Fringed leggins. A dark, faded breechclout. Moccasins with beading. A single, large feather drooping behind a head of shiny, black hair. Braids wrapped in fur. A lethal stone club hanging from a red hand. No eyebrows on a magnificent, primitive face. \nDunbar stays in a crouch, trying to think on jellied legs. His breathing has quickened. His mouth is open. \nA horses' whinny startles him. \nEver so slowly, the lieutenant peers over the bluff. \nThe aboriginal man is in the corral. He's walking slowly toward Cisco. One hand is held out reassuringly, the other is grasping a rope. He's making gentle, cooing sounds and is only a step or two from being able to loop his line over the horse's neck. \nDUNBAR You there! \nKicking Bird jumps straight into the air. As he lands he whirls to meet the voice that startled him. \nDunbar is coming. His hands are clenched and his arms are swinging stiffly at his sides. \nKicking Bird has turned to stone at the sight of this horror. With a sharp intake of breath, he staggers back a few steps. Then he turns and runs, tearing through the corral fence as if it were made of twigs. He leaps onto his horse and quirts the pony into full gallop. \nDunbar is watching from the yard. His jaw is clenched, his hands are still fisted. \nThe great grassland is empty. Kicking Bird is gone. \nINT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY \nThe first of three carbine boxes is lugged off the stack. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe three boxes are stacked on the open prairie. Suddenly a shovelful of dirt flies out of an unseen spot next to the crates. Another flying shovelful. And another. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Have made first contact with a wild Indian. One came to the fort and tried to steal my horse. Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation. Am burying excess ordnance, lest it fall into enemy hands. \nThe last square of sod is placed carefully on the surface of the earth. Dunbar drives a bleached rib bone into the ground at an angle just in front of his cache. \nDunbar steps back from his work. The replaced sod is invisible. The guns will not be found. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe lieutenant sits atop Cisco scouting along the bluff. Fort Sedgewick lies in the background. \nINT. QUARTERS - DAY \nDunbar's journal lies open on his bunk. We hear a digging sound in the background. The lieutenant is facing the wall of his quarters. Using a bayonet as a cutting tool, he has carved a window out of the sod. He's nearly finished and is just tidying up. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Have made all the preparations I can think of. I cannot mount an adequate defense but will try to make a big impression when they come. Waiting. \nFinished, he retreats to his bunk and sits staring across at his new window. He glances at the journal by his side and has a thought. He picks it up and starts to write. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) The man I encountered was a magnificent looking fellow. \nEXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY \nAn old Indian man sits in the shade outside his lodge. His skin is leathery, his hair grey and wispy but his eyes are bright as diamonds. He is TEN BEARS, well past sixty, but still strong enough to be the head man. He is, for the most part, oblivious to the GRANDCHILD squirming in his lap. \nHe's smoking a long-stemmed pipe, but the main object of his interest is an old woman squatting next to him... PRETTY SHIELD. She's pounding away at something in a bowl. \nTen Bears looks up to notice Kicking Bird. The medicine man is passing not far away and Ten Bears' eyes follow him carefully, not glancing away until Kicking Bird has ducked into his lodge. \nTEN BEARS Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself these last few days. I do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone. \nThe old woman looks up from her pounding but does not respond. \nTEN BEARS What does his wife say? \nPRETTY SHIELD He is keeping to himself. \nTen Bears gives his wife a challenging look and she bristles. \nPRETTY SHIELD That's what she says. \nTen Bears accepts this. Then he looks down at the bowl. \nTEN BEARS Make sure that meat is soft... my teeth hurt. \nTen Bears looks once more at the entrance of Kicking Bird's lodge. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY \nKicking Bird sits next to the fire playing with his son but he is preoccupied with something. \nThere is a rustle of movement at the tent flap, and Ten Bears peers in. \nTEN BEARS May I come in? \nThe little boy races over to the old chief, Kicking Bird makes a move to pull him back, but Ten Bears indicates the boy should stay. \nDUNBAR Let me help you. \nShe's too weak to run and falls face first in the grass. She starts to crawl. \nDunbar slips off Cisco and reaches down tentatively for her shoulder. She screams at his touch and he pulls away. But he follows on foot as she crawls. \nDUNBAR You're hurt... you need help. \nHe takes her again, this time holding her firmly. She struggles mightily, twisting onto her back. She lashes out at his face but he grabs her hands, holding them tight. They're nose to nose. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Don't... \nHe can't believe he heard it and she can't believe she said it. \nShe spits out a Stream of Sioux curses, throws her head back and wails like a wolf. Then she passes out. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nShe's lying in the same spot, still unconscious. The cuts on her arms have been bandaged up with strips of Old Glory. \nModestly, Dunbar lifts her dress to get at the bad thigh wound. As he ties it off, the lieutenant notices how white her skin is. He runs a finger over it. She is very still and he presses an ear to her heart. She's still breathing. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nDunbar is on Cisco. His big impression is gone. The uniform, and his hands and face are smeared with Stands With A Fist's blood. The girl is slung in front of him. \nHis arms are holding her. Her face is pressed against his chest. They've come a good distance and are approaching a smokey cloud. \nEXT. PONY HERD - DAY \nSmiles A Lot, Worm and Otter (who now sports a crude splint on his arm) are occupying an open space in the midst of a huge pony herd. \nThey should be on guard against enemies but the three boys are sitting on the ground, absorbed in a gambling game. \nEXT. PONY HERD - DAY \nDunbar is skirting the edge of the herd. Leaving the horses behind him, the lieutenant makes his way up a gentle slope. \nA powerful vision is upon him. \nTen Bears' village is rising slowly, like a curtain going up. The smoke from many fires, the willow poles fanning against the sky, the conical houses covered with well-used hides, the horses along the river, the children, the women, the men. An ancient tableau, fully alive before his eyes. \nEXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY \nDunbar has stopped on the slope leading down to the village, taking it all in. No one has seen him. He can hear human voices drifting up from the camp. \nStands With A Fist coughs lightly against his tunic and the lieutenant moves Cisco ahead at a walk. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nA woman and her children have come out of the breaks along the river and are marching back to the village when one of the kids sees him. With an ear-splitting shriek, the woman grabs up her children and runs screaming for the safety of the village. \nThere's pandemonium amongst the lodges. Everyone seems to be running everywhere at once. \nDunbar pulls Cisco to a halt a hundred yards from the first of the conical houses and slides off, taking the girl up in his arms. \nThe people of Ten Bear's village, realizing now that there is only one white man and that he is carrying someone, are massing with great curiosity on the outskirts of the town. \nWarriors, some of them mounted, have taken the front ranks. The women and children and elderly are standing just behind. \nInitial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone jockeys for a better look. \nStill holding Stands With A Fist in his arms, Dunbar suddenly stops on a familiar face... Wind In His Hair. \nHe lifts the girl resting in his arms and holds her out... as in offering. \nDUNBAR She's hurt. \nThe Sioux buzz is stronger now. The mounted warriors are getting excited. \nSuddenly, Wind In His Hair breaks ranks and starts for Dunbar at a determined walk. A nasty war club is held tightly in hand. \nDunbar stands his ground. \nWind In His Hair halts only a few steps in front of Dunbar. He barks at the intruder as he takes another step or two. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR You are not welcome here. \nAnother step and he is close enough to touch the white man. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR Go away from us... \nDunbar doesn't flinch. And Wind In His Hair's harangue is definitely part bluster. He's very curious about the woman in Dunbar's arms and now he peers down at her face. \nThe lieutenant looks down too and in a flash she is torn out of his grasp. \nHolding her in one strong arm, Wind In His Hair backs a pace or two and shouts once more at the lieutenant. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR Go away from us... go now. \nHe raises his club and shakes it at Dunbar. \nThough he doesn't understand the words, Dunbar gets the message. As he goes for his horse, Wind In His Hair marches back to his people with Stands With A Fist. \nThere is great commotion as the crowd surges in around Wind In His Hair. \nWith a look of profound disappointment, Dunbar walks away on Cisco. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nOtter, Worm and Smiles A Lot are riding in, drawn by the ruckus in the village. They see the white soldier oh his horse leaving the camp. They see the tumult in the village and realize they are in trouble, again. \nSome of the young, mounted warriors are shouting taunts at the departing soldier, calling for him to come back and fight. They seem set to take out after him when Kicking Bird suddenly appears in front of their ponies. \nKICKING BIRD The soldier did not come to fight -- he is going away and we will let him. \nKicking Bird nods his assent and Dunbar flashes a pleased smile. \nDUNBAR Buffalo. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nDunbar is watching Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair walk their horses up the ridge to meet the waiting escort. Each horse has a gift of coffee and sugar slung over its withers. Occasionally, Wind In His Hair dips a hand into one of the bags and carefully licks each finger. \nDunbar waves up at them but there is no response. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) The sugar didn't figure to last at that rate any way. I don't believe I'd go too far in saying that a foundation for good relations is being laid. \nDISSOLVE INTO: \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nDUNBAR (V.O.) They have come again, as always the same two with an escort of six. \nDunbar is standing in the same spot, it is a new day \nLeaving their ever present escort behind, Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair ride into the fort. \nKicking Bird's pony is carrying something large and bulky on his withers. A buffalo robe. Dunbar walks up to greet them. Kicking Bird returns the welcome and signs to him as he speaks. \nKICKING BIRD Have you seen any buffalo? \nDunbar can only shake his head no. \nKicking Bird accepts this and dismounts. \nDunbar throws his customary wave but the escort remains noncommittal. \nEXT. HILL - DUSK \nDunbar is lying on his buffalo robe, his hand runs against the grain of the thick fur. He begins writing in his journal. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) I believe I am dealing with Kiowa Indians as I have heard that word on several occasions. \nHe rolls on his back, and lays aside the journal, practicing the hand signals. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) I am learning the Kiowa words for head, hand, horse, fire, coffee, buffalo, hello and goodbye. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nIt's raining. High on a hill, the Indian escort waits stoically, horses heads bowed in the drizzle. On the haunches of one of the ponies is a single deer. \nDown below, Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird are still mounted and converse with Dunbar using sign talk. \nDUNBAR No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are you hungry? I have food... are you hungry? \nDunbar suggests they take some of his supplies but Kicking Bird will not stand for this. He waves Dunbar off. The three men say their goodbyes, and Dunbar as usual throws a wave to the six men on the hill. \nUnexpectedly, one of them returns it and the other five react with surprise. \nESCORT 1 He waved. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Nothing I have been told about these people is correct. They are not beggars and thieves. They are not the bogeymen they have been made out to be. \nKicking Bird and Wind In His Hair disappear over the hill, followed by their escort. \nLightning bursts far out on the prairie. \nINT. QUARTERS - NIGHT \nDunbar huddles beneath the warmth of his buffalo robe. He is finishing up the second of two drawings. It is a portrait of Wind In His Hair, he carefully titles it \"The Fierce One.\" He has already completed a likeness of Kicking Bird and underneath it the words \"The Quiet One.\" \nEXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY \nSeveral children are playing close-by as Stands With A Fist works over a staked-out hide, scraping away the excess flesh. Though her arms are lined with scabs her work is methodical and unforced. She seems recovered. \nKICKING BIRD (O.S.) Stands With A Fist. \nShe looks up to see the medicine man looming over her. \nKICKING BIRD We will talk awhile. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY \nExcept for Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist, the tipi is empty. They are just seating themselves at the firepit in the center of the lodge. A brief silence, during which Kicking Bird studies the girl with the bowed head. \nKICKING BIRD Your wounds are healing well? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Yes. \nKICKING BIRD You are happy here, with my family? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I am glad to be here. I am missing my husband. \nKICKING BIRD Perhaps you will marry again when the time is right. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Perhaps. \nKicking Bird is leading up to something and Stands With A Fist fears it. She keeps her head bowed. \nKICKING BIRD We have word from many places that the whites are... \nKicking Bird stops himself, he knows this must be hard. She brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man, waiting to hear more. \nKICKING BIRD They are coming into everyone's country. They will soon be in ours I think. This white man who lives at the old soldier fort, the one who calls himself loo ten tant... I have visited him and I believe his heart is a good one. He knows things about the whites which we do not. \nHe pauses letting this sink in. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I am afraid of the man at the fort. \nKICKING BIRD He is only one man. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nStands With A Fist is still in shock. The drumming in the village is very loud now. She rises unsteadily to her feet and starts back to camp. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT \nThe moon is full. As we look down on the fort we can hear a new sound coming off the prairie. A light rumbling. \nINT. QUARTERS - NIGHT \nLieutenant Dunbar is asleep in the moonlight. The rumbling is getting louder. It wakes him. He gropes about, lights the lantern and listens to the strange, powerful sound. \nSomething's in the air. He holds the lantern toward the ceiling. Particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from the roof. It's the earth that's trembling. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT \nDressed in only pants and boots, Dunbar walks along the bluff above the river, his lantern held out in front of him. The sound is tremendous now. Dunbar stops as a great wall of dust rises before him. \nAt the same time, he realizes something is alive behind the wall of dust, he recognizes the sound... the sound of thousands of hoofbeats. \nHe sees one veer out. And now another. And another, darting briefly from the great cloud of dust. The most powerful force on the prairie now seems like the most powerful force on earth as it thunders by. \nThe buffalo. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT \nDunbar and Cisco are running flat out in the moonlight. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT \nThe village is coming up. A great fire is blazing at the far end. Horse and rider speed past the first lodge. \nIt's an important mission for the lieutenant. As he gallops through the village, he says one word over and over, trying to remember the correct pronunciation. It's the Sioux word for buffalo. \nEXT. FIRE - NIGHT \nEveryone has gathered around the great blaze. In the center of the circle close to the fire, the buffalo men are dancing. Others are dancing too. The music is very loud. \nThe little buckskin is out of his head with speed. He doesn't answer the bit when Dunbar first tries to pull him up. \nPeople scatter in all directions, as Dunbar and Cisco charge into their midst. \nDunbar pulls back with all his might, and the buckskin sits down. He's wet from his long ride, and Dunbar can't stay on his back. As Cisco rears, he slides off and tumbles onto his back. \nAngry warriors pile on top of him. Dunbar shouts out the word for buffalo, yelling it over and over as the warriors pummel him. \nSo many men have rushed into the fray that none can deal the lieutenant a decisive blow. They roll about in the dust. Just as Dunbar's cries have begun to lose their strength, he feels a sudden lessening of the weight upon him. \nAs the men pile off, Dunbar is left flat on his back. His lip is split and blood is streaming from his nose. \nHe's looking into a familiar face. The man's head is covered with the full skin and feathers of an eagle. Kicking Bird. \nDUNBAR Buffalo... \nKicking Bird doesn't understand or can't hear. He brings his face close to Dunbar's. \nDUNBAR Buffalo... (making horns with his fingers) Buffalo. \nKICKING BIRD Buffalo? \nDUNBAR Yes. Buffalo. \nKicking Bird raises up and yells it out to his people. \nKICKING BIRD The buffalo have come. \nFor a fleeting moment there is shocked silence. Then the Sioux explode with excitement. \nStill dazed, Dunbar is pulled to his feet. The people are surging in around him with yelps of joy. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nA wide stretch of prairie, falling away to nothing. \nThe buffalo have left a trail in the form of a tremendous swath of torn-up ground, several hundred yards from side to side. \nIndians on horseback move into the picture. \nMost of Ten Bears' camp is moving out in a long, noisy column. Spirits are high. First come the lead scouts, followed by Ten Bears and his advisors, Kicking Bird and wind In His Hair among them. A large body of warriors come next. Behind these men are the women, children and elderly. Dunbar is riding at the head of the last group. \nThe attitudes of the people have changed significantly. People who catch his eye are openly smiling at the lieutenant. \nAn old woman comes alongside and offers him a piece of dried meat, patting his hand as he takes it. \nHere comes Smiles A Lot, Worm and Otter, all on ponies, galloping up beside him. They want to play. \nSMILES A LOT Loo ten tant... \nHe motions for Dunbar to break ranks and while the lieutenant is puzzling this out, a chorus of cries comes from the column's front. \nThree far-ranging scouts are coming in at a run. \nEXT. COLUMN - DAY \nThe scouts pull up in front of Ten Bears to make their report. There's no way to know what's going on but something important is happening. \nWind In His Hair suddenly breaks ranks and rides back to the main body of warriors. A dozen warriors strip off their shirts and leggings. They're ready in moments. Then, with Wind In His Hair leading them, the party breaks away from the column and rides east at a gallop. \nThe column resumes its southward march. \nEXT. COLUMN - DAY \nThe day has grown hot as the column continues its march through changing terrain. \nDunbar is suffering some. The heat and dust are monstrous. At the moment however, he's most concerned with Stands With A Fist. She's riding closeby and he watches her with interest. \nThe band's best hunters, two dozen of them, are making ready to chase the buffalo. It's the big time, no event is more important. The villagers -- mostly women, children, and elderly -- have gathered around each of the hunters. \nThe largest audience has gathered around Lieutenant Dunbar and Wind In His Hair. Wind In His Hair's pony is ready. Great bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump. Right now the warrior is drawing the same design along Cisco's rump. \nDunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by silently. Wind In His Hair is finished. He looks at Dunbar and nods at the paint as if asking for a response. \nDUNBAR I wish I knew what to say. \nA Sioux voice, using english words, sails out of the circle of watchers. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Say... thank you. \nStartled the men turn to the sound. The other Sioux are stunned too. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST (indicating the paint) His speed... his power... you have. \nDUNBAR Thank you. \nHe takes the warrior's hand in his own and shakes it crisply. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nIt's the first time we've seen the buffalo up close. They're fantastic creatures, powerful, brutish, untameable animals from another age. A great bull turns away from the others and lifts his purple, horned head to sniff the breeze. He can detect no sign of trouble and eventually returns to his browsing. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe hunters are advancing across the prairie, spreading out in a formation that will encircle part of the herd. \nThe lightning bolts on Wind In His Hair's pony are in motion. Cisco's bolts are moving too. \nThere's a lump in Dunbar's throat. He knows nothing of what is expected of him but he's doing it anyway. He glances to -- his right at Wind In His Hair and to his left at Kicking Bird. They're both concentrated on what lies ahead. \nFrom the corner of his eye, he sees Kicking Bird look back. The lieutenant looks too. \nIt's a minor flap. Three or four youngsters, eager to distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the hunters and are being turned back. Dunbar recognizes one of them as the boy who took charge of Cisco at the village... Smiles A Lot. \nLike Kicking Bird, Dunbar swings his face back to the front. They're close enough now to hear the low bellowing of the herd. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nA strike far up on the horned formation. Their ponies leap forward. The mad dash is on. \nDunbar's hat flies off at first spurt and now the lieutenant and his horse are hurling over the prairie. The little buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has put every ounce of his muscle to speed. They're burning up the ground. \nWhen Dunbar looks back over his shoulder, he's shocked to find that the best buffalo ponies the Sioux's have are far behind. He and Cisco are on their own. \nThe herd is in full flight and the sound of their stampede is overwhelming. The buffalo are very fast but Cisco is gaining with every stride. They've formed a great running wall in front of him and now Dunbar can see their rumps and tails and flying hooves. \nDunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his eyes as if in prayer. The sound of thousands of hooves is deafening. \nDunbar and Cisco have caught the buffalo. A few more strides and they'll be in. \nDunbar and Cisco are running with the buffalo. A shaggy head moves in and swipes at Cisco, but the little horse is too quick and too smart. He dodges away, nearly dumping the lieutenant in the process. \nDunbar rights himself and fires. It's a wild shot, only grazing the buffalo's shoulder. The report of the gun instantly scatters the herd and Dunbar pulls up, dust swirling all around him. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nSioux hunters stream past him, every man for himself zeroing in on targets. \nDunbar starts to dismount but something he sees stops him. \nA hundred yards away a small hunter is after a handful of buffalo who have splintered off from the rest. It's Smiles A Lot, trying to make a kill of his own. As Dunbar watches, the boy's inexperienced horse shies away and bucks, pitching the kid to the ground. \nA big bull breaks away from the splinter group, lowers his head and charges. \nDunbar kicks Cisco into a run, spits a spare bullet from his mouth and rams it into the chamber. \nSmiles A Lot is picking himself off the ground. The bull is in full charge. \nDunbar is riding with his knees. Both hands are holding the rifle. He'll never make it to the boy in time. He's got to make the shot. He squeezes the trigger. \nThe bullet plows home, exploding the bull's heart. The big buffalo's legs collapse but the momentum of his charge puts him into a skid. He comes to rest only a few yards away from Smiles A Lot. \nThe boy stands as the lieutenant rides up. Smiles A Lot is dazed but he's okay. \nDunbar hops off next to the dead buffalo. He's a huge one, a real grandfather and the lieutenant loses himself for a few moments in contemplation of this tremendous kill. Now he looks back to check the boy. \nSmiles A Lot has caught his pony and is racing away from the scene of his humiliation. \nThe sounds of approaching riders turns Dunbar's attention in a different direction. \nThe entire village is streaming onto the plains for the butchering. \nThe riders bearing down on him are being lead by Wind In His Hair. \nWind In His Hair jumps off his pony and, smiling broadly, slaps Dunbar's back with a good-natured blow of congratulations. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nThe buffalo has been split open and Wind In His Hair, kneeling at the bull's side, is feeling around in the cavity. He finds what he's looking for and gives it a jerk. \nIt's the liver, still warm and steaming. He offers it to Dunbar but the lieutenant, not having the faintest idea, only looks at it blankly. \nA sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual. \nWind In His Hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth and happily bites off a chunk, letting the juices run from the edges of his mouth. Now he figures the lieutenant knows what to do, and hands the liver back to him. \nDunbar doesn't want to do this, but with the pressure of so many eyes and so much good will, he has little choice. Tentatively, he bites off a small piece and chews it thoughtfully. It's good. \nEncouraged by this good taste, Dunbar takes a man-sized bite. Shrill Sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer the lieutenant. Dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over his head. \nEXT. KILLING GROUND - DAY \nLittle butchering parties cluster around each fallen buffalo. \nKicking Bird reaches out and feels the strange material on either side of Wind In His Hair's chest. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR I traded for it. \nKICKING BIRD Does it scratch the skin? \nWIND IN HIS HAIR A little. But do you see how good it looks. Everyone says it looks good. Everyone. \nEXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT \nDunbar keeps to the shadows as he makes his way through camp. Now he slows his step. \nLight from another fire is spilling into his path. There's music too. And singing. The voices are high and feminine. \nDunbar peers around a lodge. A group of young women are dancing in a clockwise circle. Their steps are light-hearted. This is dancing purely for the fun of it. \nOne of the young women spots him standing behind the lodge and there's a wave of shy giggling as news of \"loo ten tant's\" presence is passed along. Embarrassed, Dunbar starts along the fringe of the fires, nodding politely to the women as he goes. \nOne has more courage than the others. She breaks out, takes his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle. Whatever resistance he might have is buried by the girl's insistent encouragement. She keeps showing him the step and the lieutenant tries to pick it up. \nThe movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing. Awkward at first, Dunbar quickly gets the hang of it. In short order, he's keeping up with the others. And he's enjoying himself. \nSoon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes, carried along by the eternal sound of the drums. He doesn't notice that the circle has begun to shrink. There is a touch of the devil in their eyes. \nHe bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into him. But the girls just laugh and so does Dunbar. It was a pleasant accident. But quickly there's another accident. And then all their bodies are squeezing against his. The girls are murmuring good things to him. Their hands are touching him everywhere. \nIt's okay with Dunbar. Everybody's having a good time. The drumming suddenly stops however, and the women scatter away from the fire, leaving Dunbar suddenly alone. Kicking Bird is standing not far off. \nDUNBAR They asked me to dance... \nThe medicine man says nothing. \nDUNBAR I was just dancing... \nThe lieutenant does a step or two, trying to explain. Finally, that strange half-smile appears on Kicking Bird's face. \nEXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT \nStands With A Fist has been watching everything from the tipi flap. Now she ducks back inside. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT \nThe fire is still burning in the center of the lodge. Dunbar is sleeping soundly. \nIt's not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of mumbling somewhere in the lodge. Then it's quiet. There's that mumbling again. And now a woman's giggle. \nDunbar stirs, waking and curious, sits up a little and looks across the fire. There is movement on Kicking Bird's platform. The medicine man's head and that of his wife come into view for a second or two before they sink back down into shadow. The movements and sound that follow become more forceful. They're having sex. \nEmbarrassed, the lieutenant averts his eyes, they happen over the forms of Kicking Bird's deeply sleeping children, the low-burning fire, and settle on Stands With A Fist's back. \nLieutenant Dunbar, the sounds of lovemaking floating over him, peers again in that direction only to meet the smiling eyes of Kicking Bird and his wife. \nEmbarrassed again, he stares open-eyed at the ceiling. He looks like a man who knows something is happening but doesn't know what it is. \nStands With A Fist's eyes are open too. She doesn't move. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAWN \nThe faintest seam of light is starting to glow on the eastern horizon. \nEXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nThe camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon. \nIt's the pony herd. And Dunbar is walking in that direction. His feet leave a trail in the wet grass. \nFirst one, then two, then whole groups of ponies lift their heads and prick their ears at Dunbar's approach. \nDunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses, he stops and gives a long whistle. \nA figure, previously unseen, sits up on the back of a pony. It's Smiles A Lot. He and Dunbar glance blankly at each other. But in a moment, both are distracted by movement in the herd. \nHorses are being gently eased out of the way by Cisco who is answering Dunbar's call. A moment later and they are reunited at the edge of the herd. \nGrasping a hunk of Cisco's mane, Dunbar starts to lead him back to the village. The temporary camp is starting to come to life. And with Cisco at his side, Dunbar pauses to take in the scene. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK \nAn escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to join the rest of the column as they make their way back to camp. Dunbar looks on, a travois of meat next to him and gives a last wave. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) To stay any longer would've been useless. We had all the meat we could possibly carry. We had hunted for three days, losing half a dozen ponies and only three men injured. Many times I have felt alone but until this afternoon, I have never felt completely lonely. \nINT. QUARTERS - DAY \nThe person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance to the Lieutenant Dunbar we've known. \nHis long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head. His skin is not so white anymore, and the great bone-pipe breastplate covers his torso. \nDunbar starts to write and stops, he repeats this action. It is clear that as Lieutenant Dunbar, he can find nothing to say. He lays the pen down momentarily. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Made a long patrol today. There is nothing to report. The truth is I am bored. \nThere is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws. His eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored. Watching the sacks more closely, he sees that they are infested with mice. \nRestlessly, he walks to the doorway, gazing out onto the old fort. The awning is beginning to tear at the corner. And then he spots something. \nEXT. QUARTERS - DAY \nA large prairie chicken is lying in front of the quarters. Dunbar squats next to it. It's neck carries punctures, and when he dabs a finger on the wounds, he finds that the blood is still wet. The lieutenant rises slowly, his sharp eyes sweeping the fort. \nHe's waiting patiently in his usual spot on the bluff overlooking the river. Two Socks. \nDunbar smiles and shakes his head. Watching his old friend, he picks up the bird and begins to pluck with an ease that suggests he's had some experience. \nEXT. QUARTERS - NIGHT \nDunbar hands the pipe back, and as Kicking Bird takes it he hears the light tinkling of bells. \nDunbar hears it too. As he looks toward the sound, a shadow falls across the arbor's entrance. \nKICKING BIRD We were waiting for you. \nStands With A Fist ducks through the arbor's entrance and seats herself between Dunbar and Kicking Bird. \nStands With A Fist is wearing a band of bells around one ankle. She has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her feet. Her dress is old but well-cared for. Animal teeth are sewn along her bodice. On her wrist is a solid brass bracelet. Her hair is tied back loosely with a bret, accenting the feminine in her face. \nHer whiteness seems to show more than ever. But it is not dominant. The Sioux is dominant. \nKICKING BIRD (to Dunbar) Welcome. It is good that you are here. \nKicking Bird looks to Stands With A Fist. She takes her time and the words are accented but they are close enough. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Hullo. You here... good. \nThe words are sweet music to the lieutenant. He replies with a feeling of great relief. \nDUNBAR Thank you... I feel good. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST (to Kicking Bird) He thanks you. It is good. \nKICKING BIRD Ask him why he is at the soldier fort. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST (to Dunbar) Uhh... you... come... \nDunbar jumps in. There are things he wants to know, has waited a long time to know. \nDUNBAR Wait... what is your name? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Our... names? \nKICKING BIRD What does he say? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST He wants to know how we are called. \nKICKING BIRD Ahhh... He's right. I'm sorry. \nThe medicine man nods agreeably. He smiles at Dunbar, quite right, introductions should come first. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST He... he... Kick... \nDUNBAR Kick? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST More. \nShe kicks at the ground with the toe of her moccasin. Dunbar doesn't get it. She kicks a little harder. \nDUNBAR Kicking? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Kicking... yes... Kicking... Bird. \nDUNBAR (to Kicking Bird) Kicking Bird... (to Stands With A Fist) What does he... is he a chief? \nStands With A Fist has the word but it takes a few seconds to make it come out of her mouth. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Hul... hal... ho-lee... holy... holy man. \nDUNBAR Oh... (glancing at Kicking Bird) \nA brief silence. Kicking Bird seems ready to speak but Dunbar is too quick. \nDUNBAR (to Stands With A Fist) Your name... you. \nShe thinks. It's hard. She smiles thinly. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I don't know. \nAn idea comes to her. She stands up quickly. \nDUNBAR Up? Get up? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST No. \nShe repeats the movement again. \nDUNBAR Stand. \nHer smile is a little wider this time. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Yes... Stands. \nDunbar starts to speak but she cuts him off. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST More... (thinking) Wiff... (quickly) With. \nShe draw something in the dirt. It's an \"A\". \nDUNBAR Stands With A... \nNow she makes a fist and holds it close to Dunbar's face. \nDUNBAR Fist? \nShe nods. \nDUNBAR Stands With A Fist. I'm John... John Dunbar. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST John Dunbar. \nDUNBAR Yes. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nBLACK SHAWL You can't, he is gone. \nStands With A Fist bolts up, racing to the lodge flap -- she pulls it aside and is stunned by the sight of Dances With Wolves' abandoned lodge -- Cisco is nowhere to be seen. \nShe turns away, tears coming to her eyes. Black Shawl is beside her watching -- the girl's emotions have betrayed her. \nBlack Shawl takes the crying girl into her arms. A child runs into the lodge but Black Shawl indicates \"not now.\" \nThe message is clearly understood, and the child digs in his heels and heads the other way. \nEXT. FORT - DAY \nThe breeze is up and the remaining shreds of canvas that were once the awning are flying like tattered flags. \nLeading Cisco, Dances With Wolves walks into view. It will be his last visit to his old home and he is taking his time. \nHe watches the blowing canvas. The sound of it snapping is all that can be heard. \nHe steps over to the supply house. He starts to peer in, but when he places a hand against the sod, part of the wall gives way. \nINT. QUARTERS - PAY \nPart of the old bed has collapsed but some of it is still strong enough for support and here Dances With Wolves is sitting as he leafs through his beloved journal. \nHe reads a little entry here and there, sometimes smiling at the memory. \nA few blank pages remain at the back of the book. Reaching these he closes the journal and holds it on his lap, letting his mind run for a moment. \nNow he notices the old pen and ink. He picks them up and opens the journal for one last entry. \nHe writes: \"I love Stands With A Fist\" and signs himself \"Dances With Wolves.\" \nSomething is moving outside and Dunbar stops, drawing his gun out. He drops the book on the bed and carefully moves outside. \nEXT. QUARTERS - DAY \nLying in the sun a few feet away is Two Socks. He looks up hopefully at Dances With Wolves. The two partners stare at each other for a moment. \nThen Dances With Wolves reaches into a little day pouch at his side and pulls out a strip of jerky. He squats close to the ground and offers the meat to the wolf. \nTwo Socks is up now. He takes several tentative steps. His nose sniffs at the meat and he opens his mouth. Teeth and fingers touch as the wolf takes the meat delicately. \nNow, in his customary style, he moves away, heading out onto the prairie with his prize. \nDances With Wolves watches a moment longer. Then he vaults onto Cisco's back and they canter off in the direction of the village. \nEXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY \nStands With A Fist is wading through the water, her mind is far away. \nIn a moment there is a shift in the wind. The rustling of the trees alerts her to a presence she had not thought to feel before. \nGradually, she raises her eyes to see the figure of a man moving through the trees... Dances With Wolves. \nStands With A Fist walks slowly out of the water. He opens his arms and she melts into them, letting her head rest against his chest. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I am in mourning. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I know... Stone Calf told me. \nShe presses her body full against his, feeling all of him. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST No one can know... we must be careful. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Yes. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST We must be careful. \nShe climbs higher into his arms for a moment. Then, supporting each other, the lovers move into the cover of the willow breaks along the river. \nEXT. RIVER PATH - DAY \nThe path leading to the river is deserted. \nSuddenly, a couple steps out of the cover of the willows alongside the path. Stands With A Fist and Dances With Wolves look up and down the path. They start for the village, holding hands. \nAs they near the top of the trail their hands part. A few steps later and someone calls from the bushes startling Dances with Wolves. \nSMILES A LOT What are you doing? \nSmiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are sitting pathside. Worm is holding a sack. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Nothin'. \nSmiles A Lot looks to Stands With A Fist. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Nothin'. \nWorm opens the sack. A large, wriggling snake lies in the bottom. \nWORM We got a snake. \nOTTER We're gonna see if it can swim the river. You wanna come? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Okay. \nThe two parties split up and everyone says goodbye to Stands With A Fist. She makes her way up to the village. \nDances With Wolves watches her go. Turning back to head down to the river, he is greeted by the open hissing mouth of Worm's snake. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Don't do that! \nWorm and Otter laugh and race off down the path. \nSmiles A Lot and Dances With Wolves follow, Dances With Wolves a little ahead. Something on his back, something curious, has captured Smiles A Lot's attention. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Wait. \nSmiles A Lot stops. Dances With Wolves squints into the feeble light. He can see the outline of the village below, but upriver the light is still too murky to make anything out. \nAnother bolt of lightning flashes. There they are. A long line of horsemen crossing river a mile or so upstream from the village. The Pawnee. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN \nIn front of Ten Bears' lodge, Dances With Wolves is passing out the last of the rifles. Warriors are grabbing handfuls of bullets out of an open ammo box. \nTen Bears is watching this procedure. And while he watches, he thinks. \nThe guns have been passed out and, except for a slight murmur among the warriors, it's strangely quiet. The band's best fighters are gone and many men don't know what to do next. They're looking to Ten Bears for leadership. \nBut the old man is looking at Dances With Wolves. He holds up a hand for quiet. \nTEN BEARS Hear us now. (to Dances With Wolves) A white soldier with many far-shooting guns... how would he fight the Pawnee? \nEveryone is waiting. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I would hide in the village. \nThe warriors send up a chorus of derisive cries but Ten Bears angrily quiets them. \nTEN BEARS Dances With Wolves has not finished. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I would let the enemy think we are asleep... let him come close. Then we would shoot together and run to fight them, drive them into the river and kill so many that they would never trouble us again. \nTen Bears smiles. \nTEN BEARS I am of the same mind as Dances With Wolves... we should kill so many that they never trouble us again. \nEXT. RIVER - DAWN \nTwo of the camp dogs are lapping water at the river's edge, behind them lies the quiet village. Suddenly both heads jerk up. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nDances With Wolves steps into the lodge, followed by Smiles A Lot. They both have rifles and Dances With Wolves' old long-barreled revolver is holstered at his waist. \nBefore him is a quiet, tense scene. \nThe women are huddled together on a single sleeping platform. Kicking Bird's three children nestled between them. Two of the kids are crying softly. \nBlack Shawl grips a hatchet and Stands With A Fist has a rifle. They will both fight. But they are both scared. Everyone in the village has a life at stake. In one glimpse, Dances With Wolves understands what he will be fighting for. \nHe looks once more at the women and children and ducks out of the lodge. \nEXT. RIVER - DAWN \nThe feet of the enemy are moving past the dogs, whose bodies are still and riddled with arrows. In front of them the river is full of Pawnee crossing over toward the village. There is no sound. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAWN \nIt has stopped raining but the ground is still soaked and an early morning fog is swirling through the camp. Clumped in groups of five or six, behind the lodges nearest the river, are Sioux warriors with rifles. They're absolutely quiet as they wait for the enemy. \nDances With Wolves looks across a clearing that slopes down to the breaks fronting the river. Nothing. \nWait. A movement. And another. Another. The heads of men lurking in the fog. He glances at the defenders. \nMost of the warriors are huddled behind the line of lodges watching him. Ten Bears raises a hand. \nThe Pawnee are visible now, a war party at its fiercest, painted and feathered and armed to the teeth. \nComing on foot, the first of them have reached the edge of the clearing. They start into a stealthy trot, more and more of them breaking into a run. \nA Pawnee war cry goes up and, as the others join in. Ten Bears lowers his hand. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN \nIn ragged formation, the Sioux pour from behind the lodges and thirty rifles fire into the vanguard of the Pawnee charge. \nThe smoke of many rifles mixes with the ground fog as the Sioux run screaming down on the Pawnee. Dances With Wolves screams too as he runs flat out down the slope. \nA Pawnee warrior suddenly looms out of the smoke and they crash together violently. \nThe two fighters tumble over the ground, each grappling for an advantage. The hand to hand fighting all around them is furious and, shrouded in smoke and fog, it has a surreal quality. \nDances With Wolves works the Navy revolver from its holster and shoots the Pawnee in the face. \nEXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nA child sticks his head out from under the edge of the lodge. Momentarily he is jerked back into the lodge out of sight. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAWN \nNow there's a ripping at the lodge entrance. The flap is being torn away. Black Shawl is desperately pulling the child back from the edge of the lodge. \nSuddenly, there he is... a Pawnee warrior. But now it's his turn to be surprised. He sees Stands with A Fist taking aim, and it's too late. She fires the rifle and the Pawnee explodes back out of the lodge. \nEXT. VILLAGE - DAWN \nThrough the smoke, Dances With Wolves can just catch a glimpse of Ten Bears. He is moving through the village at a trot, loading his gun. \nHe spots a Sioux warrior grappling with a Pawnee, sights and shoots the Pawnee point blank. He trots off, reloading once more. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAWN \nDances With Wolves is bumped from behind and is knocked to his knees. It's a frantic Pawnee war horse, loose on the battlefield. Dances With Wolves grabs a hunk of mane and swings onto his back. \nHe has a real view now. The Pawnee are taking a terrible licking. Already they are being beaten back to the river. \nA turbaned enemy is falling back to the river, firing arrows as he goes. Dances With Wolves goes after him. \nEXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAWN \nThe war party with Kicking Bird and Wind In His Hair at its head has halted in the middle of nowhere. The Sioux riders are coming toward them at a run. They pull up, excited with what they have to tell. \nThe returning war party and the two riders who met them start ahead at a gallop. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT \nBlack Shawl and Stands With A Fist are clearing things away. The medicine man has hosted a dinner party which is now winding down. \nWind In His Hair is there, Dances With Wolves and several other prominent warriors. It's purely social and all the men are enjoying themselves. \nDances With Wolves sneaks a look of affection at Stands With A Fist, and she returns it. \nThen, with more theatricality than is really necessary, he stretches his arms and yawns. Wind In His Hair looks at his friend with surprise. \nDances With Wolves gets to his feet. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR There is gambling tonight... at Horse Back's lodge. Horse Back's games are always good. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I am tired... and Horse Back already has a good rifle of mine. (to Kicking Bird) thank you... (to all) goodnight. \nHe slips out. In a few seconds, the men have pick up another topic to jawbone. \nThey pay no attention to Stands With A Fist's momentary exit, But Black Shawl does, it doesn't bother her, but she notices. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT \nThe medicine man's wife is already in bed as he slips under the covers with a grunt. \nBLACK SHAWL How long will Stands With A Fist mourn? \nKicking Bird gives his wife an odd look. \nKICKING BIRD I don't know. \nBLACK SHAWL I hope it will not be too long. \nKicking Bird rises on his elbows. \nKICKING BIRD Something has happened? Well what? \nBLACK SHAWL She has found love again. \nKICKING BIRD With who? \nBLACK SHAWL Dances With Wolves. \nKICKING BIRD Are you certain of this? \nBLACK SHAWL When you see them together you will know. \nKicking Bird stares wearily across the floor. \nKICKING BIRD What are people saying? They're not angry? \nBLACK SHAWL No. They like the match. It makes sense. They are both white. \nKICKING BIRD I suppose I will be the one to say something. \nA brief silence. \nBLACK SHAWL She's your daughter now. \nKicking Bird glances up frustrated with himself. \nBLACK SHAWL You can't see everything coming. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nStands With A Fist is walking through the village with Kicking Bird's youngest child. They're both carrying armloads of firewood. \nHere comes Kicking Bird. He's out of breath. \nKICKING BIRD Stands With A Fist. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Yes. \nKICKING BIRD You are no longer a widow. \nKicking Bird turns abruptly and stalks off, leaving Stands With A Fist to ponder the meaning of his curt announcement. A smile gradually works onto her face. \nINT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DAY \nDances With Wolves sits waiting as a voice comes to him from the outside. \nWind In His Hair's face pokes through the entrance. He steps inside, followed by Smiles A Lot. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR There's talk that you want to get married. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES To who? \nWind In His Hair and Smiles A Lot share a smile. \nSMILES A LOT To Stands With A Fist. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR That's the one isn't it? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES She's in mourning. \nSMILES A LOT Not today. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR She has been released. Kicking Bird did it. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES He did? \nWind In His Hair isn't really listening. He glances around the lodge curiously. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Yes. \nKICKING BIRD Good, then take her inside... she is your wife. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Oh... good... thank you... goodbye... \nThe newlyweds disappear into their new home. The flap is dropped and there it stays. The light begins to change, growing darker, the wind comes up, blowing leaves against the door. In the distance there is thunder. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nThe lodge flap is still closed. But now it is covered in sunshine. \nSmiles A Lot, Worm and Otter are just across the way, bundled now against the chill of oncoming winter. They're watching too. Smiles A Lot is standing next to Worm, -- Otter is on his haunches. Both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat as they talk nonchalantly. \nWORM Dances With Wolves' door is closed alot these days. \nSMILES A LOT They're trying to make a baby. \nThe two older boys look down at Otter. \nOTTER I know that. \nSMILES A LOT You would think they could have made a baby by now. \nWORM Maybe they're having a hard time. Some people have a hard time. \nSMILES A LOT I don't think they're having a hard time. \nOTTER Me neither. \nA silence as the boys watch smoke curl out of the lodge. Worm laughs to himself. \nOTTER Maybe we should pull the smoke flap closed. Then they would come out. \nThe boys look at each other for the first time, their eyes brightening. What a great idea! \nThe two boys are stalking toward Dances With Wolves' lodge when they see something that makes them peel off in another direction. \nIt's Kicking Bird, coming to call. \nKICKING BIRD Dances With Wolves, are you in there? \nIn a moment the lodge flap opens and Dances With Wolves steps outside. He's fully dressed but a little disheveled. \nKICKING BIRD I am riding today to a far away place. It is a place I haven't seen for a long time. A sacred place. I would like you to come with me. \nDances With Wolves ponders this. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nKicking Bird and Dances With Wolves are cantering side by side across the open prairie. \nThey pull their horses to a walk and Kicking Bird glances Dances With Wolves' direction. \nDances With Wolves' glances back and smiles. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES It's good to be out. \nKICKING BIRD Yes it must be. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES We are trying for a baby. \nKICKING BIRD No waiting? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES No waiting. \nThe medicine man keeps looking at his protege. There is virtually no semblance of Lieutenant Dunbar left. \nKICKING BIRD I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life, there is one that matters more than all the others. It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and it is good to see. \nDances With Wolves doesn't reply, but he is blushing a little. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nDances With Wolves and Kicking Bird gallop their horses to the crest of a steep hill and rein to a halt. \nDown below, miles distant, is the curving line of a river. But there is a section of river, directly before them, that cannot be seen. It is screened by a mammoth stand of trees, some of them towering a hundred feet or more. \nHe glances at Dances With Wolves but his companion doesn't see. He's staring in wonder at the great forest before him. \nKICKING BIRD It is said that all the animals were born here... that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people. Even our enemies say this is a sacred place. \nThey start toward the river at a walk. \nEXT. BROKEN FOREST - DAY \nThe two riders come out of the sunlight and onto a shaded path leading into the forest. They've only gone a few yards when Kicking Bird pulls to a stop. The men sit on their horses in complete silence. Dances With Wolves is still fully entranced. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES It's quiet. \nBut Kicking Bird does not acknowledge his companion's words. He seems to be concentrating on the quiet. The quiet is wrong and Kicking Bird knows it. He moves forward slowly. \nFollowing behind Kicking Bird, Dances With Wolves' attention is focused on the tree tops above him. A curious buzzing sound has started up and is growing louder by the moment. Perhaps there are bees swarming in the branches overhead. \nNow he is distracted by Cisco coming to a stop. Kicking Bird too has stopped. Just ahead the forest opens into an incredible cathedral-like expanse. Sunlight streams down onto the floor in beautiful pools. \nBut still there is a deathly quiet and Dances With Wolves can see now that this remarkable place has been horribly desecrated. \nTrees have been felled everywhere, most of them left to rot for no explicable reason. \nAt the same time he sees this destruction Dances With Wolves realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming from overhead but from the forest floor. \nThe insects are not bees. They are flies and they are swarming over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground. Badgers, skunks, squirrels and other small animals, nearly all of them killed merely for target practice. \nThe men and their ponies move on. Deer carcasses are everywhere, many of them horribly mutilated. A choice flank portion is cut away here and there, while ninety-five percent of the bodies have been left to rot. \nThe soldiers in the wagon, a collection of pimply-faced teen- agers and middle-aged rabble, are aiming their rifles. Cisco rears high in the air as the volley is fired from the wagon. \nDances With Wolves is pitched off to one side, landing hard on the ground. When he gets his senses back the first thing he sees is Cisco. The buckskin is lying very still. \nOblivious to the shouts of the soldiers racing toward him, Dances With Wolves runs crab-like to his horse's side. \nCisco's been shot several times, one bullet taking him in the heart. He's dead. \nDances With Wolves whirls to face the soldiers. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES You killed him... \nThat's the last thing he says. A rifle stock slams into the side of his face and as soldiers swarm over him, everything goes black. \nEXT. COLUMN - DAY \nTen Bears village is on the trail. Kicking Bird is riding down the line. He notices Stands With A Fist. She is terribly distraught. \nKicking Bird glances at the sun. The day is more than half- over. He kicks his pony back up the line next to Wind In His Hair. \nKICKING BIRD Something has happened... Dances With Wolves is not coming. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR He must have trouble. \nKICKING BIRD Pick two good men with fast ponies and send them back to the soldier fort. \nINT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY \nDances With Wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined supply house. One side of his face is grotesquely swollen from the blow he took. Blood still seeps from a long split of the skin along his cheek. \nHe groans. Voice are playing about his ears, the voices of white men. He opens his eyes. \nA bearish, bearded SERGEANT BAUER, is squatting directly in front of him. Behind the sergeant, peering over the crumbled walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary soldiers. \nBAUER Spivey... \nA pitiful looking man, SPIVEY, who is a soldier by name only, answers up. \nSPIVEY Yessir sergeant... \nSERGEANT BAUER Tell the major he's wakin' up... and move your worthless ass. \nThe sergeant's smallish eyes are fixed on Dances With Wolves. With some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting position against the back wall. \nSERGEANT BAUER Got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't ya? \nDances With Wolves only blinks at him. His cheek is crushed and so is his spirit. \nSomeone calls attention and two officers walk into the roofless supply house. One is a MAJOR, one is a young lieutenant -- Lieutenant Elgin -- the officer Dances With Wolves bumped into at Fort Hays. Neither one recognizes the other. \nMAJOR Does he speak english? \nSERGEANT BAUER Don't know sir... you speak english? Talk english? (kicking at one of Dances With Wolves' boots) Talk? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I speak english... \nEveryone is shocked at the clarity of the words. \nMAJOR Who are you? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Lieutenant John. J. Dunbar. This is my post. \nMAJOR Why are you dressed like this? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I came out from Fort Hays last April. But there was no one here. \nThe major and the lieutenant exchange whispers. \nELGIN You have proof of that? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES My journal is on the bunk in my quarters. My orders are in the journal. It will tell you everything. \nELGIN Spivey, you and Edwards were here first. Did you find anything... a journal. \nSpivey shifts uncomfortably. \nSPIVEY We didn't see nothin' sir. \nELGIN Where's Edwards? \nSPIVEY He's outside. But he didn't see nothin' either. \nElgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom of this and walks out the door -- the major follows. \nDances With Wolves lets his head slump forward. The men gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves, commenting on the prisoner. They can't take their eyes off him. Neither can Sergeant Bauer. He watches the prisoner from a distance. Then he walks across the floor, squats in front of him and whispers coarsely in his face. \nSERGEANT BAUER You turned Injun, din'cha? \nDances With Wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant. \nSERGEANT BAUER Din'cha? \nThe major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear. \nELGIN What is your name? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Dunbar... D.U.N.B.A.R... John. \nELGIN You say you are an officer? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Did you read my orders? \nELGIN No. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES It was in my journal. \nDances With Wolves sticks a toe under the lip of the plate and flips it over. Most of it hits Spivey, a little splashes on Bauer. Spivey moves to kick the prisoner, but Bauer intercedes with his rifle. \nSERGEANT BAUER Go on ahead Injun... You'll just get hungrier is all... but mebbe that don't matter. Word is they're gonna ship you back to Hays. And they'll hang you once you get there. \nBauer and Spivey leave him and Dances With Wolves kicks out viciously at the spilled plate. \nEXT. TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY \nThere's a tremendous upheaval. Ten Bears' band has halted its march. SIX PAINTED WARRIORS all heavily armed are jumping onto their ponies and being handed the lines to spare mounts. Wind In His Hair is their leader. \nThe whole village is up to see them off. \nSmiles A Lot, painted and carrying a bow and quiver rides into the midst of the group. Wind In His Hair studies the resolute boy. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR You will hold our horses... nothing more. \nSmiles A Lot nods. \nWith a great whooping from the villagers, the rescue party roars out of camp. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nThe wagon is pulling out with an escort of SEVEN SOLDIERS. \nDances With Wolves' spirits are very low as he sits in the bed of the jolting wagon. Spivey is guarding him.  Elgin is leading the detail. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY. \nDances with Wolves watches a ridge in the distance for any sign of riders. \nSPIVEY I don't see nobody. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nElgin and one of the escort soldiers are scouting far out on the prairie. The lieutenant pauses and looks back at the wagon. It is far behind in the distance, but still coming. \nEXT. WAGON - DAY \nDances With Wolves is dozing as the wagon jolts across the ground. Suddenly a shot rings out. Dances With Wolves opens his eyes. \nThe wagon driver is aiming his rifle out at something on the prairie. He fires again. \nDances With Wolves looks over the wagon bed and sees Two Socks. He's standing still, fifty yards away. Staring in his old inquisitive way at the wagon. \nSPIVEY Lookit the stupid bastard... he ain't even runnin'. \nTwo shots ring out in rapid succession. \nBAUER Don't shoot, I seen 'em first... it's my shot. \nSergeant Bauer fires his own round. Everyone has missed. Bauer is jamming another cartridge into the chamber. \nDRIVER It's my shot goddamit. \nNow Spivey decides to get into the act. He rises up with his rifle aiming. \nSPIVEY You dumb sons a bitches. \nBefore he can fire, there's a rattling of chains. And the next moment, Spivey's feet are being pulled out from under him by Dances With Wolves. His rifle fires harmlessly into space. \nBauer turns from the wagon seat and slams the back of the prisoner's head with the gunstock. Dances With Wolves falls back, letting go of the shaken Spivey. \nBauer smiles at Spivey contemptuously. \nBAUER He mighta killed you. \nIn the next instant, Spivey gives Dances With Wolves a resounding crack in the sternum with the butt of his rifle and he goes down on his back. \nMore shots are fired. Dazedly, Dances With Wolves looks out and sees Two Socks still running parallel to the wagon. \nThere's another shot and then shouting. \nSOLDIER 1 I got him... \nSOLDIER 2 The hell you did... \nSOLDIER 1 I got him... dead shot boys. \nSpivey is still poking Dances With Wolves. \nSPIVEY You want more?... get up... get up. \nELGIN Spivey! \nElgin has ridden alongside the wagon. \nELGIN I see you bash the prisoner once more and I'll put those shackles on you... \nElgin's men are headed up towards Two Socks when shots ring out. \nELGIN You men! Get back to your places. \nThe camera continues over the hill to Two Socks' body, but it is no where in sight. Instead the Indian war party of six is waiting silently in ambush. Frustrated, they will try again. \nEXT. RIVERBANK - DAY \nThe wagon is making its way steadily down, toward the river. Dances With Wolves watches the line of growth along the river get closer, his eyes and ears and nose full alert. \nIf they come this will be the place to do it. Dances With Wolves will make the most of this hope. \nThe wagon moves down a narrow pathway, not much more than a game trail. The lieutenant raises his hand and the wagon halts at the river's edge. \nA soldier rides back and forth in the water on the other side of the river. He's checking for any signs of ambush. The soldier starts back to them. \nSOLDIER All clear lieutenant... \nDANCES WITH WOLVES What ever is on your mind. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST We have decided. You are my husband. I am your wife. That is all I know. \nDances With Wolves lays his forehead on her back. He sighs. Then he pulls away, slips a robe around his shoulders and walks out of the lodge. \nSadly, she watches him go. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nWe follow a pair of boots walking in the snow. Pan up to find an ORDERLY bringing coffee to a MAJOR. He is surrounded by other officers and in front of him a large column of men is moving toward the snow covered mountains. \nThe Major tosses the remaining coffee in a fire and he prepares to mount. \nWe pan up with the smoke and the steam. \nEXT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY \nIt's cold in the Sioux camp. A warm column of smoke is spiraling out of Ten Bears' lodge. \nINT. TEN BEARS' LODGE - DAY \nSeveral men are gathered around Ten Bears' fire, including Kicking Bird, Wind In His Hair and Dances With Wolves. \nAll the men are draped with blankets. The wind is howling outside. The men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes around the circle. \nThe pipe comes around to Dances With Wolves, and the man next to him must nudge him to attention. Dances With Wolves takes the pipe and begins to smoke. \nTen Bears watches him closely. \nTEN BEARS (to Dances With Wolves) Dances With Wolves is quiet these days. \nHe does not reply. He smokes a little more and passes the pipe. \nTEN BEARS Is his heart bad? \nDances With Wolves glances at the men around the fire. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Killing the soldiers at the river was a good thing. It made me free and my heart was big to see my friends coming to help me. I did not mind killing those men. I was glad to do it. \nHe searches for the right words. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES But the soldiers hate me now like they hate no other. I am more than an enemy to them, I am a traitor. They will hunt for me. They will not give up. And when they find me they find you and that cannot happen. \nObjections break out all around the fire. Wind In His Hair jumps to his feet and even Kicking Bird is protesting. \nTEN BEARS Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair. You are hurting an old man's ears with your loud talk. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nThe column of soldiers can be heard but not seen. They are moving forward, singing the Battle Hymn of The Republic. \nINT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - DUSK \nStands With A Fist is building up the fire in their cozy home. Dances With Wolves works on a long-stemmed pipe which is in the last stages of completion. \nTEN BEARS (O.S.) Dances With Wolves? \nDances With Wolves gets up, opens the flap and admits the old chief. A few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair. \nHe goes straight to the fire and sits. \nTEN BEARS Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my age a good fire is better than anything. \nStands With A Fist brings two small bowls of food, places them next to the men and busies herself with something else. Though neither one is much interested they begin to eat. \nTEN BEARS I wondered how your bad heart was doing and though I would come by and see for myself. This place doesn't look so bad-hearted. \nDances With Wolves smiles. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES No, we are happy. \nTEN BEARS But you are leaving anyway? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I have talked with Stands With a Fist and we will go together. \nTEN BEARS Have you told this to Kicking Bird or to Wind In His Hair. \nIt's anguish for Dances with Wolves to think about his friends. He shakes his head \"no\". Ten Bears thinks again in silence. \nTEN BEARS You are the only white man I have ever known. I have thought about you alot. More than you know. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES That does not surprise me. \nTEN BEARS You have always spoken with your heart. And like all of us, you are a free man and can do anything you like. When I look across this fire, I do not see a white soldier. I see only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves. And there is nothing they hate so much as a Sioux. \nTen Bears words always have purpose and as always, he makes his point. \nHe pauses for a moment and notices Dances with Wolves' nearly finished pipe. \nTEN BEARS You are making a pipe? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Yes? \nTen Bears holds out a hand and Dances with Wolves hands the pipe to him. Ten Bears inspects it briefly. \nTEN BEARS This might be a pretty good pipe... how does it smoke? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I don't know, I haven't tried it yet. \nTEN BEARS Let's smoke it awhile... it is good to pass the time this way. \nEXT. WINTER CAMP - DAWN \nFrom a little distance, Wind In His Hair is watching Dances With Wolves' lodge. His face is full of uncertainty and a kind of pain we have never seen before. He is in agony. \n", "test1_input": "INT. QUARTERS - NIGHT \nA lamp turns up, casting a glow over Dunbar's incredibly cramped quarters. \nHe adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk, his journal on his lap. He begins an entry. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted. Am now waiting for the garrison's return or word from headquarters. Post is in exceedingly poor condition. Have decided to assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The country is everything I dreamed it would be. There can be no place like this on earth. \nDunbar signs the entry, yawns contentedly and reaches to turn down the lamp. \nA wolf howls somewhere outside. It's low at first but it keeps on building. At its height, the howl sounds as though it is coming from, something gigantic. \nDunbar is still listening after it's gone. He hears wood snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again. Without hesitating, he slips the big revolver out of its holster and cradling it like a teddy bear, slips it under his blanket. \nThe light is left blazing. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAWN \nFirst light over the sad fort. \nINT. QUARTERS - DAWN \nDunbar is sleeping quietly. He opens his eyes and rears his head to get his bearings. Then he flops back down and shuts his eyes, hoping for more sleep. \nHe hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession. \nDunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway. Quietly, he pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway. \nSilence. Suddenly, a shadow starts across the threshold, followed quickly by Cisco's big buckskin head. The horse watches Dunbar a moment, then looks curiously around the room. \nEXT. CORRAL - DAY \nDressed in pants, old boots, and a threadbare shirt, Dunbar bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate. He tests the gate's swing and satisfied with this, he latches it leaving Cisco inside. \nThe lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as he walks the few, quick yards it takes to reach the bank overlooking the river. \nWhen he sees what lies along the slope below, he stops. At this spot just below the fort, a garbage dump falls away to the stream. Old containers, sacks, rags, trash, bottles, and a thousand other miscellaneous scraps. \nDunbar hops over the steep lip of the bank and starts down the gentle incline, eyeing the trash as he goes. Now he reaches the stream and kneels, preparing to dip the bucket. \nHe sniffs a bad odor, looks across the stagnant stream and sees something sticking out of the water. \nIt's a cloven hoof. And further out, another. And part of an antler. There are decomposed antelope corpses everywhere. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nAn antelope skeleton is being pulled from the muck. \nDunbar is stripped to the waist as he drags the body through deep water. Covering his face against the stink is a bandana. His pants are soaked and he's sweating hard. \nAt the stream's edge he heaves the antelope onto a pile holding several others. Under the bodies is a huge bed of trash which he has already collected. \nThe body he tosses up slips and he has to right it. Now he wades back into the river and searches the water with his hands for more. \nEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY \nDunbar fastens the last of the traces to a pile of garbage spread out on a sheet of canvas. He picks up a set of long reins, clucks to Cisco and they start up the steep bank with the load. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nA distinct change has taken place with the water. It's running. \nEXT. TRASH PILE - DAY \nOil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap. Dunbar empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto the pile. He takes the match he's been holding between his teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail. He flips it onto the heap. \nThe fire catches immediately and Dunbar has to back away a few steps as the flames send a column of thick, black smoke into the air. \nTo Dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger... climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see. \nDUNBAR Damn... damn. \nHe stoops for his rifle and we follow as he scrambles up the slope. The lieutenant clambers over the lip and stops to scan the horizon. \nBut we continue, following the black smoke as it towers higher and higher until it is just a wisp. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nFour fantastic faces fill the screen, three together, one a little apart. They are tired, frustrated faces, and also very fierce. They are painted. Several wear their hair in spiked roaches, one has brightly-colored eagle feathers jutting out of his scalp at all angles. The FOUR WARRIORS are naked from the waist up. \nThey are Pawnee, the scariest of all the Plains Tribes. The man a little apart looks THE TOUGHEST. The four men are squatting on their haunches and four scrawny ponies stand behind them. All the men are staring in the same direction from a low rise on the prairie. \nIt's smoke, a column much smaller than Dunbar's. The smoke is drifting up from the furthest of a line of rolling gullies. \nWe can see the whole Indian party now: the four men and their ponies, two injured men on travois and two extra ponies. \n(PLEASE NOTE: ALL INDIAN DIALOGUE WILL BE IN NATIVE DIALECT AS INDICATED BY TRIBE. SUBTITLES WILL BE USED.) \nTHE TOUGHEST Only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see. \n1ST PAWNEE Maybe there's more than one. \nThe Toughest turns back to face the others. Without another word, he jumps on his horse. Another silence as the three warriors consider what to do. \n2ND PAWNEE We have no rifles. White men are sure to have rifles. \n3RD PAWNEE We should forget this and go home. \nThe Toughest has listened all the while, growing more and more disgusted. He pulls the blanket from his shoulders and flings it angrily at his companions. \nTOUGHEST Then go. I for one, will not debate the merit of a single line of smoke in my own country. \nHe starts his pony walking down the rise toward the smoke. \n1ST PAWNEE (shaking his head) He will not quit until we are all dead. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nWe're dropping down through the smoke, right down to the supper fire of Timmons the teamster. He's cooking slab bacon in a pan. Risking the heat, he dips a finger into the pan and sucks off the grease. \nThere's a sudden swish of sound behind him and a split-second later, an arrow goes deep into the wagon driver's ass knocking him clear across the fire. \nTimmons screams like a half-butchered hog and starts into an odd crippled run. He clears the gully where he's been camped and struggles up the incline. \nAnother swish and another scream, as another arrow catches him high on the shoulder. \nTerrified with pain and fear, Timmons looks back as he scrambles up the slope. \nHere comes the Toughest at a lazy gallop. He's riding only with his legs. His hands are busy with bow and arrows. Casual but blink quick, the Toughest snatches another arrow from the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. This arrow catches Timmons in the gut. He falls squirming against the slope. \nThe Toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he fires arrow after arrow. \nThe three warriors who came with the Toughest have reached the wagon. Two of them are slicing away harness on the team of nice army horses. The third is rifling through Timmons' gear. This man unwittingly picks up Timmons' blanket. When he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far out on the grass. Then he drops to one knee, scoops up some dirt and rubs it between his soiled hands. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nA lone arrow remains in Timmons' dead body, jutting out of his privates. \nNow the Pawnee warriors pass by, heading for home in no particular hurry. The Toughest passes by with Timmons' scalp hanging from his bow. None of the men give Timmons a parting glance. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAY \nWe're close on Dunbar, his face is grimy with sweat and dirt. He's working hard at something. \nWe pull back and see that Dunbar is half-way up the bluff, he's been filling up the pockmarks, the holes where Cargill's men once lived. \nExhausted, he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses to look over his work, all of the holes have been filled. \nHis eyes sweep over the prairie across the river. He sees something moving, it's the wolf. Dunbar instinctively goes for his rifle. \nBefore he can bring it up to aim, he has second thoughts. He lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer, then walks up the hill and disappears into the sky. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAY \nFingers are playing with a button. It appears to be the same one that came off Captain Cargill's coat. Dunbar stands atop the hill, sighting across the prairie. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) No sign of Captain Cargill's command. I don't know what to do. Communication can only take place if I leave and I don't want to abandon my post. \nHe sticks a hand in his overcoat, pulls out a piece of dried meat and bites off a hunk. \nDunbar starts down the hill toward the fort. He watches the horizon as he goes. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Made a short patrol yesterday p.m... discovered nothing. Will go further tomorrow. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DUSK \nHis long day has drawn to a close. Dunbar sits on the stoop of his quarters. His journal open in his lap. The sign over the doorway has been straightened. Dunbar is staring at something. \nOne hundred yards away, sitting in the grass is the outline of a wolf. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) There is a wolf who seems intent on the goings on here. He does not seem inclined to be a nuisance however and aside from Cisco has been my only company. He has appeared each afternoon for the past two days. He has milky white socks on both feet. If he comes calling tomorrow I will name him Two Socks. \nEXT. SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY \nWith a grunt Dunbar lugs an army saddle out of the supply house and starts for the door. He slows to a stop and stares down at the saddle as if in a trance. In a moment he is tossing the saddle back where he found it. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY \nDunbar is leading Cisco to the top of a low hill. He glances over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed. \nThe wolf with two socks stops when Dunbar looks back at him. \nDunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues leading Cisco up the hill. But now he's glancing regularly over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves, so does the wolf. \nReaching the top of the hill, Dunbar pauses. He pulls out the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie. There is nothing. \nNow Dunbar swings onto Cisco's bare back and with a last glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the open prairie at an easy canter. We follow for a little distance. Dunbar glances once more over his shoulder. \nThe wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching. He has decided to come no further. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - DAY \nConsiderable time has passed. Dunbar, bundled warmly against the chill of an oncoming storm, and Cisco are coming back into camp from a hunting foray. A brace of grouse is slung over Cisco's withers. \nINT. QUARTERS - DAY \nIt's storming outside. Rain is pouring down, its patter broken from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and the boom of thunder. \nBut inside it's cozy. The quarters are still crowded but considerable order has been brought to bear on the place. \nHe is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits on the table. Open at his side is his journal. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Almost a month and no one has come. The longer this condition persists, the less inclined I am to believe that anyone will. Rain has forced me indoors for most of two days. I have begun an awning. The work has ruined my hands, but I am excited about the improvement it will bring to this place. \nA great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room with violent white light. Dunbar walks to the door and tosses out a handful of bones. Two Socks scurries to collect the bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) It is the loneliest of times... but I cannot say that I am unhappy. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nJust as Dunbar did on his trip out with Timmons, someone is running a palm over the tips of the tall prairie grass. This hand, however, is red. \nA lone Indian is standing in the grass, his pony at his side. He is a real Indian; tough, wild and free. He is a person of special maturity. He radiates wisdom and is a man of responsibility in his community. He is a Sioux medicine man. He is KICKING BIRD. \nEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY \nDunbar is squatting naked at the edge of the stream, pounding the dirt out of his trousers on a little rock ledge. He rises, wringing out the pants, and wades across the river. \nOn the opposite bank he spreads the pants on a low bush. Then he looks along the river. For some distance every bush and shrub is draped with the lieutenant's laundry, all of it drying in the sun. \n", "test1_id": 243, "test2_input": "Smiles a Lot trots his pony over to Otter. \nSMILES A LOT If we take the horse of a white god they will make up songs about us. \nOTTER Maybe. \nSMILES A LOT They will ask us to go on raids. \nOTTER Who gets the white god horse? \nSMILES A LOT I do... but we share... you and Worm can ride him too. Who can say this is not a great plan? \nOtter and Worm have blank expressions. \nINT. QUARTERS - NIGHT \nDunbar is snoring. The lantern is turned down low. A horse whinnies loudly and Dunbar arises. \nIn the next instant there is a pounding of hooves and the yelping of Indian boys. \nReeling with sleep, Dunbar is up and moving. He grabs a rifle and lurches for the door. \nAs he runs through the door he forgets to duck under the wooden cross beam. His skull cracks resoundingly against the. overhang and Dunbar slumps onto his back... out cold. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT \nThe three boys are shrieking as they race across the prairie with their prize. Otter has Cisco by a lead line. Smiles A Lot gallops alongside. \nSMILES A LOT Let me take him Otter. \nOTTER I have him. \nTo Smiles A Lot's amazement, Otter is suddenly gone. He's zooming backward in midair. \nOtter comes to ground a few yards back, throwing up a puff of dust. Cisco has screeched to a halt. Now he rears up, twisting until the rope is free of Otter. Then he sticks his tail in the air and makes tracks in the direction of the fort. Worm chases after Cisco as Smiles A Lot sees to Otter \nEXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT \nSmiles A Lot pulls his pony up next to Otter and peers down at the fallen boy. \nSMILES A LOT What happened? \nOTTER I don't know. My arm doesn't work. \nSMILES A LOT You shouldn't have fallen down... now we'll get in trouble. \nOTTER It was your idea. \nSMILES A LOT My idea was only to take the horse. \nThis squabble is interrupted by Worm's return. He gallops up and jumps off his pony. \nSMILES A LOT Otter hurt himself. \nWorm shakes his head in frustration. Otter grabs a handful of dirt and flings it at Smiles A Lot and Worm. \nOTTER (to Worm) You're not hurt... I'm hurt. \nWORM I will be when my father finds out, his bow will be across my back. \nINT. QUARTERS - DAWN \nIt's growing light and Dunbar is just coming to. He rolls to one side and touches the egg that has risen on his forehead. He hears movement in the yard and looks out. \nCisco is pawing the ground. The Indian line still around his neck. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nDunbar is sitting naked in the shallow river below the fort. He has worked up a good lather on his face and is shaving. The big Navy revolver and his gunbelt are slung over his shoulder. Dunbar glances at the far bluff. \nTwo Socks is sitting quietly, watching the shaving ritual below. \nThe lieutenant is finishing shaving his moustache. He stares onto the surface of the water trying to get it just right. Once again he glances up at Two Socks. \nTwo Socks' attention has been diverted. He's on guard, staring intently across the river. \nDunbar looks quickly at the bluff nearest the fort. Everything is still. He looks back at Two Socks. \nThe wolf is gone. \nThe lieutenant hears something now. Hoofbeats. Hoofbeats coming in a rush. \nHe bursts from the water and scrambles up the incline. \nEXT. CORRAL - DAY \nThey're streaming past him. FIVE MOUNTED WARRIORS bunched around Cisco: raw, powerful men on painted, feathered ponies. Wind In His Hair is one of them. \nTheir faces are streaked with colorful designs, their weapons slung around the shoulders, their nearly naked bodies all sinew and bone. They are the full and breathtaking glory of war. \nDunbar is struck dumb. He stands still as the pageant passes in front of him. \nThe sight of Dunbar troubles Wind In His Hair, so much that he pulls up a hundred yards away. He sits a moment on his whirling pony, trying to decide if he should confront this white god. \nHe makes a warrior's choice. Wind In His Hair shouts to his fellows to go on and charges down the slope... straight for Dunbar. \nDunbar's eyes are fixed on the closing horseman. He can't move. \nWind In His Hair is coming flat out, his lance extended. At the last moment he pulls up so hard that the black pony skids to a sit. The horse is up quickly and hard to manage. He pitches back and forth only a few feet in front of Lieutenant Dunbar. \nWIND IN HIS HAIR I am Wind In His Hair. Do you not see that I am not afraid of you?... Do you see? \nDunbar stares expressionlessly into the Sioux's eyes. He doesn't blink. \nWind In His Hair suddenly turns his pony and whips after his comrades. A big smile breaks out across his face. \n", "test2_true": "For two or three steps he staggers toward the quarters, but his legs give way and he falls face first in a dead faint. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nWind In His Hair is riding hard and happy. He really fixed that white god. But as he clears the brow of a rise, a riderless horse blows past him, running in the opposite direction. \nCisco's running back, to the fort at full speed, the lines of two ropes flying behind him. \nThe big warrior's smile is gone. He wheels his pony and charges over the rise, nearly colliding with another warrior who has been in hot pursuit of Cisco. The warrior pulls up and looks helplessly at Wind In His Hair. But Wind In His Hair's attention is focused on the rest of his party. The three remaining warriors who rode with him are all on foot. One is bending over a man lying unconscious on the ground. The third is limping badly, trying to catch his horse. \nWind In His Hair glances back in the direction of the fort, but the buckskin is already gone. \nHe starts down the incline to help his friends. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nWind In His Hair and his friends, two of them riding double, are going slowly home when they see a COURIER coming in their direction. They rein in waiting for the young man cantering toward them. \nHe speaks directly to Wind In His Hair. \nCOURIER The party that went against the Pawnee is coming in... \nWind In His Hair says nothing. \nCOURIER There are many hearts on the ground. \nEXT. INDIAN CAMP - DUSK \nSeveral travois are parked in a clearing. It's a scene of terrible woe. On the travois are dead bodies. Women members of several families are grieving as they collect the dead men. \nSome are shrieking, some are crying softly, and some are beating themselves. \nOne group is just beginning to hoist a body off its litter when a strange looking woman appears in the clearing. She's been running. Her light, cherry-colored hair is tangled. \nHer face is creased with pain and disbelief as she rushes forward, crying out in Sioux. She pushes through the other women and tackles the body, taking it to the ground. \nShe climbs atop the dead man, cradles his head against her face and says a single word softly. \nIt is his name and she whispers it again. \nOf course there is no answer. With each saying of the name she is more desperate, her voice growing louder and louder. \nShe arches her back eerily and wails the name to the heavens before flinging herself back at the lifeless face. \nAt last the other mourners feel compelled to drag her away. The little woman does not go easily. \nHer name is STANDS WITH A FIST. \nEXT. SEDGEWICK - NIGHT \nThe lieutenant rides, a silhouette against a harvest moon. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) I realize now that I have been wrong. All this time I have been waiting. Waiting for what? For someone to find me? For Indians to take my horse? To see a buffalo? \nINT. QUARTERS - NIGHT \nLieutenant Dunbar has gotten a beautiful shine out of his best boots. He's putting the finishing touches on one of the toes. \nDunbar places the boot next to its mate and turns to inspect a dress tunic laid out on the bunk. His open journal is lying next to it. He picks at little pieces of lint and brushes at the smudges. \nDUNBAR (V.O.) Since I arrived at this post I have been walking on eggs. It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it. Tomorrow morning I will ride out to the Indians. I do not know the outcome or the wisdom of this thinking. But I have become a target and a target makes a poor impression. I am through waiting. \nEXT. CORRAL - DAY \nThe buckskin's ears are pricked and his eyes are set. Something has his complete attention. \nThe \"something\" is Lieutenant John Dunbar. He looks like a recruiting poster: full dress uniform, red sash, saber clanking at his side, hair tied in a neat pony tail, knee- length riding boots. And all of it is gleaming... from the brass buttons to the gold epaulettes to the army issue belt buckle. \nThe red sash flutters and Cisco shies to one side. Dunbar slaps at the sash, calms his horse and jumps on. \nWe stop with them at the supply house. Old Glory is standing against one of the crumbling walls. The flag has been affixed to a long willow branch. Dunbar sweeps it up and sticks the staff into one of his boots. \nThey start off at a jog, the flag popping in the stiff morning breeze. Just as they are getting small in the distance, Two Socks comes into view. \nEXT. PRAIRIE - DAY \nLieutenant Dunbar has ridden deep into the prairie. Watching the sky, he takes a drink out of his canteen. The lieutenant hears something, he turns Cisco in that direction. He listens harder. A weird sort of singing. Warily he goes ahead. \nEXT. KNOLL - DAY \nStands With A Fist is sitting under a solitary cottonwood. Her hands are folded on her lap. A blood-stained knife is held between them. She has ritually slashed her arms. The cuts are not deep -- but all are running with blood. Blood pours from a deep cut in her thigh. \nShe lets her song fade to nothing and bows her head. She dabs at a large pool of blood spreading in the ground next to her thigh. Suddenly she's alert. Stands With A Fist has heard something too... a strange popping sound. She turns. \nThe gleaming buckskin horse is standing thirty or forty feet behind her on the top of the knoll. A white soldier is sitting on the horse. A white soldier with a sword, a bright uniform and a red sash. And most amazing of all, no face. \nA shift in the breeze has wrapped the popping red, white, and blue flag around his head. One of the soldier's hands is trying to claw it away from his face. \nDunbar pulls the flag away. \nIt's an Indian woman alright. But now that she is staring at him open-mouthed and afraid, he can see that there is something odd about her. \nToo late for further study. She's risen and has taken a slow step backward from the knoll. She's covered with blood. \nReflexively, he offers a helping hand and calls after her. \nDUNBAR Wait... \nShe's still backing down the hill, her steps a little faster now. He's following her at a walk. \nDUNBAR Wait... you're hurt. \nShe's reached the base of the knoll and has begun to run. Dunbar is trotting after her. \n", "test2_id": 244, "test3_input": "She smiles and tries again. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST (in english) That man is a fighter. \nHe really wants to get one right on the first try. His brows come together as he concentrates. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Again. \nHe listens hard. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST That man is a fighter. \nDances With Wolves thinks some more. When he speaks it is with quiet confidence. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES (in english) Alright... I have it... (in Sioux) That man... \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Yes... \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Is... \nDances With Wolves' eyes get big. He leans forward for emphasis his whole face lit with the joy of having the right answer. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES A... bone! \nStands With A Fist doubles up and falls onto her side, laughing all the way. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES A bone... right? \nStands With A Fist doesn't really hear. She's rocking back and forth on the floor of the arbor, laughing so hard that her eyes are tearing. \nHer laughter subsides to an occasional chuckle but Dances With Wolves is quiet. He gazes at her face. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES What is the word for beautiful? \nStands With A Fist hesitates in her answer, meeting his gaze. A little boy pokes his head in. \nLITTLE BOY What are you doing here? \nThe moment is broken. Stands With A Fist brings herself to respond. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST It is hot. We are sitting in the shade. \nThis makes so much sense to the little boy that he trots in and flings himself on Stands With a Fist's lap. Then a squirm or two. \nLITTLE BOY I'm hungry. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Alright. \nStands With A Fist leads the little boy off to a lodge. Dances With Wolves watches her walk away. From out of nowhere, Smiles A Lot appears. He's been milling about the arbor eavesdropping, and looks over to Dunbar with a teasing smile. \nSMILES A LOT ...a bone. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - NIGHT \nBlack Shawl is settling the youngest children in for bed, Stands With A Fist is playing with the oldest of the children. They're setting up a child's tipi. \nBLACK SHAWL How is Dances With Wolves? \nStands With A Fist stares straight ahead as if she were wondering the same thing. Which she was. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST What do you mean? \nBLACK SHAWL How is he learning? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST He learns well... he is fast. \nCase closed, she goes back to playing and Black Shawl continues putting the kids to bed. \nShe looks again at Stands With A Fist wondering \"what did you think I meant?\" \nEXT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY \nDunbar is sitting on Cisco. It's plain he's been waiting for someone. \nStands With A Fist pulls aside the lodge flap, she's lugging a couple water bags. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES You go for water? \nHis Sioux is perfect, and she smiles. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST Yes. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Let us take you. \nEXT. RIVER TRAIL - DAY \nCisco makes his way down the river trail, he shies at the flurry of wings as a covey of quail fly up before them. Stands With A Fist tightens her grip around Dances With Wolves waist. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nStands With A Fist draws water into a set of bladder bags. Dances With Wolves squats next to her, staring at the eddying stream. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES How did you get your name? \nStands With A Fist smiles to herself as she fills up the last of the bags. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I was not very old when I came to be with the people... I was made to work. \nShe lugs the filled bags onto shore and sits next to Dances With Wolves. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I worked every day... very hard... there was a woman who didn't like me. She called me bad names... sometimes she beat me. One day she was calling me these bad names, her face in my face, and I hit her. I was not very big, but she fell down. She fell hard and didn't move. I stood over her with my fist and asked if any other woman wanted to call me bad names... (laughing at the recollection) No one bothered me after that day. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I would not think so. \nA little silence. \n", "test3_true": "He taps his jaw. She makes a fist and brushes very gently at the point of his jaw. Dances With Wolves' eyes flutter. They roll up in his head and he keels over backward... out cold. \nShe goes with the joke. Bending over him she slaps lightly at each side of his cheeks, until Dances With Wolves revives. He sits up, rubbing his jaw. \nNeither one acknowledges the joke and, a sudden awkwardness falls between them. Stands With A Fist fiddles shyly with the ties on the water bags while Dances With Wolves draws lines in the earth with a stick. \nFinally he works up the courage to ask a delicate question. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Why are you not married? \nThe question comes as a jolt to Stands With A Fist. She stops her fiddling. A visible stiffness overtakes her. She quickly stands up. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I must go. \nDances With Wolves doesn't know what to do. He only knows that he should not have asked the question. She slings the heavy bags over her shoulders and starts back up the path. Dances With Wolves jumps to his feet. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I'm sorry. Let me help... \nBut the words are delivered to her back. She is already hurrying up the path with her heavy load. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST No. \nFive ponies have wondered into the middle of the path. She kicks violently at the nearest innocent bystander. The horses shy out of the way. \nHe's left alone at the waters edge, frustrated and confused. He watches her go for a moment. Then he lets the stick drop from his hand. He stares at it for a second then gives it a vicious little kick. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY \nStands With A Fist is sitting in the middle of the lodge, she starts when Black Shawl walks in. \nBLACK SHAWL You are not talking today? \nSTANDS WITH A FIST No, I'm not. \nBlack Shawl gives her a deeper look, then lets it go. \nINT. ARBOR - DUSK \nThe sun is setting and the village is settling in for the evening. \nINT. DANCES WITH WOLVES' LODGE - NIGHT \nLying on his bed, Dances With Wolves looks sleepy as he stares- across at the small fire. Even, in his drowsiness, it is easy to see he's concentrating... in this case on a certain someone. \nINT. ARBOR - DAY \nAgain, Dances With Wolves is waiting. This time, not so patiently. He gives up and leaves in search of something. \nEXT. INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nDances With Wolves is wandering through the village, half- heartedly looking for Stands With A Fist. The day is very hot and the village is quiet. Most of the people have gone to shade. \nHe sees Stone Calf sitting in the shade behind a lodge. A newly made shield hangs from a tripod and he is painting a design on it. \nEXT. STONE CALF'S LODGE - DAY \nDances With Wolves sits in the shade with Stone Calf, watching the older man paint. \nSTONE CALF Some of your words are wrong... but you are learning fast. That is good. What can I tell you today? \nDances With Wolves is a little taken aback. The elder has read his mind. He decides to speak it. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I want to know about Stands With A Fist. \nFor the first time, Stone Calf leaves his work. He gives his visitor a quick and penetrating look. Then he goes back to his shield. \nSTONE CALF What is your question? \nDANCES WITH WOLVES There is no man with her. \nStone Calf considers before he speaks. It is not something he wants to get into. \nSTONE CALF She is in mourning. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES I do not understand \"mourning\". \nSTONE CALF She is crying for someone. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES Crying for who? \nSTONE CALF It is not polite to speak of the dead... But I will tell you... you are new. She cries for her husband. He was killed not long ago. \nThe blood has gone out of Dances With Wolves' face. He tries to digest this. \nDANCES WITH WOLVES How long will she cry? \nSTONE CALF It is Kicking Bird's place to say when she is finished. \nINT. KICKING BIRD'S LODGE - DAY \nStands With A Fist kneels before Black Shawl, the older woman is combing out the tangles in her hair. Black Shawl senses a tension in the girl and gently tries to pry it out of her. \nBLACK SHAWL People are talking about you... \nStands With A Fist stiffens a bit. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST What are they saying? \nBLACK SHAWL They are proud of the medicine you are making with Dances With Wolves. \nStands With A Fist is quiet. \nSTANDS WITH A FIST I have hurt him and I must go talk to him. \n", "test3_id": 245}

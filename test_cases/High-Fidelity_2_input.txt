WOMAN Sure.  Ten cents. 
ROB Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care. 
WOMAN Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FANCY LINCOLN PARK TOWNHOUSE - DAY 
Rob comes down the stairs holding his single, and walks down the street talking to camera. 
ROB How come I end up siding with the bad guy, the man who ran off to Jamaica with some nymphette?  I just got left for someone else, so why can't I bring myself to feel whatever it is his wife is feeling?  All I can see is that guy's face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records, and I can't help but feel desperately, painfully sorry for him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GREEN MILL - NIGHT 
The bar where Al Capone used to party, and it looks about the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths and a stage for jazz.  Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring a drink with his finger.  After a beat, we hear a DOOR SLAM off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear. 
Heavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds Rob -- LIZ stands in front of him. 
LIZ MOTHERFUCKER. 
She is enormous, and she is mad as hell.  Rob reflexively shrinks. 
ROB What's the -- hey, Liz -- 
LIZ -- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE. 
She turns and stomps toward the door.  Rob gets up and follows. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Rob comes out of the club and follows Liz.  She hears him and turns on him, punctuating with a finger in his chest. 
LIZ To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that! 
ROB It's true! 
LIZ Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!" 
ROB Well she -- 
She turns again and keeps walking, holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 
Rob sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train. 
He stares at an OLD COUPLE who do not speak to each other. 
ROB She's right, of course.  I am a fucking asshole.  I did and said those things.  But before you judge, although you've probably already done so, go off for a minute and write down the top five worst things that you have done to your partner, even if -- especially if -- your partner doesn't know about them. Don't dress things up or try to explain them.  Just write them down in the plainest language possible... 
A LONG BEAT, even five or ten seconds. 
ROB Pencils down.  Okay, so who's the asshole now? 
CUT TO: 
INT. RECORD STORE - DAY 
Saturday.  For the first time we see the place kind of busy. Rob watches the room.  Barry is toward the back, talking to a CUSTOMER. "Cruel to Be Kind" by Nick Lowe plays. 
BARRY It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- 
CUSTOMER I have all of the others. 
BARRY Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain? 
CUSTOMER They always seemed... 
BARRY They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane. 
He plucks it from the rack, and sticks it in the Customer's hand, who regards it with a bit a of shame. 
CUSTOMER Well what about the new Echo -- 
BARRY Do not get ahead of yourself. 
DICK 
is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her voice.

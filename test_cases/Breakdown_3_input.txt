CONTINUED: 
RED Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy? 
Deke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red returns to the cab, passing within several feet of Jeff's hiding place. 
He reaches into the cab, brings out a duffel bag and unzips it. Jeff keeps his breathing shallow, squeezes against the windfoil. 
RED Deke, c'mon over here, I got something for you. 
Deke runs up, breathless. Red holds two hands behind his back. Red and Deke are just six feet from Jeff. 
RED Guess which hand. 
DEKE (pointing to right hand) This one. 
Red opens his right hand.    Empty. 
RED Nope.    Try again. 
DEKE (pointing to left) This hand. 
Red opens his left.    Empty. 
RED Nope. 
DEKE (he's been tricked) Dad... 
RED (laughing) Okay, okay, I'll give it to you. 
He opens his hand, revealing Jeff's Swiss Army knife. 
DEKE Cool! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Deke takes the knife and runs off. Red goes to the rear of the trailer, unlocks it and raises the slatted door. 
He hops up inside. His FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the metal trailer. We hear him SHIFTING BOXES. 
EXT. BARN - NIGHT 
Jeff seizes his chance. He crawls out from under the windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave. 
The STRUCTURE CREAKS under his weight. 
INSIDE TRAILER 
Red sticks his head out of the trailer, puzzled. 
RED Deke?   Deke, you back there? 
EXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT 
Jeff crouches in the shadows. He can see Red poking his head out from the trailer, peering up at the roof. 
INSIDE TRAILER 
Red shrugs, lets it go. He resumes unloading boxes, tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage. He lugs the items into the barn. 
EXT. ROOF OF BARN - NIGHT 
Jeff goes to a second-story window. A board has been nailed over the window. He pulls it away, steps into... 
INT. BARN HAYLOFT - NIGHT 
and looks around, amazed.     Everywhere around him there are stolen goods. 
Matching luggage sets... a rack of women's coats... a table piled with cameras... a crate filled with car phones... 
A stack of windshields... two sets of golf clubs... three child safety seats... a ten-speed bicycle... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Several dozen "COMMERCIAL VEHICLE" license plates are scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South Dakota... 
As Jeff stares, reeling, there is a RUMBLE outside. 
EXT. BARN - NIGHT 
Red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at the barn. 
He beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into... 
INT. BARN - NIGHT 
Al dismounts from the moving truck. Billy climbs out of the Firebird. They are travel-sore, stretching. Red shuts the door behind them. 
AL Man, if I never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon. 
RED Tell me about it.   You get any word on Earl? 
BILLY (shakes head) There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it. 
Red grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers a ramp. The three men begin unloading boxes.

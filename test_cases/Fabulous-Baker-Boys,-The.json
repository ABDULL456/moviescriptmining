INC. All Rights Reserved \n\"THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS\" \nFADE IN: \nJACK BAKER \nis standing before a dirty window, looking out at a dirty city street.  He is wearing a tuxedo. \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey. \nWIDEN ANGLE \nIt's the GIRL from this afternoon. \nJACK Hey. \nJack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment. Not good. \nGIRL Whatcha doin' over there? \nJACK Gotta go. \nGIRL How come? \nJACK Job. \nThe Girl glances at the bedside clock. \nGIRL Funny hours. \nJACK Funny job. \nGIRL Will I see you again? \nJack looks out at the dirty street again. \nJACK No. \nThe Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this. \nGIRL (at the tux) You weren't wearing that, were you? Earlier. \nJack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on the sill. \nJACK Brought it. \nGIRL Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep. \nJACK Thanks. \nGIRL I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit. \nJack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to the door. \nGIRL (continuing) Hey. (as he stops) You got great hands. \nEXT.  STREET - JACK \nJack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel. Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent. \nDOORMAN Hey, Jackie! \nJACK How goes it, Tommy? \nTOMMY (DOORMAN) (shrugging) Ah, you know. Howsa pooch? \nJACK Losing his teeth. \nTOMMY No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps. \nJACK Yeah. (standing back) Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy. \nTommy brushes at his new velvet coat. \nTOMMY Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday. \nJACK Another five years, huh? \nTOMMY Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie. \nJACK It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here? \nTOMMY (nodding) He's got blood in his eye. \nJack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and moves into the hotel. \nINT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK \nJack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the lounge when he sees Jack approaching. \nFRANK Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it. \nJACK How we doing? \nJACK No thanks. \nFRANK No, I mean it. \nJACK So do I. \nFRANK We gotta go, Jack. \nJACK No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go. \nFRANK This time you gotta go. \nJACK I don't gotta go. \nFRANK You gotta go. \nJACK Says who? \nFRANK Your older brother. \nJACK You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore. \nFRANK Christ, Jack, it's her birthday. \nJack glances up.  Frank nods. \nFRANK (continuing) So what do you say? Think the city can spare you for an afternoon? \nJack squints out the window. \nFRANK (continuing) Okay.  And don't worry about a present. I got her something from both of us. \nEXT.  STREET \nJack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand, gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street on which he grew up. \nFRANK Make sure you lock. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nUnless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity. But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point. \nBACK TO SCENE \nFRANK Place looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks. Times've changed, huh? (pointing) See the tree? Remember the job Cecil did on it the day Dad planted it? You can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really. I was looking at it just the other day. Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat. \nFrank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise, then raps on the front door. Jack studies the tree a moment, then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand. \nJACK So what'd we get her? \nFRANK You'll see. \nANGLE - FRONT DOOR \nAt that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties. \nMRS. BAKER Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys! \nFRANK How's the birthday girl? \nMRS. BAKER A little stiffer, but just as sturdy. \nMrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly, embraces Jack. \nMRS. BAKER (continuing) John.  It's good to see you. \nJACK (uncomfortable; balancing cake box) Good to see you, Ma. \nJack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and mimics \"John\" with a knowing nod. \nFRANK Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack. \nMRS. BAKER I thought maybe held gotten over that. \nFRANK Twenty years, Ma ... \nMRS. BAKER Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association. \nJack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he holds his brother personally responsible for this. \nFRANK Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack. \nMRS. BAKER Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake. \nAs Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack. \nFRANK Keep her busy, will ya? I have to set a few things up. \nFrank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch with the bakery box.  Jack shakes his head, wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon, then enters the house. \nINT.  HOUSE \nThe front room is cluttered with his childhood. Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights, perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed with age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed, are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight. Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared, piled everywhere in drunken stacks. This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly, warily, but with a noticeable dispassion, until his eyes fall upon a photograph. In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms. \nFrank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean, perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger, his shirt too big, is caught in profile, looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze. \nMRS.  BAKER (entering) Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank? \nJACK Downstairs. \nMRS. BAKER Oh. \nAll at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT \nJack lets himself into his apartment and stops. Across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl. Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to the bedroom.  As he folds a blanket under her chin, he pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful. \nEXT.  STREET - DAWN \nThe next morning.  Early. The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and beginning to drip out onto the street.  Suddenly, RINGING OUT over the rooftops, is \"JINGLE BELLS\" -- not the entire song, just the first two bars, over and over. \nIHT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering Eddie, opens his eyes.  Across the room, seated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl. She stops playing and turns. \nNINA Morning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee. \nJack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up. He nods to the coffee.  Nina goes to the kitchen. \nNINA (continuing) I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup. \nJack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window. \nNINA (continuing) Did you break a cup, Jack? \nJACK Eddie did. \nNina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch, then brings Jack his coffee with both hands. \nNINA I practiced the piano last night.  Two hours. I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.' \nJack nods.  Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard. Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling. \nNINA (continuing) Guess they're up. \nJACK Sounds big.  What's he do? \nNINA Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast. \nJACK What happened to the donut king? \nNINA Married. \nUpstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the stairwell. Nina peers out the window. \nNINA No breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight. \nTWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling. \nNINA (continuing) Well, gotta go.  Teach me later? \nJack nods. Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits. Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge. \nJACK Hey. \nINT.  LUAU LOUNGE \nThough the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence seem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back, giving \"McCarthur Park\" the full treatment. Unfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause is less than volcanic. \nFRANK Uh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this evening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did. \nAs the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys, a freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up. \nBELLHOP Mr. Baker. \nFRANK (tired) Yeah, Jimmy. \nJIMMY (BELLHOP) Mr. Simpson asked to see you. \nFRANK All right, tell him I'll be right there. \nAs Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack. \nFRANK (continuing) Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.' \nINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR \nFrank pauses before a door marked \"HOTEL MANAGER.\" It's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON, a heavy man in a shiny suit, is throwing darts in the general direction of a dartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks. \nCHARLIE Frankie. \nFRANK You wanted to see me, Charlie? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nCHARLIE Yeah, come on in. \nFRANK Little slow tonight. \nCHARLIE (waving it off) Mondays. \nCharlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it to Frank. \nFRANK What's this? \nCHARLIE Your pay. \nFRANK Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show. \nCHARLIE Take it now. \nFRANK (confused) What about tomorrow? \nCHARLIE We don't need you, Frankie. \nFor a moment, Frank just stands there. \nFRANK (lifting Cindy out of the pool) Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart? \nDONNA I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool. \nDonna shepherds the kids toward the house. \nFRANK Feet! \nThe kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat and disappear into the house.  Frank turns to Jack. \nFRANK (continuing) It's probably the excitement of seeing you again. \nEXT.  BACKYARD (LATER) \nDonna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade. The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed aluminum chairs. \nFRANK Well, look at this. \nDONNA You bring trunks, Jack? \nJACK Trunks? \nDONNA Swimming trunks. \nJACK Oh. No. Strictly dryland. \nDONNA Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really. \nJACK Maybe next time. \nDONNA We have some lotion. \nJACK Just the same. \nDONNA Suit yourself. \nDonna returns to the house. Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his surroundings complacently. \nFRANK Nice, huh? \nJACK What? \nFRANK The trees.  The flowers.  Nice. \nJACK Terrific. \nFRANK (expansively) Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new. \nJACK You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank? \nFrank shakes the ice in his glass. \nJACK (continuing) Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he? \nFRANK I don't know what you mean. \nJACK The hell you don't. \nFRANK I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something. \nJACK Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off. \nFRANK It wasn't like that. \nJACK No? \nFRANK No. \nJACK What was it like? \nFRANK Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it. \nJACK That how you see it? \nFRANK Yeah, that's how I see it. \nJack shakes his head in disgust. \nFRANK (continuing) And don't go shaking your head, little brother. I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling like he's got a day job in a piss factory. (pause) It killed him, you know. \nJack glances up.  Dangerous territory. \nJACK A gust of wind killed him. \nFRANK Yeah, and what put him up there? \nJACK Hey, you weren't there.  Right? \nJack's look ends this.  Frank sighs. \nFRANK Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk. \nJACK Talk. \nFRANK I been thinking maybe we should make some changes. (pause) I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer. \nSilence. \nJACK Sure, why not. \nFRANK It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right? \nJACK It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say? \nWOMAN Hey.  You one of the fabulous Baker Boys? \nJACK AND FRANK \nare putting on their coats, preparing to leave. Frank is staring at his notepad. \nFRANK Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven. \nJACK What? \nFRANK Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible. \nJACK It was a somewhat extraordinary day. \nFRANK I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ... \nWOMAN (O.S.) Damn! \nThe Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway, holding a shoe in her hand.  It's broken. \nWOMAN (continuing) Brand new Thursday.  You believe it? \nAfter today, Jack and Frank are prepared to believe anything. \nWOMAN (continuing) This where the auditions are? \nFRANK This is where the auditions were. \nWOMAN What do you mean? \nFRANK We're finished. \nWOMAN What about me? \nFrank looks at his watch. \nFRANK You're an hour and a half late. \nWOMAN My watch is broken, too. \nFRANK Punctuality.  First rule of show business. \nThe Woman looks around her. \nWOMAN This is show business? \nFRANK (in no mood) Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home. \nWOMAN (touching her lip) Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance? \nFRANK Don't take it personally. \nWOMAN How should I take it? \nFRANK Impersonally. \nFrank begins to leave. \nWOMAN I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late. \nFRANK You're an hour and a half late. \nWOMAN So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here? \nFRANK We ran long. \nWOMAN So run a little longer. \nFRANK Miss -- \nWOMAN You find a girl? \nJack and Frank glance at each other. \nJACK No. \nWOMAN So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say? \nBefore Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano. \nFRANK Terrific.  Thirty-eight. \nWOMAN What's that mean?  Thirty-eight. \nJACK Don't worry about it. \nWOMAN (to Frank) You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you. \nFRANK (appealing) Jack. \nJACK Let's get it over with. \nFRANK All right.  What's your name? \nWOMAN Susie.  Susie Diamond. \nFRANK Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond? \nSUSIE (WOMAN) Well ... for the last four years I've been on call to Triple A Escort service. \nJack and Frank exchange a glance. \nSUSIE (continuing) Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance. \nSUSIE (continuing) Sorry. \nFrank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of \"Just the Way You Are.\" A moment later, Jack joins in, and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital. After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand. \nSUSIE Fellas, fellas ... \nJack and Frank stop. \nFRANK What's the problem? \nSUSIE The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... (searching) ... music.  You know what I'm saying? \nJack and Frank look at one another. \nSUSIE (continuing) I mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here I'm having a little trouble getting a word in. \nJack and Frank just stare. \nSUSIE (continuing) I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right? \nFRANK (icily) No. We are not supposed to be backing you up. \nSUSIE What I mean is -- \nFRANK We're a team.  We work together. \nSUSIE So work with me, not against me. Okay? \nFrank stares at Susie for a long moment. \nFRANK I suppose we can bring it down a little. \nJACK I'll drop the eighths. \nFRANK Okay? \nSusie looks at the two brothers. \nSUSIE Okay. \nWILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER \nFrank is on Willie's telephone. In the front of the store, just out of earshot, Jack sits at a beat-up grand, while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another. \nFRANK I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got a voice like an angel ... What? \nFrank glances furtively across the room to where Susie, making a very sexy silhouette against the front window, is running her hand over a pearl-white piano. \nFRANK (continuing) No, I wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel. \nAs Frank continues to talk in the background, Susie looks over at Jack. \nSUSIE Hey, he's not sore, is he? \nJACK He'll come around. \nSusie nods, goes back to stroking the piano. \nJACK (continuing) You never sang before? \nSUSIE Not for money. With my mother. \nJack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand. \nSUSIE (continuing) She used to waitress downtown, nights, when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing. You know how people whistle when they're nervous? My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you.  I don't know. If they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments. (shrugging) But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since, I always wanted to sing. I never took lessons or anything, though. I guess you guys took a lot of lessons. \nJack looks down at the piano in front of him. \nJACK Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons. \nJACK AND NINA \nJack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds. \nNINA You shave like an old movie, Jack. \nAs Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror. \nJACK In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him. \nNINA Is that what you used to do? \nJACK My days are not the old days, genius. \nNINA What are they? \nJACK The recent past. \nNINA Oh. (nodding to the ceiling) Bigfoot gets his out of a can. \nJACK How do you know? \nNINA I saw his stuff in the bathroom. \nJACK Oh? \nNINA I guess it's getting serious. \nJACK Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him. \nNINA I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this? \nNina holds up the handle of the shaving brush. \nSUSIE Time for what? \nINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE \nFrank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous downtown department store, the brothers turning a few heads with their tuxedoes.  As they reach the ladies' department, Frank begins to flip through the dress racks. \nSUSIE If you ask me, this is pretty stupid. \nFRANK Just look.  What do you wear? A nine? \nSUSIE (offended) A seven. \nFRANK My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me. \nSUSIE I wear a seven. \nFRANK Okay, okay.  Here, how about this? \nSUSIE (looking) Save it for your wife. \nFRANK We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything? \nJack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts. \nJACK No. \nFRANK Here, how's this? \nFrank holds out an inky black dress.  Susie gives it a long look. \nFRANK (continuing) Close enough.  Let's go. \nFrank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room. \nSUSIE Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go. \nFRANK All right, but make it quick. (remembering) Shoes!  What size do you wear? \nSUSIE (from the dressing room) Nine. \nFRANK Nine? \nSUSIE Nine! \nFRANK (to himself) Big feet. \nINT.  SHOE DEPARTMENT \nFrank and Jack work the shoe department, scouting the endless rows. \nFRANK See anything? \nJACK (holding one up) How about these? \nFRANK Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing. (seeing something) Ah, here we go. \nFrank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the SALESMAN, who's waiting on a woman. \nFRANK Hey!  Do these come in black? \nSALESMAN I'll be with you in a minute, sir. \nFRANK I don't have a minute, pal.  Yes or no? \nSALESMAN (glowering) Yes.  They come in black. \nFRANK Okay.  Give me a pair of nines. Pronto. \nThe Salesman looks casually at Jack. \nSALESMAN Does he want a pair, too? \nINT.  DRESS DEPARTMENT \nAs Jack and Frank return to the dress department, Frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper. \nFRANK All right, we got your shoes. \nJust then, Susie steps out of the dressing room. Even Frank stops at the sight of her. \nSUSIE What do you think? \nFRANK Uh... good. \nSUSIE (turning to Jack) Zip me up? \nThe dress is open down to the small of her back. It's a nice back. Jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully. \nSUSIE (continuing) Shoes? \nFRANK Right. \nFrank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them. \nSUSIE They're tight. \nFRANK They're nines. \nSUSIE Well, they're aspiring to be sevens. \nFRANK You can buy new ones tomorrow. \nSUSIE Oh, thanks. \nA BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice coming from the lounge, stops. He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk. \nBELLBOY I thought the Bakers were on tonight. \nCLERK They are. \nBELLBOY Well, who's that? \nThe Clerk looks up from the register and listens. \nCLERK I don't know.  Frank? \nINT.  LOUNGE \nJudging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the lounge as she is in the lobby.  Head thrown back, eyes closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic, exhausted bow.  There is a split second of silence, then thunderous applause.  Magic. \nEXT.  HOTEL \nThe new trio, fresh off their first gig, come out of the service entrance into the night. \nFRANK Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people. \nSUSIE I said I was sorry. \nFRANK (to Jack) Did you hear it? \nJACK Fucking. \nSUSIE Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway. \nFRANK (directly to her) Fucking. \nSUSIE For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. (pulling out some bills) Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you? \nFRANK (grabbing the bills) Give me that. \nSUSIE Hey! \nFRANK We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men. \nSUSIE (innocent) I was gonna split it with you guys. \nFRANK We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress. \nFrank puts the money in his pocket.  Susie stares at him, steaming. \nSUSIE Then I want my name on the poster. And my picture! (taking off her shoes) And these shoes are too goddamn tight! \nSusie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot. Jack is leaning against the wall, watching it all with amusement. \nJACK Nice girl. \nON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of \"New York, New York\" and we see: \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nSusie and the boys performing it in one lounge after another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences, no empty tables now. \nAs the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up, newly done over with a picture of Susie and an accompanying exclamation: \"See the Sensational Susie Diamond!\" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LLOYD'S OFFICE \nJack and Frank, once again in the office of the supercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their cash envelope. \nLLOYD Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local? \nFRANK Born and bred. \nLLOYD Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack? \nFRANK We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that. \nFrank takes the envelope and begins to leave. \nLLOYD Say, Frankie.  Since I've got you here... How's next week look for you guys? \nFrank glances at Jack, giving it to him. Jack's eyes go cold. \nJACK We'll call you. \nAs Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool, then glance at one another and begin to walk faster because they're about to burst out laughing. \nFOLLOWING SHOT \nBy the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing, tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching them with raised eyebrows.  Jack and Frank, frozen in a clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing their throats and squaring their cuffs.  Susie exhales a plume of smoke, studies them a moment, then smiles slightly. \nSUSIE Night, Bakers. \nAs she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her trim shadow disappear down the street. \nEXT.  CITY \nGray and cold.  The streets swept with rain. And once again the tentative piano: \"JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun...\" \nINT.  VETERINARY CLINIC \nJack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room: small and dirty and packed with pet owners and their animals. After a moment, a WOMAN with a clipboard appears. \nWOMAN Barker. (no takers) Jock Barker? \nJACK (realizing it's him) Baker.  Jack Baker. \nSUSIE (likes \"resort') Hey. \nJACK Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee. \nFRANK That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls. \nSUSIE Maybe it's legit. \nFRANK Maybe.  I'll call him. \nJACK Make it collect. \nFRANK (shuffling his slips) That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns. \nFrank looks at Jack. \nJACK Draw. \nSusie shrugs. \nSUSIE How'd you guys used to decide what gig to take? \nJack and Frank exchange a glance. \nFRANK Uh, well ... we flipped a coin. \nSUSIE So find a dime.  Let's get out of here. \nEXT.  DINER \nJack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their collars up against the chill. Frank pulls on a pair of gloves. \nFRANK Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year. Where're your gloves? \nJack shrugs. \nFRANK (continuing) Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.' \nJACK I'll take my chances. \nFrank pats his hands together and glances into the street. \nFRANK Something, huh?  All those bids. \nJACK Yeah.  Something. \nFRANK Yeah ... Well, I gotta go. \nJACK You wanna get a drink? \nFrank stops, surprised. \nFRANK No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been up two nights making sure the rest of us don't get it. \nJack nods. \nFRANK (continuing) You all right? \nJACK Yeah, fine. \nFRANK Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then. \nJACK Right. \nAs Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother, then disappears around the corner.  A second later, Susie comes out of the diner. \nSUSIE Where's egghead? \nJACK His kid's sick. \nSUSIE (searching her purse) I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere. \nJACK He takes after our mother. \nSUSIE Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit. \nJack offers his pack of cigarettes. \nSUSIE Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes. (still searching) What's tomorrow again? \nJACK The Stratford. \nSUSIE Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads. (shaking the purse) Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that? \nJACK Huh? \nSUSIE Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. (finding one) Ah, here's a lost soul. \nJack lights it.  She takes a draw. \nSUSIE (continuing) Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir. \nJACK Hey. (as she stops) You feel like a cup of coffee? \nSUSIE You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes. \nJACK You want me to walk you? \nSusie looks at Jack a little funny. \nSUSIE No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back. \nSUSIE (continuing) Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp. \nJACK Yeah. \nFRANK Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay. \nINT.  LOBBY \nJack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room. \nFRANK You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite. \nJACK Thanks, but I've got plans. \nFRANK All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway. \nSUSIE (coming up) Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank? \nFRANK For the kids. (moving off) Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth. \nFrank pushes through the revolving door and steps out into the street in his Santa suit. \nSUSIE He do that every year? \nJACK Every year. \nSUSIE Aren't the kids asleep? \nJACK Every year. \nSUSIE So why's he do it? \nJACK I guess in case one year they're not. \nJack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the door and exits.  Susie watches him go, then turns to the desk clerk. \nSUSIE Call me a cab, will ya? \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT \nAs Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in the room and looks over to the old phone booth. Nina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head tilted against the glass.  Jack studies her a moment, then takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses.  He pulls a chair over to the phone booth and sits down. \nNINA How'd the show go? \nJACK Okay.  How'd yours go? \nNINA Not so good. \nJack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the soft shadows of the booth.  After a moment, her eyes shift to the carton in his hand. \nNINA Eggnog? \nJack nods. \nNINA (continuing) From Hurley's? \nJACK Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it? \nNina nods. Jack begins to fill the two glasses. \nNINA Jack. \nJACK Yeah? \nNINA Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here? \nJack pauses a moment, then closes the carton and sets it aside. \nJACK Sure. \nHe hands Nina her glass, then takes his own. \nNINA Merry Christmas, Jack. \nJACK Merry Christmas. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING \nJack and Nina are standing in the middle of the room, looking down at something. \nNINA What do you think? \nEddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog sweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why he's the object of so much attention. \nJACK Very cool. \nEXT. CEMETERY - JACK, NINA AND EDDIE (sporting his new sweater) \nmake their way across an empty cemetery. Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey. \nNINA (looking around) There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack? \nJACK Sure. \nNINA That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman. \nAs they come to a plot of ground, they stop. There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father, fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing only her name.  Jack studies the plot a moment, then crouches before his father's marker: \"ANDREW S. BAKER. Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin and John.\" Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the stone, then stands. \nNINA (continuing) Now? \nJack nods.  Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours it onto the dead man's grave. \nNINA (continuing) Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker. \nThey stand another moment, just looking, then turn away. As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new sweater sniffing at a gravestone. \nSUSIE Smells like fish. \nFRANK Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five? \nSUSIE (to herself) Smells like tuna number two to me. \nFRANK It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise. \nAs Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot, its toilet paper streamers blowing gently in the ocean breeze. \nINT.  HOTEL LOBBY \nThe lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there are a lot of swords on the walls. Franks steps up to the front desk. \nFRANK Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys. \nCLERK Glad to meet you.  I'm Terrific Tom. \nFRANK No. We're the entertainment. \nTOM (CLERK) Oh, right, gotcha.  You got bags? \nFRANK Outside.  Blue Chevy. \nTOM (ringing a bell) Cyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up to the Guinevere Suite. \nA lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles out for the bags.  Tom hands Frank the room keys. \nTOM (continuing) Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker. You can practically dangle your toes in the water. \nINT.  SUITE \nTom wasn't kidding.  The immediacy of the ocean beyond the window is almost scary. \nFRANK You believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting away with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest of the time we live like kings.  It's a crime. \nJack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed side by side.  Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom. \nSUSIE Hey, we're connected. \nFRANK Great. \nSUSIE Great? \nFRANK Yeah. \nSusie shrugs and returns to her room through the bathroom. \nJACK I thought we had separate rooms. \nFRANK (opening drawers) We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries. \nJACK I thought we all had separate rooms. \nFRANK Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view. \nINT.  DINING ROOM \nJack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which, like their rooms, looks out over the ocean. Dinner is over and they're well through a second bottle of wine. \nSUSIE You're kidding me. \nFRANK As Charlie Steinway is my witness. \nSUSIE Peggy Lee? \nFRANK Tell her. \nJACK She was staying at the Grand downtown ... \nFRANK It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember. \nJACK We were playing the lounge one night and she came in. \nFRANK Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful. \nJACK Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars. \nFRANK A few bars! \nSUSIE What'd she sing? \nFRANK People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play. \nSUSIE Wow. You ever see her again? \nFRANK No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera. (to Jack) God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it? \nJack nods.  Frank shakes his head, still lost in the spring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds sitting across the room. \nFRANK (continuing) Hey, will you look at that? \nSUSIE They must've bought the same map we did. \nFRANK What do you say we send a bottle over? \nSUSIE I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank. \nJACK He's drunk. \nFRANK Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic. \nSUSIE Oh yeah? \nFRANK Uh, well ... \nJACK Yes.  It's important. \nFrank glances nervously at Jack. \nMR. DANIELS Tom, who're we dealing with on these? \nTOM A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation. I called this morning. \nMR. DANIELS Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say. Not being a musician myself I find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose there's any way you could just ... accommodate. \nJACK Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean. \nFRANK I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is -- \nJACK Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say. \nMR. DANIELS I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended. I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we? \nINT.  HALLWAY \nFrank dogs Jack down a hallway. \nFRANK Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid. \nJACK No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old. \nFRANK What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what? \nJACK (stopping) Christ, can't you hear it? \nFRANK No! I never hear it! (shaking his head) Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me. \nJACK Doesn't it matter to you? \nFRANK What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care? \nJACK Because I can hear it. \nFRANK Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother? \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM \nFrank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror. Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean goes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair. \nSUSIE Hey, fellas.  What's the word? \nNothing. \nSUSIE (continuing) What's with you two? \nFRANK Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle. \nSusie looks at Jack.  Then Frank. \nSUSIE 0-kay. \nINT.  LOUNGE \nAs Jack, Frank and Susie perform \"Strangers in the Night,\" dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor, while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails. As the song ends, the couples applaud. \nFRANK Thank you, thank you. (as applause dies) You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack? \nJACK Right.  I love you, Frank. \nFRANK (stunned) What? \nJACK I love you.  I just wanted to say it. \nFrank stares incredulously at Jack. \nFRANK Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. (moving quickly along) So. Susie.  How 'bout it. \nSUSIE Huh? \nFRANK Got another song for us? \nSUSIE Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them. \nFRANK Well then ... shall we? \nBACKSTAGE \nFrank corners Jack as they exit the stage. Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching. \nFRANK (whispering) What's the matter with you? \nJACK I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional. \nFRANK How dare you say you love me. \nJACK It won't happen again.  Scout's honor. \nSUSIE What's with you guys? \nFRANK Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack. \nJACK Sure you will. \nJack pushes past Frank and leaves. Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself. \nINT.  BATHROOM \nJACK What? \nFRANK Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. (smiling) Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you? \nEXT.  HOTEL - DAY \nJack is standing on the walkway that encircles the hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another. As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices Florence Simmons standing a few yards away with a camera. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS I just know my sister won't believe me. Do you mind? \nJack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the camera. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS I really hate to impose.  It's just that the resemblance is so extraordinary. (focusing) I wonder if you could turn this way so your face isn't in the shadows. \nAs Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other end of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind, her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS Say cheese. \nThe camera clicks. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS (continuing) Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for yourself?  The hotel develops. \nJack glances away from Susie and the man. \nJACK No. \nON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment later we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThat evening.  The trio has just finished a song and those on the dance floor are clapping. \nFRANK Thank you.  You know, before we came out here this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking over your dedications and something struck us. \nSusie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea what he's talking about. \nFRANK (continuing) We realized that, well, we're really not so different from one another after all.  Oh sure, we may be at different points in our journey, but we all travel pretty much the same road. And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce you to two very special couples.  First, married for all of two days, please say hello to Helen and Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud. \nThose standing on the dance floor applaud as the young couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the front of the room. \nFRANK (continuing) And now, our second couple.  I'm talking about Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now, Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told you they'd been married for fifty years.  Why? Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane have been married for seventy-five years! \nThe audience lets go with an audible \"ooh\" and applauds enthusiastically. \nFRANK (continuing) Ethel, Bert.  Get up here and show these kids how it's done. \nA path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make their way to the dance floor. \nFRANK (continuing) Aren't they a sight? \nThey are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the dance floor than Frank anticipated. \nHe nods to Jack and they launch into \"The Anniversary Waltz,\" but have to keep repeating the opening passage while they wait for Ethel and Bert.  Finally, everyone on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the way, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite. \nINT.  BATHROOM \nJack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He hears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a man's.  He puts out his cigarette in the sink and leaves. \nINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm. Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to see a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged, he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply. \nSUSIE (opening door) Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank! \nFRANK You want to tell me what the hell's going on? \nSUSIE Huh? \nFRANK I just saw a man walk out of your room. \nSUSIE Uh ... \nFRANK In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency. \nSUSIE Decency?  Hey listen, pal ... \nFRANK No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning \nJACK Hey! \nFrank and Susie turn.  Jack is standing in the hallway. \nJACK (continuing) What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel? \nFRANK We were just having a little discussion about morality. \nSUSIE Some discussion. \nFRANK I just saw a man walk out of your room! \nJACK You saw wrong. \nFRANK Huh? \nJACK He's with the hotel.  I called him. \nFRANK What are you talking about? \nJACK We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it. \nFRANK He was wearing a suit. \nFRANK Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things. \nJACK A useless talent. \nFRANK Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ... \nFrank snaps his fingers. \nJACK They were simple songs. \nFRANK Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever. (turning) So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday? \nJACK I told you.  It's a useless talent. \nFrank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the ocean. \nFRANK God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he? \nJACK Yeah. \nFRANK I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember? \nJACK You always threw up. \nFRANK Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you. \nJACK He was just having fun. \nFRANK It was like you'd passed some test, you know? \nJACK It was just a can of beer, Frank. \nFRANK Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together. \nJACK You could've come. \nFRANK I could've.  But he didn't want me to. \nJACK You're making things up, Frank. \nFRANK Maybe so. (pause) You ever go back there?  Where it happened. \nJack stares at the angry SEA, LOUD even through the thick glass. \nJACK No. \nEXT.  HOTEL - DAY \nThe next morning.  Jack is sitting outside the hotel, watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado. The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal to the car's exterior.  After a moment, Frank exits with a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a tiny souvenir shot glass. \nFRANK Want one? \nJack shakes his head. \nFRANK (continuing) Ah well, the kids'll break a couple anyway. \nSuddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the newlyweds are heard. \nBUD Give me the keys. \nHELEN You're not going to drive. \nBUD Give me the keys! \nHELEN You're not going to drive! \nBUD It's my goddamn car! \nHELEN It's our goddamn car! \nBUD Give me the keys. \nHELEN No. \nBud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car. Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a madman, trying to catch her.  Finally, when he gets close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot. \nFRANK I think I'll warm up the car. \nOVERVIEW - CITY \nCold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite appealing after a week in paradise. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nThe trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front of Jack's building.  It is very late. \nFRANK That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri. \nJACK The tenth's out. \nFRANK What? \nJACK I can't make the tenth. \nFRANK What do you mean? \nJACK I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance. \nFRANK Be reasonable, Jack. \nJACK I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be? \nJack gets out of the car.  Frank shakes his head in exasperation, then looks to Susie. \nSUSIE (continuing) The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank... I'm leaving.  The act. \nSusie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing. \nSUSIE (continuing) It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it? \nSusie tries a laugh.  Jack nods. \nSUSIE (continuing) You can always get another girl. \nJACK (looks out window) There's always another girl. \nINT.  LOUNGE \nJack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to NICK, the manager.  Busboys move in and out, preparing the room for the evening. \nNICK Sick?  How sick? \nFRANK The flu. \nNICK So she's got a few sniffles. \nFRANK Doctor's orders. \nNick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room. \nNICK You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical. \nFRANK Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up. \nNICK What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there? (exiting) Bad, Frankie.  Bad. \nJACK (to Frank) What're you doing? \nFRANK Just until we find another girl. \nJACK Cancel, Frank. \nFRANK You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack. \nJACK Better give her pneumonia. \nINT.  BACK ROOM \nJack and Frank find themselves in the back room of Willie's again.  They do not look happy. \nGIRL (O.S.) Remember me? \nJack and Frank look up.  A girl in a yellow and black dress is in the doorway.  She looks like a bumblebee. \nGIRL Monica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time you guys were looking for a singer. (smiling) Perseverance.  First rule of show business. \nJack and Frank just stare at her. \nMONICA (GIRL) I bought a book.  That's what it says. \nEXT.  WILLIE'S - LATER \nFrank is looking at a list. \nFRANK We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a couple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me know by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it. \nFrank folds the paper carefully. \nFRANK (continuing) I got some calls out.  Things that might be good for us. \nFrank looks over at Jack for the first time.  He's leaning against the building, staring at his shoes. \nFRANK (continuing) We'll try for a girl again next week. \nJack nods. \nFRANK (continuing) Okay.  Well, the Roosevelt then. \nINT.  ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOUNGE \nOnce grand, now dark and dusty looking.  A small crowd. \nFRANK You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack? \nJACK Twenty-eight years. \nNo response.  Bored, brutally indifferent faces. \nFRANK Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little different.  We were just kids.  Just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old Cecil, huh, Jack? \nFrank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the microphone, is the only sound in the room. \nFRANK (continuing; hanging tough) Yeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in the Roosevelt Room, because this has always been ... \nFrank falters as he sees Mrs. Baker enter the lounge and seat herself at a table in the back of the room. Jack follows Frank's eyes and spots her. \nFRANK (continuing) a very special place for Jack and I. (recovering) And tonight we'd like to open with a very special song.  It's the song my mother and father danced to the night they were married.  This is for them. \nINT.  LOBBY \nJack watches as Frank gives Mrs. Baker a hug. \nFRANK You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you. \nMRS.  BAKER Spur of the moment. \nFRANK So what'd you think? \nFRANK I don't know. Some disease. \nJACK What disease? \nFRANK I don't know. \nJACK You don't know? \nFRANK It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision. \nJACK (another pause) What channels it on? \nFRANK Seventy-one \nJACK Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one? \nFRANK (defensive) A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right? \nJack stares at Frank. \nJACK Right. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nJack and Frank make their way down a hallway. \nFRANK The guy said to find Studio E and turn right.  What's that say? \nSuddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through the corridor.  As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge YOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them. \nYOUTH Fast break! \nJack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it around the corner. \nFRANK I guess it's that way. \nINT.  STUDIO \nJerry Lewis need not fear.  This is strictly a tin foil and crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the \"phone bank,\" monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite, in makeshift bleachers, is the audience.  A huge tote board, set on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total, at 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the camera. \nFRANK This must be it.  I'll see when we're on. \nFrank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's walked into a nightmare.  At the phone bank, a heavyset MAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over.  Both the sweatshirt and the cap have \"Earl\" printed on them. \nEARL (MAN) You the magician? \nJACK No. \nEARL (disappointed) Oh.  What do you do? \nJack points to the pianos across the room. \nJACK Piano. \nEARL (hopeful) Two at a time? \nJACK My brother and I. One each. \nEARL (disappointed again) Oh. \nJACK (indicating the kid in the wheelchair) What's wrong with the kid? \nEARL Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident. \nJACK Accident? \nEARL The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym. \nAs Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair. \nFRANK We're on after Meadowlark. (seeing Jack's face) What's wrong? \nJACK Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me? \nFRANK What? \nJACK We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium! \nFRANK (worried) What? \nBefore Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux strides in front of the camera.  He's VINCE NANCY, the host. \nVINCE Let's hear it for our own Jimmy Marshall, shall we? \nThe audience applauds. \nVINCE (continuing) As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant High this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us Jimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ... if there is a next season. (Uncle Sam) That's where you come in.  Pick up that phone. Make a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the streets and in the gym where they belong. \nApplause. \nVINCE (continuing) All right.  Well, friends, what can I say about our next guest? (consulting a card) He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with us two of the most respected men in the musical entertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker Boys!  Come on out here guys. \nVince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and Frank enter from the right. \nVINCE (continuing) Whoops, there they are.  Hey, nice suits, fellas. (to camera) Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out there are going to want to rap with these guys and don't worry.  Right after they finish up here, they're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we can even convince them to raffle off a few piano lessons if we're lucky.  What do you think? \nThe audience applauds.  Jack glares at Frank.  He shrugs. \nVINCE (continuing) Well, all right then.  What are we waiting for?  Take it away, guys. \nJack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and begin to play.  As the music rises, the studio becomes very quiet, almost still.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously LOUD BELL begins to RING.  Suddenly, Vince steps out again. \nVINCE (continuing) Uh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's time to turn the board over. (to Jack, Frank) I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute. Let's bring out the board. \nFRANK (continuing; scared) Jack! ... Jack! ... \nFrank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect himself.  Jack hovers over him. \nJACK How's it feel to have your little brother beat the shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh! \nJack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face. Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself, and catches a blow on his fingers. \nFRANK My hands!  My hands! \nJack grabs one of Frank's hands. \nJACK (mocking) Your hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue ribbon on amateur night. \nJack bends back Frank's fingers. \nFRANK (terrified) Jack! \nJACK Who's weak now, big brother? \nJack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack. \nFRANK Jack!  JACK! \nFrank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain. Suddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior as Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped and dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split and bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks hollow, frightened. \nJACK I'm through with it.  I can't do it anymore. \nFrank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and disappears into the rain.  MUSIC begins.  A sad, plaintive solo piano.  And we see: \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nJack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain over now. \nFrank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the dim glow of the streetlights. \nJack, letting himself into his apartment and standing there.  Alone. \nFrank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off the engine. \nJack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly. \nFrank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as the sun begins to come up. \nJack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe next morning.  Jack is sitting on the windowsill, watching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS.  He glances at the phone across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes to the phone.  He picks it up hesitantly, then dials. It rings.  Again.  Again. \nCINDY (V.0.) Hello? \nJack blinks.  It's Cindy. \nCINDY Hello ... Hellooooo ... (fainter) Daddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the phone and they won't talk. \nJack sets the phone back down on the cradle. \nINT.  BAR \nJack stands in a dark bar.  It is early morning and the light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere. A big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is talking to Jack. \nMAN If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen. If they wanna talk about their job, you listen. If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen. That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I send you home.  Okay? \nJack nods and points to the piano in the corner. \nJACK That it? \nMAN How many you need? \nJack walks over to the giano and strikes a note. \nJACK It's out of tune. \nMAN Trust me, the way I fix a martini, it'll be in tune. \nThe MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see: \nINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE \nFrank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother and sister tandem who would be better served by an obedience school.  While the little girl pounds incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles around the room, destroying everything in sight. \nMUSIC CONTINUES and we see: \nEXT.  STREET Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed. \nMUSIC CONTINUES and we see: \nINT.  BAR \nJack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing throughout the previous scenes.  It is after midnight and the tables are empty.  Only a few somber men remain at the bar.  They do not appear to be music lovers. As Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys. There is a glass on the piano with money in it. \nSUSIE (O.S.) I thought the Bakers didn't take tips. \nJack glances up, but he knows the voice. \nJACK I give it all to charity. \nSusie nods. \nSUSIE Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh? \nJACK Yeah.  Got my own sign. \n", "test1_input": "INT.  OFFICE \nFrank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who, despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal attitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture any further is to risk contracting some hideous disease. \nLLOYD (YOUNG MAN) (preparing a cash envelope) Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific. \nFRANK Thanks, Lloyd. \nLLOYD Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this. \nFRANK Uh ... thanks. \nFrank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone. \nLLOYD Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on State Street.  These blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while he's playing 'The Sound of Music.' \nANGLE - JACK \nSmoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still, like a pit bull eyeing a steak. \nBACK TO SCENE \nLLOYD Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more lessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this. \nLloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and, business closed, busies himself with other matters. \nFRANK Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd? \nLLOYD I'll call you. \nFRANK Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe... \nLLOYD I'll call you. \nFrank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk. \nJACK Count it. \nFRANK Huh? \nJACK Count it. \nFRANK Jack... \nJACK Count the fucking money, Frank. \nLloyd looks up.  Jack is staring right into him. Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope. \nFRANK It's all here. (pulling Jack out) I'll be talking to you, Lloyd. \nLloyd doesn't answer.  He just looks at Jack, smiling with amusement. \nEXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK \nJack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard stand-up under his arm. \nFRANK You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative? \nJACK Fuck him. \nFRANK This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack. \nJACK Fuck him. \nFRANK (to himself) Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him. \nThe fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to Frank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put the stand-up away. \nJACK So we on tomorrow night? \nFRANK (shaking his head) Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis. \nJack nods and starts to walk away. \nFRANK (continuing) Hey. \nJack stops. \nFRANK (continuing) Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown. \nJACK I hate your kids, Frank. \nFRANK You're their uncle. \nJACK Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too. \nFRANK They don't.  They're always asking about you. \nJACK They tried to electrocute me, Frank. \nFRANK It was an accident. \nJACK It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ... \nFRANK Cindy. \nJACK She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that? \nFRANK She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive. \nJACK You got weird kids, Frank. \nFRANK Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing. \n", "test1_true": "FRANK (continuing) Just think about it, all right? Consider it a standing offer. \nFrank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side. \nFRANK (continuing;like a litany) You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank, I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night. Good night, Frank. \nFrank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb. Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance, then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads for home. \nANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING \nJack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment building, where a black labrador is studying him from a second story window. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT \nJack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in, EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack. \nJACK Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the apartment. \nEddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper and hands it over. \nJACK (continuing) Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth around here. \nJack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs. He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky \"PEACE PIECE\" fills the tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows gently on the keys and stares out the open window, listening to the music. \nINT.  PIANO STORE \nJack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color. WILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap upright, contemplating his shoes. \nFRANK What happened to the two Clays, Willie? \nWILLIE Out. \nFRANK When they coming in? \nWILLIE Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack. \nFRANK What d'ya got?, \nJACK Bosen black. (taps a key) Flat. \nFRANK What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up? \nWILLIE What's the gig? \nFRANK Two nights. \nWillie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head. Frank frowns and glances around. Across the room, Jack pauses before another piano. \nFRANK (continuing) What d'ya got? \nJACK (tapping) Yamaha white.  Nice. \nFrank moves to another grand and alternates taps with his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony. \nFRANK What do you think? \nJACK Try the black Knable. \nFrank moves to another piano and repeats the process, watching Jack for a verdict. After a moment, Jack nods. \nFRANK Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks. \nWILLIE My pleasure. \nINT.  DINER \nThe brothers sit at a window of a corner diner, Jack nursing an ice coffee, Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs. The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs of neighborhood luminaries, including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes. \nFRANK You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth. \nJACK Trust me, you're not missing anything. \nFRANK You look awful. \nJACK Thanks. \nFRANK Really.  You sleeping? \nJACK Only on odd days. \nFRANK (a look) Seeing anyone in particular? \nJACK Why the interest? \nFRANK Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours. \nJack studies his brother's face. \nJACK I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular. \nFRANK What about that waitress at the Ambassador? \nJACK Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone? \nFRANK Funny. (points at his wedding band) Strike a bell? \nJACK It's only a ring.  Not a collar. \nFRANK It's more than that. \nJack smiles and sips his coffee. \nFRANK (continuing) By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow. \n", "test1_id": 108, "test2_input": "JACK Nothing. \nSUSIE What'd I say? \nJACK Nothing. \nSUSIE You're upset. \nJACK I'm not upset. \nSUSIE All I said was you were good. \nJACK (stops) Look. You don't know good. All right? \nSUSIE What's that supposed to mean? \nJACK It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you. \nSUSIE You were good. \nJACK Let's make a deal.  You shut up. \nSUSIE You were good. \nJACK (exasperated) How do you know? \nSUSIE (yelling) Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit! \nJack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment, they just stand on the corner, not talking. \nSUSIE (continuing) So you wanna get a drink? \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT \nJACK Nina? \nSUSIE Who's Nina? \nJACK Friend. \nSUSIE Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her. \nJACK She's four feet tall.  Ed? \nSUSIE Ed? How many people live here? \nEddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at Susie.  Jack moves to the kitchen. \nJACK I have to make him some chili. Okay? \nSUSIE (a look) Sure. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER \nLight from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic as Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window, the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming. \nSusie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as if they were veils. \nSUSIE (at window) Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it. \nJACK How come you didn't close your eyes? \nShe looks surprised by the question. \nSUSIE I don't know.  I guess I didn't trust the night like she did. \nSusie finishes her drink and sets it down. \nSUSIE (continuing) Let me have a cigarette, will you? All of mine are down there on the sidewalk. \nJack looks at her curiously. \nSUSIE (continuing) Long story. \nJack gives her an American cigarette and lights it. \nSUSIE (continuing) You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt. \nJACK Must've been a cheap date. \nSUSIE Soap convention. \nJACK Soap? \nSUSIE Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ... (shaking her head) Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby. \nSusie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly. \nSUSIE (continuing) It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once. Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me four dozen roses. (almost wistful) But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed. Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie. (pause) I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ... \nSusie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She looks out the window again. \nSUSIE (continuing) Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up. \nShe stares at the lights another moment, then turns and nods to the phone booth. \nSUSIE (continuing) So what's this? \nJack frowns, takes another drink. \nJACK History. \nSUSIE Huh? \n", "test2_true": "SUSIE No kidding? \nIt's a small phone booth. \nSUSIE (continuing) The both of them?  In there? \nJACK He called her. \nSUSIE Oh. So what's it doing here? \nJACK Long story. \nSUSIE You sending me home? \nJack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away. \nJACK They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous. \nSUSIE Nervous? \nJACK By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition. \nSUSIE You're kidding. \nJACK He had a mind that escalated things. \nSUSIE So, what happened? \nJACK He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb. \nSusie blinks. \nJACK (continuing) I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her. \nSUSIE Wow.  But I still don't see how ... \nJACK Ma didn't want it around.  After. \nSUSIE Oh. \nJack glances out the window. \nSUSIE (continuing, carefully) Frank said you saw him die. \nJack glances up quickly, surprised.  He nods. \nSUSIE (continuing) Frank said --- \nJACK Frank wasn't 'there. \nSusie stops, looks down.  Jack studies her for a moment, then decides. \nJACK He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean. He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it. It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig. To make me laugh. (pause) He drank a lot that day. \nSusie studies Jack as he stares into his glass. \nJACK (continuing) There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to do the jig.  One minute he was there ... (shrugs) I thought it was a joke at first. He did things like that.  Games. (pause) I was laughing when it happened. \nJack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances up and catches Susie looking at him. \nJACK You got pretty eyes, you know that. \nINT.  JACK'S BEDROOM \nJack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile, her eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck. \nEXT.  JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nWe see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater, sleeping on the fire escape. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nSusie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the window as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one of Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the doorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink. \nJACK You gotta move 'em around if you want to play a song. \nSusie starts, looks at her hand on the piano, pulls it away. \nSUSIE Oh. Hi.  Sorry. \nJACK Coffee? \nSUSIE Yeah... No. \nJACK Look, if you want to leave... \nSUSIE Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes! \nSusie throws the cigarette out the window, then looks down. \nSUSIE (continuing) Shit.  I think I started a fire. \nJACK If our feet get hot, you grab the piano. \nSusie smiles weakly. \nJACK (continuing) Why don't you go.  I'll see you tomorrow night at the Ambassador. \nSusie doesn't move. \nSUSIE I followed you last night.  I mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was about to come up when you came out. \nJack waits. \n", "test2_id": 109, "test3_input": "INT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY \nJack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting. After a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie. \nSUSIE Jack. \nJACK Hi. \nSUSIE Well, this is some surprise. (seeing his face) Hey ... You don't look so good, pal. \nSusie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway. \nSUSIE (continuing) Jack? \nJack looks up. \nSUSIE (continuing) You want to come in? \nHe nods.  Susie steps back and Jack enters. \nSUSIE (continuing) Let me get the light. \nJACK No. \nHe stares directly into her eyes. \nJACK (continuing) Leave it dark. \nINT.  SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING \nJack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down at Susie's naked back as she sleeps.  He studies her face as if looking for something, then takes his coat and begins to leave. \nSUSIE I used to do that. \nJack turns.  Susie is looking at him. \nSUSIE (continuing) Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though. \nJACK I didn't want to wake you. \nSUSIE (smiling slightly) Yeah. \nJACK Thanks.  For letting me in last night. \nSUSIE Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song. \nJack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and turns for the door. \nSUSIE (continuing) Hey. \nJack stops, his hand on the doorknob. \nSUSIE (continuing) Am I gonna see you again? \nJack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light. \nJACK Yeah.  You're gonna see me again. \nSusie smiles slightly. \nSUSIE Okay. \nEXT.  STREET \nJack is standing across the street from his mother's house, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the street.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it, kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there -- cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the damage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks toward the house. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nThrough the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING sound and see partially into the front door.  Half the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light. He opens the door and enters. \nINT.  HOUSE \nInside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a completed FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage. Jack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely into shadow.  For a moment, the house is silent, full of ghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the kitchen. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nAs Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching through a cabinet.  He watches for a moment. \nJACK What're you looking for? \nFrank turns quickly, surprised. \nFRANK I didn't hear you come in. \nJACK What're you doing? \nFRANK Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry. \nJack nods.  Frank looks nervous. \nFRANK (continuing) Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started. \nJACK Later. \nFrank nods.  Silence. \nJACK (continuing) Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean. \nFRANK Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it. \nJACK Right. \nFRANK I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today. (pause) It's okay?  Wednesday? \n", "test3_true": "FRANK There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ... \nJACK Sure. \nJack glances around the room.  Pictures on the walls. Handmade curtains, lightly faded. \nFRANK It's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the house seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep up with it. I keep losing my wind. \nFrank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a moment. \nFRANK (continuing;glancing away) God, I could use a drink. \nJack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat. \nFRANK (continuing) Oh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses. \nFrank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there. \nFRANK (continuing) Damn.  Donna must've packed them up this morning. \nJack holds out the bottle. \nJACK Go ahead. \nFRANK No. \nJACK (showing the seal is unbroken) Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun. \nFRANK No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag. \nJACK Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot. \nFrank looks embarrassed. \nFRANK (remembering) Oh, hey, I want to show you something.  Come on. \nJack follows Frank back into the front room.  Frank stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and gestures Jack to the other. \nFRANK (continuing) Hit the C. Go ahead. \nJack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank does the same.  Jack glances up in surprise. \nFRANK (continuing) I'm right, aren't I? They're in tune. \nJack hits the note again and nods in amazement. \nFRANK (continuing) All these years.  She kept them in tune. Can you imagine? Now why would she do something like that? \nFrank looks down at the keys and his smile fades. Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a different hotel. \nFRANK (continuing) Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all. (picking up a few glasses) What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory. \nJACK I'll take the Mallory. \nFRANK Good choice. \nFrank blows some dust off the glasses. \nFRANK (continuing) Looks like these got a few years on them. \nJACK This'll kill 'em. \nJack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano benches.  As Frank swallows, he winces. \nFRANK Jesus. \nIt suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old familiar place, staring into his glass. \nJACK How're your hands? \nFRANK (surprised) Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing. \nJACK You know, that night, I ... It just all came up. \nFRANK Yeah, I know.  Me, too. \nJACK I mean, you can play.  You're okay. \nFRANK (smiling) I can keep the beat. \nJack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses. \nFRANK (continuing) Charlie called. \nJACK Yeah? \nFRANK Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh? \nJACK Yeah. \nJack and Frank lock eyes again. Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass. \nFRANK Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory? \nJACK Five years ago. (thinking) November. \nFRANK Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran? \nJACK Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen. \nFRANK Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare. \nJACK She asked for it. \n", "test3_id": 110}

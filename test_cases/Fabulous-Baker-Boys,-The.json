{"test1_input": "SUSIE (continuing) Sorry. \nFrank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of \"Just the Way You Are.\" A moment later, Jack joins in, and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital. After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand. \nSUSIE Fellas, fellas ... \nJack and Frank stop. \nFRANK What's the problem? \nSUSIE The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... (searching) ... music.  You know what I'm saying? \nJack and Frank look at one another. \nSUSIE (continuing) I mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here I'm having a little trouble getting a word in. \nJack and Frank just stare. \nSUSIE (continuing) I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right? \nFRANK (icily) No. We are not supposed to be backing you up. \nSUSIE What I mean is -- \nFRANK We're a team.  We work together. \nSUSIE So work with me, not against me. Okay? \nFrank stares at Susie for a long moment. \nFRANK I suppose we can bring it down a little. \nJACK I'll drop the eighths. \nFRANK Okay? \nSusie looks at the two brothers. \nSUSIE Okay. \nWILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER \nFrank is on Willie's telephone. In the front of the store, just out of earshot, Jack sits at a beat-up grand, while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another. \nFRANK I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got a voice like an angel ... What? \nFrank glances furtively across the room to where Susie, making a very sexy silhouette against the front window, is running her hand over a pearl-white piano. \nFRANK (continuing) No, I wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel. \nAs Frank continues to talk in the background, Susie looks over at Jack. \nSUSIE Hey, he's not sore, is he? \nJACK He'll come around. \nSusie nods, goes back to stroking the piano. \nJACK (continuing) You never sang before? \nSUSIE Not for money. With my mother. \nJack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand. \nSUSIE (continuing) She used to waitress downtown, nights, when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing. You know how people whistle when they're nervous? My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone with a song 'cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you can't hear 'em, they're singing with you.  I don't know. If they were, they were all singing safe inside their apartments. (shrugging) But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since, I always wanted to sing. I never took lessons or anything, though. I guess you guys took a lot of lessons. \nJack looks down at the piano in front of him. \nJACK Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons. \nJACK AND NINA \nJack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds. \nNINA You shave like an old movie, Jack. \nAs Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror. \nJACK In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him. \nNINA Is that what you used to do? \nJACK My days are not the old days, genius. \nNINA What are they? \nJACK The recent past. \nNINA Oh. (nodding to the ceiling) Bigfoot gets his out of a can. \nJACK How do you know? \nNINA I saw his stuff in the bathroom. \nJACK Oh? \nNINA I guess it's getting serious. \nJACK Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him. \nNINA I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this? \nNina holds up the handle of the shaving brush. \n", "test1_true": "NINA Looks old. \nJACK Older than me. \nNINA Wow. \nJack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face. Nina picks up the razor. \nJACK Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard? \nNINA Why not? \nJACK Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay? \nNINA What's a prom? \nJACK Ever go to church? \nNina nods. \nJACK It's like that.  Only you gotta dance. \nINT.  HOTEL \nAs Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby. It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation at the bottom: \"With Guest Vocalist.\" On the other side of the lobby, Frank is pacing nervously. \nFRANK Where the hell is she? \nJACK It's early. \nFRANK I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen. \nJACK She'll get here. \nFRANK Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair? \nJACK Awe inspiring. \nFRANK Yeah, well, Your's isn't. (taking out a comb) Let me run a comb though it. \nJACK Get out of here. \nFRANK Come on, stand still. \nJACK Get out of here! \nFRANK It's not gonna hurt you. \nJACK I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear. \nFrank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair. Jack hits him. \nFRANK (holding his shoulder) You hit me. \nJACK I told you I was gonna hit you. \nHe looks capable of hitting him again, too. \nFRANK All right, all right.  I'm a little tense. \nJACK You're a fucking alarm clock. \nFRANK I just wish she'd get here, that's all. \nJACK She's here. \nSusie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress, is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up. \nFRANK Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. (walking over) Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late. \nSUSIE Where's my name? \nFRANK What-? \nSUSIE And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster? \nFRANK We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed. \nSUSIE Changed? \nFRANK Where's your dress? \nSUSIE (to Jack) What's he talking about? \nFRANK Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it? \nSUSIE Do I look like I'm naked? \nFRANK That!  You can't wear that! \nSUSIE What's wrong with it? \nFRANK It's orange! \nSUSIE (to Jack) Am I missing something? \nBefore Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and pulls her toward the door. \nFRANK Come on. \nSUSIE Hey! \nFRANK Come on.  We don't have much time. \n", "test1_id": 108, "test2_input": "SUSIE (likes \"resort') Hey. \nJACK Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee. \nFRANK That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls. \nSUSIE Maybe it's legit. \nFRANK Maybe.  I'll call him. \nJACK Make it collect. \nFRANK (shuffling his slips) That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns. \nFrank looks at Jack. \nJACK Draw. \nSusie shrugs. \nSUSIE How'd you guys used to decide what gig to take? \nJack and Frank exchange a glance. \nFRANK Uh, well ... we flipped a coin. \nSUSIE So find a dime.  Let's get out of here. \nEXT.  DINER \nJack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their collars up against the chill. Frank pulls on a pair of gloves. \nFRANK Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year. Where're your gloves? \nJack shrugs. \nFRANK (continuing) Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.' \nJACK I'll take my chances. \nFrank pats his hands together and glances into the street. \nFRANK Something, huh?  All those bids. \nJACK Yeah.  Something. \nFRANK Yeah ... Well, I gotta go. \nJACK You wanna get a drink? \nFrank stops, surprised. \nFRANK No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been up two nights making sure the rest of us don't get it. \nJack nods. \nFRANK (continuing) You all right? \nJACK Yeah, fine. \nFRANK Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then. \nJACK Right. \nAs Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother, then disappears around the corner.  A second later, Susie comes out of the diner. \nSUSIE Where's egghead? \nJACK His kid's sick. \nSUSIE (searching her purse) I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere. \nJACK He takes after our mother. \nSUSIE Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit. \nJack offers his pack of cigarettes. \nSUSIE Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes. (still searching) What's tomorrow again? \nJACK The Stratford. \nSUSIE Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads. (shaking the purse) Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that? \nJACK Huh? \nSUSIE Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. (finding one) Ah, here's a lost soul. \nJack lights it.  She takes a draw. \nSUSIE (continuing) Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir. \nJACK Hey. (as she stops) You feel like a cup of coffee? \nSUSIE You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes. \nJACK You want me to walk you? \nSusie looks at Jack a little funny. \nSUSIE No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back. \nSUSIE (continuing) Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp. \n", "test2_true": "SUSIE I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all. \nJACK Forget it. \nSUSIE Nothing personal -- \nJack holds up his hand.  Susie just stands there. \nJACK Better hurry.  You're a nickel down on your cigarette. \nEXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC \nJack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his arms against the night's chill.  He glances up at the flickering sign over the building: \"Twenty-Four Hour Emergency Care.\" Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is bent over a magazine.  Jack hesitates then enters. \nINT.  VETERINARY CLINIC \nKID Yeah? \nJack glances around, ill at ease. \nKID (continuing) You want something, pal?  If you're looking for a bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner. \nThe Kid goes back to his magazine. \nJACK No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth. \nKID Regular hours are eight to five. \nJACK Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him. \nKID You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five. \nJACK Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now? \nThe Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt. \nKID You want to know if he's okay. Right? \nJACK (uncomfortable) Yeah. \nKID All right.  Hold on. \nJACK The name's Baker -- \nKID Save it.  What's he look like? \nJACK (puzzled) Black.  Labrador. \nKID All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look. \nThe Kid disappears into the back.  Jack stands frozen, watching the swinging door come to rest.  He looks like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed to his neck.  He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't light it.  He waits.  A moment later, the door swings open. \nKID Nope.  Just a couple poodles. \nJack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves. \nEXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC \nOutside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle. \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT \nOn the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing a different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie. Eddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest. In the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan. \nNINA I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth. \nJACK He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can. \nJack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next to the others.  Nina and he wait.  At first, nothing, then ... Eddie's eyes move.  His nose twitches. His head lifts. Finally, he gets up and walks to the bowl.  He eats. \nJACK (continuing) Chili. \nCITY \ndraped in winter.  Dark skies, people lost in heavy coats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung tenuously across traffic-clogged streets.  Over it all we hear \"JINGLE BELLS,\" PLAYED for the first time completely through, hesitantly but without error. As the SONG ENDS, we are: \nINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT \nwatching Nina strike the final chord triumphantly. She turns to Jack, who's been listening from the couch. \nJACK (nodding to the ceiling) You're gonna knock her dead, kid. \nINT.  LUAU LOUNGE \nAll done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve. Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own little Santa hats -- perform \"Silver Bells\" for the happy crowd. Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable. Frank just looks happy. As they finish, the crowd applauds. \nINT.  BATHROOM \nJack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the lobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the mirror, fussing with his beard. \nJACK Hey, Frank. \nFRANK You recognized me. \nJACK Just a lucky guess. \nFRANK So what do you think? \nJACK Very realistic. \nFRANK (not buying it) Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big? \nJack looks in the mirror. \n", "test2_id": 109, "test3_input": "FRANK Uh, well ... \nJACK Yes.  It's important. \nFrank glances nervously at Jack. \nMR. DANIELS Tom, who're we dealing with on these? \nTOM A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation. I called this morning. \nMR. DANIELS Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say. Not being a musician myself I find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose there's any way you could just ... accommodate. \nJACK Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean. \nFRANK I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is -- \nJACK Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say. \nMR. DANIELS I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended. I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we? \nINT.  HALLWAY \nFrank dogs Jack down a hallway. \nFRANK Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid. \nJACK No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old. \nFRANK What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what? \nJACK (stopping) Christ, can't you hear it? \nFRANK No! I never hear it! (shaking his head) Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me. \nJACK Doesn't it matter to you? \nFRANK What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care? \nJACK Because I can hear it. \nFRANK Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother? \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM \nFrank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror. Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean goes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair. \nSUSIE Hey, fellas.  What's the word? \nNothing. \nSUSIE (continuing) What's with you two? \nFRANK Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle. \nSusie looks at Jack.  Then Frank. \nSUSIE 0-kay. \nINT.  LOUNGE \nAs Jack, Frank and Susie perform \"Strangers in the Night,\" dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor, while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails. As the song ends, the couples applaud. \nFRANK Thank you, thank you. (as applause dies) You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack? \nJACK Right.  I love you, Frank. \nFRANK (stunned) What? \nJACK I love you.  I just wanted to say it. \nFrank stares incredulously at Jack. \nFRANK Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. (moving quickly along) So. Susie.  How 'bout it. \nSUSIE Huh? \nFRANK Got another song for us? \nSUSIE Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them. \nFRANK Well then ... shall we? \nBACKSTAGE \nFrank corners Jack as they exit the stage. Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching. \nFRANK (whispering) What's the matter with you? \nJACK I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional. \nFRANK How dare you say you love me. \nJACK It won't happen again.  Scout's honor. \nSUSIE What's with you guys? \nFRANK Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack. \nJACK Sure you will. \nJack pushes past Frank and leaves. Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself. \nINT.  BATHROOM \n", "test3_true": "SUSIE Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell. \nJACK It's okay. (the cigarette) Last one. \nSUSIE Can't sleep? \nJACK In and out. \nSUSIE It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean. \nJACK Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets. \nSUSIE How's egghead? \nJACK Like a baby. You? \nSUSIE In and out. \nJack nods.  Susie looks at him carefully. \nSUSIE (continuing) If you want, I got a pack in the room. \nJACK No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes. \nINT.  LOBBY - DAY \nThe next morning.  As Jack passes through the lobby, he hears the plaintive PLINKING of a PIANO.  Curious, he goes to the dining room and peers in. The tables have yet to be set for the evening and, except for Frank, the room is empty. \nJACK What the hell are you doing? \nFRANK (not looking up) What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano. \nJACK Really. \nFRANK Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune. \nJack smiles to himself and crosses the room. \nJACK How's it coming? \nFRANK Fine. \nJACK How long you been at it? \nFRANK (shrugging) Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet? \nJACK They stopped serving two hours ago. \nFRANK Two hours ago! \nJACK Time flies, huh? \nFrank looks despairingly at the pianos. \nJACK (continuing) I could give you a hand.  If you want. \nINT.  DINING ROOM - DAY \nJack and Frank are eating lunch.  Frank has a tiny stack of blue cards he's perusing. He holds one out to Jack. \nFRANK What do you make that?  Paruchi? \nJack nods.  Frank continues to go through the cards as he speaks. \nFRANK (continuing) You haven't seen Susie, have you? \nJACK No. Why? \nFRANK Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous. \nJACK She's a big girl. \nFRANK Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there. (another card) Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that? \nJACK What the hell are these? \nFRANK Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea. (whispering) And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie. \nWOMAN Excuse me. \nFrank jumps.  A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop dress pokes her head in. \nWOMAN I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons. \nFRANK Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN) Oh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you play last night and it's the most remarkable thing. \nFRANK Oh. Well, thank you. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS No, I mean you. (to Jack) I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you. Exactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry in your family tree, do you? \nJACK Afraid not. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin. Of course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically, I mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge. Can imagine? \nJack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons. \nFLORENCE SIMMONS (continuing) Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was no relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you. \nFlorence Simmons gives a little flutter of a wave and exits. \nFRANK Funny, huh? \n", "test3_id": 110}

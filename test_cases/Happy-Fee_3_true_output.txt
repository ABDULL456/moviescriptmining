ADELIES ...He's possessed! ...It's a seizure! 
MUMBLE No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight. 
THE ADELIES ...Why din' you say so? ...Hold on we gonna take it off. ...You pull that side, I pull this side. 
They tug at the SIX-PACK PLASTIC. LOVEDAY GASPS AND WINCES. 
MUMBLE Stop. You're hurting him. 
The Adelies back off. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
AN ADELIE Any better? 
LOVEDAY gives a little `so-so' gesture with his flipper. 
THE ADELIES ...It not gonna come off. ...Of course it's not! It's sacred! 
MUMBLE LOVEDAY, where did you get it? 
THE ADELIES ...It was bestowed on him. ...By the Mystic Beings! 
LOVEDAY shakes his head sadly. 
MUMBLE They didn't bestow it on you? 
THE ADELIES ...Poor Guy. ...He don't know what he's saying. 
MUMBLE If it wasn't bestowed, what happened? 
LOVEDAY mimes swimming. 
THE ADELIES ...Oh, this one's easy. ...He swam.... ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment... ...To the Forbidding Shore. 
MUMBLE And then....? 
LOVEDAY mimes the talisman going over his head. 
AN ADELIE ...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing. 
LOVEDAY shakes his head, `no'. He stretches his neck. 
MUMBLE You looked up and...... It just got caught around your neck? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
ADELIES ...No way. No. He's the revered one ...He speaking symbolically. 
LOVEDAY hangs his head. A TEAR slides down his beak. 
MUMBLE (gently) Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really? 
Beaten, LOVEDAY shakes his head `No' The Adelies are stunned into silence. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) But this thing was made by someone. And if we find them, they could take it off. 
LOVEDAY looks up, a glimmer of hope in his eye. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) So where do we Go, Loveday 
Loveday Then he makes a strange "Oi, Oi, Oi" sound. 
AN ADELIE Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant Seal

CRAWFORD Who the hell's fault is - 
KRENDLER - a U.S. Senator who's half out of her head because her daughter's going to be murdered today! And all because of your mind games with fucking Lecter! 
CRAWFORD If you hadn't interfered, he'd still be in custody in Baltimore! 
BURKE Jack - 
KRENDLER You sent in a green recruit, with a phony goddamn offer - 
CRAWFORD You're just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape! 
BURKE THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you... 
A long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice. 
BURKE (very reluctantly) Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. You're suspended from the Academy. (Crawford starts to interrupt) Not another word! (to Clarice) This is pending a reevaluation of your fitness for the service. I promise you'll get a fair hearing. (pause) Jack... you're ordered to take compassionate leave. You'll spend the rest of the day briefing the AG's office, then transfer command of the task force, effective by 1800 hours. (beat) I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take care of Bella. 
Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY 
Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other. 
CLARICE All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. (beat) I have to go to Belvedere. 
CRAWFORD You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore. 
CLARICE You do until six p.m. 
He stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, defeated, old beyond his years. 
CRAWFORD Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals. 
CLARICE But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me! 
CRAWFORD I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now. 
CLARICE But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to. 
CRAWFORD With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony. 
CLARICE He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it... 
He stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it. 
CRAWFORD (pulls out his wallet) There's about $300 here... And a hotline code number. They'll patch you through to me, wherever I am. 
She raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card. 
CLARICE Thank you. 
He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van. 
SOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) 
CLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in background. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) (calling out) Preeeeecious...! 
CLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult moths flutter out. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) Precious, come on Precious! Busy busy day today... 
CLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful! 
CLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) You come here this minute, you little scamp! 
LOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. Genuinely scared. 
MR. GUMB Precious...? 
LOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING 
Towards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows. 
MR. GUMB Sweetheart...? 
From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice. 
CATHERINE (O.S.) She'd down here you sack of shit. 
Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with a series of YIPS. 
UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM 
as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.

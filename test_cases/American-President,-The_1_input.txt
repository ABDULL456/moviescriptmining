LUCY Are my lips swollen? 
SHEPHERD Are they supposed to be? 
LUCY Yeah. 
SHEPHERD Then you're doing fine. 
LUCY Whatcha got behind your back? 
SHEPHERD A little gift. 
LUCY Is it a dirt bike? 
SHEPHERD Nope. 
He hands her an old textbook ... 
LUCY Is it a really old seventh-grade textbook of yours that you're gonna make me read cover to cover and discuss at dinner and drive me crazy with? 
SHEPHERD I'm not comfortable with the "really old" part, but everything else you said was true. 
LUCY (reading the cover) "Understanding the Constitution." 
SHEPHERD Your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the Constitution this week. 
LUCY You talked to Mr. Linder? 
SHEPHERD Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher Conference. Mr. Linder and I were the key player in that discussion. Why don't you like social studies, Luce? 
LUCY I like it fine, Dad. 
SHEPHERD All your other teachers say you're happy, you're enthusiastic, you've always got your hand up...Mr. Linder says you don't participate unless he calls on you, and even then it's a one-word answer. 
LUCY I don't know what to say, Dad. I guess I'm just not...I don't know. 
SHEPHERD Luce, take a look at this book. This is exciting stuff. It's about who we are and what we want. Read what it says on the first page. 
LUCY (reading) "Property of Gilmore Junior High School." 
SHEPHERD The next page. 
LUCY (reading) "We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union..." 
SHEPHERD See? Grabs you right off the bat. It's a page-turner. 
LUCY I can't wait. 
SHEPHERD Good, 'cause it's possible the subject might come up at dinner tonight. 
LUCY Do you see it as part of your job to torture me? 
SHEPHERD No, it's just one of the perks. See you tonight. 
He gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door. Behind him, he hears Lucy's rendition of "Hail to the Chief." SHEPHERD shoots her a look as we 
CUT TO: 
INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 
Where SHEPHERD is finishing a meeting with the DEFENSE SECRETARY, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS and a NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, each of whom is accompanied by at least one DEPUTY or AIDE. A.J. is also present. 
DEFENSE SECRETARY The C-STAD hardware's been in place for a month. We've got 22 instructors from the Army Air Defense School waiting to go down and train the Israelis. 
A.J. How soon can you deploy them? 
CHAIRMAN We can airlift 'em in the morning. They'll have C-STAD operational in 20 days. 
A.J. Any security concerns? 
SECURITY ADVISOR If anybody wanted to hit it, they'd have hit it by now. 
SHEPHERD Okay. Let's move on it. Thank you, gentlemen. 
SHEPHERD and A.J. leave the Cabinet Room amidst a volley of "good-bye" 's and "Thank you, Mr. President"'s. They pass MRS. CHAPIL and JANIE. 
SHEPHERD (continuing) Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil. 
MRS. CHAPIL You too, Mr. President. 
SHEPHERD starts his walk from the West Wing back to the residence. 
It is the exact reverse of the path he took to the OVAL OFFICE in the morning. 
SHEPHERD I'll see you in the morning, Janie. 
JANIE You will, Mr. President. 
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT follows at a distance. 
AGENT #2 (sotto) Liberty is moving. 
A.J. Leo Solomon brought in a hired gun at the GDC. 
SHEPHERD It's about time. 
A.J. She's a lawyer from Virginia named Sydney Ellen Wade. I know this woman well. She's had a lot of success getting congressmen elected. 
SHEPHERD Maybe we should try to steal her. Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that. 
A.J. You know, if you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello. It might smooth the way.

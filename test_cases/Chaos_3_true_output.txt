Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him on the floor. 
Conners QUICKLY opens a LAUNDRY SHOOT, SHIMMIES INSIDE AND SLIDES DOWN...

Conners lands safely on a mattress he left on the floor. Once settled, he pushes the SECOND BUTTON ON THE DETONATOR and...

Dekker and Teddy don't see... A FIREMAN PASSES BEHIND THEM, turns his head slightly, REVEAL THROUGH THE VISOR IT'S CONNERS!

Dekker continues his search for Conners all to no avail. He TURNS HIS BACK, just as... A MAN WALKS RIGHT PAST DEKKER CARRYING A CELLPHONE! 
DEKKER So the corpse in the morgue with your name on its toe...? 
CONNERS (VO) Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone again. 
DEKKER You're a serial killer. 
CONNERS (VO) Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington, Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The world's safer with them gone. The kid at the bank... that was unfortunate. But... you live with your decisions. You choose to take this road... there is no half way. It's all or nothing. That's why others fail. They don't make the commitment. I won't make that same mistake. 
DEKKER You said they were all hoods...     what about, Callo? 
CONNERS Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault. 
DEKKER This is Callo's fault? 
CONNERS If it weren't for him, York and I would've never done this. One random act, causes another, causes another, and in the end... the pattern emerges. That's the Chaos Theory. (beat) It's after six. The money's cleared. I'm a wealthy man. Lei, for all his (MORE)

CONNERS (cont'd) evil, was one smart sonofabitch. The Feds will be tracing false leads for weeks. 
DEKKER Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose. 
CONNERS They should've suspended me after I testified. What did they expect? 
DEKKER And because the "bitch that made her career off you" worked for Channel Two, that's why American National was the target. 
CONNERS Everybody who screwed us, got screwed. Everything in its right place. 
DEKKER Why not kill me? You had plenty of opportunities. 
CONNERS This wasn't about killing, Shane. This was about standing up for what matters. Besides... you kinda grew on me. 
DEKKER You're not going to get away. 
CONNERS (VO) I already have. I'm not even here now. This is a very valuable lesson for you to learn, and it's good to have learned it early. 
DEKKER What's that? 
CONNERS (VO) You don't always win. 
DEKKER All your years of service for not. You're a hypocrite. 
CONNERS (VO) I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly died in the line of duty, but they took that away. If they had been as faithful to me, as I to them none of (MORE)

CONNERS (VO) (cont'd) this would've happened. The system broke down. Good luck, Detective. It would've been an interesting partnership, but I have to go now. 
As Dekker continues his search, his cellphone CUTS OFF! 
DEKKER Conners?   Conners? 
Dekker doesn't notice... THE MAN walks past security and out of the Western Airlines terminal.

TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND. We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood. HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet. CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE KEYHOLE into the foyer. 
INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her side. 
WOMAN (into phone) Yes Donna, I'm out the door. We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the kitchen, unable to see her face. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Just inform Kayleigh that anesthesia is on the way to prep the epidural and I'll be there as soon as I can. Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she talks. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) And promise her she's about to have a woooonnderful labor. As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket. They give each other a silent wave. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Right, I'll see you in twenty. She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but ready for the day ahead. 
JESSICA Buenas dias, Rosario. 
ROSARIO Good morning Miss Jessica. Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY. In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry. 
MALE VOICE (on machine) Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the- And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips-- SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts, noise and confusion. Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark. Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM -- 
LEAD GUNMAN Get away from there! Don't touch that -- !! -- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on Jessica. 
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D) (dire) Where is he? Jessica cringes. 
JESSICA Where is who? 
LEAD GUNMAN Wrong answer. The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the face, knocking Jessica cold. Then he turns to his men. 
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D) Search the house. And as the answering machine fills the silence: 
CRAIG VO (on machine) -I'll call back later. The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness of his masked face. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us. We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing. As the van stops-- 
WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS: 
INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see-- 
THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid. Imposing. 
JESSICA Wh... what do you want? Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room. Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT. Grim as death, he stalks toward her -- 
JESSICA (CONT'D) No, wait.. And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS -- 
JESSICA (CONT'D) 
NO!   PLEASE--// SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that hung there. As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking Jessica in the darkness. Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to show through. Trembling, tears running down her face, Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic-- 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Wha... what the hell is happening?! The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE OCEAN Skimming along the water. And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA 
PIER. 
EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier. VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead. BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design. HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand. FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

Kelly runs his hand through his hair. He can't bring himself to say what's really on his mind. 
KELLY Remember that stupid speech? 
Kelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it. Bart frowns. 
He knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff. 
KELLY I'm supposed to give it next week. 
Bart polishes his combat boots. 
BART Maybe you should talk to my dad about it. 
KELLY You think he'd go for that? 
Bart keeps his head down, polishes intently. 
BART Of course. He loves you. He was talking the other day about helping you out. (ironic) Want to go to Dartmouth? 
KELLY Are you serious? 
BART He was. If you applied for Spring Semester, he could "pull some strings." 
KELLY (shakes his head slowly) I don't think that would work for me. Considering -- my background. 
BART Yeah, probably not. 
KELLY I'm not properly socialized. I wouldn't fit in. 
Bart checks his bandoleer and cartridges. 
BART That's bullshit. 
KELLY No, it's not. 
BART Tell that to my family. They're like your fucking fan club. 
Bart pauses, darts his eyes at Kelly. 
BART Even Tabby likes you. 
KELLY So much she ratted me out to you. 
BART Well, she's inviting you to the wedding. 
KELLY Oh. 
Bart watches Kelly's face. 
BART But you probably won't enjoy that much, will you? 
KELLY I don't know what you're talking about. Weddings? I love weddings. I always get drunk and make out with someone's cousin. 
Bart throws his olive drab socks at Kelly's head. 
BART Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher and tell him to expect a little action. 
KELLY Fletcher, eh? 
BART He's twelve. Let me give some advice. He's very into sharks at the moment. 
EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT 
Kelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door. 
There he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls. 
He goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio. 
INT. TABBY'S STUDIO 
Tabby sits on the couch facing away from the door. Kelly enters. 
KELLY Why did you tell -- 
Tabby turns toward him. She's crying. 
KELLY What? Oh, I'm sorry. 
He knows he should leave, but Kelly just stands there. 
Kelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture. 
Tabby dabs at her face. 
TABBY Miner and I broke up. 
Beat.

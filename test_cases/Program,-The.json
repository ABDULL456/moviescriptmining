{"test1_input": "INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT \nNear closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There are few other skaters at this hour. \nDARNELL Yes, I figure the key is to go places only white people go. Next time we'll go bowling. \nAutumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating it's closing time. \nDARNELL Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never believed a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad, but now I know. \nThey make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble over to a bench, begin to unlace. \nAUTUMN Thanks, that was fun, sort of. \nDARNELL You were pretty good for the first time. \nAUTUMN Well, it's not really my first time. My dad took me skating once. \nDARNELL He used to play ball for E.S.U., didn't he? \nAUTUMN Yeah, how'd you know that? \nDARNELL I saw his picture on the Wall of Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you didn't get his thighs. \nShe laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips. \nDARNELL Make sure you mean it this time. \nShe hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go out. \nINT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nCamille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes. Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his waist. Both are surprised to see the other. \nJOE What are you doin' here? \nCAMILLE Couldn't sleep. \nJOE I was just sweatin' out some of the beer. \nCamille just nods. Long, silent pause. \nJOE I didn't go home with her. I thought about it... but I didn't. \nCAMILLE You drink too much. \nJOE Yeh. \nHe turns, starts toward the door. \nCAMILLE Why didn't you? \nJOE Why didn't I what? \nCAMILLE Go home with her? \nJOE I don't know... I guess I figured maybe there was somethin' goin' on between you and me. \nCamille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then gets off the bike and walks toward him. \nCAMILLE Then why'd you pick her up in the first place? \nJOE I was drunk... I needed some company. \nCAMILLE (angry) Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a real far-ranging discussion with Sheri. \nJOE I mean, ya know, physical company... I was... I just needed to pounce on somebody I guess. \nCamille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around Joe's waist, leaving him naked. \nCAMILLE Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I good enough to pounce on? \nCamille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's totally thrown by this reaction in her. \nJOE Well, you're more conservative... classier... you're not that kinda girl... \n", "test1_true": "CAMILLE (insulted) How do you know? You've never slept with me. \nShe pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table. \nCAMILLE What makes you think she's such a great ride? (climbing up on top of him) I'm prettier, my legs are longer... (pulling down her leotard) I've got better tits. (exasperated) Why would you go to her, when you have me? \nJOE I didn't know I had you. \nCAMILLE (softer, leaning close) Well you do. \nHe looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his. They fall into a long, white-hot kiss. \nINT. THE TRAINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJoe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically. Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top. \nCAMILLE (between kisses) You shoulda looked for me at the library, or don't you ever go there? \nJOE (rolling back on top) I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political Science. I just don't go there on Saturday nights. \nCAMILLE (rolling back on top again) I have a paper due Monday. What'de she do? Sit on your lap or just give you the nail-me stare? \nJOE Shut up, Camille. \nJoe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them off the table and out of sight. \nINT. HUGE LECTURE HALL - MORNING \nSome 100 students are taking a history test in blue books. A T.A., checking attendance, walks up to Louanne. She's uneasy as the T.A. checks his chart. \nT.A. What's your name? \nLOUANNE Bobby Collins. \nT.A. Can I see your I.D.? \nLouanne knows she's in deep trouble. \nINT. COACH'S VIDEO ROOM - DAY \nA high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to run simultaneous views of different positions during the same play. A grim-looking group of assistant coaches approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the images on the screen. \nCLAYTON Coach, we, ah... got a problem with Bobby Collins. \nWINTERS Yeh... \nCLAYTON He talked... a friend... into taking a test for him and got caught. They had a new T.A. in there... \nWINTERS What's the penalty? \nCLAYTON Well, the rules say automatic expulsion for both of them. \nWINTERS Fortunately, we've got friends on the Board of Regents. I think we can beat this if we really go to bat for him. We got Mack off when he turned in that other guys term paper. (shaking his head) But what kinda idiot would do something like that? \nCLAYTON Well, I guess Bobby figured he was gonna flunk... \nWINTERS I don't mean Bobby. I mean what kinda guy would be dumb enough to take a test for him? \nCLAYTON Uh, well... it wasn't a guy. \nWINTERS A girl? Typical Collins. He must have banged her until she couldn't think straight. Who was it? \nCLAYTON (barely able to get it out) It was... Louanne. \nWinters' face goes dead. \nINT. COACH WINTERS' DEN - DAY \nWinters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne. \nWINTERS Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so stupid? \nLOUANNE I... he was behind, he needed help. I'm sorry. I just... \nWINTERS Sorry! You're sorry! You've destroyed my credibility at the University, my authority with the players... Christ, it looks like I'm running a dirty program. And Collins of all people! What the hell's the matter with you, Louanne? \n", "test1_id": 1833, "test2_input": "CAMILLE But you're one of the best players in the country. \nJOE (snapping) He's just not into it, o.k.? \nCAMILLE (chastised) O.k. (silence) What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out here, like you wanta talk about somethin', then you don't say anything. You worried about tomorrow? \nJOE No... I'm worried about the days after that. I just. I don't know... I feel like tomorrow's gonna be my last game. I want to stay up, make the time go slow. \nCAMILLE Why would it be your last game? You afraid of getting hurt? \nJOE No, that'd be a relief. Then, at least, I wouldn't be a failure. \nCAMILLE Joe, why are you thinking like this? Why would you be a failure? You're having a great year, you're a Heisman Trophy candidate, you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the pros. \nJOE (testy) How do you know what's waiting for me? You don't know me at all. \nCAMILLE (hurt) I don't know you? How can you say that? \nJOE Because you wouldn't be here now if you did. You only know the guy that's supposed to make millions in the pros. \nCAMILLE Is that what you think? That I'm with you for the money? \nJOE Why else? \nInfuriated, she slaps him across the face. \nCAMILLE Fuck you, Joe. (starting to cry) I don't give a shit about your money. I don't even give a shit about football. And you know what? Maybe you're right, maybe I don't know you. \nShe turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward the tracks as the train comes into view. \nCamille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry. \nJoe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him. \nCAMILLE Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you doing? No! No! \nAs the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties. Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming. \nUnder the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his clothes flapping wildly. \nThe train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps him over to the embankment. \nCAMILLE God Joe, oh god, are you allright? \nJOE (drained) Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth. Guess you've really seen the dark side now, huh? You should've gotten out while you had the chance. Before it all goes to hell. \nCAMILLE I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's wrong Joe? Why would it all go to hell? \nJOE I'm a Kane, Camille. That's all it takes. We're cut out to be drunks and fuck-ups. We never live up to expectations. It's in our blood. My dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up. My dad went the longest. Waited till he was playin' triple A ball, before he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for my turn. The better I do, the closer it gets. \nCAMILLE You're not like them, you can beat all that. You can stop drinking, you can break the chain. \nJOE If I gave up that, I wouldn't be much of a football player. And if I wasn't a football player, what would I be? \nThe question hangs in the air. \nCAMILLE You'de still be Joe. And I'd still love you. \nHe pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against each other. \nJOE Just don't say I never warned you. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY \nSTEVE ZABRISKIE and BO SCHEMBECKLER in the foreground, the jammed to capacity stadium in the background. This shot is going out on nationwide T.V., the college Game of the Week. \nZABRISKIE 4:29 to go and it's been a great one. Two undefeated teams goin' after each other. Michigan up by four, 24- 20, but the lead has changed hands three times, and you get the feeling that whoever has the ball last is gonna win it. \nANGLE ON FIELD \nJoe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage. Yells signals. \nSCHEMBECKLER (V.O.) Well, it was billed as a Heisman shootout, and it's been all of that. Both Waymen and Kane moving their teams up and down the field, having big days. \nJoe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle, 15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see \n", "test2_true": "ZABRISKIE (V.O.) Kane back to pass, can't find anybody, gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit at the goal-line... Touchdown E.S.U.!! Great run by Kane! \nJoe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him. \nSCHEMBECKLER (V.O.) He's still down. Looks like he's hurt. \nWe go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration around him begins to die down. \nANGLE ON JOE \nAs he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's shoulders, and lowered onto the bench. We go to a BLURRY IMAGE of a man's face waving something. We REVERSE to REVEAL a DOCTOR waving smelling salts under Joe's nose. Joe begins to come around. The doctor holds up two fingers. \nDOCTOR How many fingers am I holding up? \nJOE Four. \nEXT. THE FIELD - DAY \nMichigan comes to the line of scrimmage. As Tim Waymen gets under center, Alvin begins to yell at him. \nALVIN Hey, powderpuff. You're the white boy that ratted my brother out. Sent him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off with the fuckin' money. Left the blood to do the time, huh? \nWaymen begins to call signals. \nALVIN Yeh, you're the little bastard. Account of you, my bros' datin' his cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff? Gonna make you pay. You gonna be my cellmate now. You gonna have 250 lbs. of pissed-off nigger up your ass. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking for the run on third and short. \nThe ball is snapped. Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback, hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. On the sideline, Coach Winters yells, \"Pass! Pass!\" \nAlvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and takes dead aim on Waymen. Just as Waymen releases the ball, Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the blitz, Waymen is goin for it all! Hit as he throws. \nThe ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral. The E.S.U. secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is a step behind. The ball comes down in the hands of the Michigan tight end, JERRY HUNT. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) Hunt has got a step. He's got it! Touchdown! \nWinters slams his headphones to the ground. \nSCHEMBECKLER (V.O.) Great clutch throw under pressure. Can't do it much better than that. \nANGLE ON JOE \nThe Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes him track his finger, etc. \nDOCTOR You're vision's back to normal. \nWINTERS You think you can go? \nJOE Yeh, I'm fine. Just a little headache. (getting up, shouting to his teamates) O.K. Offense, let's get it back. \nAlvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust. \nALVIN Damn tough to scare that little white boy. Either his momma dropped him on his head, or the motherfucker is deaf. \nCoach Winters goes to Darnell. \nWINTERS Jefferson, in for Griffen. \nGriffen slams his helmet to the ground. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nJoe breaks the huddle as the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go, Kane brings 'em to the line of scrimmage. \nJoe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally runs out of bounds at the twenty. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) Great run by Jefferson, the highly- touted Freshman, the longest of the day for the Wolves. And this one is turning out to be everything we thought it would be. \nANGLE ON DARNELL \ncoming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the center. \n", "test2_id": 1834, "test3_input": "REGULAR SPEED \nThe crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block. \nINT. ALVIN MACK'S SHACK - DAY \nAlvin sits alone in the \"living room\", listening to the E.S.U. game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate. His mother mends a pair of jeans in the b.g. \nHARVEY (V.O.) So the Wolves defense has held after the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets will opt for the field goal. Around a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away, it's long enough. And good! Georgia Tech jumps out on top 3-0. \nAlvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from Alvin. There's none. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nBobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick sideline, but it's a little short. The Yellow Jackets' CORNERBACK sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Collins back to pass, rushed, now fires out in the flat. It's picked off by Hill. Down the sideline. He's gonna go in untouched. Touchdown, Georgia Tech. \nINT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA discouraged bunch of E.S.U. players drag into the locker room. Some swear, some bang their lockers. \nLATTIMER C'mon guys, we're only down ten. Let's get our fuckin' shit together. \nDarnell marches over to Ray's locker. \nDARNELL You missed that block on purpose, didn't you, asshole. \nRAY You're full of shit. You fumble, you try to blame me. \nDARNELL It's Autumn isn't it? That's what this is all about. \nRAY The hell with Autumn. You just can't take a hit. \nInfuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging. Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging, trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several players manage to pull them apart. Coach Winters charges over. \nWINTERS Don't tell me who started it. I don't care. All I care about is this football team. We win together. We lose together. So whatever your problem is, get over it. I don't want any more of this shit. Understand? \nDARNELL AND RAY Yes, sir. \nWINTERS As for the rest of you guys. Here's what I think of the way you played. \nWinters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this. \nWINTERS (pointing toward the Yellow Jackets' locker room) They're laughin' at you over there. Makin' plans for the evening. They never dreamed it'd be this easy. You guys are nothin' but bugs splattered on their windshield. You better stock up on potato chips, 'cause you're gonna be watching a lotta T.V. on New Years Day. \nWinters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate their mistakes. Winters goes over to Joe. \nWINTERS Get warm, Joe. You're startin' the second half. \nJoe nods, excited but uncertain. Winters moves on to Ray Griffen. \nWINTERS By the way... don't let me see you miss anymore blocks. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nThe E.S.U. players return to their bench for the start of the second half, gather in a circle. Joe looks up in the stands to the seat he reserved for his father. It's empty. \nBEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS: \n1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it. \n2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is sacked. \n3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nClayton approaches Winters on the sideline. \nCLAYTON Joe's too tentative, too cautious out there. He seems flat. Maybe we oughta give Collins another shot. \nWINTERS Joe just needs to get the feel back. He'll be allright. \nCLAYTON Sam, we can't afford to wait... \n", "test3_true": "ANGLE ON JOE \nHARVEY (V.O.) 5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to nothing. The Wolves are gonna have to find some offense in a hurry here. Their defense has been keepin' them in it. \nAs he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes up to him. \nWINTERS Joe, I know that Rehab was good for you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits. But what about the rest of you? What happened to the Joe Kane that used to take command of this team, the Joe Kane these guys i'd run through a bulldozer for? They put him out with the trash? What are you waitin' for, somebody to feel sorry for you cause you've had some problems? Nobody in this stadium gives a shit. It's time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at the head of the Table. \nANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE \nAs Joe comes into the huddle. He's all business now. \nJOE All right, we've held these guys up long enough. Give me time back here, and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift, green, bolt. First sound. \nJoe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells \"Go!\" The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe: \n1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle. \n2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket, scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to get it to the four, but it's gonna bring up fourth and goal. No doubt about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go for it here, if they're gonna get back in this game. \nANGLE ON THE SIDELINE \nWinters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into the huddle. \nRAY Give it to me up the gut, Coach. They've been ignoring me. I know I can score. \nWINTERS No, we're gonna go with the sweep. \nWinters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is upset, angry. He swears to himself. \nANGLE ON FIELD \nRay enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear. \nJOE 28 Thunder right. On 2. \nThe team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building. \nWe go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make the block. He drops out of our picture. \nDARNELL Shit! \nDarnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line. Touchdown, E.S.U. \nThe stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to talk to his defense. \nDarnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray, grabs him by the helmet. \nDARNELL Monster block, man. Monster motherfuckin' block. \nRay smiles. They butt heads and run off the field \nINT. ALVIN'S SHACK \nALVIN (softly to himself) All right, defense. Let's get evil. Kill 'em all, let the paramedics sort 'em out. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nGeorgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle. \nHARVEY (V.O.) 1:11 and counting. Third and one. The Wolves have got to stop them on this play if they're gonna get the ball back. A first down here and it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of timeouts. \nThe Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a fierce yell. \nSmash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way. \nLattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling their arms, whipping up the crowd. \nANGLE ON SIDELINE \nWinters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise. \nANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER \n", "test3_id": 1835}

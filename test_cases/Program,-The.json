{"train": "THE PROGRAM \nWritten by \nDavid S. Ward & Aaron Latham \nREVISED TAN 11/23/92 SHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN \nON BLACK SCREEN \nSPORTSCASTER'S VOICE (V.O.) Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em down. \nINSTANT CUT TO: \nLINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT \nsmashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes set, frosted breath steaming across to: \nThe DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode. \nCLOSE ON JOE KANE \nE.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped, and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the slop. \nJoe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by, grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him face-down in the swamp. \nWe FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete. The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION. \nJoe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then drops his head in defeat. \nANGLE ON SAM WINTERS \nBetraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense, early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across the field. \nREPORTER #1 (V.O.) Coach, this is the second year in a row you've failed to go to a bowl game. Do you feel your program's in decline? \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nCoach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face. \nWINTERS (keeping his cool) No, we're just a young team on the verge. We'll be back in a major bowl next year. \nElsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud- splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it. \nALVIN Good throw, Joe. It was there. \nJOE So was half their team. (trailing off) Shit, another Christmas at home. \nALVIN Next year, man. Next year we sell out. Next year we dominate. \nON COACH WINTERS AGAIN \nstill fielding questions. \nREPORTER #2 You still need a deep threat or a breakaway back to go with Joe Kane. What are you gonna do to address this need? \nCOACH WINTERS (a little edgy) Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you guys for a start. \nAs Winters gets up to go, we hear: \nWILSON (V.O.) I'm not gonna lead you into the fog here, Sam... \nINT. CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY \nCHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director. \nCHANCELLOR WILSON I'm concerned about our Program. It's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two straight so-so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund-raising, both public and private. \nWINTERS (half-joking) Then stop raising the entrance requirements on me. We never could have gotten Alvin Mack in here under the new guidelines. \nCHANCELLOR WILSON As Chancellor, my first responsibility is to the academic interests of this University. \nWilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is \nFRANK Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn't think we'de see you here this Christmas, little brother. \nJOE You won't next year. \nJOE'S FATHER (getting up) Yeh, well we won't rent your place on the couch. \nAs Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree. We see that the whole tree is covered with cans. \nINT. PHILADELPHIA BOY'S HOME - NIGHT \nDarnell talks on a pay phone in the hall. \nDARNELL You're from E.S.U? \nGIRL'S VOICE Yeh. I was just sittin' here by the fire doin' my homework, and decided to give you a call. See how you're doin'. \nINT. OFFICE IN E.S.U. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT - NIGHT \nWe see who Darnell is talking to: AUTUMN HALEY, beautiful black girl, stylish, long straight hair, definitely not street. \nAUTUMN Coach Winters has been telling me about you. I'm looking forward to seeing you when you come to visit. I'll be your guide. You are coming to visit aren't you? \nWe PULL BACK and REVEAL Autumn in an office with 15 other telephones, a coed on every one. ASST. COACH MYERS supervises with a clipboard of names and numbers. \nEXT. TUNNEL OF WOLFDEN STADIUM - DAY \nJoe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive than Darnell thought she'd be. \nShe takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking, pom-poms whirling. \nThe band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and picture appear. The stadium P.A. ANNOUNCER cuts in. \nP.A. ANNOUNCER Now for the starting line-up for the E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback, number 20, Darnell Jefferson!! \nDARNELL You got that right. \nDarnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance. Slaps hands with Joe. \nEXT. PICTURESQUE CAMPUS WALK - NIGHT \nRomantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights. Darnell and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's dorm. \nDARNELL Thanks for showin' me around, Autumn. I don't meet too many females like you. You got a lotta class. Real efficacious. Maybe I'll check you out in the fall. \nAUTUMN I hope so, Darnell. \nHe leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to let it deepen, then breaks it off. \nAUTUMN Good night. \nAs he watches her go up the steps, we go to: \nEXT. THE BOYS HOME - DAY \nEarly February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's home is under seige. Reporters. Microphones. Television cameras. Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an ESU jersey with #1 emblazoned on it. \nDARNELL Now you know where I'm going and what we're indubitably going to be. \nMUSIC and TITLES END. \nEXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY \nA hot, late summer day. Over the deserted Quad, we see the title: 6 MONTHS LATER. \nIt fades and we MOVE TO REVEAL a city BUS pulling up at a curb adjacent to the Quad. Off steps Darnell, carrying one battered suitcase. Joe Kane and BUD LITE KAMINSKY, offensive line tackle, are there to greet him. \nJOE Hey, Darnell, Welcome to E.S.U. \nDARNELL (shaking hands) Yeh, good to see you guys. What happened to the band and the dancin' honies? \nJOE Regular students don't come back for two weeks yet. Not that they woulda been here. Now that you've enrolled, you're just another wormshit freshman. \nINT. BROWNING ATHLETIC DORM - DAY \nA dorm devoted exclusively to football players. Luxurious lounges, study halls, saunas, recreation and media rooms. Spacious living quarters. A world unto itself. \nJOE I'm gonna lead... but can you follow? \nMuted chuckles, but set faces. The challenge accepted. Joe chugs his beer, pours another. \nEXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The others join in. \nBUD What are we doin', Joe? \nJOE (slightly slurred) There's something I wanta try. Gotta wake up our Mojo. Start settin' the tone for the season. \nBUD This is not a good time to be settin' anything. You're in no shape... \nSuddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway. \nBUD Joe, c'mon Joe, don't be an asshole. Joe! God-damnit, why's he always doin' shit like this? Coach'll fuckin' kill me. Alvin, go get him, will ya? \nALVIN Hell no, you go get his ass. Crazy motherfucker. \nJoe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by, then lies down on his back, arms at his side. \nJOE'S POINT OF VIEW \nCars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt. \nBud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now. \nBUD Fuck this shit. \nPissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft- wake of a passing truck almost blows him over. \nBUD C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get the hell outa here. What if somebody drifts or crosses the line to pass? \nJOE What's the matter, Bud? Can't you follow? \nBud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare. \nBUD (torn) God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit. \nBud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in. Alvin and the others can't believe it. \nALVIN Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder bread out there. \nBOBBY They're makin' us look like pussies, ya know. Standin' here suckin' our thumbs. \nLATTIMER (to Alvin) Yeh, and there's nobody from the Defense out there. \nBobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante up. Both turn to Alvin. \nALVIN What are you lookin' at? You think you're bad? \nAlvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop. Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby, holds him back. \nLOUANNE (vaguely sexual) Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be careful. \nBobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, leaving her breathless. \nAlvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody scared shitless, howling their lungs out. \nLouanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road. \nDARNELL This guy do this kinda shit a lot? They never mentioned this in recruiting. \nFinally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING \nTwenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the clock, goes on to the next page. \nEXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING \nDarnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's still thinking about the test. \nDARNELL We'll see. (departing, to Ray) Give my best to Miss Lilly. \nAutumn's mortification is complete. \nRAY (to himself) What the hell is that supposed to mean? \nEXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY \nEstablish the new, modern KELLER CENTER, home of the E.S.U. Athletic Department. \nINT. KELLER CENTER - DAY \nThe football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U. greats arranged on the Wall of Honor. \nBehind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation punctuated with laughter. \nA door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes immediately. Coach Winters walks in. The Upperclassmen break into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join in. \nWINTERS Good to see you again, gentlemen. (catching sight of Darnell) Jefferson, either take off the earring or put on a dress. \nThe upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off his earring. \nWINTERS I wanna talk a little about what we're trying to do here. There are many highly respected people who feel football is about preparation for life. \nThe players nod reverentially at this established axiom of the football cannon. \nWINTERS These people are full of shit. You see, football is not like life. (pause) It's better. More exciting, more intense, more fun. In life, people are always wondering how they measure up; whether they're getting ahead or fallin' behind. In football, you know. Every week you get a chance to show what you're made of, a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who can't play this game are left to agonize about. \nSpreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football player. \nWINTERS Last year we didn't make enough of those chances. Last year everyone felt we let the school down. Fuck the school. We let ourselves down. (pointing to the Wall of Honor) We let down a great tradition, a 120- year-old Line of Champions. \nThe smiles are gone. Lots of set faces now. Shame. anger, retribution. \nWINTERS Any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of knights. That first time our starting unit takes the field, the first time we huddle up; that's our inner circle, that's our Round Table. If I were an upperclassman, I'd be real nervous about my seat, cause we got some very talented new-comers this year. Guys who want a place at the Table. (producing Darnell's trophy from behind the podium) This is the trophy one of our freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as a Pennsylvania State High School First Team All-American. You know what this says to me? \nThe freshmen are hanging on every word. \nWINTERS Not a god-damn thing. \nHe smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half, shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog. The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen. \nWINTERS (to the freshmen) Everybody here was a high school All- American. (to all the players) Whatever any of you have done before is out the window. We're startin' over. Ground zero. The Table is empty. Are you ready? \nThe upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. We go to the freshmen. They're not so sure. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. E.S.U. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nPassing drills. Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head. Joe's angry with himself. \nCOACH CLAYTON (to Winters) He's too pumped up. Tryin' to win the damn Heisman on every throw. I'm not sure he's ready for all this hype. \nCOACH HUMES Little late to be worryin' about that. If we don't follow up the Sports Illustrated cover with something, it'll look like we didn't believe in our own player. \nWINTERS Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll be allright. \nEXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nScrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin, pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run. \nThe players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground, the wind knocked out of him. Ray Griffen runs by to take his place. \nGRIFFEN Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You got all the moves. \nWINTERS (shouting to the team) Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15 yards, run the next play. \nThe scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind. Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask. \nWINTERS Cut the necktie tackle horseshit. You think you're in some kinda highlight reel? He left you huggin' air. Target his guts. Drive right through his abdomen. I wanta see snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta see shit in his underwear. \nLattimer nods chastised. Winters moves over to check on Darnell. \nWINTERS You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt? \nThe players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe. \nDARNELL (mock introduction) Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I'm a young black man. \nJOE Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane, Caucasian. So what doya think a that new Garth Brooks album? \nDARNELL I love that motherfucker. \nCoach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables are integrated now. \nWINTERS That's more like it. \nHe turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to drift back to their old tables. \nINT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT \nJoe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in. \nJOE How ya' doin'? \nCAMILLE Fine. \nJOE Little late to be workin' out, isn't it? \nCAMILLE (with a little edge) Only time I could get in here when the football team wasn't usin' it. \nJOE (trying to get a rise out of her) Well, if it wasn't for the football team, might not be a weight room to use. You tryin' to firm up a little, or what? \nCAMILLE (unfazed) Don't need to firm up. I'm strengthening my knee. Had arthroscopic surgery. \nJOE Had my knee scoped once too. When you're finished here, maybe we could get a yogurt, compare scars. \nCAMILLE Sorry, I don't date football players. They're all full of themselves. I saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated, so you're probably worse than most. \nJOE That's real open minded of you. So you won't consider doin' anything with me? \nCAMILLE No. \nJOE Well at least tell me what happened to your knee. What'd you do? Fall outa your convertible? \nCamille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's going to fire on him. Wrong. \nCAMILLE You know, there's maybe one thing I'd do with you. \nJOE What's that? \nCAMILLE Tennis. I'll play tennis with you. \nCamille starts to walk away. \nJOE Tennis. You mean now? It's raining. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nCAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT \nsmashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins watch, amazed. \nWe begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence. Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back. \nCAMILLE Thanks for the game, Heisman. You took it really well. \nAnd she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her, pissed. \nJOE What's this Heisman crap? \nCamille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve. \nJOE I didn't say anything about being a Heisman candidate. I don't go around strokin' myself about it. So what's this shit you're givin' me? \nCAMILLE I... I'm sorry... I just figured you were probably kissin' yourself in the mirror every morning. \nJOE You figured wrong. \nNow Joe walks away and Camille goes after him. \nCAMILLE Hello... \nON JOE \nJOE This is Joe Kane. What did you decide? \nCAMILLE (still drowsy) What? (looking at the clock) It's 3:00 in the morning. \nJOE I wanta know what you decided. \nCAMILLE I don't know... I couldn't think of any other sports I could beat you at. \nJOE Then I'll pick you up tonight at \nHe hangs up. \nCAMILLE What? \nINT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY \nAutumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see Darnell. \nDARNELL Hey, Autumn. \nAUTUMN Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here? \nDARNELL My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya know, just to get me over a couple rough spots. (showing her a paper) I saw your name on this list. I figured if you couldn't keep my attention, nobody could. \nAUTUMN I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already been assigned. You're gonna have to find somebody else. I'm tutoring Scott Sherman. \nDARNELL Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters to switch us. \nAUTUMN Coach Winters wouldn't do that. \nDARNELL Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect than Sherman. (pointing across the way) He's a lineman on the scout team. \nAutumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough, SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn can't believe it. She tries to compose herself. \nDarnell sits down across the table from her. \nDARNELL C'mon Autumn, you could teach me some real erudition. \nAUTUMN (trying to whisper, pissed) Will you stop using those big words. It sounds ridiculous. \nDARNELL (serious about this) What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself. I learn a new word out of the dictionary every day. Mendacious, pejorative, antithetical, commensurate... \nAUTUMN And you don't ever use them right. Pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated. Or erudite. It's just a con. And it makes you sound stupid, no matter how big a prospect you are. \nDarnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His customary bravado melts away. \nDARNELL O.K... even more reason for you to be my tutor. You already taught me something. \nAutumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having trouble being angry about it. \nALVIN MACK \nAt another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP. \nEXT. CAMILLE'S DORM - LATE AFTERNOON \nCamille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on his Harley. \nCAMILLE We goin' on that? \nJOE Yeh. I thought we might take a ride. \nCAMILLE I promised my dad I'd never get on one of those. \nJOE What are you, one of these trust- fund princesses? It's fine for me to play a game I don't know, but I ask you to try somethin' different and you hide behind your daddy. \nHe holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her to decline this challenge. \nCAMILLE (snatching the helmet) All right. But we go slow. No cowboy stuff. \nJoe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they roar off. \nDarnell listening to a Walkman, is going through a pregame ritual by his locker; pivoting from leg to leg, switching the ball from arm to arm. \nDARNELL (V.O.) Just that I'm here. That I'm not dead or in jail. \nINT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN \nJOE The great thing about football is you can lose yourself in it. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY \nJoe sits off in a corner by himself, his head back against the wall, staring out into space, the only movement the rhythmic tapping of his feet. \nJOE (V.O.) There's no time to think, to worry, to have doubts. Everything else fades away. You just move and react. \nINT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE \nALVIN The best thing is when you dominate. That feeling when you hit a guy real good, really stick him, and you hear that little moan. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY \nAlvin, his ass-kicking game face on, walks over to where Lattimer is finishing decorating his face with Indian war paint. They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his mouth. Alvin spits into it. Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's. Darnell can't believe this shit. \nALVIN (V.O.) You know it's killin' him, but you feel great. It's just him and you, and he's the one that's hurtin'. \nWe move in on the burning ferocity of Alvin's eyes and \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. STADIUM TUNNEL - GAME DAY \nThe Players are bunched together in the tunnel, slapping pads, yelling encouragement. Winters waves them forward. They start to run down the tunnel. \nPLAYERS P.O.V. \nCAMERA runs with the players as the light at the end of the tunnel becomes larger and brighter. Crowd NOISE becomes louder until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the light and 95,000 VOICES ROAR. AND ROAR! AND ROAR! This is Big Time College Football. \nINT. RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH \nE.S.U. announcer BRAD HARVEY and colorman, HARMON SLOAN are holding forth. \nHARVEY Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den where the E.S.U. Timberwolves, led by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open their season against the tough Mississippi State Bulldogs under head coach Jackie Sherrill. \nEXT. THE FIELD - DAY \nThe crowd stands, waving banners, as the E.S.U. kicker comes forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky. The MISSISSIPPI STATE RETURN MAN fields the ball at the four yard line and returns it to the 22 where he's buried. The defense trots out and huddles up. \nALVIN All right, let's get evil. 60 minutes, balls out. Let's open a can of kick- ass. Kill 'em all. Let the paramedics sort 'em out. \nThe Mississippi State offense breaks it's huddle, comes to the line of scrimmage. Alvin, prowling behind the line, locks eyes with the tailback, No.23. \nALVIN Hey, 23, don't think I don't recognize you, you little fuck. \nThe tailback looks away. \nALVIN Hey, pay attention when I'm talkin' to you, nigger. You're the guy that shot my mother aren't you? \nTAILBACK What? \nALVIN You were tryin' to steal her fuckin' car weren't you, cocksucker. \nTAILBACK Shut up. I never heard of your mother. \nOn the sidelines, Darnell is watching this exchange. \nDARNELL (to Joe) What's Alvin saying to that guy? \nJOE Just gettin' himself pumped up. \nDARNELL He wasn't pumped up already? \nANGLE ON ALVIN AGAIN \nALVIN (to tailback) Thought I'd never find you didn't ya? But I got you now nigger, and I'm gonna kill you motherfucker. I'm gonna bust your guts open and watch you die. \nThe ball is snapped. The quarterback pitches to the tailback as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer. The ball flies loose, there's a scramble, Alvin comes up with it. E.S.U. ball. \nINT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT \nNear closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There are few other skaters at this hour. \nDARNELL Yes, I figure the key is to go places only white people go. Next time we'll go bowling. \nAutumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating it's closing time. \nDARNELL Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never believed a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad, but now I know. \nThey make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble over to a bench, begin to unlace. \nAUTUMN Thanks, that was fun, sort of. \nDARNELL You were pretty good for the first time. \nAUTUMN Well, it's not really my first time. My dad took me skating once. \nDARNELL He used to play ball for E.S.U., didn't he? \nAUTUMN Yeah, how'd you know that? \nDARNELL I saw his picture on the Wall of Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you didn't get his thighs. \nShe laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips. \nDARNELL Make sure you mean it this time. \nShe hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go out. \nINT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nCamille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes. Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his waist. Both are surprised to see the other. \nJOE What are you doin' here? \nCAMILLE Couldn't sleep. \nJOE I was just sweatin' out some of the beer. \nCamille just nods. Long, silent pause. \nJOE I didn't go home with her. I thought about it... but I didn't. \nCAMILLE You drink too much. \nJOE Yeh. \nHe turns, starts toward the door. \nCAMILLE Why didn't you? \nJOE Why didn't I what? \nCAMILLE Go home with her? \nJOE I don't know... I guess I figured maybe there was somethin' goin' on between you and me. \nCamille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then gets off the bike and walks toward him. \nCAMILLE Then why'd you pick her up in the first place? \nJOE I was drunk... I needed some company. \nCAMILLE (angry) Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a real far-ranging discussion with Sheri. \nJOE I mean, ya know, physical company... I was... I just needed to pounce on somebody I guess. \nCamille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around Joe's waist, leaving him naked. \nCAMILLE Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I good enough to pounce on? \nCamille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's totally thrown by this reaction in her. \nJOE Well, you're more conservative... classier... you're not that kinda girl... \nLOUANNE (crying) I don't know... I thought he... loved me... \nWINTERS Loved you? He loves anything that winks back, the little rat bastard. And what are you gonna do for school now? I use my influence to get you back in, it'll stink to high hell. The press'll crucify me. \nLOUANNE I'll get in someplace. \nWINTERS God, Louanne, I told you to stay away from my players. That was my cardinal rule, stay away from the damn players... \nLOUANNE They've always been good enough for you. Good enough to devote your life to. Why aren't they good enough for me? Or are they too good? \nWINTERS You're changing the subject, Louanne. We're talkin' about you breakin' the rules. \nLOUANNE Didn't you ever break the rules just a little? Didn't you tell me once that 90 per cent of the schools obey the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per cent go to bowl games? Was that just a joke? \nShe gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his eyes and slumps down on the couch. \nINT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT \nDarnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected test down in front of him. \nAUTUMN You seen this? You got a D on your math test. \nDARNELL Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had some trouble on this last part... \nAUTUMN We went over that last week, Darnell. What is this time we spend in here? Just a joke to you? I don't even think you've been listening to me. \nDARNELL I've been listening to you, baby... \nAUTUMN Don't call me baby. I thought you wanted to learn. But if all you wanta do is fake your way through, then get another tutor to waste time with. \nDARNELL C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good time, and now you're gettin' all nuts behind this. It's just one test. \nAUTUMN So far, it's the only test. I want you to study this whole chapter. By yourself, without me here. When I come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready to do problems based on it. \nDARNELL Whatever you say, Teach. (big grin) I don't wish to be cast in a pejorative light, so I'm dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities. \nShe shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's embarrassed and deeply worried. \nINT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nThe players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter. \nBUD LITE Coach'd probably shoot ya lower. \nSuddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is Coach Winters. \nHe says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at Bobby a beat, then. \nWINTERS You all played a fine game on Saturday. Take the day off. \nWith that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash. \nINT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY \nWinters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek. Hits the floor. \nEXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY \nA very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks on Coach Winter's door. \nWINTERS C'mon in, Collins. \nINT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE \nBobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters doesn't invite him to sit. \nBOBBY Listen, Coach, I just want you to know I'm really sorry about this whole thing with Louanne. I was real glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to junior college here... \nWINTERS (cutting him off) Shut up. \nBobby does. Instantly. \nWINTERS I could easily take your case to the Board of Regents. You've had no prior infractions and I could argue that you were under abnormal pressure. (pause) But I won't. You embarrassed me, you embarrassed my family, you embarrassed the program. As of now, you are no longer a member of this university or it's football team. Clean out your locker. \nBobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally, dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out. \nCAMILLE But you're one of the best players in the country. \nJOE (snapping) He's just not into it, o.k.? \nCAMILLE (chastised) O.k. (silence) What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out here, like you wanta talk about somethin', then you don't say anything. You worried about tomorrow? \nJOE No... I'm worried about the days after that. I just. I don't know... I feel like tomorrow's gonna be my last game. I want to stay up, make the time go slow. \nCAMILLE Why would it be your last game? You afraid of getting hurt? \nJOE No, that'd be a relief. Then, at least, I wouldn't be a failure. \nCAMILLE Joe, why are you thinking like this? Why would you be a failure? You're having a great year, you're a Heisman Trophy candidate, you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the pros. \nJOE (testy) How do you know what's waiting for me? You don't know me at all. \nCAMILLE (hurt) I don't know you? How can you say that? \nJOE Because you wouldn't be here now if you did. You only know the guy that's supposed to make millions in the pros. \nCAMILLE Is that what you think? That I'm with you for the money? \nJOE Why else? \nInfuriated, she slaps him across the face. \nCAMILLE Fuck you, Joe. (starting to cry) I don't give a shit about your money. I don't even give a shit about football. And you know what? Maybe you're right, maybe I don't know you. \nShe turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward the tracks as the train comes into view. \nCamille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry. \nJoe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him. \nCAMILLE Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you doing? No! No! \nAs the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties. Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming. \nUnder the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his clothes flapping wildly. \nThe train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps him over to the embankment. \nCAMILLE God Joe, oh god, are you allright? \nJOE (drained) Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth. Guess you've really seen the dark side now, huh? You should've gotten out while you had the chance. Before it all goes to hell. \nCAMILLE I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's wrong Joe? Why would it all go to hell? \nJOE I'm a Kane, Camille. That's all it takes. We're cut out to be drunks and fuck-ups. We never live up to expectations. It's in our blood. My dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up. My dad went the longest. Waited till he was playin' triple A ball, before he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting for my turn. The better I do, the closer it gets. \nCAMILLE You're not like them, you can beat all that. You can stop drinking, you can break the chain. \nJOE If I gave up that, I wouldn't be much of a football player. And if I wasn't a football player, what would I be? \nThe question hangs in the air. \nCAMILLE You'de still be Joe. And I'd still love you. \nHe pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against each other. \nJOE Just don't say I never warned you. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY \nSTEVE ZABRISKIE and BO SCHEMBECKLER in the foreground, the jammed to capacity stadium in the background. This shot is going out on nationwide T.V., the college Game of the Week. \nZABRISKIE 4:29 to go and it's been a great one. Two undefeated teams goin' after each other. Michigan up by four, 24- 20, but the lead has changed hands three times, and you get the feeling that whoever has the ball last is gonna win it. \nANGLE ON FIELD \nJoe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage. Yells signals. \nSCHEMBECKLER (V.O.) Well, it was billed as a Heisman shootout, and it's been all of that. Both Waymen and Kane moving their teams up and down the field, having big days. \nJoe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle, 15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see \nJOE O.K., time to put the women and children to bed, and go looking for dinner. \nHe begins to howl, as do all the others. The Call of the Wild. \nJOE 82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2. \nThey clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense, bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped. Action goes to SLOW MOTION. \nJoe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it, but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front and intercepts it. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) Kane looking for Jefferson. It's... Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman! And that should do it. \nJoe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like he's been punched. \nAs Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go to: \nINT. BROADCAST BOOTH - AFTERNOON \nSteve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium behind him. \nZABRISKIE Well, it was everything we expected it to be. Fine performances on both sides of the field. \nINT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON \nPlayers undress and shower in relative silence. No joy here. \nZABRISKIE (V.O.) The edge in the much ballyhooed battle of the quarterbacks would probably have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran for another. Joe Kane accounted for three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had that crucial interception in the waning moments. And that proved to be the difference. \nThe door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead against the wall, the water coursing over him. \nEXT. TUNNEL BENEATH STADIUM - LATE AFTERNOON \nDarnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and dressed. He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking to Coach Humes. \nDARNELL Hey, Autumn. \nAUTUMN Hi, Darnell. \nDARNELL Is this your dad? \nAUTUMN Yes... \nDARNELL How do you do, Mr. Haley. I'm Darnell Jefferson. \nMR. HALEY Jefferson? Nice run you made on that screen pass. Another block and you might have scored. \nDARNELL Thank you. We'll get 'em next year. \nMR. HALEY How do you and Autumn know each other? You a friend of Ray's? \nDarnell is jolted by this question. It's obvious that Autumn has never told her dad about him. \nAUTUMN (filling the void) Ah, I tutor him... \nMR. HALEY Oh really? In what? \nDarnell would like to crawl under a rock. \nDARNELL Math and English. \nMR. HALEY Ah. \nThere's a slight tone of condescension in Mr. Haley's voice. He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam. This is not lost on Darnell. \nMR. HALEY Well, stay on top of that, Darnell. I'd have been in real trouble if I hadn't gotten my degree. I played ball once. Hurt my knee. \nDARNELL Yeh, I know... \nMR. HALEY I used to put a copy of my report card inside the webbing of my helmet to remind me that college was more important than football. \nDARNELL (forcing enthusiasm) Good idea. Well, I gotta get goin'. Nice to meet you Mr. Haley. \nMR. HALEY Nice to meet you, Darnell. \nDARNELL See you around, Autumn. \nCLAYTON So what do we do? \nAll eyes go to Winters. \nWINTERS Bring him down here. \nINT. COACH WINTERS LOCKER ROOM OFFICE - 20 MINUTES LATER \nClose on a contrite, but shaken Steve Lattimer. \nLATTIMER Three games? Why so many? \nWINTERS You oughta be grateful I didn't suspend you for the whole year. \nLattimer nods, he knows it's true. \nLATTIMER What are you gonna give as the reason? \nWINTERS We'll say you've got a hamstring pull. \nLATTIMER (relieved) Thank you, Coach. \nWINTERS Don't thank me. During those three weeks, you better kick the roids, cause when you come back I'm gonna personally test you before every game. No N.C.A.A. shit either. I'm gonna watch the piss go into the bottle. You got that? \nLATTIMER (barely audible, shamed) Yes, sir. \nWINTERS Start practicing your limp. \nINT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT \nNot the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back, with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS. \nJOE Coupla real college heroes, huh? Tearin' up the town. \nDARNELL First time I ever lost a girl and a game on the same day. Guess I never really had the girl. \nJoe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving him the once over and a little smile. Joe smiles back, not really interested. Debbie's BOYFRIEND notices. \nBOYFRIEND You know that guy? \nDEBBI Not really... \nBOYFRIEND Then why you smilin' at him? \nDEBBI I don't know... he looks like that E.S.U. quarterback guy. Joe, what's his name? \nBOYFRIEND So what? So you go and smile at him? \nThe boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to Joe's table. \nBOYFRIEND You been lookin' at my girlfriend? \nJOE (a little drunk himself) I don't know. Which one is she? \nBOYFRIEND Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime quarterback. The one who choked his ass off today. You got nothin' better to do then look at my girlfriend? \nJoe says nothing. \nBOYFRIEND Hey, Heisman, I'm talkin' to you. You too good to talk to me? \nJOE I'm not even interested in talkin' to you. \nBOYFRIEND You think you're a bad ass? You think my girl's hot for you? Take your pads off, you're just another pussy. \nJoe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in his shoulder. \nDARNELL (grabbing him) C'mon we gotta get outa here. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nA speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line on the curves. \nINT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT \nJoe's driving, Darnell's holding on. Suddenly we hear SIRENS. Joe sees flashing lights in the rear-view mirror. \nJoe is shown into his room. Bare. One cot. One dresser. He drops his bag, sags onto the bed. \nALVIN (V.O.) Four fuckin' weeks? \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nA tired and depressed group of E.S.U. football players undress after practice. Bud and Alvin sit in their pads, Lattimer standing in street clothes. Bud softly sings \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina.\" \nALVIN Shit, the defense is gonna have to pitch shutouts now... (to Lattimer) and you're gone for 3. What the hell did you take that shit for? \nLATTIMER Nobody seemed to mind when I was knockin' people's dicks in the dirt. \nALVIN I bust chops too. I don't have to get all fucked up. \nLATTIMER Not everybody has the ability you do, Alvin. You do what you have to do to play. \nALVIN Well, you're not playin' much now are you? Shit, whole fuckin' season down the drain. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY \nWinters and Galen Howard are walking across the field after practice. The stadium is deserted. \nHOWARD I been talkin' to Chancellor Wilson... \nWINTERS What's he wanta do now, cut practice down to once a week? \nHOWARD No, he's happy with the way the season's gone so far. The Alumni have pretty much stayed off his back, but with Joe out now, it could all be up for grabs again. \nWINTERS He thinks he's gonna have trouble marchin' the ball down the old fund- raisin' board, huh? \nHOWARD The facts are, all we have left are freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' I saw at practice today, convinced me that any of them are ready to step in. \nWINTERS What are you sayin? \nHOWARD We gotta get Bobby Collins back. \nWINTERS Wilson say that? \nHOWARD He didn't have to. \nWINTERS Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All- Star either. \nHOWARD Yeh, but he's good enough to get us a split of the next four games. \nWINTERS Look, just because you're Wilson's boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean I'm gonna let him make me look like a fuckin' whore. \nHOWARD Don't give me that high and mighty shit. There's a lotta people on the bubble here. Four straight loses and we're out of bowl contention. How's that gonna make you look? If you're too stupid to consider your own situation, then maybe you oughta think about your assistant coaches. They've got families to feed too. \nHoward walks away, pissed off, leaving Winters alone in the middle of the field. \nINT. BOARD OF REGENTS HEARING ROOM - DAY \nThe seven members of the BOARD OF REGENTS sit on one side of a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle. On the other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President of the Faculty Senate, EDWARD LEARNIHAN, Academic Advisor, ARTHUR SHANE, President of the Student Body, RICHARD FOWLER, and Galen Howard. Fowler is addressing the board. \nFOWLER Therefore, I respectfully submit that Bobby Collins should not be given special treatment just because he's a football player. Would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if they'de been caught cheating? Nobody's talking about letting the girl who took the test back in. \nWinters could kill this kid. \nLEARNIHAN I think it's also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken. Beginning Golf, Voice and Speech Improvement... \nSHANE I'd like to point out that Mr. Collins was still on schedule to get his degree. \nLEARNIHAN (pointing to Collin's transcript) In what, Swimming Pool Management? \nCHAIRMAN Would you like to respond, Coach Winters? \nWinters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the odious nature of what he has to do. \nWINTERS I don't know much about all this other stuff, but I do know the punishment should fit the crime. Cheating's bad, but I don't think it deserves a life sentence. Here's one of those athletes who takes college level courses, who wants to graduate. I think Bobby Collins made a big mistake, but he's already been suspended for several weeks. He's served his time. I think he deserves a second chance. \nLEARNIHAN Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second chance and since he's had 5 incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still reads at a fourth grade level. You're using his body to make money for the Athletic Department -- you, yourself, are making three times what the Chancellor is -- but obviously no one is making an effort to see that this kid gets an education. \nWINTERS He's helpin' to pay for your physics lab too. If you're willin' to go without a new office, maybe I could hold him out a few games. Save his body. \nCHAIRMAN Gentlemen... \nBUD You two seein' each other again? \nLOUANNE Yeh, he was even talking about us gettin' a place off campus together, until he got reinstated. I don't know how I woulda told my dad. \nBud just nods blankly. Louanne starts to head for Bobby's room. \nBUD Ah, Louanne... (pained to say it) I wouldn't go in there right now. \nLOUANNE Why not? \nBud doesn't have the heart to tell her. She finally realizes Bobby's with another girl. \nLOUANNE Ah. Guess I'm pretty stupid when it comes to men. I never learn, do I? \nBUD I think maybe men are just stupid when it comes to you. If you ever feel like, ya know, just talkin' sometime, gettin' a beer -- let me know. My schedule's pretty open. \nLOUANNE Thanks, Bud (handing him the clothes) Give him these, will ya? \nBud nods. Louanne, fighting back tears, walks back down the hall with as much dignity as she can muster. \nINT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER - DAY \nWinters comes to the door, hesitates, walks in and finds Joe huddled on his bed. Shivering. \nWINTERS Get up. I wanta talk to you. \nJoe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up. \nWINTERS Don't sit up. Stand up. If you can. \nJoe gets unsteadily to his feet. He feels sick. Winters reaches out to shake hands. Joe does not reciprocate. Hides his right hand behind his body. \nWINTERS What's the matter, Joe? You won't shake hands with me. (Joe is silent) You don't want me to see your hand, do you? (more silence) So I guess what I heard was true, huh? You been poundin' the walls with your passin' hand, right? (silence) I tell you what, Joe, you want to hit somethin', hit me. \nJoe doesn't move. \nWINTERS I said hit me. I'm the one who put you in here. Don't hit the damn wall. It ain't the wall's fault. Hit me! Go on, hit me right now! \nJoe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it. \nWINTERS Who else you wanta hit, huh? you're daddy maybe? Cause he's a no-show prick? Well, I'm a daddy, too, and not a very good one at that. So just hit me instead! I'll take your daddy's beatin' for him. Go on, you want to. Hit me, damnit! \nJoe shakes his head. \nWINTERS (pushes Joe in the chest) Hit me! I'm not gonna leave you alone until you hit me. (shakes Joe by shoulders) The guys'll thank you. They've always wanted to do it. So do it now, damnit! Do it! \nJoe sinks to his knees. Winters stares down at him, then kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away. \nWINTERS O.K., Joe, it's o.k. I guess I need it more than you do. (pause) You gotta quit beatin' up on yourself. Let me see that hand. \nJoe reveals his hand. It's barked and cut, but not badly swollen. \nWINTERS It's o.k. (playfully) You can still throw with it, you fuckin' mook. (pause) Look, the nurses say this is the toughest time for you right now. I thought I'd stick around a little, case you wanta play some cards, pick a fight with the wall again, whatever... \nJOE You don't have to. \nWINTERS Yes I do. \nINT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia. He carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into his toilet. Syringes, vials and bottles of pills all tumble into the water. He flushes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - MORNING \nThe sun shines through the window. Joe wakes up, raises up, looks over at Winters who is asleep in a chair. Winters rouses. Joe gives him a little smile, he's allright. Winters gives him a nod of approval. \nMUSIC UP. BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS \ndetailing the Timberwolves progress over the next four games. \nON FIELD \n1) Players shaking hands at midfield after the game. The scoreboard reads E.S.U. 14 Boston College 10. \nEXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT \nAn ambulance carrying Alvin emerges from the stadium. We hear CHEERING inside, the SIREN outside. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving for the winning touchdown. Fourth and goal at the one. E.S.U. trying to hold on without their star middle linebacker, Alvin Mack. \nEXT. THE FIELD AGAIN - NIGHT \nThe E.S.U. defensive line digs in. Lattimer tries to suck up his remaining strength. \nIowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side. He fights through one block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. They meet in a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving, twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line. Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10. \nAs the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man. \nREPORTER (V.O.) Coach, you've lost two of your last four. \nINT. INTERVIEW ROOM UNDER STADIUM - NIGHT \nCoach Winters faces the press. \nREPORTER Why do your teams seem to nose dive at the end of the last couple seasons? \nCOACH WINTERS This was a tough loss, but this ain't any nose dive. We've had some key players out, but if we win next week, we'll still win the conference and go to a major bowl on New Year's Day. I mean, I know you guys can't write, but I thought you could at least count. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING \nAlvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated. He's still a little groggy from anesthetic. Coach Winters stands beside him. \nWINTERS You look good, Alvin. \nALVIN Yeh, I feel o.k. \nWINTERS Any of the guys been down yet? \nALVIN They called. \nWINTERS Hell, you know how football players are about hospitals and injuries. \nALVIN Yeh. \nSeveral beats of silence. Then: \nALVIN I'm never gonna play again, am I? \nWINTERS Doctors aren't always right, Alvin... but I just want you to know... you're the best defensive football player I ever coached. \nAlvin nods. Winters comes forward, hugs him around the head, gives him a smile, walks out. Tears brim in Winters eyes as he leaves. Alvin's head goes back against the pillow. Tears aren't brimming here. They're rolling down his cheeks. \nMUSIC BEGINS \nEXT. REHAB CENTER - MORNING \nJoe walks out with his suitcase. Coach Winters waits for him. Shakes his hand. They get in the car. \nWINTERS (V.O.) Congratulations. I'm proud of you, Joe. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nWINTERS I know you had a difficult time. Michigan is easy, right? Bourbon is tough. \nJOE Scotch. \nThey share a laugh. Winters pulls out two sets of round trip airline tickets. \nWINTERS I got somethin' for ya. Coupla round trip tickets. Go see your dad. Get it cleaned up. \nJoe takes the tickets, just looks at him. \nINT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLATTIMER (on the phone) I'm gonna have to take a test with the coach right there. You sure you got somethin' better than blockers? \nDEALER (V.O.) Much better. This guy is foolproof. See ya Saturday. \nLattimer hangs up, picks up a HYPODERMIC. Stares at it a second, sweat beading on his forehead. Then plunges it an inch deep into his thigh. Pulls it out, sits on the bed a beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously, biceps bulging. \nJOE'S DAD (sensing the anger) What do you mean? \nJOE Mighta made you feel bad. Like maybe it wasn't written someplace that we all gotta go on our ass. Like maybe you coulda done somethin' more, if you'de tried a little harder. \nJOE'S DAD Or maybe I didn't wanta see you gettin' all excited, all pumped up with pride, when I knew one day it would all come crashin' down. Just like it did. \nJOE I think I spent the last couple years hopin' I'd die before that day. But you know what Dad? That day came and I'm still here. And I got one more game this year. I don't know how well I'll play or even how much, but I want you there. \nJOE'S DAD How would you feel introducing your drunk dad to all your friends? You think about that? \nJOE I could live with it, if you could. (handing him a ticket) Here's a ticket. Section 2, Row 6. Fifty yard line. If you don't come, I'll never ask you again. \nJOE'S DAD O.K., Joey. And good luck. \nThey give each other a short, quick hug. Nothing sentimental. Joe walks back through the house. His dad stares out at the yard. \nINT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - NIGHT \nDarnell is up late again, studying at one of the tables. He hears footsteps, becomes aware of the presence of another person. He looks up to see Autumn. \nDARNELL Hey, Autumn. How's Ray? \nAUTUMN Don't know. Haven't seen him since the night I saw you. He'd been goin' out. \nDARNELL Monica Lambert. \nAUTUMN You knew? Why didn't you tell me? \nDARNELL Didn't wanta win you over that way. \nSilence. Darnell looks back at his books. \nAUTUMN I just wondered how your studying was comin'. You ready for tomorrow? \nDARNELL The test? I hope so. I been workin' pretty hard. \nAUTUMN Good... (sitting down) I talked to my dad last night. \nDARNELL Oh, yeah? How's he doin? \nAUTUMN Fine. We talked about you. \nDARNELL What did you say? \nAUTUMN (eyes brimming) I told him I'd gone out with you... I told him I wished I could still go bowling. \nDarnell gets up and pulls her to her feet. He hugs her. \nMUSIC BEGINS \nINT. EXAMINATION ROOM - AFTERNOON \nDarnell is bent over his test booklet. He writes furiously, stops to think, starts writing again. \nEXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY \nJoe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball flutters badly, falling short. \nCLAYTON He's rusty. I doubt if we can start him. \nWINTERS (simmering) He's worse than that. He's outa shape. (blowing his whistle) All right, that's enough for today. Practice is cancelled. Everybody off the field, but Kane. (the players hesitate) C'mon what the hell are you standin' around lookin' at? Get outa here. \nThe players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file off. Even the coaches are baffled. Winters walks over to Joe, who has no idea what this is about. \nWINTERS Didn't do much while you were in there, did ya? \nJOE Well, we didn't exactly have a team... \nWINTERS You could've worked out on your own. \nJOE I had some other things to worry about... \nWINTERS Well, we're gonna make up for lost time. We'll start by hoppin' the steps. \nJOE Hoppin' the steps?! What, you're gonna punish me now. \nHe catches the snap, boots the ball away. \nDarnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line. \nON STANDS \nThe E.S.U. fans are on their feet. Winters races over to Joe. \nWINTERS Time for 2 plays. If it's not open in the end zone, take the sideline. As the offense runs onto the field, Winters checks the scoreboard. 17 seconds left. Georgia Tech 10. E.S.U. \nINT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nJoe brings the Wolves up. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35. 17 seconds left. Kane barking signals. \nJoe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he fires a bullet down the sideline. Ray Griffen catches it and goes out of bounds at the twelve. \nANGLE ON SIDELINE \nJoe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more time outs, as the refs move the chains. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Field goal here ties it, but a tie may not get the Wolves into a bowl. Tough decision for Winters. \nWINTERS (to Joe) You want me to send in the kicking team or you think you can handle it? \nJOE Give me the ball. \nWINTERS O.K., let's do 24 inside slot, left blue lightning. \nON FIELD \nJoe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as the crowd's roar goes off the charts. \nJOE (in huddle) O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue lightning. Let's put the women and children to bed, and go lookin' for fuckin' dinner. On 2. \nHe starts the wolf howl. The others join in, howling for all they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break the huddle. \nThe crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at the seat he left for his father. It's still empty. \nJOE This one's for you, Dad. \nJoe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings \"Bali Hi.\" We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. \nThe Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe. \nDarnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that Darnell is heading for. \nThe ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance. \nANGLE ON STANDS \nPandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob Darnell. \nINT. ALVIN'S SHACK - DAY \nAlvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be a part of again. We leave him staring off into an uncertain future. \nINT. CHANCELLOR'S SKY-BOX - DAY \nThe Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory, congratulating each other. Conspicuous among them are the Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman of the Board of Regents. \nCHAIRMAN Looks like the Timberwolves are back. Probably brought the library with them. \nCHANCELLOR Hope so. (turning to Galen Howard) Give my sincere congratulations to Coach Winters. \nHOWARD He'll be delighted. \nThe Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund football field and starts advancing the ball. \nFAT CAT ALUMNUS 15,10, touchdown! \nThis brings applause all around. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \n", "test1_input": "Joe roars in on his motorcycle. Parks. Starts inside. Finds himself face to face with a very unhappy Coach Winters. Winters holds out his hand. \nWINTERS The keys. \nJoe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his motorcycle keys. \nWINTERS I told you, as long as you're in this program, you don't take unnecessary risks off the field. A man in contention for the Heisman Trophy should be able to remember that. \nJoe nods, contrite. Winters just walks on off. \nINT. STUDY HALL - CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY \nAutumn is tutoring Darnell, checking her lesson notes. \nAUTUMN O.K., using the things we worked on yesterday, I want you to write a two or three page essay on some aspect of your life. Something other than football. \nDARNELL Like what? \nAUTUMN Your father, maybe. You could write about your dad. \nDARNELL Don't know that much about him. He was off in Detroit workin' in a car plant when I was born. Got laid off, tried to rob a jewelry store to get us some money. He died in prison. Some kinda heart problem. \nAutumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. She tries to press on gamely. \nAUTUMN How about your mother? \nDARNELL She was always workin'. Usually two jobs. Comin' home one night she stopped to get us some root beer. Got caught in a gang crossfire. Shot three times... died on the way to the hospital. You want me to write about that? \nAUTUMN (blown away) No... \nDARNELL Good, 'cause none of it's true. \nAutumn jumps up. \nAUTUMN (raising her voice) Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible thing to do to somebody. That's not funny. That's sick. \nAutumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down. \nDARNELL Had ya goin', didn't I? \nAUTUMN (soft library voice) No you didn't. You just... How could you make up somethin' like that? \nDARNELL (contrite now) Sounded more interesting than the truth. My mom took a vacation to Chicago when I was 12. Never came back. Don't know who my dad was. \nAutumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth. \nAUTUMN Who took care of you? \nDARNELL I started hangin' with the J.B.M., gang-bangin'... Did some time in the Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin' football on a juvenile probation team. Took me in, got me into high school. Only reason they accepted me was 'cause I could play football. Sorta like here. Football saved my life. I'd be nowhere without football. \nAutumn just nods, still trying to take this all in. \nAUTUMN Well, then... maybe you could write about football this once. \nDARNELL Yeh, o.k... thanks. (pause) I've seen a lotta shitty things in my life, Autumn. That's why I know when I see somethin' good. \nAutumn knows this is no line. He means it. She's seeing him with new eyes. Moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity, and more than a little taken by his regard for her. \nON ALVIN \nacross the room with his tutor. \nTUTOR Let's review the chapter I read you yesterday. Which two city states fought in the Punic Wars? \nALVIN I dunno. Detroit and Buffalo. \nTUTOR C'mon, Alvin. You're gonna be tested on this. \nINT. FOOTBALL MEETING - AFTERNOON \nA video projector projects various football formations on the wall. \nWINTERS Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi State's offensive set. 2nd and 2 on our 24. What defense are you in? \nALVIN Eagle. Zipper. Hero. Unless the set back shifts into the I. \n", "test1_true": "ALVIN Okie. Thunder. Lion. \nWINTERS What's your assignment? \nALVIN Kill the Quarterback. (slide changes) Hit the tight end so hard his girlfriend dies. (slide changes) Kill everybody. \nMUSIC UP - MONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS \nEXT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING \nJoe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in and unveil a life-size CARDBOARD STAND-UP of Joe's Sports Illustrated cover pose. They whoop it up, as Joe tries to muster some enthusiasm. \nINT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT \nAutumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math book. As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her. Autumn quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw Darnell's attempt. Darnell laughs. \nINT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY \nA group of football players sits in the back of the class. As the HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures at the board, Darnell furiously takes notes. Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity, leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football out of Darnell's left hand. Darnell, Scott and two other FRESHMAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS spring out of their seats, scrambling after the loose ball. The prof and the other students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball. Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it. He and the others quickly return to their seats. The prof looks at Darnell aghast. \nDARNELL Sorry... I lost my football. \nINT. RAQUETBALL COURT - DAY \nJoe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball. Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a fist in triumph. Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket and stomps around. \nEXT. CAMPUS - DAY \nDarnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on a secluded patch of lawn. Darnell holds his football. As he begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the ball out of his hand. They both scramble for it, Darnell winding up slightly on top of her. They eye each other a beat. Darnell bends down to kiss her. She lets herself kiss him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her books. \nINT. ATHLETIC CENTER - DAY \nSeveral of the players are gathered around a bulletin board in the hall. The starting lineup for the first game has been posted. Darnell traces his finger from the designation TAILBACK over to the name RAY GRIFFEN. He drops his eyes, obviously disappointed. \nLattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board. He finds his name posted as a starting defensive end. Punching the air, he dashes out of the building. \nLATTIMER Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the table. Whooo!! Yes!! \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nLattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins head-butting car windows. He breaks out three in a row, and yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood. \nWinters, walking with the TEAM TRAINER, has seen this from across the street. He knows there's something dark at work here. \nWINTERS N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team before the game Saturday. Make sure Lattimer knows about it. \nMUSIC AND MONTAGE END \nINT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles. Coach Winters addresses the assembly. \nWINTERS As the veteran players know, we have Pride Night every year before our opening game. It's a chance to get to know each other better, share some thoughts, and bring us closer together as a team. So to start off, I'd like each player to tell the others in his group what he likes best about football and then what he's most proud of off the field. I've asked some of the seniors to lead it off. Gentlemen. \nANGLE ON LATTIMER IN HIS CIRCLE \nLATTIMER I don't know... It's the battle. The goin' to war with the other guys. Hangin' together. \nINT. CAMPUS BALLROOM - GAME DAY \nThe team walks through several plays. They wear coats and ties, but no socks. Their ankles are taped. \nLATTIMER (V.O.) Bein' different from everybody else. Havin' our own dorm, stayin' in hotels the night before games. Settin' ourselves apart. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY \nBefore the game. An NCAA OFFICIAL gives Lattimer a little test tube to urinate in for his drug test. Lattimer goes into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back of the tank, where a VIAL OF CLEAN URINE is taped. He pours it in the test vial. \nLATTIMER (V.O.) Havin' a chance to be somebody. To do somethin' that people look up to you for. Your strength and your courage. Not everybody can play football. We're the lucky ones. \nINT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN \nDARNELL The thing I'm most proud of myself for? \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY \n", "test2_input": "As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised, he goes over to Alvin. \nDARNELL Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar bill. \nALVIN Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred once you're startin', depending on how you play. \nDARNELL But we're not supposed to get any are we? \nALVIN Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a month scholarship money. And the NC double assholes won't let us have jobs, so you take your money where you can get it. (taking Darnell's envelope) I'll keep it for you, till you see the light. Shit, they oughta be payin' us anyway. Athletic Department gets 3 million just for goin' to a bowl game. \nINT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING \nJoe sits alone on his bed watching T.V. He's being interviewed in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face. \nREPORTER (V.O.) This performance today -- two touchdown passes, another you ran in. Where do you think this puts you in the Heisman race? \nJoe hates this question. We go to the screen. \nJOE (uncomfortable) I really have no idea. That's up to you guys. \nANGLE ON SCREEN \nThe image changes to ESPN anchor CHRIS BERMAN in the studio. \nBERMAN Now let's turn to our Heisman watch. (does the pose while remaining seated) We begin with Sports Illustrated cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led his team to an impressive victory this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues to raise Kane, he may well be Able to dust off a large space on his trophy shelf. Although the real test will come in four weeks against Michigan and their Heisman hopeful, Tim Waymen. \nEXT. CAMPUS - EVENING \nJoe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm. \nBERMAN (V.O.) Michigan also won big today. Timothy, \"He Could Go All The Way Men\", will be looking to do so against the Timberwolves. And of course the able Kane will be looking to also. I can't wait. \nINT. CAMILLE'S DORM - NIGHT \nJoe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door. No answer. Knocks again. Nothing. Disappointed, he turns and walks away. \nINT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe post-game victory party is in full swing. All the players, their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking, celebrating. Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching the action. \nBUD LITE I don't know, I never seem to make out at things like this. \nBobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne. \nBOBBY You don't make out anywhere. Or did you finally break the snatch barrier this summer? \nBUD LITE Fuck you, Bobby. (realizing Louanne's there) Excuse me, Louanne. \nANGLE ON DARNELL \nsitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor. Alvin notices. \nALVIN Forget it, nigger. No chance for you there. \nDARNELL Why not? \nALVIN Griffin's goin' to medical school. She likes that light-skinned respectable shit. You're just her ghetto toy. \nDarnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays. \nDARNELL (to Autumn) Can I have this one? \nRAY I don't think so. \nDARNELL What are you so worried about? You haven't lost your starting job yet. \nAutumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand. \nAUTUMN (turning to Ray) Just one. \nRay reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance. Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them as they move around the floor. They try to pretend they're just having a nice little chat. \nAUTUMN (whispering) Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a good time to push things. You're putting me in an awkward position. \nDARNELL Yeh, well, I got a little encouragement along the way. \n", "test2_true": "DARNELL Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn't be standing here now, everybody thinkin' I'm a stupid asshole, if I didn't know you meant it. I wanna see you, Autumn. Not in study hall. Not like your student. Like somebody to be taken seriously. \nAUTUMN I do take you seriously, Darnell, but I'm still with Ray. I can't just go paradin' around town. \nDARNELL I don't need to go paradin'. We'll go someplace different. Someplace nobody'll see us. \nShe looks at him a long beat. She doesn't need this complication, this conflict, but she can't say no. \nAUTUMN God, why am I even considering this? \nThe song ends. Ray moves in to reclaim her. \nRAY (to Darnell) All caught up on your arithmetic? \nDarnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove. \nDARNELL Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12 carries. \nRay lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by Joe and Bud Lite, step between them. Darnell shrugs them off and leaves the party. \nJOE (to Bud Lite) Just what we need, a little team unity. \nRay takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio. \nRAY I'm gettin' a little sick of this asshole, Autumn. I don't like you hangin' out with him. It's embarrassing. \nAUTUMN I don't hang out with him. I tutor him. \nRAY Then have him get another tutor. \nAUTUMN I can't do that. I made a commitment to help him pass his qualifying exam. I can't bail out on him now. \nRAY What the hell difference does it makes? They'll grease him through no matter what he does. Nobody's ever gonna see his graduation. Don't tell me you're falling for this guy. He's just another gang-banger with speed. \nAUTUMN I just said I wanted to help him. What are you more afraid of, losing your girl or your position? \nRAY Maybe you oughta think about what you're in danger of losing. \nAUTUMN Maybe I will. \nAutumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party too. \nEXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT \nDarnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him. \nVOICE (V.O.) So where you wanna go? \nHe turns. It's Autumn. \nINT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in thought. \nJOE Maybe she's out with some guy. \nBUD Who? Camille? I don't think she's the type to screw around on ya. Shoot ya, maybe... \nJOE It wouldn't be screwing around. It's not like we're going together. \nJoe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He stares back at her. She doesn't blink. \nEXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT \nCamille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm, she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped around Joe, nuzzling him. \nJoe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get it out. \nON DARNELL AND AUTUMN \nWe don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and sliding, clutching on to each other. \nAUTUMN You're right, nobody would ever see us here. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \n", "test3_input": "REGULAR SPEED \nThe crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block. \nINT. ALVIN MACK'S SHACK - DAY \nAlvin sits alone in the \"living room\", listening to the E.S.U. game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate. His mother mends a pair of jeans in the b.g. \nHARVEY (V.O.) So the Wolves defense has held after the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets will opt for the field goal. Around a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away, it's long enough. And good! Georgia Tech jumps out on top 3-0. \nAlvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from Alvin. There's none. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nBobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick sideline, but it's a little short. The Yellow Jackets' CORNERBACK sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Collins back to pass, rushed, now fires out in the flat. It's picked off by Hill. Down the sideline. He's gonna go in untouched. Touchdown, Georgia Tech. \nINT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA discouraged bunch of E.S.U. players drag into the locker room. Some swear, some bang their lockers. \nLATTIMER C'mon guys, we're only down ten. Let's get our fuckin' shit together. \nDarnell marches over to Ray's locker. \nDARNELL You missed that block on purpose, didn't you, asshole. \nRAY You're full of shit. You fumble, you try to blame me. \nDARNELL It's Autumn isn't it? That's what this is all about. \nRAY The hell with Autumn. You just can't take a hit. \nInfuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging. Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging, trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several players manage to pull them apart. Coach Winters charges over. \nWINTERS Don't tell me who started it. I don't care. All I care about is this football team. We win together. We lose together. So whatever your problem is, get over it. I don't want any more of this shit. Understand? \nDARNELL AND RAY Yes, sir. \nWINTERS As for the rest of you guys. Here's what I think of the way you played. \nWinters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this. \nWINTERS (pointing toward the Yellow Jackets' locker room) They're laughin' at you over there. Makin' plans for the evening. They never dreamed it'd be this easy. You guys are nothin' but bugs splattered on their windshield. You better stock up on potato chips, 'cause you're gonna be watching a lotta T.V. on New Years Day. \nWinters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate their mistakes. Winters goes over to Joe. \nWINTERS Get warm, Joe. You're startin' the second half. \nJoe nods, excited but uncertain. Winters moves on to Ray Griffen. \nWINTERS By the way... don't let me see you miss anymore blocks. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nThe E.S.U. players return to their bench for the start of the second half, gather in a circle. Joe looks up in the stands to the seat he reserved for his father. It's empty. \nBEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS: \n1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it. \n2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is sacked. \n3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nClayton approaches Winters on the sideline. \nCLAYTON Joe's too tentative, too cautious out there. He seems flat. Maybe we oughta give Collins another shot. \nWINTERS Joe just needs to get the feel back. He'll be allright. \nCLAYTON Sam, we can't afford to wait... \n", "test3_true": "ANGLE ON JOE \nHARVEY (V.O.) 5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to nothing. The Wolves are gonna have to find some offense in a hurry here. Their defense has been keepin' them in it. \nAs he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes up to him. \nWINTERS Joe, I know that Rehab was good for you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits. But what about the rest of you? What happened to the Joe Kane that used to take command of this team, the Joe Kane these guys i'd run through a bulldozer for? They put him out with the trash? What are you waitin' for, somebody to feel sorry for you cause you've had some problems? Nobody in this stadium gives a shit. It's time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at the head of the Table. \nANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE \nAs Joe comes into the huddle. He's all business now. \nJOE All right, we've held these guys up long enough. Give me time back here, and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift, green, bolt. First sound. \nJoe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells \"Go!\" The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe: \n1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle. \n2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket, scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt. \nHARVEY (V.O.) Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to get it to the four, but it's gonna bring up fourth and goal. No doubt about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go for it here, if they're gonna get back in this game. \nANGLE ON THE SIDELINE \nWinters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into the huddle. \nRAY Give it to me up the gut, Coach. They've been ignoring me. I know I can score. \nWINTERS No, we're gonna go with the sweep. \nWinters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is upset, angry. He swears to himself. \nANGLE ON FIELD \nRay enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear. \nJOE 28 Thunder right. On 2. \nThe team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building. \nWe go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make the block. He drops out of our picture. \nDARNELL Shit! \nDarnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line. Touchdown, E.S.U. \nThe stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to talk to his defense. \nDarnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray, grabs him by the helmet. \nDARNELL Monster block, man. Monster motherfuckin' block. \nRay smiles. They butt heads and run off the field \nINT. ALVIN'S SHACK \nALVIN (softly to himself) All right, defense. Let's get evil. Kill 'em all, let the paramedics sort 'em out. \nEXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nGeorgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle. \nHARVEY (V.O.) 1:11 and counting. Third and one. The Wolves have got to stop them on this play if they're gonna get the ball back. A first down here and it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of timeouts. \nThe Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a fierce yell. \nSmash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way. \nLattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling their arms, whipping up the crowd. \nANGLE ON SIDELINE \nWinters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise. \nANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER \n"}

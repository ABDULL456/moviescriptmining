THEN: 
VOLUMNIA I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. She moves across the room to fetch a cigarette. She moves, always, with stately grace. She walks past a series of photographs. They tell the story of Martius' life: the happy baby; the stern dead father; the rigid young military cadet; the formal wedding; the restrained and unsmiling adult. In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to experienced, severe looking soldier. Volumnia is present in most of the pictures. 
AS: 
VOLUMNIA When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. She lights her cigarette. 
VOLUMNIA To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak. 
VIRGILIA But had he died in the business, madam, how then? 
VOLUMNIA Then his good report should have been my son. (she rivets Virgilia) Had I a dozen sons I had rather have eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action. A MAID enters. She speaks to Volumnia (the true mistress of the house) not to Virgilia. 
MAID Madam, Senator Menenius is come to visit you. 
VOLUMNIA Tell Menenius we are fit to bid him welcome. The Maid goes. 
VIRGILIA Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself. 
VOLUMNIA Indeed, you shall not! She turns off the TV and goes to a bar to mix drinks. She mixes the drinks aggressively, strangely inspired by the discussion of war: 
VOLUMNIA Methinks I hear hither your husband's 
DRUM; Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call 
THUS: 
(MORE) 
VOLUMNIA (CONT'D) "Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear, Though you were born in Rome." His bloody 
BROW Then wiping, forth he goes. 
VIRGILIA His bloody brow? 0 Jupiter, no blood... 
VOLUMNIA Away, you fool! It more becomes a man Than gold his trophy. 
VIRGILIA Heavens bless my lord from fell Auf idius ... 
VOLUMNIA He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee And tread upon his neck. Senator Menenius enters, he is comfortable in this house and an old ally of Volumnia's. 
MENENIUS My ladies both, good day to you. Volumnia hands him one of the drinks she has been mixing: a perfect martini. She knows how he takes his drink. She is not above flirting with him when it suits her ends. 
MENENIUS How do you both? 
(TO VIRGILIA) And how does your little son? 
VIRGILIA I thank you, sir; well, good. 
VOLUMNIA He had rather play with swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster. 
MENENIUS On my word, the father's son! He and Volumnia laugh. Menenius has sensed Virgilia's tension. Tries to cheer her: 
MENENIUS Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.

COP #1 Not on duty, sorry. 
CAESAR Oh, right. 
COP #2 But, uh, would you mind if I used your bathroom? 
Caesar's face tightens. 
CAESAR Yeah, why not?  It's right there. 
COP #2 Thanks. 
He heads for the john. 
Violet watches Caesar back up to the bar, moving behind it. 
CAESAR I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay? 
COP #1 Go right ahead, sir. 
INT.  BATHROOM NIGHT 
Cop #2 enters, walking right past the shower curtain.  We hear his sigh as he starts to piss. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Cop #1 walks onto the rug, looking around, turning to Violet. 
COP #1 This is a beautiful place. 
VIOLET ...  thank you. 
She stares at his shoes on the rug. 
Watching everything, Caesar takes a sip of his drink.  He slips his gun out and holds it at his side. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
There is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine Johnnie's arm is hanging. 
Slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic curtain, where a drip of blood forms and -- 
Plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Close on the heel of the cop's black shoe, where we can almost see the blood seeping up through the oriental rug. 
COP #1 Is this a condo? 
Violet nods. 
Everyone turns when Cop #2 busts out of the bathroom. 
COP #2 Okay, let's roll. 
Cop #1 walks across the rug to the hardwood floor.  He turns to Caesar. 
COP #1 Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around. 
CAESAR Good idea. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet.  The door closes. She isn't sure what she should do. 
Over her shoulder, she notes the bucket of paint.  She lets the cops leave. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Caesar puts on a new shirt, the gun stuffed in his pants. 
CAESAR Let's go. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky rises at the sound of Caesar's door closing. 
We track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the faint sounds of Caesar and Violet's footsteps. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty apartment, straight at the peephole. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT Corky is pressed against the door, eye at the peephole. 
She sees that Violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak to each other with their eyes. 
CORKY ...  shit. 
EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's Mercedes.  Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.

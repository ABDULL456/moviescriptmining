SKY - DAY                                              1 \nFluffy white CLOUDS drift across a clear blue sky. \nTITLE CARD- \"This really happened\" \nFADE TO WHITE: \nTITLE CARD- \"It really did\" \nA dull WHINE is heard building in volume until finally- \nSMASH CUT TO: \n2   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY    2 \nStartled, STEVEN RUSSELL (40) opens his eyes. Gaunt and pale, he seems to be on death's door. The whine we once heard is now the high-pitched ALARM of medical equipment. \nThe door BURSTS open. NURSES enter, rushing toward him. \nThe nurses pass him and attend to the PATIENT in the next bed over, frantically administering CPR. \nSUPER: \"TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY INFIRMARY - 1998\" \nA DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside. \nDOCTOR Where's the crash cart!? \nHe straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard. \nSteven returns his gaze to the ceiling. A CHEERY VOICE counterpoints the bleakness of this scene. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) (upbeat and happy) Love sure is a funny thing... It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes you do all sorts of things you never thought you'd do before. Love's the reason I'm here actually. \nSMASH CUT TO: \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages      5-23-08   2. \n3   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              3 \nA group of FOUR NINE YEAR OLDS lie in the grass atop a hill. They stare up at the clouds, playfully arguing. \nRED HAIRED BOY I still don't see it. \nLITTLE GIRL It's right there. \nA young STEVEN RUSSELL (9) is among them. \nYOUNG STEVEN It's really big. \nSTEVEN'S MOM (O.S.) Steeeeeeeeeven... \nSteven looks down the hill to see his mother calling. \nSTEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) Steeeeeeeeeven... \n4   INT. LIVING ROOM CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              4 \nYoung Steven sits in the middle of the couch. His PARENTS and 11 year old BROTHER stand before him. He stares at them- innocent and doe-eyed with a big smile on his face. \nSTEVEN'S MOM Are you a happy little boy Steven? \nSteven smiles and nods. \nSTEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) You've always been such a happy little boy. (then) Now Steven, we want to tell you something very important, but I want you to understand that it doesn't change a thing. \nSteven awaits, smiling. \nSTEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) We're still gonna love you, you're still gonna be our happy little boy and you're still gonna-- \nSTEVEN'S BROTHER You're adopted. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages     5-23-08     3. \nYOUNG STEVEN Shut up! \nHe glares at his brother, then turns back to his mother. Her face says it all. \nSTEVEN'S MOM It's true. \nWHACK! She SWATS his brother in the head. Steven starts putting things together. \nSTEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) Your brother overheard your Dad and I talking and well, we didn't want you to hear it from anybody but us. (then) It's true. You're a special little boy. You know why? Because we chose you. Not like your brother here who's natural. \nSTEVEN I'm absolutely bushed. \nDEBBIE Me too. \nThey turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. After a few moments of SILENCE, Steven rolls over and puts his arm around her, gently feeling her breasts. \nDebbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as Steven quietly gets on top. In moments, they are rocking with the gentle rhythm of everyday sex. \nJust as things are peaking, Steven suddenly STOPS and strikes a conversational tone. \nSTEVEN Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots of access? You know- records and things? \nDEBBIE (surprised) Steven- \nSTEVEN (oblivious) Now do you think it's, you know, unethical, to use that to find my mother? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"      Green Pages    5-23-08   7. \nDebbie quickly realizes where his head is at. \nDEBBIE Oh... that.   Yeah, um, well I don't know- \nSTEVEN I swear honey- getting around the system's so easy. No one would even know I did it. \nDEBBIE I know you want to find her Steven, but you need to think about this. \nSTEVEN You're right, I shouldn't have done it. \nDEBBIE You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what'd you find? \nSteven shrugs. \nSTEVEN I haven't looked. It's downstairs. \nDEBBIE Really? Well let's go! \nShe moves to get up. Steven takes umbrage. \nSTEVEN Well hold on- let me finish. \nDEBBIE Oh, right. \nSteven thrusts and tenses. \nSTEVEN There- that's got it. \n10   INT. STEVEN AND DEBBIE'S HOUSE 1984 - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 10 \nSteven flips through the file box, reading through various pages. Debbie watches with compassion as he reads. Eventually he cracks an incredulous SMILE. \nDEBBIE What? \nSTEVEN She's right here. She's been right here all this time. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08     8. \nDEBBIE It's really her? \nSTEVEN Yeah. No question. \nDEBBIE My goodness Steven, that's wonderful. \nHe reads on, his smile ever widening until- \nHe comes across something that concerns him and his voice trails off. His smile fades, replaced by a look of dread. \nDebbie grows concerned. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) What? What is it? Steven? \nHe cannot believe his eyes. \n11   EXT. BASCOMBE HOME, VIRGINIA, 1984 - DAY                    11 \nSteven walks up to a middle class home and raps on the screen door. A kindly woman (MRS. BASCOMBE) arrives behind the mesh wearing a birthday PARTY HAT. \nMRS. BASCOMBE (alarmed) Is something wrong officer? \nSTEVEN Are you Barbra Bascombe? \nMRS. BASCOMBE Yes. Is something wrong? Is someone hurt? \nSTEVEN (lip quivering) In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave up a baby for adoption, correct? \nAn ashen look overcomes Mrs. Basham's face. She removes her hat. \nMRS. BASCOMBE I don't think I know what you're talking about. \nSteven can see that behind her is a small FAMILY GATHERING at the table, grouped around a BIRTHDAY CAKE. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages     5-23-08   9. \nSTEVEN Elizabeth City? St Jude's Hospital? Remember? \nMRS. BASCOMBE I don't know what you're talking about. \nAmidst the moonlit shadows, the THUMPING of VIGOROUS LOVEMAKING is heard. It continues, getting louder and louder until we make out two forms doing it doggie-style in the bed. \nBuilding to the climax, Steven moans with pleasure. \nSTEVEN I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come... \nSuddenly we see the face of the MOUSTACHED MAN he's fucking. \nMOUSTACHED MAN DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! \nSMASH CUT TO: \n14   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 14 \nWe are back with Steven in his hospital bed at the Penitentiary. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Oh did I forget to mention I was gay? Yeah, sorry about that. I'm gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as I can remember... \nSMASH CUT TO: \n15   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY           15 \nWE'RE BACK on the hilltop from the beginning of the movie. \nNine year old Steven and his three young FRIENDS crest the verdant hill- running and laughing through the backlit dandelion fluff of an idyllic summer day. \nThey all collapse into the long grass like the splayed arms of a starfish. Catching their breath, they stare up at the sky- searching for shapes in the clouds. \nLITTLE GIRL I see a pony! What do you see!? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"    Green Pages   5-23-08     13. \nLITTLE BOY I see a diesel train! \nRED HAIRED BOY I see a whirlybird! \nYOUNG STEVEN I see a wiener. \nThey look at him with incredulity. \nRED HAIRED BOY What?! What kind of wiener? \nYOUNG STEVEN A man's wiener. \nLITTLE BOY Shut up! There's no wiener! \nYOUNG STEVEN Uh huh! \nRED HAIRED BOY No there's not! \nThere is a long silence.   Then- \nLITTLE GIRL Oh I see it. There it is! \nYOUNG STEVEN Told ya... \nAnd as the other boys squint closely... \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Anyway where was I? Oh yeah-- \nSMASH CUT TO: \n16   INT. HOUSTON BEDROOM - 1986 - NIGHT                        16 \nOnce again, the MOUSTACHED MAN throws his head back in the throes of lust. \nMOUSTACHED MAN DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! \nSteven drives it home. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages       5-23-08   14. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) (matter of fact) And I did. \n17   EXT. HOUSTON APARTMENT DOORWAY, 1986 - LATER THAT NIGHT     17 \nThe Moustached Man and Steven say goodbye at the door. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) I had been living a lie for a long, long time. I tend to do that... hide things. \nMOUSTACHED MAN You be careful out there, you're a little drunk. \n18   EXT. HOUSTON STREET - 1986 - NIGHT                          18 \nSteven drives his red Corvette, hard top removed, with a contented look on his face. He glows as the Pet Shop Boys' \"West End Girls\" plays on the radio. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Now just because I was screwing around doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did. I loved her with all my heart... Stephanie too. My family was all I had and they needed me. So I told myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it stayed that way. (beat) That's what I told myself. But life has a way of forcing these things into the light. \nCRASH! A CROSSING PICKUP TRUCK smashes into the driver side door-- violently propelling steven and his corvette out of frame. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) You might even call it an epiphany. \n19   OMITTED                                                     19 \nSTEVEN Thank you. \nWith great difficulty, Steven gets on his crutches and makes his exit. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now it didn't happen all at once. It was sort of a gradual thing... \n28   EXT. GROCERY RECEIVING DOCK - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY             28 \nAn OLD WAREHOUSE MANAGER emerges from a darkened AMITY FOODSERVICE trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand. As he steps out onto the dock, he passes Steven, who is talking with a 500 pound PRODUCE MANAGER. \nTomato crates are all around. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain stores as higher grade. \nPRODUCE MANAGER These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right? \nSTEVEN (big smile) Finest in the land... \nAnd as they talk- \nSTEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) It's called `field buying'. I could clear three thousand dollars in a good week doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough. \n29   INT. MIAMI JEWELRY STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                 29 \nSteven stands before a SALESPERSON at a counter. \nSALESWOMAN Cash or charge? \nSTEVEN Charge... \nSteven flips through a handful of identical CREDIT CARDS. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages     5-23-08   19. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) (sotto) Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell, Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell... (seeing one he likes) Ah! \nHe gives a card to a smiling SALESWOMAN. \nSALESWOMAN Thank you... (reading card) ...Mister Evans. Can I see some ID? \nSTEVEN Of course. \nAnd as Steven riffles through an equally large stack of DRIVER'S LICENSES... \n30   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                      30 \nSteven stands atop a escalator, looking around. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) But when money got really tight, the slip and fall always came in handy. \nHe throws himself down the escalator, out of frame to the floor below. Painful tumbling is heard. \nAt the BOTTOM of the escalator a hard THUD is heard.      A beat later, Steven's feet slide into frame. \n31   INT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1992 - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 31 \nCHRISTMAS MUSIC. \nDressed in pajamas, Steven and Kemple sit cross-legged at the base of their Christmas Tree, surrounded by torn paper and strewn gifts. Steven's arm is in a cast. \nKemple opens a hinged case to reveal a GOLD Rolex watch. \nKEMPLE Oh wow... \nSTEVEN What do you think? Yes? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"      Green Pages       5-23-08   20. \nKEMPLE Well Steven it's beautiful.     It really is. \nSTEVEN You don't like it. \nKEMPLE No, no, no.   I do. \nSTEVEN You don't like it. \nKEMPLE I'm menstruating. Don't listen to me. \nSTEVEN Tell me what's wrong with it.        Is it the gold? \nKEMPLE Well... \nSTEVEN That's why I got you the stainless! \nHe takes out another box and hands it to Kemple. \nKEMPLE Steven! \nAs he opens it, Steven grabs the gold Rolex. \nSTEVEN The gold one is for me, dipshit. \nKemple smiles broadly as he admires his new watch. \nHe continues to CRY uncontrollably as he raises a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and dumps all the pills into his mouth. He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a bottle of Galliano to wash it down. \nHe starts up the car. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine. \n36    EXT. ROAD - FLORIDA 1992 - DAY                              36 \nCARS PASS through frame, quickly heading wherever it is they are going. Moments later, a car horn is heard, incessantly blaring and building in volume until-- \nSTEVEN'S CAR IDLES INTO FRAME AT 1 MPH. The Heights', \"How Do You Talk To An Angel\" is barely audible over the car horn and STEVEN is slumped over the steering wheel. \nMoments later, it veers off down into the grassy shoulder and out of frame. \nFADE OUT. \n37    INT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL - 1992 - MORNING                   37 \nSteven awakes in a hospital bed. He looks around and eventually looks through the observation glass into the hallway. He sees Debbie talking to a COP. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"       Green Pages   5-23-08   24. \nKEMPLE (O.S.) Hey... \nHe readjusts to see Jimmy sitting nearby. \nSTEVEN (bleary) Sorry. \nKEMPLE Why didn't you tell me? \nSTEVEN I can't go to prison, Jimmy. I can't. I can't go to prison. I can't. I can't... \nKEMPLE Okay-okay calm down. It's okay. I just want to tell them you're awake and we can take it from there. \nConfident that Steven is calm, Jimmy steps into the hall. \n38   INT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - 1992 - CONTINUOUS         38 \nJimmy joins Debbie and the Cop in the hallway.    Steven is visible in bed through the glass. \nDEBBIE Did you know Steven was wanted? \nKEMPLE Not until just now. \nDEBBIE He likes to keep little secrets sometimes. \nKEMPLE Like the fact that he was a big queer? \nDEBBIE Yeah, like that. \nKEMPLE But suicide, my god. \nDEBBIE Well he does tend to overreact. \nKEMPLE I feel like I don't even know him. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08   25. \nDEBBIE Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not really sure he knows who he is. He's searching, at least that's how I figure it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for. \nKEMPLE (to cop) Can you tell me exactly what he did? \nAs they CONTINUE TO TALK, they fail to notice Steven getting out of bed and looking around blearily. \nHe picks up a bedpan, reaches into his gown and absent- mindedly PISSES-- missing the pan completely. \nCOP He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud, forgery, embezzlement... \nDEBBIE What? \nKEMPLE I should have known... I should have said something. \nDEBBIE Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest. \nKEMPLE That would be a warning sign... \nDEBBIE And all that Peter Allen music on his Walkman. \nKEMPLE Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now. \nDEBBIE I just never thought. But now stealing? \nKEMPLE He's probably been doing it for years.    I say to myself he did it just to buy me things but I don't think that's true. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08    26. \nDEBBIE It's bigger than that. I'm sure. \nKEMPLE But why then? \nDEBBIE And why suicide? I mean- just like that? \nAfter that, he dresses and walks out the door behind them. \nKEMPLE I know- he seemed so happy and-- \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His name's Gary. \n45   EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY BREEZEWAY, 1995 - DAY            45 \nA mean-looking con named GARY mans a mail-cart while he talks with Steven and Arnie. \nGARY (mid-sentence) ...letters, magazines, shit like that- it all goes through unmolested. But if Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or brownies or whatever-- you're gonna have to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five bucks per item or you can suck my dick. \nSteven turns to Arnie. \nSTEVEN Your choice. \n46   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY CELL BLOCK - 1995 - DAY          46 \nSteven and Arnie arrive at the doorway of their cell. \nSTEVEN Well that's about it. You're gonna be fine. Don't worry. And if you need anything you just let me know. Alright? \nArnie thinks a moment. \nARNIE So, uh, do I need to suck your dick? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08   30. \nSTEVEN That'd be great. \nSteven gently shoves his new cellmate into the cell. \n47   INT. TX STATE PEN - PHONE BANK/COMMON AREA - 1995 - DAY     47 \nSteven is on one of the many pay phones. \nDEBBIE (O.S.) Hi this is Debbie and Steffie. Sorry we missed you. Leave a message. God Bless! \nBEEP. \nSTEVEN Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. I thought one o'clock was our time but maybe not. I sure miss you guys. Thanks for the picture and the article. Sometimes it's just nice to know there's someone out there who still cares about me since Jimmy left and all. So... uh... \nSteven is holding the stainless steel ROLEX he gave Kemple as a gift. He regards it wistfully. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) (thinking, drifting) Do you think I broke his heart? (snapping out of it) Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the machine... I'll try you again next time. One O'clock. Don't forget. \nHe hangs up. Bored and lonely, he has a moment of repose. Just then, a loud RUCKUS across the COMMON AREA gets his attention. \nSteven watches as a group of ROWDY PRISONERS throw whatever they can find at a small BIRD as it flies around, trapped in the cavernous hall. \nThe men LAUGH and HOOT as the bird is struck down and lies motionless on the ground. \nAs the prisoners resume their activities, Steven notices a GENTLE LOOKING INMATE approaching the bird. \nRapt, Steven watches as the inmate sympathetically scoops up the bird and walks off. Steven is quite taken. \nCUT TO: \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08   31. \n48   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - LAW LIBRARY - 1995 - DAY       48 \nThe gentle inmate, PHILLIP MORRIS, is a slightly built, handsome blonde boy-man. He struggles to reach a book on a high shelf. Helpless and irresistible, he is surprised when Steven reaches in to help retrieve the book. \nTheir eyes lock and they stare in a short silence, until- \nPHILLIP (slightly Blanche DuBois) Thanks. Guess I need a few extra inches. \nSTEVEN Glad to help. How's the bird? \nPHILLIP Huh? (realizing) Oh. Him, yeah... he's at peace. \nSTEVEN Oh, I'm sorry. \nPHILLIP It was for the best. He was suffering. \nSteven acknowledges his kindness with a smile. \nSTEVEN (referring to law book) Civil law? You know, I'm an attorney. \nPHILLIP Really? \nSTEVEN You suing someone? \nPHILLIP I don't know what I'm doing. There's a guy I know- he's in the infirmary now. He's sick- he's real sick... AIDS. I thought maybe I could find a way to get him some help- I mean real help. Not here. I don't know- maybe I could-- I don't even know what I'm looking for... \nSteven is intrigued. \nSTEVEN Does he have a lawyer? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"       Green Pages   5-23-08   32. \nPHILLIP Yeah. \nSTEVEN Have him get in touch with the Prisoner Rights Committee. They deal with this all the time- pro bono. I've got the number. \nPHILLIP Well thank you, I-- \nSTEVEN My name's Steven Russell. \nSTEVEN Good... \nPhillip turns to walk away and hides his giddyness. \n50   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - MICHAEL UNIT, 1995 - DAY           50 \nPhillip passes the cells of Michael Unit, clutching his belongings and soon enters his cell. He looks around sheepishly until he is interrupted- \nCLEAVON (O.S.) You Phillip? \nPhillip turns to see CLEAVON- a huge black inmate mopping the hall outside his cell \nPHILLIP Yes. \nHe tosses Phillip a folded note.      He catches it and looks at it with a smile. \nPHILLIP (CONT'D) Already? \nPhillip opens it up. As he reads, his face brightens considerably. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages     5-23-08    36. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Phillip, hope your new place is nice. Nice enough anyway. I hope the chocolate made it to you okay. Check the T.P. \nPhillip looks at the spare roll of toilet paper and turns it over. A small chocolate bar is stuck in the tube. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) I hope you try to make some new friends and not be too shy. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n51   INT. TX STATE PEN - MICHAEL UNIT - PHILLIP'S CELL - DAY     51 \nOPEN CLOSE ON a note as Phillip scrawls it. \nPHILLIP (V.O.) Dear Steven. I keep thinking about you saying I'm shy. I guess you're right, but I don't feel shy around you. I think that means something... \nAs his VO continues, Phillip folds up the paper and passes it through the bars back to Cleavon. \n52   INT./EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 (MONTAGE)             52 \nVARIOUS SHOTS as we follow the note being passed by different hands and means throughout the prison on its way to Steven. \nPHILLIP (V.O.) Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I should tell you I'm diabetic so I probably shouldn't... but I did anyway. It's been so long since anyone's shown me any kindness and well, it means a lot. I just wish you were here... \n53   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1995 - STEVEN'S CELL - CONTINUOUS        53 \nSteven reads the letter on his bunk. \nPHILLIP (V.O.) ...Write me back soon. Phillip. \nSteven finishes the letter and folds it up, looking strangely expressionless. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages       5-23-08   37. \n54   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - DAY           54 \nPhillip peers out of his cell to see Cleavon working his way nearer with his mop. He's giddy. \nMoments later, Cleavon passes him by. Phillip is bummed. \n55   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NEXT DAY      55 \nAgain Phillip watches as Cleavon passes his cell without leaving a note. \n56   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NEXT DAY      56 \nPhillip lays in bed, impatiently. He seems upset. He anxiously peers out the bars and catches a glimpse of the mopping Cleavon working his way closer to his cell. \nPHILLIP Hurry up would you? \nCLEAVON I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot. Besides I ain't got nothing for you anyway... \nPHILLIP But it's been three days. \nCLEAVON You got a tracking number, motherfucker? \nPHILLIP No. \nCLEAVON Then shut your faggot ass. \nPhillip slumps back onto his bed, depressed. \nPHILLIP Congratulations Phillip, scared off another one. \nA few moments later, he's startled by the CLANG of his cell door sliding open. \nHe looks up - a CORRECTIONS OFFICER stands over him. \nCORRECTIONS OFFICER Morris - you got a new roommate. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages     5-23-08   38. \nThis is no consolation to Phillip. He heaves a heavy sigh until he sees STEVEN enter his cell, clutching a pile of belongings. \nPhillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind Steven. \nPHILLIP Get up... \nSteven sits up. \nPHILLIP (CONT'D) Did you pay to have the Screecher beat up? \nSTEVEN Me? \nPHILLIP Don't bullshit me. Did you pay to have him beat up? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages    5-23-08   41. \nSTEVEN Well you said he bothered you. \nPHILLIP Just answer me. \nSTEVEN Yeah. Yeah, I did. \nPHILLIP Steven... \nA tear comes to Phillip's eye. \nPHILLIP (CONT'D) This is the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me. \nHe clamps onto Steven and hugs with all his life. \nSTEVEN I just want you to be happy, baby. \nPHILLIP You are so amazing!!! \nAnd as they roll on the bed playfully... \n62   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - CLEAVON'S CELL - NIGHT        62 \nCLEAVON lays on his cot staring at the ceiling. Eventually a hand enters through the bars holding a cassette tape. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Cleavon- put this in. \nCLEAVON No man- not now. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) It's important. \nCLEAVON How important? \nPhillip's hand disappears for a moment and comes back with a FIVE DOLLAR BILL. \nCLEAVON (CONT'D) Ten. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"       Green Pages   5-23-08   42. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Fine. But you gotta play the whole thing. \nCLEAVON Yeah, alright. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Promise? \nCLEAVON Fuck you- my word's my bond motherfucker. \nCleavon takes the cash and puts the tape in a BOOM BOX. \nA familiar romantic TUNE begins to play... \nCLEAVON (CONT'D) Fuck man- Johnny Mathis? Fucking white- ass nigger... \nHe buries his head in the pillow as \"Chances Are\" plays. \n63   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NIGHT         63 \nAs the MUSIC seeps into their dark cell, Steven reads a LAW BOOK by pen light. Phillip grabs Steven's hand and tries to pull him off the bed. \nPHILLIP C'mon... \nSTEVEN What? \nPHILLIP C'mon. Dance. \nSTEVEN No. No... I can't dance. \nPHILLIP Yes you can. \nSTEVEN No I can't. I'm serious... \nPHILLIP Honey, you're queer- it comes with the package. \nSTEVEN Well not me. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages      5-23-08   43. \nPHILLIP C'mon, I'll show you... \nHe drags him up and begins his lesson. \nPHILLIP (CONT'D) Hold me here... and here. Okay watch... \nSteven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a while, but with Phillip's help he begins to settle in. \n68A   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN BREEZEWAY, 1995 - MORNING             68A \nPhillip runs after Steven, quickly arriving at a LOCKED GATE. Steven is on the other side, still being escorted away.

TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - COMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS      69 \nPhillip marches through the common area, fighting tears. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages    5-23-08     46. \n70   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - M BLOCK - CONTINUOUS           70 \nPhillip runs through another cell block until he comes to a window. He looks outside. \nPHILLIP Steven! \n71   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS        71 \nPHILLIP'S POV: Steven is waiting in line with some other prisoners to board a bus. \nPhillip can be seen through the small window, but he fails to get Steven's attention. \nHe bangs silently on the glass. \n72   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - M BLOCK - CONTINUOUS           72 \nPhillip continues in vain to get Steven's attention. \nPHILLIP STEVEN!! STEVEN! \nHe sees the line at the sally port start to move and stops to think. He knows what he has to do. \n73   EXT. TX STATE PEN BREEZEWAY, 1995 - YARD GATE - DAY         73 \nPhillip runs down a breezeway. Eventually he reaches a heavily populated gate, manned by a YARD GUARD. \nPHILLIP I wanna go in the yard. \nYARD GUARD You do? \nPHILLIP I WANNA GO IN THE YARD! \nYARD GUARD Hold your horses Dorothy. \nThe Yard Guard pushes a button that opens the gate and Phillip bursts through. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages    5-23-08   47. \n74   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - YARD - DAY                     74 \nPhillip runs through the yard, passing GIANT WOLF- WHISTLING INMATES as they put down their weights and stop their basketball games. \nPhillip maintains his focus on the sally port on the other side of the far fence. \nPHILLIP STEVEN!!!! \nBoarding the bus, Steven hears him and turns. Delighted, he's forced on board by a Guard before he can respond. \nPHILLIP (CONT'D) STEVEN! \nSteven gets in his seat and yells out the window. \nSTEVEN What the hell are you doing!? \nPHILLIP I love you! \nSTEVEN I love you too! \nVROOM! The bus starts up and begins to move. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) We'll be together soon! I promise! \nThe bus drives off. Phillip runs along with it for a while as they share a long goodbye. And eventually, the bus disappears from view. \nPhillip clings to the fence a moment, hanging on to hope. He slumps and turns- \n-only to find himself confronted by several HULKING MEMBERS OF THE ARYAN BROTHERHOOD with one thing on their minds. \nPhillip marches right toward them and as he draws close- \nPHILLIP GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY!!! \nStartled, they split to let Phillip pass unmolested. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"      Green Pages   5-23-08   48. \n75   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 75 \nBack in the present, Steven remains in his hospital bed at the Penitentiary Infirmary. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Those were the longest three months of my life. I wrote to Phillip every day until I got released. \n76   EXT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 - SALLY PORT - DAY       76 \nCLANG!   The gate of the prison closes behind Steven as he exits.   He approaches a waiting TAXI. \nA PARTY to celebrate Phillip's release. Steven and Phillip stand at the door as FRIENDS file in and greet him boisterously. \nBAYLOR Phillllip!     It's so good to see you... \nAnother friend enters. \nBLAKE Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed with you. How do I get on that diet? \nPHILLIP Oh you couldn't handle it- not unless we smuggled an espresso machine in a cake. \nBLAKE Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I'm there! \nPHILLIP This is Steven. Steven- Blake and Baylor. \nBLAKE (Gasp) This is him?! This is your gay lawyer prison boyfriend?! Pleased to meet you. \nBAYLOR Much better than the guy who had you kidnapped. What was his name? \nSteven looks to Phillip, perplexed. \nPHILLIP Long story. \nSTEVEN (regroups, to others) Can I get you all a drink? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08    52. \n84   INT. PASSABLE APARTMENT KITCHEN, 1995 - LATER THAT NIGHT 84 \nSteven works his way through the crowded apartment struggling to hold a few cocktail glasses for guests. \nHe eventually arrives next to Phillip, who is having a great time with another friend- and older woman named EUDORA MIXON. \nSTEVEN We gotta get a bigger place. \nPHILLIP Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor- Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest. \nEUDORA Pleasure Steven. \nSTEVEN Eudora... \nPHILLIP Eudora owns a little building in Montrose and she's having a hell of time with the builder. He sounds like a real asshole. \nEUDORA His plans were useless and he's trying to sue me to pay him! I need your expertise Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help. \nSTEVEN I could certainly try. \nEUDORA Can you still practice law, having been to prison? \nSTEVEN Sure- why not? \nEUDORA I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd just be glad to have someone I could trust. I'll pay your normal fee. \nSteven doesn't miss a beat. He smiles wide. \nSTEVEN It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my speciality. \nPhillip beams with pride over Steven's decision. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages    5-23-08   53. \n85   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, 1995 - DAY               85 \nEudora waits on a bench in the corridor, nervously glancing at her watch. Steven stands behind a column down the hall hiding and watching. He looks at his watch, then approaches her. \nSTEVEN Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in court all day. Let's go in. \n86   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM, 1995 - DAY                         86 \nSTEVEN'S POV: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling. \nON STEVEN, staring up at it with admiration. \nJUDGE (O.S.) Mister Russell? \nSteven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting JUDGE. \nSTEVEN It's a beautiful fixture. \nJUDGE I know.   It's your turn. \nSTEVEN Oh... (then) Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed. \nLAWYER The terms of that contract were ambiguous at best. The truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment. \nSTEVEN Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his! \nEudora glances into Steven's opened BRIEFCASE. It contains only a SANDWICH and a PHOTO OF PHILLIP. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08   54. \nThe shocked LAWYER turns to his client (EVANS). \nLAWYER (whispers) Is this true? \nEVANS No. \nPhillip smiles. \n90   OMITTED                                                     90 \n91   I/E. KEY WEST COVE - 1996 - VARIOUS                         91 \nPALM TREES undulate on the constant breeze, inviting us to a beautifully solitary cove. Eventually Steven and Phillip's voices are heard. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) I've been meaning to ask you something. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Yeah? \nDIALOGUE CONTINUES OVER VARIOUS SHOTS of their romantic getaway to the Keys. In a SERIES of SHOTS we see where they've been and what they've been doing in the moments AFTER they've been there. \n- A Hammock blowing in the breeze. \n- A quaint COTTAGE nestled in the vegetation. \n- Half empty glasses of beer on the porch. \n- Dirty dishes in the cottage sink. The remains of a romantic meal on a table. The swaying palms are visible through the windows. \n- Footsteps in the sand. \n- Two beach chairs facing the surf. \n- Etc...   etc... \nPHILLIP (O.S.) That birthday cake you got me in the pen? Where'd you get those candles? \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Oh you know... just... people I knew. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Yeah, I know. But how? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"       Green Pages   5-23-08   58. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a lot? \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Lance? He couldn't been more than 98 pounds. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Yeah, that's him. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Oh he was such an asshole. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Actually- I was in the yard once. Another guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw this picture of a little girl about Steffie's age. So I brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. That's the thing about having kids, you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... And the next day, bedtime, there they were. \n91A   EXT. PALM BEACH COVE - 1996 - DUSK - CONTINUOUS            91A \nThe dialogue continues on the beach as we finally see Steven and Phillip enjoying the sunset by the light of a small fire on the beach. \nPHILLIP How'd you know he'd do that? \nSTEVEN I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for you... and I found a way to do it. That's all. \nPhillip smiles, eyes never leaving the sunset. \nPHILLIP Just listenin' huh? \nSTEVEN That's it... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"    Green Pages      5-23-08   59. \nAnd as the sun sets on the shimmering water-- \n92   EXT. OCEAN, 1996 - DAY                                      92 \nAn empty 21-foot MOTORBOAT bobs atop placid seas, fishing poles dangling over the side. The SOUND of two men enjoying themselves can be heard. \nAfter reaching their inevitable conclusion, the VOICES gasp for air. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) (winded) I'm gonna get a Coke... you want a Coke? \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Uh huh...                                              * \nPhillip spits something over the railing...                      * \nSTEVEN (CONT'D)                           * Aw, you don't love me...                               * \nAnd as Phillip smiles and wipe his chin.                         * \nSTEVEN (V.O.) With Phillip I felt strong. I felt invincible. I promised myself he would never want for anything ever again. That meant I needed a real job. Something dependable. And- no more scams. \nFADE IN: \n96   INT. USAMM HQ - LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY              96 \nA bored Steven waits in the middle of a big wig's office. He looks at PHOTOS on a nearby wall of a broad-shouldered all-American man dressed in a NASA jump suit performing various astronautical training tasks. \nHe picks up a small ASTRONAUT FIGURINE and examines it. \nLINDHOLM (O.S.) Sorry to keep you waiting Steven. \nSteven turns to find Dan Lindholm, the broad-shouldered man himself. \nLINDHOLM Hell of a hazard ain't it Steven? \nEventually, a ball flies out of the trap. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) (to ball) Oh yeah! How ya like that, sister!? \nCUT TO: \n112   EXT. HOUSTON GOLF COURSE FAIRWAY - 1996 - DAY              112 \nSteven and the Client amble along a few yards behind Dan and the other client. Steven is covered in sweat and sand. \nCLIENT So the black fella says to the jew lawyer- \"50 bucks a question? Ain't that expensive?\" \"Yeah it's expensive,\" he says, \"I'm a Jew, you nigger!\" \nThe man laughs to himself. \nCLIENT (CONT'D) Get it?!! \nHe soon spots his ball up ahead. \nCLIENT (CONT'D) There I am. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages       5-23-08   70. \nHe moves on, leaving Steven standing there, disgusted. \nMATCH CUT TO: \n113   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  113 \nSteven sits at his desk, detached and fed up. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Maybe it was because it's just my nature, or maybe it was because of my past... or maybe it was because they were the most boring fucking people I'd ever met in my life... (beat) Whatever the reason, I had been robbing them blind for months. \n114   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  114 \nFLASHBACK to Steven's first day on the job as his RHEBA escorts him to a desk piled high with financial reports. \nRHEBA Anything else I can do for you? \nSTEVEN Uh.... cup of coffee? \nRHEBA I'll do it today but I don't do that really. \nSteven nods and begins to leaf through various folders. \nIt isn't long before something catches his eye. \n115   MONTAGE: HOW MONEY FLOWS AT USAMM--                        115 \nQUICK CUTS of Steven researching by leafing through folders and files INTERCUT with a slow push in on a CHECK PRINTING MACHINE as it spits out product as well as TIME LAPSE footage of employees buzzing through one of the USAM hallways. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) The thing about U-SAMM was that they took in all this HMO money and distributed it to doctors. (MORE) \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"    Green Pages   5-23-08   71. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) But in the time between receiving the money and paying it out- it was just sitting there, not making interest or anything. \n116   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                 116 \nAt his desk, Steven leafs through the company finances. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) It occurred to me to set up an investment account where the held money would earn interest for the short time that the company had it. We're talking twenty two million at any given time here, so even short term the interest adds up pretty quickly. I'd be making the company millions virtually overnight. \nHe leans back to think to himself. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) ...and I of course would take a commission. Say... fifty percent. The only problem with that was-- I wasn't the one signing the checks. \n117   INT. USAMM OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                            117 \nOPEN CLOSE on a check being signature-stamped with a RUBBER STAMP. A hand places the stamp into a small wooden box and closes it. \nCUT WIDE to reveal the hand belongs to VERA, the company accountant and STEVEN is standing over her. It is now we realize we are revisiting an earlier scene. \nSTEVEN So I ask, \"Don't you think that's a little expensive?\" and the lawyer says, \"Yes it is, now what's your final question?\" \nVera EXPLODES with laughter. \nVERA It's so true. Lawyers! \nShe turns to a colleague. \nVERA (CONT'D) Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this! \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages    5-23-08    72. \nAnd as ANNIE comes over, Steven's hand moves to the wooden box and secretly plucks the RUBBER STAMP. \n118   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  118 \nLindholm raps on the open door as he enters. \nLINDHOLM Steven, we got a problem. Vera lost that stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is a goddamned disaster and she's the o-ring if you know what I'm saying. \nSTEVEN (faux) Oh... how long till we can get a new one? \nBIRKHEIM Which one is it? \nSTEVEN SL.   That the C you're driving? \nBIRKHEIM Yeah. \nSTEVEN Good car. \nBIRKHEIM Mmm hm. \nSTEVEN Good value. \nDING! The door opens. Steven exits, leaving a disgruntled Birkheim in his wake. \n123   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                         123 \nBirkheim pores over spreadsheets, taking notes and comparing numbers. CLOSE UPS on headings like \"INTEREST EARNED\" and \"DEPOSIT\" indicate he's looking for something \nHe continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious until something catches his eye. \nIn the margin of one of the pages is a DOODLING of a SMILEY-FACED PENIS. \nBirkheim doesn't quite know what to make of this... but it seems to stare at him mockingly. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages     5-23-08    76. \n124   INT. USAMM HALLWAY - 1996 - DAY                            124 \nSteven whistles happily and takes a draw off his coffee mug. As he passes an office, something catches his ear. \nBIRKHEIM (O.S.) I have some questions about these new accounts we've opened. \nSteven slows to a stop. \n125   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - CONTINUOUS                 125 \nBirkheim, his back to the door, is on the phone as Steven eavesdrops outside. \nBIRKHEIM Yeah... I was wondering if we could compare some numbers. I know you usually talk to our CFO but this is a delicate matter and I'd like keep it secret for now. \nSteven is worried. \n126   INT. USAMM CUBICLE - 1996 - DAY                            126 \nOPEN CLOSE on blank copies spitting out of a copier. Steven stands over the machine, his finger on the button as he keeps surveillance on Birkheim's office door. \nA SECRETARY arrives with a stack of papers. \nSECRETARY Hi Mister Ru-- \nSTEVEN I'M MAKING COPIES!!! \nShe leaves, terrified. \nFinally, Steven spots Birkheim leaving his office. \n127   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        127 \nSteven runs into Birkheim's office and scans the papers on his desk. Nothing. \nHe turns his attention to Birkheim's briefcase, but he can't get it open. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages    5-23-08     77. \nEventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it closely. He grabs a pencil and does the old detective trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written on the now missing page above. \nThe embossed text reads, \"837,502.12\" \nHe stares at it a moment. This number looks familiar. He grabs the phone and dials. An AUTOMATED VOICE answers. \nAUTOMATED TELLER Hello, you've reached the Automatic Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please enter your personal account number followed by the pound sign. \nSteven quickly enters some numbers. As he listens he flips through Birkheim's desktop calendar. \nAUTOMATED TELLER (CONT'D) Thank you. Your account balance is eight hundred-thirty seven thousand five hundred and two dollars and twelve cents. To repeat this- \nIt's the SAME NUMBER as on the pad. He hangs up. And turns his attention to the calendar. He spies an entry that reads, \"Harris County Police, 12:30\" \nHe leaps out of the chair and exits the office. \n128   INT. USAMM COPIER ROOM - 1996 - DAY                        128 \nSteven furiously shreds documents in the company's PAPER SHREDDER. Moments later the same SECRETARY enters the room with an armload of work- enraging Steven. \nSTEVEN CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SHREDDING!? \nTerrified, the woman runs away. \n129   EXT.

He stuffs it into his breast pocket and hops back into his SL. \n130   INT. DEBBIE'S HOME - NIGHT                                 130 \nShe exits. Steven tries to give Kemple some water. Kemple resists. \nSTEVEN Come on. You need to drink something. \nKemple meekly hands Steven his stainless steel ROLEX. \nKEMPLE I want you to have this because I'm gonna be leaving soon... \nSTEVEN Well that's not okay with me baby. You can't leave. I need you around here. You're the love of my life. \nKEMPLE You're sweet... but no, I'm not. \nSTEVEN Shhhh... \nKEMPLE I'm not. I've seen him. You haven't met him yet, but you will... \nSteven is perplexed. \nKEMPLE (CONT'D) You're gonna be so happy. And I know you don't think so, but you deserve to be happy... \nSTEVEN You're not thinking clearly baby. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"       Green Pages     5-23-08   87. \nKEMPLE Yes I am... And you have to promise me... When you find him, you're gonna treat him right... okay? \nSteven gives in gently. \nSTEVEN Okay, okay.     Now drink some water. \nKEMPLE Treat him right. \n150   INT. KEMPLE'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT - 1994 - CONTINUOUS         150 \nHelen is on the couch, watching the TV news as OJ Simpson is apprehended. It isn't long before a KNOCK on the door gets her attention.

Is-- \nHe's interrupted and proceeds to listen.       The look on his face says it all. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) Okay... mmm hmm... \nThrough the glass wall outside the phone room, we watch as Steven continues to absorb the bad news. \nHe hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the CACOPHONY of the prison masks any sound of his grief. \nBACK TO: \n154   I/E   NEW HOUSE, 1996 - HOUSTON POLICE CRUISER - DAY         154 \nOPEN CLOSE ON the stainless steel ROLEX. WE'RE BACK outside Steven and Phillip's house in a POLICE CRUISER. Steven stares at it, reflecting on his memory of Kemple. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I just don't like talking about some things. \nThe door opens and a HOUSTON COP hands him a black LEATHERETTE CASE. \nHOUSTON COP This what you wanted? \nSTEVEN Oh thanks. \nHOUSTON COP Diabetes huh? \nSTEVEN Yeah... \nThe cop gets in and they drive off. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages       5-23-08   89. \nSTEVEN Not long.

HARRIS COUNTY JAIL - 1996 - INFIRMARY - DAY           161 \nOPEN CLOSE on Steven's BLOODY FACE. A PRISON PHYSICIAN is examining it closely. We notice Steven is wearing WHITE SCRUBS (as opposed to the doctor who wears GREEN SCRUBS). \nPHYSICIAN That's a pretty big gash. Just stay still... \nSTEVEN It sure hurts... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08    92. \nAs Steven talks and the doctor looks, Steven stealthily plucks the doctor's ID BADGE and slips it in his pocket. \n162   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY                  162 \nSteven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls out a GREEN MAGIC MARKER.

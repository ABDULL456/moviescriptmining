KEY WEST COVE - 1996 - VARIOUS                         91 \nPALM TREES undulate on the constant breeze, inviting us to a beautifully solitary cove. Eventually Steven and Phillip's voices are heard. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) I've been meaning to ask you something. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Yeah? \nDIALOGUE CONTINUES OVER VARIOUS SHOTS of their romantic getaway to the Keys. In a SERIES of SHOTS we see where they've been and what they've been doing in the moments AFTER they've been there. \n- A Hammock blowing in the breeze. \n- A quaint COTTAGE nestled in the vegetation. \n- Half empty glasses of beer on the porch. \n- Dirty dishes in the cottage sink. The remains of a romantic meal on a table. The swaying palms are visible through the windows. \n- Footsteps in the sand. \n- Two beach chairs facing the surf. \n- Etc...   etc... \nPHILLIP (O.S.) That birthday cake you got me in the pen? Where'd you get those candles? \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Oh you know... just... people I knew. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Yeah, I know. But how? \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"       Green Pages   5-23-08   58. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a lot? \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Lance? He couldn't been more than 98 pounds. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Yeah, that's him. \nPHILLIP (O.S.) Oh he was such an asshole. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) Actually- I was in the yard once. Another guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw this picture of a little girl about Steffie's age. So I brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. That's the thing about having kids, you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... And the next day, bedtime, there they were. \n91A   EXT. PALM BEACH COVE - 1996 - DUSK - CONTINUOUS            91A \nThe dialogue continues on the beach as we finally see Steven and Phillip enjoying the sunset by the light of a small fire on the beach. \nPHILLIP How'd you know he'd do that? \nSTEVEN I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for you... and I found a way to do it. That's all. \nPhillip smiles, eyes never leaving the sunset. \nPHILLIP Just listenin' huh? \nSTEVEN That's it... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"    Green Pages      5-23-08   59. \nAnd as the sun sets on the shimmering water-- \n92   EXT.

He looks at PHOTOS on a nearby wall of a broad-shouldered all-American man dressed in a NASA jump suit performing various astronautical training tasks. \nHe picks up a small ASTRONAUT FIGURINE and examines it. \nLINDHOLM (O.S.) Sorry to keep you waiting Steven. \nSteven turns to find Dan Lindholm, the broad-shouldered man himself. \n", "test1_true": "STEVEN Were you a spaceman? \nLINDHOLM Yep. Never got out there though.

How do you crap up there? \nLINDHOLM Ass gasket. (draws on his coffee) Have a seat. \nSteven sits across the desk from Lindholm . \nLINDHOLM (CONT'D) With the popularity of HMO's in today's health care system, doctors need help managing their billing-- so they can focus on their patients. That's where USA Medical Management comes in. Hundreds of millions of dollars pass through our system from the HMO's to the doctors. It's a critical business. A powerful business... (beat) So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure what to think. Your level of education and your past experience would factor heavily into this decision and frankly... \nSteven deflates in expectation. \nLINDHOLM (CONT'D) ...you were head and shoulders above the rest. I mean, I could hardly believe it.

NEW HOUSTON APARTMENT KITCHEN - 1996 - DAY            97 \nSteven makes breakfast in his tightie-whities while talking on the phone. Phillip is in the background doing a crossword puzzle at the kitchen table. \nSTEVEN I could not speak more highly of Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter. We were damn lucky to have him at Prudential as long as we did. \nIn his own world, Phillip chimes in. \nPHILLIP Brando's wet debut? \nSteven covers the phone with his hand. \nSTEVEN On the Waterfront. \nBACK TO: \n98   INT. LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        98 \nDan continues to wax on about Steven. \nLINDHOLM Employee of the year two years running? Developing software with IBM? You're the kind of people we need here Steven. We want you as our Chief Financial Officer. So what do you say? I want your answer right now. C'mon Steven- let's light this candle. \nAs Steven pretends to mull-- \n99   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  99 \nAn uptight assistant (RHEBA) leads Steven into his fancy new office. \nRHEBA ...for example \"he's in a meeting\" sounds better than \"he's away from his desk\" at least I think so, but whatever you prefer. \nSTEVEN That's fine... sure. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"   Green Pages    5-23-08   62. \nShe leads him to his new desk which is stacked with folders, files, printouts and reams of data. \nRHEBA I pulled all the claims for the last two years as well as the statements, transfers and confirmations from the bank. Most of it's routine and I think you can get up to speed in a day or two. (then) Anything else I can do for you? \nSTEVEN Uh.... cup of coffee? \nRHEBA I'll do it today but I don't do that really. \nSteven nods and turns his attention to the sea of numbers before him. He looks concerned as he begins to leaf through. \n100   INT. USAMM BOARDROOM - 1996 - DAY                         100 \nSteven sits in a board meeting, surrounded by all of the company honchos. Dan Lindholm lords over the gathering at the head of the table while a suit (MARK) reads from a report to the group. \nMARK Crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with training wheels. \nEveryone LAUGHS, but no one quite as hard as Steven who desperately tries to fit in. \nLarry Birkheim, the CEO of USAMM sits beside Dan Lindholm. He chimes in. \nBIRKHEIM Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've only had the one quarter to play catch up but I tell you, we can't wait to get some insight here. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"      Green Pages    5-23-08    63. \nSTEVEN Sure. What about? \nBIRKHEIM Mark's projections. \nSTEVEN Mmm hm.   Sure. \nBIRKHEIM They seem kind of flat. \nSTEVEN Oh.   Okay. Ummm... \nSteven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while. \nSTEVEN (CONT'D) Well I did a lot of work here and uh...

We notice Steven is wearing WHITE SCRUBS (as opposed to the doctor who wears GREEN SCRUBS). \nPHYSICIAN That's a pretty big gash. Just stay still... \nSTEVEN It sure hurts... \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages   5-23-08    92. \nAs Steven talks and the doctor looks, Steven stealthily plucks the doctor's ID BADGE and slips it in his pocket. \n162   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY                  162 \nSteven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls out a GREEN MAGIC MARKER. He breaks it open and drips the ink into the water. \nAnd as the water turns GREEN, Steven removes his white scrubs and plunges them in the sink. \n163   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL GUARD STATION - 1996 - NIGHT       163 \nThe NIGHT GUARD watches his monitors when a rap on the glass gets his attention. He looks up to see Steven in newly (and badly) dyed GREEN SCRUBS, awaiting exit on the other side, holding the stolen ID BADGE against the glass. \nNIGHT GUARD `night Doc. \nHe pushes the buzzer and Steven pushes open the door. \n164   EXT. TEXAS MOTEL - 1996 - DAY                              164 \nSeven State and Local police cruisers sit in the parking lot, a shirtless Steven is removed from his motel room by a pair of OFFICERS. His skin is stained green but his expression is pure resolve. \n165   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM - 1996 - DAY                        165 \nOPEN CLOSE on a GAVEL striking. Steven stands before the judge flanked by his attorney and a bailiff. \nHOUSTON JUDGE Set bail at 900,000 dollars. \nATTORNEY Your honor... \nSTEVEN Nine hundred thousand!? It's a white collar charge. \nATTORNEY Your honor- \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages     5-23-08   93. \nThe judge begins FILLING OUT A FORM. He barely looks up at them. \nHOUSTON JUDGE Mister Russell is a flight risk. The bond is set. Nine hundred thousand. \nSTEVEN This is bullshit. (sotto to attorney) Set a reduction hearing. \nATTORNEY (off this) Your honor we'd like to set a reduction hearing. \nHOUSTON JUDGE That's your right, but I strongly advise you don't. \nThe judge finishes filling out the form and PLACES IT AT THE EDGE OF HIS BENCH for Steven to see. \nIt clearly reads his bail amount, his charge, everything. As the Attorney PRATTLES ON in the background, Steven just STARES AT THE FORM LONG AND HARD. \nHOUSTON JUDGE (CONT'D) Fine. You can have your hearing tomorrow. \nSteven interjects. \nSTEVEN (sotto to Lawyer) Next week. \nThe attorney looks at him quizzically and turns back to the judge. \nATTORNEY We'd like next week if that's okay. \nSTEVEN (sotto) On the thirteenth. \nATTORNEY Oh the thirteenth if possible. \nHOUSTON JUDGE Fine. Friday the thirteenth. Now go away. \"I Love You Phillip Morris\"     Green Pages     5-23-08   94. \n166   INT.

HOUSTON APT BEDROOM (TYLER) - 1996 - DAY              167 \nOPEN CLOSE on an opened envelope next to Steven's sketch and a letter. \nSTEVEN (V.O.) Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won't beat around the bush. I got into a spot of trouble here in Houston and find myself needing help. That's right, jail again. Anyway I was wondering if you could type up this thing for me on your computer just like I sketched out... \nAs Steven `reads' the letter we reveal a MAN hacking away on a computer nearby. As we move closer, we see that he's the MOUSTACHED MAN from the night of his car crash and he's not wearing pants. \n168   INT.

How can I love you? I don't even know who you are. And you know what's sad? I don't even think you know who you are. So how am I supposed to love something that don't even exist?

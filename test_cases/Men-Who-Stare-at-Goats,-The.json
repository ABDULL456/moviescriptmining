I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say... \nBOB Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile. \nGUS LACEY I can't really talk about Bill. \nBOB So what did you do in the army? \nGUS LACEY We were Psychic Spies mainly.

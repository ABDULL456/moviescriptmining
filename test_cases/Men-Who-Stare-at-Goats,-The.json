Yeah. \nBOB \n(LISTENING) ...what's, uh, happening, so...is that Dave? \nDEBORA (O.S.) Yeah. He says Hi.

I'm just working on this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build. The Journalists look bored. \nBOB (CONT'D) Yeah, I think they didn't want me going over because I'm not embedded. \nSECOND JOURNALIST Yeah, they don't like the unilats. The troops think the unilats'll stab `em in the back. When you're \nEMBEDDED you form a bond with the soldiers. You're like one of them. \nFIRST JOURNALIST (to Second \nJOURNALIST) You see action? \nSECOND JOURNALIST Went into Baghdad with Charlie Company, Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division... \nFIRST JOURNALIST The thunder run?

E.C.U of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are Crazy. \nBOB (CONT'D) So...when did this all start for you Gus? \nGUS LACEY It started when I was a kid. I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say... \nBOB Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile. \nGUS LACEY I can't really talk about Bill. \nBOB So what did you do in the army? \nGUS LACEY We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was our initial tasking but...once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work...

Gus' mother hovers in the background. \nGUS LACEY You ever seen a hamster do that before? \nBOB Well, I've never owned a hamster Gus, so I don't know what... \nGUS LACEY Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel. \nBOB Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so... \nGUS LACEY Good. Then they'll know how rare that is. \nBOB Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's...Oh, shit, he's down!

At this point I'd been staring at him for about three hours. The other hamster falls over. \nBOB Oh my God! You've dropped both hamsters! \nGUS LACEY No, the other one's just fallen over. They watch in silence. Then the hamsters get up and start eating. \nLYN CASSADY What's this? \nBOB What? Nothing. I was just doodling. Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE. \nBOB (CONT'D) What's the matter? \nLYN CASSADY \n(BEAT) Nothing. He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He hands it to Bob. Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report 92245. The New Earth Army Manual. Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and reads... \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED: (6)                                         21 \nBOB (V.O.) \n(READING) The U.S Army doesn't really have any serious alternative than to be Wonderful!

Bill senses someone staring at him and glances over to the Meditator next to him - Aviator shades, a baseball cap pulled low, empty cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The Meditator continues to stare intently at him. Then opens his coat to reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to his chest. Bill smiles nervously. An ARROW identifies the gunman as \nHUNTER S. THOMPSON. \nBOB (V.O.) Bill disappeared into the New Age Movement for six years. Bill feels Thompson staring at him. He smiles nervously. \n38   EXT. FORT BRAGG - MAIN GATES - THE PAST - DAY               38 \nIt's 1980. Bill walks down the road towards the entrance gates. His long hair is braided.

Does it direct your psychic powers or something? \nLYN CASSADY No. \nBOB What does it do? Lyn takes some BURGERS out of a cooler box and puts them into the cone. \nLYN CASSADY It cooks supper. He examines the stove approvingly. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Solar. Utilizing the power of the universe - no pollution, totally renewable. This is like New Earth Army technology.

Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them. \nBILL DJANGO We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen. Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams.

We must create Warrior Monks - men and women who can fall in love with everyone, sense plant auras, pass through walls, stop saying mindless cliches and see into the future. I want you to JOIN me in this vision. (Beat) Be ALL you can BE. Bill finishes. We TRACK along the OFFICERS' FACES - really not sure what to do or say. We reach one officer who looks like Lee Marvin. This is BRIGADIER GENERAL DEAN HOPGOOD. His eyes are shining with excitement. \nBOB (V.O.) Amongst Bill's audience that night was Brigadier General Dean Hopgood, from the Defense Intelligence Agency. For some time the General had been concerned about information he had been receiving about Soviet research into psychic powers. \n44   EXT.

It seems the story was a French hoax.

But now that they are doing psi research, we're going to have to do psi research, sir. We can't afford to have the Russians leading the field in the paranormal.

We hear the sound of an approaching ENGINE. The two men turn to see a WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK approaching. \nBOB (CONT'D) (scrambling to his \nFEET) Oh thank Christ. Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG IRAQI MAN looks out at them. \nBOB (CONT'D) Can you help us? We drove into a rock. Could you take us to a town or someplace? Smiling, the Iraqi gestures to the back of the pick-up. \nBOB (CONT'D) \n(RELAXING) Thank you! Thanks so much! He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the truck. Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks up his bag and follows Bob. \n56   EXT.

Phew! One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the contents. \nBOB (CONT'D) \n(OBLIVIOUS) Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh? The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's bag and inspects it. \nYOUNG IRAQI (to the other) Deep Purple. They laugh. \nBOB (laughing too) Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep Purple. Right. You guys like Deep Purple? You like rock or, or... He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN. The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it. \nBOB (CONT'D) (smile fading) Lyn? Is this...is this...? \nLYN CASSADY \n(WEARILY) Yeah. \n57   INT.

Lyn listens. \nBob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke Lyn. Lyn THROWS him - sailing through the air. He crashes down into the floor behind Lyn. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) See? I hardly moved. Physics wise there's not much going on. It's the psychic energy that's important. (Beat) You okay? \nBOB (in pain) Sharp...edges... \nLYN CASSADY (helping him up) You felt fear didn't you? Before hand? Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself. \nBOB Yes. \nLYN CASSADY Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you? Bob thinks about this. \nBOB I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual. \nLYN CASSADY \n(PLEASED) You know why? It wasn't you. It was me. I was inside your head.

Bill nods. \nBILL DJANGO (CONT'D) You've gotta free your feet before you can free your mind, Lyn. \nLYN CASSADY \n(EMBARRASSED) Not much of a dancer sir.

Lyn smiles shyly. \nBILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (to the room) Okay remember everyone, we don't officially exist as a unit so I'm afraid there's no coffee budget. Bring your own coffee. Oh, and no solid food for the first week. As the track continues we... \nCUT TO: \n65   OMITTED                                                   65 \nMONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS \n66   EXT.

INSIDE THE JEEP - DAY                                71 \nBill sits next to a nervous JEDI TRAINEE who is driving. The Jedi is BLINDFOLDED. \nBILL DJANGO \n(CALMLY) Okay, you're doing very well. Now feel the next bend... \n72   EXT. ON THE FIELD - DAY                                   72 \nScotty, Larry and Lyn sit focusing on a wall of SMALL WOODEN CUPBOARDS. Each cupboard has a letter and number printed on its door. \nBILL DJANGO \nA-9. The three men focus on the cupboard in question. \nSCOTTY It's...it's something cylindrical? I think it's a pencil? \nBILL DJANGO Okay. Larry? Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent. \nLARRY HOOPER This is Larry's Spirit Guide, Maud. I'm looking into the cupboard now and I'm seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug? \nBILL DJANGO Lyn? Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly, puzzled. \nLYN CASSADY It's a man on a chair. Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration from the watching Jedis. \n(CONTINUED) \n82   CONTINUED:                                                82 \nLARRY HOOPER \n(BLUSTERING) Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you said K, not A! Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn. \nBILL DJANGO Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding. Larry looks daggers at Lyn. \n83   EXT. FIELD - DAY - THE PAST                               83 \nLyn is walking calmly over the HOT COALS as the other Jedis watch, impressed. \n84   INT. GYM - DAY - THE PAST                                 84 \nBill is leading the Jedis in AIKIDO. \nBILL DJANGO Aikido is a vehicle for harmonizing ourselves with the Universe and the Way. Look upon these sessions as an opportunity to discover yourself and your training partner in a loving environment. \nLATER Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease. Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn. \nBILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (addressing the watching Jedi's) Notice how Lyn's circular motions turned Larry's aggression back upon him. Good work Lyn. A CHAIR flies through the frame, just missing Lyn's head. \nBILL DJANGO (CONT'D) (without looking at \nHIM) Larry, go outside, calm down. \n85   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 85 \nLyn lies on a couch drinking a beer, staring at a large BROWN ENVELOPE. Bill sits beside him with pad and paper. \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                             85 Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of the NATO GENERAL inside. \nBOB (V.O.) After a year's training, Lyn was given his first tasking. A senior Nato General had been kidnapped by Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill was unofficially asked if his unit would be able to help find him before it was too late. \nLYN CASSADY \n(CONCENTRATING) We're north of Verona. It's a little town. There's a lake nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across from the Cinema is a shop or, or...it's a cafe. He's in the apartment above. The town is called...it's something sweet. (Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce. Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking OFFICIAL watches from the next room. The Official looks impressed. \nBOB (V.O.) It's true that the unit never found out whether any of their remote viewings were accurate or not. Nevertheless from that moment on Lyn's reputation soared. \n86   INT. EX-MESS HALL - DAY                                   86 \nLyn stands in front of the other Jedis. \nBILL DJANGO Rank, medals...these things mean little to the Jedi. But growth in spirit, in wisdom, in psychic power, these things earn our respect. He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER. \nBILL DJANGO (CONT'D) Native Americans believed that when one received an Eagle feather, it was the mark of love, of gratitude and ultimate respect. Only true Human Beings may carry the Eagle feather. He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other Jedis applaud. Larry watches Lyn with HATE. \n87   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 87 \nLyn lies on the couch, drinking another beer, the Eagle Feather on a chain around his neck. A period song is playing in the room. \nBOB (V.O.) The word soon got out in the intelligence community that there was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who could find whatever you needed found. It was as if Lyn could fly anywhere in the world without leaving his room. We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND. LYN'S MIND P.O.V - We move towards the wall. \nBOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) As Bill Django said - the Force truly was strong with this one. As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the wall, into freedom... \n91   EXT. ARMY BASE - DAY - THE PAST                          91 \nOVER-HEAD SHOT - Ben lies on the ground staring up at us. We hear the sound of an approaching engine. \nBOB (V.O.) Another demonstration involved letting a recruit drive a jeep over him. This, in the end, was to be his undoing. Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at sixty miles an hour. We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP. \nBOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before his untimely death Ben caused quite a stir by advocating his controversial \"shock and awe\" knife attack method. \n92   INT. DOJO - DAY                                          92 \nBen leaps spastically in the air, spinning and shrieking, a knife held in one hand. \nBOB (V.O.) The approach was hailed by some knife aficionados as revolutionary but criticized by others who believed that the leaping and spinning might lead you to accidentally stab yourself. TRACKING ALONG BEN'S TRAINEE JEDIS - as they watch his display. \nBOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Lyn Cassady, however, became a firm convert to the style. We reach LYN who TURNS TO CAMERA. \nLYN CASSADY Ben, you're not forgotten. The knife you gave me lies next to my beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer. \n93   EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING                               93 \nWe UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on the sand. \nBOB (V.O.) Of course, Lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so I still think what he did was kinda...reckless. The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his ass. Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle. The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races away over the sand. The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him. Beat. Nobody moves. \n94   EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER                                 94 \nThe sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the sand and swerves onto the road. \nINSIDE THE TRUCK Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at the road behind them. \nBOB (pulling his head back in) They're not coming! We're okay! Oh God, we're gonna be okay! The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running desperately down the road ahead of us, his hands tied. \nLYN CASSADY There he is. He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the running man. \n(CONTINUED) \n94   CONTINUED:                                                94 \nTRACKING SHOT - pulling the IRAQI MAN, running for all he's worth. Lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind him. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) (yelling over the \nENGINE) Sir? You're okay! We're Americans. We're here to help you! Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him, but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS him, sending him flying. \nIN THE TRUCK \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Oh crap! \nBOB What happened? \nLYN CASSADY \n(BRAKING) I think I just ran him over. \n95   EXT. ROAD                                                 95 \nLyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road, his head bleeding. \nLYN CASSADY Sir? Are you okay? (Beat) Bob, give me a hand here will you? Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to carry him back towards the truck. They stop listening to an approaching rumble. \nBOB Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming! They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man dangling between them. Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck, the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation, aiming their M-16's at Lyn and Bob. ARMED MEN'S P.O.V - Lyn and Bob stare at them before dropping the bound Iraqi on the ground. Bob waves nervously. \n(CONTINUED) \n95   CONTINUED:                                                 95 \nWe hear the opening of a period song as we... \n96   INT. S.U.V - DAY                                           96 \nLAPTOP SCREEN We're rushing over a CGI DESERT, between the CGI rivers Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY rising from the sand. \nNIXON (O.S.) Then I say \"There it is. The Future!\" Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS, who are nodding along to the music playing in the car. Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the screen, moved. \nNIXON (CONT'D) We play this on these big screens at the conferences, you know? This trumpet music blasting out. Every time I see it, it gets me. He glances over at the Iraqi Man who is holding a dressing to the cut on his forehead, pale and shaken. \nTEXAN SECURITY MAN Bullshit. \nNIXON (cheerfully, out of the window) He did fill her up last time Gary. \n(CONTINUED) \n99    CONTINUED:                                                99 \nTEXAN SECURITY MAN With respect sir, bull-fucking- shit. I tanked her last time. \nTHIRD SECURITY MAN Every time! Can we get some sort of fucking system so we don't... We hear a sudden, sharp POPPING sound. Immediately the Men drop into CROUCHES, scanning the area. \nTEXAN SECURITY MAN \n(YELLING) Contact! We've got contact! He opens FIRE - IMMEDIATE CHAOS: people scream, duck down, some cars reverse desperately and collide with the cars behind. The other Security Men join in the shooting. \nTHIRD SECURITY MAN \n(SHOOTING) Where? Where's the shooter? \n100   ACROSS THE STREET                                        100 Another SUV - identical, but black, is passing, hemmed in by traffic. A stray BULLET from the gas-station pings off it's armor plating. Immediately it screeches to a halt and a NEW DETACHMENT OF SECURITY MEN roll from the car - same flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different color uniforms. \nNEW SECURITY MAN (into radio) Contact! We're under fire! The New Detachment open FIRE blindly in the general direction of the Station. \n101   GAS STATION                                              101 ...as bullets smack off the parked SUV. \nTHIRD SECURITY MAN Two o'clock! Two o'clock! All the Security Men turns and begin spraying bullets across the road. Car windshields and windows explode. \nINSIDE THE SUV A scowling Nixon has slid low in his seat. \nNIXON (muttering to \nHIMSELF) \n(MORE)                (CONTINUED) \n101   CONTINUED:                                                101 \nNIXON (CONT'D) Trying to help you fucking savages. Mahmud, Bob and Lyn are lying flat on the seats. \nMAHMUD DAASH My house is not far. We could walk from here. Bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the SUV. \nBOB Sounds good Muhammad. \nMAHMUD DAASH Mahmud. \n102   GAS STATION                                               102 As machine-gun fire from across the street strafes the station and Nixon's Security men return fire blindly. \nFIRST SECURITY MAN (yelling into Radio) Krom One this is Freedom Frontier. We are under attack. This is a FUBAR situation. Requesting Kiowa! Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them. \n103   EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER                               103 \nMahmud leads Bob and Lyn at a crouching run down the street, amongst the crowd of Iraqis fleeing the gunfire behind them. We hear the whup-whup of a helicopter as a Kiowa Warrior passes over head. Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter opens fire with a MISSILE... \n104   INT. MAHMUD'S HOUSE - EVENING                             104 \nTRACKING along a wall, past a crooked WEDDING PORTRAIT - a smiling Mahmud and WIFE, the glass broken... \nBOB (V.O.) Muhammad led us to his home which it turned out had been robbed in his absence. We TRACK past a row of BULLET HOLES in the wall, a section of smoke damaged wall paper. \n(CONTINUED) \n104   CONTINUED:                                                  104 \nBOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) And also accidentally set on fire by a US tank. Neighbors told him his wife had left, they weren't sure where she had gone. We reach Bob, Lyn and Mahmud eating at a low table. The windows behind them have been partially boarded up. Mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. Lyn looks tired, pale. They eat in awkward silence. \nLYN CASSADY What is this? \nMAHMUD DAASH Taameeyah. \nLYN CASSADY They're really good. Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs. \nBOB (V.O.) I understood he was going     through a lot, but considering we     had saved him from kidnappers     I still thought his welcome could     have been a little warmer. Lyn clears his throat. \nLYN CASSADY I'm very sorry for running you over, sir. Mahmud shrugs. \n110   INT. EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST            110 \nBill is introducing a young, fresh-faced recruit - LIEUTENANT NORM PENDLETON to the other Jedis. \nBOB (V.O.) The Jedis survived such minor scandals, protected, it was rumored, by a President who was a fan of both the Star Wars films and the paranormal himself. But then, one summer, a young, likeable Lieutenant called Norman Pendleton was recruited to the New Earth Army... Larry Hooper examines the new recruit with interest. \n111   EXT. FIELD - MORNING - THE PAST                            111 \nLarry and Norm are jogging together, deep in conversation. \nBOB (V.O.) Larry Hooper wasted no time befriending the newcomer. Desperate to compete with Lyn, Larry had been doing research into the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments which he believed could enhance his own psychic powers. \n112   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                  112 \nNorm sits on the couch, smiling innocently as Larry wheels an ELECTRONIC DEVICE on wheels over to the couch. \n(CONTINUED) \n112   CONTINUED:                                                112 \nBOB (V.O.) All he needed was a lab rat to try them out on, check if they were safe. Larry, making sure Norm can't see, is pouring a massive dose of LSD into a DRINK. He gives the glass a quick stir and turns, smiling, to Norm with it. \n113   INT. REMOTE VIEWING ROOM - DAY - LATER                    113 \nNorm lies tripping on the couch, rigid, wide-eyed, wearing headphones, connected to the electronic device, which emit disturbing electronic frequencies. Larry stands at the light switch, turning the red bulb overhead on and off, eagerly watching Norm's reaction - a modern day Frankenstein. \nBOB (V.O.) It turned out they weren't. \n114   CLOSE ON LARRY - LATER                                    114 ...cowering terrified under the couch, as the sound of GUNSHOTS fill the room. Norm's NAKED LEGS stride past him. \n115   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                     115 \nA NAKED AND DEMENTED NORM walks through the base, firing random shots at scattering soldiers with his Beretta. He finds Bill blocking his way. \nBILL DJANGO \n(GENTLY) Norm? Give me the gun, Norm. Norm starts to cry. Then he puts the gun into his mouth... \n116   INT. DISCIPLINARY HEARING - DAY                           116 \nNorm's father - MAJOR GENERAL PENDLETON - stares fixedly to where Bill and Brigadier General Hopgood sit in the hearing - his expression filled with icy rage. \nBOB (V.O.) Norm's father, who it turned out was pretty high up in the Pentagon, wanted blood. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n116   CONTINUED:                                               116 \nBOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Although the Jedis were pretty sure Larry was responsible, nothing could be proved and when he was called to the disciplinary hearing Larry made sure to smear Bill with everything he could... \n117   LARRY TALKING BEFORE THE HEARING                         117 ...looking every inch the neat, professional soldier. \nLARRY HOOPER Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds from the project's black budget to procure prostitutes... The OFFICIALS listening register shock and dismay. Bill stands up, outraged. \nBILL DJANGO That's a lie! \nLARRY HOOPER ...and also drugs for himself and his men. Bill jumps to his feet again. \nBILL DJANGO That's a...(catches himself) Well the hooker thing is definitely a lie! The OFFICIALS look at him as if he were SATAN himself. \nBOB (V.O.) Brigadier General Hopgood resigned and died some years later. Bill received a dishonorable discharge. \n118   OMITTED                                                  118 \n119   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                    119 \nBill, a broken man, is walking off the base. He reaches the gates and sees Lyn waiting for him. \nBILL DJANGO Continue the work, Lyn. The World needs the Jedis, now more than ever. Lyn can't speak. Bill hugs him and walks off, the gates closing after him. \n120   INT. FORT BRAGG - BARBERSHOP - DAY                       120 \nThe Jedis sit having their hair shaved with electric clippers. The Jedi's NEW COMMANDER - MAJOR HOLTZ - not a shred of New Age sympathy in his regulation heart - walks down the line, examining his men coldly. \nLYN CASSADY Level Two. Intuition. We were trained to make correct decisions. Somebody runs up to you and says \"There's a fork in the road. Do we turn left or do we turn right? And you go...(snapping his fingers) \"We go right!\" Bob stares at him. \nBOB Just...instant? \nLYN CASSADY Instant. (Snapping his fingers) Just like that. \nBOB \nWE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR HALF \nAN HOUR! HOW'S THAT \"INSTANT?\" Lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn. \nBOB (CONT'D) Oh, it's that way? \nLYN CASSADY \n(GRIMLY) Yes. It's this way. \nBOB Right. Now you know. \n127   EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS                            127 \nHIGH ANGLE \n(CONTINUED) \n127   CONTINUED:                                               127 \nBelow us the car drives off into the empty landscape, getting smaller and smaller. Then... BOOM. We see the flash of the explosion and the Renault is flipped like a toy car. A ribbon of black smoke rises into the blue sky. Silence. \n128   EXT. DESERT - LATER                                      128 \nBOB's P.O.V - We are stumbling forward towards a sand berm. We hear the sound of heavy breathing. \nBOB (O.S.) \n(CROAKING) What...what happened? Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black smoke rising. \nLYN CASSADY \nIED. \nBOB \n(BEAT) What? \nLYN CASSADY Improvised Explosive Device. \nBOB Oh Jesus. \nLYN CASSADY You're okay Bob. It's gonna be okay. \nBOB I can't believe this. Great fucking intuition Lyn. I can't...put me down. I can walk. Put me down. Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and lies there, wheezing. \nBOB (CONT'D) Oh, Jeez. Oh, Jeez. \nLYN CASSADY Alright, c'mon... He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as Lyn sets off again. \n(CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:                                               128 \nLyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his spectacles. Bob doesn't notice. \nBOB Where are we going? We should stay with the car so the army can find us. \nLYN CASSADY Fedayeen will find us first. \nBOB Well, I disagree. I totally disagree.(Beat) The Federal what? \nLYN CASSADY Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary. Fellas who probably laid the IED. They could be on their way now. Hold this Bob. He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised divining rods to scan the sand ahead. \nBOB What are you doing? \nLYN CASSADY Could be IED's or mines around here. I'm checking for disturbances in the telluric current. \nLYN CASSADY I don't have Crohns. \nBOB What's the matter with you? \nLYN CASSADY I'm dying. Bob stares at him, stunned. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) I've been murdered. \n130   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                      130 \nLyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them. Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with pain. \nLYN CASSADY It's gone Bob. I can't find him. I've lost my power. It's the curse. \nBOB What curse? \nLYN CASSADY (With profound \nSADNESS) They took this... beautiful thing we'd been building and they corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army. \n(CONTINUED) \n130   CONTINUED:                                                130 \nBOB Who destroyed it?

EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST           131 \nThe Jedis, now indistinguishable from other soldiers, stand white-washing over the COSMIC MURALS. Major Holtz stands watching. \nMAJOR HOLTZ Yoga is not the business of the US Army, ladies. Drumming circles are not the business of the Army. And love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army. So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves winning fucking wars! \nBOB (V.O.)

MAJOR HOLTZ'S OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                132 \nLarry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT held under one arm. \nBOB (V.O.) Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper as a patriotic whistle-blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious barrel of apples. \nLARRY HOOPER It's some scientific research I've done for possible offensive psi applications sir. (Beat) I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn't seem interested. Holtz snorts angrily. \n(CONTINUED) \n132   CONTINUED:                                                 132 \nMAJOR HOLTZ \n(MUTTERING) I bet he wasn't. He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause. He looks up slowly at Larry. \nMAJOR HOLTZ (CONT'D) We have men who can do this? \nLARRY HOOPER (a sly smile) I think I know one sir. Holtz ponders the report, tempted. \nMAJOR HOLTZ But we don't have the resources. \nLARRY HOOPER Well sir...there is goat lab? \n133   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                   133 \nThe building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred GOATS stare silently at us. \nBOB (V.O.) Goat Lab was originally created as a clandestine laboratory to provide in-the-field surgical training for Special Forces soldiers. We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their legs in PLASTER. \nBOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) The goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully. Goat lab actually used to be called Dog Lab... \n134   SMALL DOG STARING AT US                                    134 ...with big, brown eyes. \nBOB (V.O.) But it turned out most soldiers didn't feel good shooting dogs in the leg... A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in hand. \n135   EXT. NEVADA TEST SITE - DAY - THE PAST                 135 \n(SOLEMNLY) The goat is dead.

DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                        144 \nBob stares at Lyn aghast. \nBOB Collateral damage? \nLYN CASSADY (eyes glistening) Collateral damage. (Beat) That was it. I'd used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all. Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck. Every night I'd dream of that goat in its little bib, it's mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out... Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness. \n(CONTINUED) \n144   CONTINUED:                                                  144 \nBOB The silence of the goats. Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured by his solemn expression. \nLYN CASSADY I finished my tour and I quit. I walked out of the unit and I never went back. \n145   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                       145 \nLyn, wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase, is walking off the base. He reaches the gates and turns for one last look at the place that has been his home. \nBOB (V.O.) But before he could leave Larry arranged one last parting gift. Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper standing in front of him, looking WIRED. \nLYN CASSADY What do you wan...? Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little, holding his head. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) What the hell? Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh and is running madly back into the base. Lyn stares after him, stunned. \nLYN CASSADY (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was the Dim Mak. \n146   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - THE PRESENT                           146 \nBob looks at Lyn, puzzled. \nBOB The Dim Mak? \nLYN CASSADY The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm. The Death Touch. It's like this legendary, martial arts move. It was forbidden in the New Earth Army. Larry had got it from a mail- order book. \n(CONTINUED) \n146   CONTINUED:                                                 146 \nBOB What does the Death Touch do? \nLYN CASSADY (Beat, patiently) It kills you Bob. With one touch. \nBOB Jesus. \nLYN CASSADY There's a story that Wong Wifu, great Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded. That was it. He'd given him the death touch and Wong died. \nBOB Then and there? \nLYN CASSADY No. Eighteen years later. That's the weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it's going to take effect. He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him as he falls asleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n147   EXT. DESERT - MORNING                                      147 \nThe same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound - a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him, the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been lying at the foot of. The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the berm and disappears from sight. Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying, staring down at something. CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned. \n148   EXT. BERM - DAY                                          148 \nBob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm, following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one foot in front of the other. At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us. \n149   EXT. WATER-HOLE - DAY                                    149 \nBob and Lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole. Bob manages to cup some water into Lyn's mouth and then his own. He rolls onto his back, stares up at the burning sky. We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A HELICOPTER is approaching... \n159   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - NIGHT                         159 \nLyn lies sleeping. Larry sits at the foot of his bed, smoking a cigar. He watches Lyn for a moment, then COUGHS deliberately. Nothing. He repeats the cough - louder. Lyn wakes. \nLARRY HOOPER Oh. Didn't mean to wake you. The two men stare at each other. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Heard you weren't feeling well? \nLYN CASSADY \n(BEAT) Just tired. \nLARRY HOOPER How'd you find us? \nLYN CASSADY I told you. I remote viewed you. \nLARRY HOOPER \n(SMILING) Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he? \nLYN CASSADY No. \nLARRY HOOPER Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we were coming over here, asked him if he wanted some work. \nLYN CASSADY I haven't seen Scotty. \nLARRY HOOPER That's funny, because he told me he'd run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here. (Beat) Isn't that why you came, really, Lyn? You want back in, don't you? Lyn stares at him, disturbed, afraid this might be true. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) It can happen. You've only got to say the word. Could be the new Golden Age for Psi research. \n(MORE)                (CONTINUED) \n159   CONTINUED:                                                 159 \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) You, me and Bill, back together again. Just like the old days. Larry closes his eyes, trying to remember something. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Mother Earth, my life support system. As a soldier I must drink your blue water, live inside your red clay and eat your green skin. Lyn listens, moved despite himself. \n160   EXT.

The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier having to hang on. The Stryker roars off again, heading straight for the GATES of the base. \nSOLDIER (calling down into the vehicle) You're going to hit the gates. You're going to hit the gates. The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter fence and out into the desert. \nSOLDIER (CONT'D) \n(CALMLY) It's okay. You missed them. \n169   INT.

Lyn and Bill are holding BABY GOATS in their ARMS. A tripping Bob is holding bunches of flowers - it's as close as they can get to the illustration from the New Earth Army Manual. Lyn holds up a hand to stop the procession. Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his face blank. Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly, Larry starts to cry. \nLYN CASSADY \n(SOFTLY) Give me the gun Larry. Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses. Scratches his head. \nLARRY HOOPER Wow. I'm hungry. He wanders off. \nARMY DJ (O.S.) (Over loudspeaker, \nLAUGHING) Hey! More music! (muffled) Get off, will ya?

Nothing happens, no one shoots them. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) \n(WAVING) That's it. Keep going. Ma'assalama. The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand. Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top. \n175   EXT.

The objective of the project was to create Super Soldiers. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED: (2)                                           21 \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Soldiers with Super Powers. We were the first generation of the New Earth Army. \nBOB \n(BEAT) You've got super powers? \nLYN CASSADY That's correct. \nBOB Hold on, let me...let me just... He takes out his NOTEBOOK, fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode. \nBOB (CONT'D) Okay, so, so you're saying you were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey? \nLYN CASSADY We prefer the term Remote Viewer. \nBOB How does that work? \nLYN CASSADY Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse... \nBOB What about you? Lyn thinks about it. \nLYN CASSADY Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music. \nBOB Yeah? (Beat) Like who? \n", "test2_true": "BOB \n(WRITING) What other powers did you practise? \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED: (3)                                         21 \nLYN CASSADY Invisibility. \nBOB (Taken aback) Invisibility? \nLYN CASSADY Yup. That was Level Three. \nBOB Actual invisibility? \nLYN CASSADY Well...yeah, that was the goal. But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility. Bob tries to follow this. \nBOB Like camouflage? \nLYN CASSADY It's not like camouflage. We also practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through you. It's starts with a breathing exercise... Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) Then you think black. That's the nothingness. Bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird panting. \nBOB I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I don't know what to make of this. I don't know what to say. This is amazing stuff. (Beat) How would you...I wanna...could I write a story about this? Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the bottle, suddenly taciturn. \nLYN CASSADY Not going to happen. \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED: (4)                                           21 \nBOB No, but see, I've been looking for a story Lyn. I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this...this is even better and \nI... \nLYN CASSADY Not going to happen. \nBOB All I'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and... \nLYN CASSADY I'm shipping out tomorrow. \nBOB You're going home? \nLYN CASSADY Going to Iraq. There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim. Bob's face falls. \nBOB Oh. They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the whiskey. He takes a swig, his mind whirring... \nBOB (CONT'D) \n(SUDDENLY) I could come. \nLYN CASSADY \n(BEAT) What? \nBOB I could come with you, maybe, and... \nLYN CASSADY Bob, I don't want to be a story, okay? I don't need the attention and... \nBOB No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and... \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED: (5)                                         21 \nLYN CASSADY It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A war. I can't be looking out for you. Bob flushes with annoyance. \nBOB Well you know, you don't... I look after myself. Okay? I look after...And I've been in some pretty hairy situations before. I'm not, you know...I'm a journalist, Lyn. You understand? He slaps his notebook for emphasis. \nBOB (CONT'D) A journalist. I go where the story is. \nBOB (V.O.)(CONT'D) I was an American. I was Resolute. I wanted adversity to reveal my character to the world. And to my wife. And to that one-armed cunt Dave. Lyn is staring at Bob's notebook. He takes it from Bob and examines Bob's DRAWINGS OF EYES. \n", "test2_id": 307, "test3_input": "LARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Oh, that's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet they dropped on us. \nBOB \n(READING) \"American Soldier - your wives are back home having sex with Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds.\" \nLARRY HOOPER Yeah, hadn't exactly done their homework there. Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly at the racks of CD's. Larry notices. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) How'd you find us, Lyn? \nLYN CASSADY I remote viewed you. Larry smiles a little mockingly. \nBOB If this is Psyops what are you doing here? \nLARRY HOOPER I said primarily Psyops. This is a restricted area, you understand? Everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison. Bob nods a little nervously. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) There are individuals in the current administration who are looking for...creative solutions for the War on Terror. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED: (2)                                          154 \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) They're far more open minded then their predecessors, and they've out-sourced experimental research to my company. He indicates the PSIC name badge he's wearing. \nBOB \"Sick?\" \nLARRY HOOPER It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic Systems International Corp. Turns out certain people had heard about the New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then. They got in touch with me, I got in touch with Bill. \nLYN CASSADY (To Bill) You're working for him? Bill frowns at the CDs, not seeming to hear. \nLARRY HOOPER Bill's been looking into subliminal messaging. (Selecting a disc) This is one we've designed to play to our own troops before combat. He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a burst of a period song. \nBOB There's a subliminal message in this? \nLARRY HOOPER (reading the CD) This is...\"Don't get drunk before firing heavy machine guns.\" We've got all sort of products in development.(To Worker) Tell them one of our new ideas. \nPSIC WORKER Air bag mine? \nLARRY HOOPER Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine, catapults the fucker up into air. (To another) Gimme another one. \n2ND PSIC WORKER Blast target with pheromones and then release Attack Bees. \n(CONTINUED) \n154   CONTINUED: (3)                                           154 \nLARRY HOOPER Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces of Nature! Another. \n1ST PSIC WORKER Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy corpses and... \nLARRY HOOPER We're not doing that anymore! (Throwing an eraser at the worker) Idiot! He turns back to Lyn. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) The point is we've got a budget, we've got supporters. I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army. Only this time without the hippy crap. Bill stands up and starts walking a little unsteadily towards the door. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) You okay Bill? \nBILL DJANGO (Without turning) Gonna get some ice-cream. Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to Lyn. \nLARRY HOOPER You get the odd flash of what he used to be but... he's pretty burnt out with the booze. Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices some candy on a desk. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) Ooo, Twizzlers. He picks it up and starts to eat it. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) (To Lyn) You want one? Lyn shakes his head, trying not to show the emotions he is feeling. \nLARRY HOOPER (CONT'D) (Watching him) God, I love these things... \n155   INT. BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY                               155 \nBob helps Lyn down the corridor. Lyn suddenly stops, listening. There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from somewhere nearby. \n156   INT. BASE - CELL CORRIDOR - DAY                          156 \nLyn walks down the corridor, Bob following. At the end of the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE. The loud music is coming from there. We can hear now that it is an annoying children's show song or heavy metal. We TRACK towards the door... Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and peers in. \n", "test3_true": "SONG (O.S.) (Lyrics from chosen song.) The prisoner looks terrified, and despite the whimsical music the whole scene is horribly sinister. Lyn steps away from the spy-hole. \nBOB \n(ANXIOUSLY) What? What is it? \nLYN CASSADY It's the Dark Side. \n157   INT. ARMY BASE - TENT - DAY                              157 \nLyn sits on his bed, as low as we've ever seen him. Bob watches him, concerned. \nBOB What are you going to do? Lyn stares at the wall. \nBOB (CONT'D) Lyn? What are you going to do? \nLYN CASSADY It's too late...I'm dying, Bob. \n(CONTINUED) \n157   CONTINUED:                                               157 \nBOB Oh, you're not dying! I don't believe you can kill someone with a mail order Dim Sum. You can't... \nLYN CASSADY Dim Mak. \nBOB Whatever. I don't believe you can just... \nLYN CASSADY It's cancer. \nBOB ...just tap someone and ...it...(Beat) What? \nLYN CASSADY I mean, I know it was caused by the Dim Mak. But...it's...you know...it's cancer. That's what the doctors say. Different ways of looking at...different names for a reality or, or uh... He lapses into silence. Bob is stunned. Lyn lies down. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) I shouldn't have come Bob. Shouldn't have come. Lyn pulls the EAGLE FEATHER from the chain around his neck. \nLYN CASSADY (CONT'D) ...Give this back to Bill...I don't deserve it. Bob stares at him. \n158   EXT. BASE - DAY                                          158 \nBill Django sits cross-legged in the sand, drinking from a bottle of whiskey, watching the sun set. Bob marches up to him, stands awkward but determined. \nBOB I think you should go and see Lyn, sir. (Beat) he needs you. Bill doesn't answer. \n(CONTINUED) \n158   CONTINUED:                                                158 \nBOB (CONT'D) The man crossed a desert to see you again. Bill takes a long drink, stares at the sky. Bob watches him with mounting frustration. \nBOB (CONT'D) You know, he told me all these stories about Bill Django, and I was pretty excited to meet you, but I've gotta tell you...you're one big disappointment. Bill doesn't react. Bob starts to walk away then turns back, and throws the FEATHER down at Bill's feet. \nBOB (CONT'D) He told me to give you that back. I don't know why. Its supposed to be a mark of honour isn't it? I don't see how you deserve that. Beat. Bill turns to look at Bob for the first time. He takes a long drink. \nBILL DJANGO \n(BEAT) It isn't real. \nBOB What isn't? \nBILL DJANGO The feather. Twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather. This one's off a turkey. You just die the tip black. (Beat) Don't tell Lyn. Bill stares at the feather. \nBILL DJANGO (CONT'D) None of it was real. \nBOB \n(ANGRILY) That isn't true. That isn't true. He looks around for inspiration - notices a LONE CLOUD floating in the sky. Bob places his fingers on his temples and STARES at the cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful... Bill notices and watches, curious. Slowly, the cloud fades and DISAPPEARS. \n(CONTINUED) \n158   CONTINUED: (2)                                        158 \nBob can't believe it.

Cragie is neat as a pin, humble, cooperative to a fault. 
PARTIDA You have heard her tell this panel that she saw you lay the gun in her grandson's hand. 
He feigns compassion. 
CRAGIE I'm not saying the woman would make this up. But there's no way she could have seen anything from where she was standing in a hallway that dark. (pause) Like you said, she's the boy's grandmother. 
PARTIDA If it was dark, Officer, how were you sure Vega had a gun? 
CRAGIE We were lucky. There was a glint of light, a reflection comin off the barrel of the weapon. 
EXT. EDDIE'S ALLEY - DAY 
A carload of Comachos, including Luis, cruises down the street and parks in the alley next to Eddie's building. 
INT. OPS HALL - DAY 
The hearing is in recess and the hall is filled with smokers and coffee drinkers. 
Eddie is getting a BUSY SIGNAL on the pay phone. 
Donato approaches. 
DONATO You think he'll get a pass? 
EDDIE You heard it all. What do you think? 
DONATO If the hearing was over I'd have to put my money on the old lady. (smiles) But Kosalas's next. My bet's on Cragie. 
EDDIE The kid may surprise you. 
Eddie dials the number again. Still a busy signal. 
INT. PIRELLI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Pirelli has Eddie's answering machine plugged in, and is tinkering with the insides. 
Diana comes into the living room, toweling her wet hair, just out of the shower, but in her street clothes. 
INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY 
Kosalas is on the witness stand. 
PARTIDA And right after you heard Officer Cragie's gun discharge, what did you do then? 
KOSALAS I immediately advanced down the hall. 
PARTIDA And what did you see? 
KOSALAS The deceased, Vega, lying on the floor. Officer Cragie was checking his vital signs. 
PARTIDA What happened then? 
KOSALAS We recovered a .25 calibre automatic from the teenager's right hand. 
PARTIDA Did you see that weapon in Vega's hand before Officer Cragie fired? 
KOSALAS Yes, sir. 
Cragie leans back. 
A ripple is felt in the crowd. The reaction of the boy's relatives, delayed by translation, is one of outrage. 
PARTIDA No more questions. 
As Kosalas steps down he keeps his eyes on the floor ahead of him avoiding eye contact.

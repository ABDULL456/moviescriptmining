ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT CREATIVE BULLPEN 
The secretary in the f.g. is now reading Anna Karenina. 
The silhouetted ad men, frustrated and hoarse, are still at it. 
AD MAN #1 (O.S.) The Hoopsucker! 
AD MAN #2 (O.S.) The Hudswinger! 
AD MAN #1 (O.S.) The Hoop-dee-doo! 
AD MAN #2 (O.S.) The Hudsucker Hoop! 
The third ad man, slouched motionless at the typewriter up until now, finally raises his head. 
AD MAN #3 (O.S.) Fellas. Fellas! 
AD MAN #1 (O.S.) Ya got somethin'? 
AD MAN #2 (O.S.) Ya got somethin'?! 
AD MAN #3 (O.S.) Fellas! I got somethin'!

Printed at the top: Hudsucker Industries Proudly Presents 
PAN DOWN to reveal: THE HULA HOOP 
PAN DOWN to reveal: 
An artist's hand working in fast motion to render the hula hoop logo: A grinning, healthy 1950s boy with a spray of freckles, one fist thrown forward, the other behind, as if doing an athletic frug, a hula hoop spinning with action lines around his waist. 
In seconds the artist has completed the logo and now, also in fast motion, he writes the slogan on either side of the boy: "You know... For Kids!" 
As the page is ripped off the art pad:

As it begins to spit hula hoops in massive numbers. 
The hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest, hanging. 
A bale of hula hoops is loaded into a Hudsucker truck to complete its load. The truck door is slammed shut.

is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just opening for the day. 
In the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama -- "You know... for Kids!" 
Reflected in the display window we see crowds of people scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped glumly in his hands.

Norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits hunched over the ticker-tape machine, studying the emerging tape. Amy finally looks up at Norville and sadly shakes her head.

Crowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands idly in his doorway, smoking a cigarette. 
We TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of $1.79 has been crossed out. Underneath it, inked in: "Reduced:

ALLEY BEHIND SHOP 
where garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection: 
Hands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of hoops towards the trash heap. One errant hoop rolls towards the mouth of the alley. 
The mouth of the alley. The escaped hula hoop emerges and starts rolling down the street. 
HULA HOOP 
It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid it. 
It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement. 
The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING.

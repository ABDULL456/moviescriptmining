VICK Hey, Steve, you don't happen to know where we were heading when we left here last night, do you? 
STEVE Well, the Double Camelot Package comes with a five course wedding feast, so I assume you went there. 
STU Great -- where was the feast? 
STEVE Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall. 
CUT TO: 
ALAN (V.O.) I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?! 
INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER 
The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot. Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan seethes up front. 
VICK Your negativity is like a little black cloud over our car, Alan. You've got to let go of this. 
ALAN Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The fact that I married a complete stranger last night? Or that my girlfriend's about to leave me? Or that I'm broke? Which one?! 
VICK You're broke? I thought you were 
LOADED-- 
ALAN I know you think it's like terminally uncool to be in a committed relationship, Vick, but I actually love Becky, okay? 
(SINCERE) I-I honestly don't know what I'd do without her...I really don't... Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short. 
VICK Alan. Honey. Have you considered, even for a second, that maybe the things we do when we're drunk are what we secretly want to do? 
ALAN (dripping with sarcasm) Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, Vick, I've always secretly wanted to marry a bottle blonde with big fake melon tits named Chastity! 
STU I ain't mad atcha, dude... 
VICK Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't have the balls to leave Becky, and this is your way of getting her to leave you. 
ALAN I was going to propose to her this weekend, you jackass! 
VICK All the more reason to freak out. Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car. 
VICK (CONT'D) I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but you've always had a major pole up your ass. Maybe last night was your inner cool person trying to get out- 
ALAN I swear to God, Vick, if you say one more word to me, I will destroy you. 
STU Guys, come on, let's not use our angry words-- 
SMASH! A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump! Vick slams on the brakes! 
VICK What the--?! They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on either side of the car. And they look pissed. 
KALOLO FANALUA Get out of the car, Vick. Stu and Alan recoil in terror. 
STU Who are these guys?! 
VICK Stu, please. (to Kalolo Fanalua) I think there's been some sort of mistake, Mister...? 
KALOLO FANALUA I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get The Hell Outta The Car, and this is my associate, Mr. Smash You In The Teeth If You Say Another Word. 
VICK (beat, to Alan) Those so aren't their real names. 
ALAN Vick, don't be a dick--! 
VICK Alan? Relax. These men aren't going to hurt us. They're from Hawaii. 
SMASH! SMASH! SMASH! Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!

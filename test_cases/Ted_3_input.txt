Teenage John and Ted lean against a car. Teenage John looks indifferent and a bit jaded now. 
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY (PHOTO) 
John's high school graduation. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ANGLE ON A TV - The nightly news is in progress. A news anchor addresses the camera. A graphic next to her reads "FORMER CELEBRITY BUSTED AT AIRPORT", with an unflattering photo of Ted. 
INT. AIRPORT - DAY (VIDEO) 
We see Ted getting hauled away by security. A caption below reads "Ted caught with mushrooms at airport security". He's putting up a bit of a fight, and gives the "finger" to the camera (the finger is pixilated). 
INT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT (EXISTING FOOTAGE) 
We see 20 year-old John sitting on his bed, laughing. Ted sits by his side, also laughing at the incident.

ANGLE ON A FACEBOOK PAGE FOR JOHN BENNETT: PAN DOWN to the status indicator. It reads, "In a Relationship With Lori Collins." An arrow clicks on her name, going to her page. On her wall, it reads "Lori has added 3 new photos in the album Mobile Uploads". 
EXT. OUTDOOR FAIR - DAY (PHOTO) 
Lori and John smile as Lori holds a big stuffed bear that John has won for her at a booth. Ted stands nearby, arms crossed, with a deep, disapproving scowl.

In the photo, presumably taken by John, Lori stands laughing as Ted stands behind her (standing on something) covering her eyes with his paws.

John and Lori are set for a trail ride. They are both on horses, wearing helmets. WIDEN TO REVEAL Ted, who also wears a helmet, but rides a smiling golden retriever. 
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - NIGHT (EXISTING FOOTAGE) 
John, Lori, and Ted play miniature golf. Lori putts the ball, which rolls to the lip of the cup. She reacts, disappointed. Ted makes a graceful leg sweep, pushing the ball into the cup "accidentally". Lori smiles. John smiles back at her. Ted winks. 
EXT. BASEBALL GAME - DAY (EXISTING FOOTAGE) (Insert "Jeter sucks" bit) 
EXT. LAKE - DAY (EXISTING PHOTO) 
EXT. ICE CREAM SHOP - DAY 
John, Lori and Ted sit outside at a table, each holding an ice cream cone. They stare deadpan at the camera, each with a dab of ice cream on their noses, and a dab of ice cream on their upper lips. 
EXT./ESTAB. - JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - DAY John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall. He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there like an idiot. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO) 
John, Lori, and Ted sit on the couch. All three sit with their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of Jorian Hill Syrah to camera in identical poses, the wine bottle on the table in front of them. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PHOTO) 
We see a photo Ted has taken of himself. In the background are John and Lori, playing Scrabble. Ted is in the foreground, smiling at the camera as he holds up his letters. He has spelled out the word "DOUCHE", with an extra B and G to spare. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
John, Ted, and Lori watch a horror movie on the couch.

EXT./ ESTAB. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S APARTMENT - SAME 
CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's been around for three decades. He and John, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too- worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted passes the bong to John. 
TED All I'm sayin' is Boston women are are, on the whole, a paler, uglier sort than women from the elsewheres of life. 
JOHN That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot. 
TED Lori's from Pennsylvania, not a Boston girl. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN They're not that bad. 
John takes a hit from the bong over Ted's next line.

INT. LODGE - DAY 
Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and empty. He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. He starts to take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE BACK ROOM. The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET. 
Glass freezes... he isn't alone. He rises... grabs a splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway... raises the post to swing... 
...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. The dog takes off around a crumbled wall. Glass follows it. 
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms outstretched in front of her in weak defense. And her eyes are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. She CRIES OUT A CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this stranger to kill her. 
Glass stands frozen... confused. He tries to speak, but his throat still won't let him. He crouches down in front of the old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away. He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and bones... she's obviously dying. 
He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes it into the squaw's hand. She immediately jerks it to her mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH... she can't eat. 
Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY 
Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. The dog scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water. 
INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY 
The pot boils over burning logs. Glass dips a cup in, pulling out a warm broth. He carries it to the squaw, still sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in it for her. She gulps the liquid back. 
Glass goes back to refill the cup. The old woman MUMBLES SOMETHING we can't understand... over and over, as Glass brings the cup back to her. He tries to ease it into her hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up Glass' arm to his face... patting it... MUMBLING THOSE SAME WORDS... thanking Glass. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING 
Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. The puppy trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on as Glass pulls him across the dirt. 
INT. LODGE - EVENING 
Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes frozen open in a lifeless stare. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at the edge of the village. The squaw lies atop the pyre, covered in the blankets he gathered for her. Glass stands beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand. The puppy rests at his feet. 
EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the pyre... the flames rise into the night. 
EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames spread... engulf the woman. 
ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS... 
...floating into the night. Beyond the sparks, we see something else... THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE VILLAGE... FAST. 
And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so he just stands there. But the dog's seen enough... darts away. 
Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass knows it. 
The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass. The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong, points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass. 
Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat. Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. The other two warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same... close in on Glass. 
Glass stands firm. Spotted Horse says something else to him. Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from his sides... no weapons. Spotted Horse studies Glass hard... reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost testing to see if the color comes off. 
One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says something to the others. Spotted Horse and the other warrior join him, each touching Glass' hair. 
Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw hanging from it. He examines the enormous claw, then nods to Glass' stitching and scars. 
SPOTTED HORSE Griz-lee. 
Glass hears the familiar word... nods. Three Feathers pulls a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to Spotted Horse. 
Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. Glass is confused... holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... Glass GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a MASS OF WHITE WORMS... MAGGOTS... COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON GLASS' BACK. 
The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously never seen anything like this. Glass sees their reaction... throws a nervous glance... what?

A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the 13-year-old. 
IVY What the fuck I tell you about being here? 
Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked. 
13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (O.S.) No, wait... 
IVY (O.S.) Too fuckin' late. 
POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone on the street but Hull has hit the ground. 
IVY (enjoying it, shouting) Get down, motherfuckers! 
Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered around... 
THE 13-YEAR-OLD 
lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) watch with a variety of emotions. 
CROWD Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?... Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong fuckin' place... That poor boy... Get his beeper... 
Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow. 
EDDIE (sadly) He done done, ain't he? 
EXT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT 
TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER 
A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters. 
INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT 
A racial mix. Hull takes a seat at the bar. Stuffed birds line the lintel above the bottles. A female BARTENDER (long red nails) greets him familiarly. 
BARTENDER How's it going, John? 
HULL I'm in there. 
Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long red straw. (NOTE: He never touches the drink.) Hull's appearance has continued to change. His clothes have become flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee. 
Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his toasts. 
EDDIE (to himself) "Where's the Queen," said the King. "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is that bastard still in town?... Fuck the Queen," said the King, and ten thousand knights straaaained at their utmost... (to the bartender) Pina colada times two and a white wine. 
He goes on muttering under his breath, tapping his foot like any crankhead. He notices Hull, greets him as someone he can't place but knows he's seen around. 
EDDIE (continuing) How you doin', Dudley... 
Tries to remember name. 
HULL John. 
EDDIE John, man, right... 
Clasp hands. Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to... 
A TABLE 
where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS (30s, slick, powerful) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN (mid-20s, good- looking). She gets the wine. 
Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there. 
INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
(NOTE: Hull invariably meets Carver in this anonymous room, distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the city. This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out. And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.) 
More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 photographs. Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid. 
HULL Eddie something... a motormouth... he supplies the street dealers... buys from him... (reads name on back of photo) David Elias... who apparently buys from a guy named Barbolla or something. But I haven't seen him. 
Carver produces a photo of a handsome Latin in his 50s, pins it on the board above Elias. 
CARVER Barbosa, Felix.

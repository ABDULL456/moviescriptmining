Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the glistening apparitions closing in.  Hicks' torch feathers out.  Empty.  Bracing his back he kicks hard at the cherry-hot metal.  It bends aside. 
Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole, lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out. Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez' flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL. Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her. 
She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM! Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away. 
Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her, grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him, barely conscious. 
VASQUEZ (hoarse whisper) You always were an asshole, Gorman. 
She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE it as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake... something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip. He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the creatures are upon them. 
INT. SERVICE WAY                                        161 
RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run. The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind them and they stumble with the shock wave.  Newt breaks out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep up. 
NEWT This way.  Come on, we're almost there! 
RIPLEY Newt, wait! 
The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around obstacles.  If it wasn't clear before it's clear now that we are on her turf, and she's the ace.  Running on and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls a directionless blur.  Newt never hesitates. 
They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which runs upward at a steep 45 degrees. 
NEWT Here!  Go up. 
INT. CHUTE                                              162 
Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the top...an exterior vent hood.  The sound of wind booms down from above.  Like blowing across a bottle top vastly amplified. 
Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow side ribs in the shaft.  She looks down.  The chute descends far into the depths, lost in shadow.  She starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks, just emerging from the side duct. 
NEWT Just up there -- 
Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot.  She slides...catches herself with one hand.  Ripley reaches for her, dropping her light.  The hand-light goes skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend, and disappears. 
Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's. They miss, inches apart. 
NEWT Riiiiipppleee -- 
She slips.  Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket. AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT.  With an echoing scream Newt plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness. 
MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like a bobsled ride.  THe shaft pitches left.  Newt bounces, sliding halfway up the wall.  The chute forks ahead. Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a steeper angle into the depths.  Just disappearing down the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light. 
Ripley looks Hicks in the eye.  And kicks free...sliding down the chute after Newt.  Ripley slams her feet into the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent. Ripley reaches the "V."  Sees the glow of the light in the left fork.  She goes left. 
RIPLEY Newt! 
She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it has no direction. 
NEWT (o.s.) Mommy...where are you? 
Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL.  The light is lying there, but no Newt.  The echoing wail comes again. 
NEWT (o.s.) Moooommeeee... 
Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering.  Newt's call comes again.  Fainter?  She can't tell.  She spins in a growing panic, starts the other way. 
RIPLEY (to her headset) Hicks, get down here.  I need that locator. 
INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        163 
Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes and machines.  It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist. She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating. Ripley's voice seems to come from there. 
RIPLEY (o.s.) Newt!  Star wherever you are! 
Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating. 
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     164 
Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator from his belt.  They follow the signal into a lighted area where the power apparently was not cut. 
HICKS This way.  We're close... 
Following the signal they come to a grating set in the floor. 
NEWT Here!  I'm here.  I'm here. 
Ripley runs to the grating.  Looking down she sees Newt's tearstreaked face.  Newt reaches up.  Her tiny fingers wriggle up through the bars of the grate.  Ripley squeezes the child's precious fingertips.

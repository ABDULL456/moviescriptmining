The panic is contagious. After a stunned beat, Tiny and Singh start moving, putting on shoes and restuffing suitcases. 
A KNOCK at the door. Everyone freezes. More KNOCKING.

VOICE IN HALL Room service. 
Simon steps gingerly to the door, looks out the peephole. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A fleshy hand blocks the fisheye. 
95   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                       95 
Victor and son smile at a COUPLE walking past. When they're gone, a giant orange plumber's wrench drops down from Jr.'s jacket sleeve. 
96   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                                    96 
Simon backs away from the door, freaking out. Marcus checks the windows. They're eight stories above a parking lot. 
Tiny knocks on the door to the adjoining room 
TINY (low) Hey. Kid. 
97   INT. OTHER ROOM - NIGHT                                                    97 
The kids mutes the TV. 
TINY (O.S.) Kid. Open up the door. 
BOY Fuck you. 
INTERCUT 
TINY Look, I'm really sorry, you know? It's just, it would be really swell if you would open this door. Now. It's kind of an emergency. 
BOY Hundred bucks. 
TINY Fuck!

SIMON Give him the money. 
He gathers money from their wallets. 
98    INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                       98 
Pulling all his weight into it, Vic Jr. begins to pry the door handle off. 
99    INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                                    99 
The door knob jiggles. WHIP back to the guys. 
Tiny finally chips in. Simon shoves the cash in a wad under the door. They wait. 
OTHER SIDE 
The Boy counts the money, straightening the bills. 
TINY (O.S.) Open now! 
100   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                      100 
The door handle bends further, further. Finally SNAPS. 
101   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                                   101 
The far side of the lock mechanism drops to the floor. 
TINY Fuck! 
Fingers reach into the hole, trying to pull back the bolt. Finally catch it. The door swings open, revealing... 
...an empty room. Colt .45 in hand, Victor storms in. Checks behind doors and under beds. The suitcases are half-packed. 
102   INT. ADJOINING ROOM - NIGHT                                               102 
Singh has his ear to the door. 
SINGH (whisper) They're in.

Simon peers out the peephole into the hallway. Marcus lifts the Boy against the wall. 
MARCUS (whisper) If you let them in here, they will kill you. Understood? 
The boy nods. Marcus drops him. Simon opens the hallway door a crack. It's clear. On the count of three, they go. 
We stay with the boy, who sits back against the windows, excited and rich. There's a KNOCK at the adjoining door. The boy tucks the money away. 
With a BOOM, we hear the door being kicked open. It only takes four blows. 
BOY (pointing) Down the hall. That way. 
103   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                                     103 
Swinging off the railings, the four guy race down the stairs. Up above, a door SLAMS open.

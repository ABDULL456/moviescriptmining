IN THE BEAVERS HOUSE 
MRS. BEAVER Fish and sticks, dear. 
PETER is there nothing we can do about Mr. Tumnus? 
MRS. BEAVER well.. there's hope! 
MR. BEAVER Yeah, there's a load full of hope... Aslan is on the move. 
EDMUND Who's Aslan? 
Mr. Beaver laughs.. Mrs. Beaver sees they are serious and lays her hand on Mr. Beaver 
MR. BEAVER Aslan....you silly little blighter.....you don't know do you? 
PETER Well we haven't actually been here very long 
MR. BEAVER He's only the king the whole wood, the true king of Narnia.... and he's waiting for you! 
LUCY waiting for us? 
BEAVER You got to be joking! Look, Aslan's return, Tumnus' arrest.....the secret police! They're all happening because of you! 
SUSAN You're blaming us? 
MRS. BEAVER Not blaming you dear, thanking you. 
BEAVER There's....a prophecy, When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sits in if Cair Paravel in throne the evil is over and done. 
SUSAN You know that doesn't really rhyme. 
MR. BEAVER I know, but you're missing the point! 
MRS. BEAVER It's long been told that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear to defeat the White Witch, and restore peace to Narnia. 
PETER And you think we're the ones??? 
MR. BEAVER Well you'd better be, Aslan's already fitted out your army!!!

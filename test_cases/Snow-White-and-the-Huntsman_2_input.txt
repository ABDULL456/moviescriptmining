ROSE I don't know, princess. Rose shakes her head, still gazing at Snow White, then hears the distant cries of other female prisoners. 
ROSE What will they do to me? 
33 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 33 
Ravenna sweeps into the great hall. The Generals and Finn snap to attention. She stops and stares at TWO MEN, the captured insurgents. THOMAS, a grizzled old rebel, looks badly bruised and beaten, while his handsome son, LAIN, is unmarked. They both stare at her defiantly. Ravenna faces the two rebels. A SOLDIER steps forward. 
SOLDIER My Queen, these two were captured leading an ambush of our supply caravan. Ravenna seems intrigued, steps forward, eyeing them. 
RAVENNA You left your home, your family, the bosom of my protection, to aid my enemies? Why? 
THOMAS Because under your rule we have lost everything. We will not stop until this kingdom is free. 
RAVENNA Lost everything? 
(REGARDS IAIN) Your son? She moves to Iain, right up to his face. 
RAVENNA Very handsome. 
(TO THOMAS) Obviously a debt owed to your wife. She reaches out and touches Iain's strong jaw. He struggles against the Guards that hold him back. 
RAVENNA There was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours -- and you would have no doubt broken mine. In a flash Iain grabs a Guard's dagger and rams it into Ravenna's chest. She makes a pained face, looks down at the dagger, then up to Iain. 
RAVENNA You would kill your Queen? She pulls the dagger out - there is no"wound, no blood - and drops it on the ground. Iain and Thomas are shocked. 
(CONTINUED) 
33 CONTINUED: 33 
RAVENNA (admiring; to Iain) You have beauty. And courage. But how strong is your heart? She smiles, almost regrettably, then places her hand on his chest. We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND LOUDER. He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling his ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead. Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son. Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her hand. 
RAVENNA No. Let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his Queen. With that she sweeps out, followed by Finn. It's only now that we see the lines on her face. Finn takes her by the arm as she falters. 
FINN Are you alright? Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously. The General and the others stare, alarmed. 
RAVENNA 
(TO ALL) 
OUT!!!!! They quickly exit, all save Finn, who watches, concerned, as Ravenna leans against the wall for support. She pulls herself together, looks at Finn. 
FINN Magic comes at a lofty price. 
RAVENNA And the expense grows. 
FINN You look... 
RAVENNA old?... 
FINN Tired. 
RAVENNA My powers... fade. This is about as much as Ravenna can confess. Finn watches as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber. Then he turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE. A GUARD appears and Finn nods. 
33a INT. MIRROR CHAMBER - ROYAL PALACE 33a Ravenna walks into the room. Eyes the mirror, afraid to look at herself. 
FINN (O.S.) I have something for what ails you. She turns to see -- Finn, with Rose. Ravenna almost smiles. Rose holds her gaze defiantly. Ravenna walks over, admires her face, smiles, then takes her by the throat and -- LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET. Rose opens her mouth to scream but instead of sound, ENERGY pours out. Ravenna opens her mouth, DEVOURING GRETA'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY. Like a flower blooming, her lines vanish. Like a flower wilting, Rose AGES until she's as old as the scullery maids. 
34 INT. PRISON TOWER/ SNOW WHITE'S CELL 34 
Snow White hears approaching footsteps and watches as a Guard opens Greta's cell and tosses someone in. 
SNOW WHITE Rose?... The Guard clangs the cell door shut and walks away. Snow White peers through the shadows. Can't quite make her out. 
SNOW WHITE Rose?...

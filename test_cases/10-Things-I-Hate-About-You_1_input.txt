Gives her a "don't even start" look. 
BIANCA (continuing) I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here. 
KAT You're welcome. 
She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.

Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside Joey catches up to them. 
JOEY A bunch of us are going to Jaret's house.  Wanna come? 
Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression. She looks at her watch. 
BIANCA I have to be home in twenty minutes. 
CHASTITY (eagerly, to Joey) I don't have to be home 'til two. 
JOEY Then, c'mon. (to Bianca) Maybe next time -- 
They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca 
Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca standing alone. 
CAMERON (slightly accusatory) Have fun tonight? 
BIANCA Tons 
He starts to walk on 
BIANCA (continuing) Cameron? 
He stops. She gives him a helpless smile. 
BIANCA (continuing) Do you think you could give me a ride home? 
INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT 
Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and Patrick quickly changes it. 
PATRICK I'm driving, so I get to pick the tunes. 
She changes it back to her song. 
KAT It's my car. 
He changes it back. 
PATRICK And I'm in control of it. 
KAT But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there. 
Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her listen to her song. 
KAT (continuing) When you were gone last year -- where were you? 
PATRICK Busy 
KAT Were you in jail? 
PATRICK Maybe. 
KAT No, you weren't 
PATRICK Then why'd you ask? 
KAT Why'd you lie? 
He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the music.  She bobs her head drunkenly. 
KAT (continuing) I should do this. 
PATRICK Do what? 
KAT This. 
She points to the radio 
PATRICK Start a band?

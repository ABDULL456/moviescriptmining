The Sheriff looks over at Katherine's pickup still jammed into the side of the kiva. 
SHERIFF Did you kill this Gabriel? 
DAGGETT Maybe. I think so. 
SHERIFF Don't have any idea where the body is I suppose. 
DAGGETT No. 
SHERIFF Well, if he's alive he won't get far out there. Us or the coyotes, it'll be the same. (beat) I rang your office in LA. They don't have a warrant out for a Gabriel. Or anybody else in Arizona. 
DAGGETT I hadn't gotten around to it. 
SHERIFF Sort of an out of pocket thing. 
DAGGETT Yes. 
The Sheriff takes his hat off. Runs his finger along the inside band. 
SHERIFF That woman lying at the bottom of the arroyo, the one still in her hospital gown, know anything about that? 
DAGGETT No. 
SHERIFF Really. 
DAGGETT Really. 
SHERIFF This Gabriel was sure one busy dude. 
DAGGETT Yes, he was. 
Beat. 
SHERIFF You'll be going back to Los Angeles now? 
DAGGETT Yeah. 
The Sheriff pushes off from the patrol car and tosses aside the oak stalk. 
SHERIFF Don't hurry back. 
The deputy finishes his bandaging. 
DEPUTY Don't do much but breathe the next few days. And get to a hospital. You're going to need some serious stitches. 
DAGGETT Thanks. 
DEPUTY Say hi to Hollywood for me. 
He follows his boss. Katherine and Mary walk up. 
MARY You look bad. 
DAGGETT Thank you. I feel worse. (to Katherine re Navaho cops) They lean on you much? 
KATHERINE Not really. I think they might have even understood. One of them's related to this clan. He'll give us a ride back if we want. 
DAGGETT Good. I think I've about run out of hospitality with the sheriff's department. 
The moment drifts into silence. 
KATHERINE Do you think it's really over? 
DAGGETT Till we die. 
Her eyes settle on his. 
KATHERINE When I die, I want you with me. 
DAGGETT I want that too. 
She touches his cheek, Mary cradled between them. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Thomas sitting in the back of the tribal police bronco, looking out the window to the shimmering sands; red and yellow and black. To clouds brewing over faraway forgotten mountains. To the end of the earth. 
As the bronco drifts away from us toward the empty, rocky horizon, as it slowly blends and is consumed by the land, 
FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK

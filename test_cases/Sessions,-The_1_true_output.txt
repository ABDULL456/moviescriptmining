INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT Cheryl is at a tiny desk, dictating into a recorder. 
CHERYL First session. Mark is the oldest of four children and raised Catholic. He was extremely nervous. He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt, but I think more out of fear than pain. He cannot masturbate. Has only had the occasional kissing experience. He is capable of achieving an erection easily, but the unusual curvature of his body could be a serious obstacle to intercourse. 
She puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the drawer with a key, which she keeps with her. 
INT. CHERYL'S BEDROOM.    NIGHT Cheryl gets into bed beside her husband JOSH, who is apparently asleep. 
CHERYL This gentleman I just started working with. He spends most of his life trapped in a big metal box. 
Her husband Josh turns over and mumbles something completely incomprehensible. She nudges him. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Did you hear what I said? 
JOSH Yes, I heard what you said. You're a saint. 
He kisses her. 
CHERYL Don't forget to put the trash out in the morning. 
She turns around and goes to sleep. INT. SIDE CHAPEL.   DAY Mark is in the little side chapel with Father Brendan. 
MARK I don't know what I had envisaged it would be like, the first time I mean. But that wasn't the image I had. I thought there would be more to it. Not that it was unpleasant. After all, I was in bed with a naked woman. She complimented me on my shirt and my hair. She held my penis. I haven't even seen my penis for over thirty years. Anyway, onward. Am I sharing too much? 
FATHER BRENDAN No, I'm used to it. 
INT.   MARK'S PLACE.      NIGHT Mark is in his iron lung. With his mouth stick, he turns the page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex. There are the typical graphic cross-section diagrams of penises entering vaginas. Ravel's "Bolero" plays quietly in the background as he reads to himself. 
MARK "Sometimes the head of the penis may be too large to penetrate the vaginal opening smoothly, in which case the application of lubricant is recommended to avoid possible..." Oh, my God! 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. DAY This time Rod is wheeling Mark. He seems only slightly less anxious than the first time, but still noticeably anxious. 
ROD What's on the menu today? 
MARK We're attempting intercourse. 
ROD Uh-huh. That's a big one. 
MARK What do you think of it? Intercourse. 
ROD Overrated, but necessary. There's plenty of other ways of achieving the same result, but somehow you don't feel you've actually done it till you've gone all the way in. 
This does not help Mark's state of mind. 
67   OMITTED                                                      67 INT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.   DAY Cheryl takes off her clothes. 
CHERYL I want you to look at me this time. Go on, lift your eyes, look at me. 
He lifts his eyes. She pauses. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Do you like watching me undress? 
MARK I do. 
As she moves towards the bed, almost naked, the last thing she takes off is her bra. 
CHERYL From now on...

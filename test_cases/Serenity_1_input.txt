JAYNE Well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar. 
MAL No grenades. (Jayne groans) No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's. 
ZOE Are we crashing again? 
MAL Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped? 
ZOE Good to go, sir. Just loading her up. (to Jayne) Are those grenades? 
JAYNE Cap'n doesn't want 'em. 
J 
ZOE We're robbing the place. We're not occupying it. All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the: 
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING 
It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor. 
MAL (calling out) Kaylee! He enters: 
INT. AFT HALL/ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING 
MAL (still calling) Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the din. 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) We got the Primary Buffer 
KAYLEE Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret. 
MAL You told me -- 
(JOLT) You told me the entry couplings would hold for another week! 
KAYLEE 
(WORKING) That was six months ago, cap'n. 
MAL My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her. 
Steam and electricity shoot at him, backing him up. He turns to see Simon behind him. Simon is more seasoned than before, but still contrasts the Captain entirely in dress and manner. He is implacably proper. Also pissed. 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) Doctor. Guess I need to get innocked 'fore we hit planetside. Simon nods, the ship jolting again. 
MAL 
(CONTINUING) Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to worry about. 
SIMON I'm not worried. 
MAL Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc. 
SIMON This isn't fear. This is anger. 
MAL 
4 (LAUGHS) Well, it's kinda hard to tell the one from t'other, face like yours. 
SIMON I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider. 
MAL I'll look for that next time. 
SIMON You're not taking her. 
MAL (brushing past him) No no, that's not a thing I'm interested in talking over with -- 
SIMON She's not going with you. That's final. 
MAL (turning back) I hear the words "that's final" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be. (turning away again) This is my boat. Y'all are guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to: 
INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING

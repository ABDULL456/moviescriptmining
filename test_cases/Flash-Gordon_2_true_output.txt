To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now startsÂ· appearing. They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing thing is that they all have the SAME FACE. 
From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm us with their massive, silent, answerable threat. 
FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if paralysed. 
DALE (low and tremulous) What's the play, Flash? 
FLASH I can't -- I just can't -- 
DALE Can't what? 
FLASH Clobber a woman, Dale -- 
DALE (OUTBURST) You damn fool, those aren't women they're murderous AMAZON DYKES! 
The AMAZONS are all around DALE now. 
DALE (CONT'D) Help!! 
FLASH is paralyzed by indecision one beat more, then suddenly makes up his mind. He flies into action, SLAMS the nearest pair of AMAZONS. 
INT. PALACE - FIGHT SEQUENCE (DALE) 
Fast and furious. Great havoc is wreaked by DALE and her karate, by FLASH and his flailing fists, but the AMAZONS' numerical superiority is of course decisive. 
Soon FLASH is on the floor, pinioned by a dozen AMAZONS. 
He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper gloom. 
DALE Flash!! 
The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes after DALE. 
INT. PALACE - ON THE STAIRCASE 
FLASH struggles to get through to DALE. 
DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH. 
CLOSE SHOT - THEIR HANDS 
Just touching their fingertips. 
CLOSE SHOT - A STEP OF THE STAIRS 
Opens like a yawning trap door UNDER FLASH'S FEET. 
FLASH drops away with a YELL, in the very instant that AURA comes running INTO THE SHOT and boldly JUMPS after him. AURA is swallowed up too, a split-second before the trap door step CLOSES again after them. 
INT. PALACE - CU-MING (KLYTUS, MING) 
Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear. 
KLYTUS She betrays you! She'll take him to Aboria! 
MING So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon for me -- I don't care. 
KLYTUS Don't be too sure! 
MING glances at him, then back up the stairs at where DALE has vanished. His face softens, his tone turns museful! 
MING I haven't taken a wife in centuries. I could bring myself to marry this Dale Arden -- (A BEAT) What do you see in her future, Klytus?

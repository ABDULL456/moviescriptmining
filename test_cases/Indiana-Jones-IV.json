{"train": "CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS. \nA TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an order to his men. \nMACGOWAN Galbraith... You come with me! We'll search for Hennesey... Out here! Bottomley... You go with Doctor Jones... (finger shaking, points to inside of crypt) In there. \nMacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS. \nINT. CRYPT \nIndy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes. Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER... \nIndiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER. Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by his feet, is the DEAD BODY of \nHENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING. \nBottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm. \nINDIANA Let's get outta' here. \nIndy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help. \nBOTTOMLEY Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open the door! \nUsing his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK, another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley. \nINDIANA (motioning to candle) I need more light. \nBottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy TURNS from the door. \nINDIANA Bottomley?... \nNO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD. \nINDIANA Bottomley?... \nAGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a SHOCKING SIGHT! \nBOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt. There is NO SIGN of anyone. \nINDIANA Who is it?... Who's there?... \nThe same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE! \nIndy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back his hand. His fingers are BURNT. \nINT. BASEMENT \nMacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE. MacGowan CALLS through the door. \nMACGOWAN Doctor Jones! Try to push! \nINT. CRYPT \nIndy ANSWERS, taking a STEP BACK. \nINDIANA Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice coverin' the... \nIndiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM! \nIndy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS! \nIndy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING HIS GRIP. \nSeconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy SWINGS DOWNWARD. \nINT. ABYSS \nAt the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge SNAPS! \nIndiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH! \nBOTTOM OF THE HOLE! \nA POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS. \nINDIANA NOW they bite! \nIndy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND. Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side. \nTWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other... and Indy's HEAD! \nThe black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head. The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both knights FALLING to the floor. \nIndiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight armed with a long, sharp SWORD! \nBaron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his plate. \nIndy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the room! \nIndy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS. \nThe two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE. Indiana JUMPS to his feet. \nThe BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow. \nSeeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor. \nThe black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK! The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP! \nThe rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward. Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER. \nIndy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME! SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white knight COMES toward him. \nIndiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows. Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF to a freshly carved slice of pork. \nIndiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy. \nThe sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the chandelier. \nAt the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP. \nIndy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED, Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove. \nThe Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery throat. Indiana SNARLS. \nINDIANA Haven't you had enough? \nBaron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork. His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the flame of the mysterious candle. \nThe room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him. Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED and TATTERED Indiana Jones. \nMACGOWAN Now you can get back to your fishing, Doctor Jones. \nINDIANA No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta' get back to school. \nMACGOWAN (shakes his head) 'Tis a shame to go home empty handed... (smiles, an idea) Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy me'self quite the fisherman... Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you a real beauty, eh?... \nINDIANA (sarcastic smirk) Right. Send it to me airmail. \nMACGOWAN (incredulous) Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is truer than... \nINDIANA Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I know. \nThey EXIT the room. \nEXT. CASTLE \nThe villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD. \nBARON SEAGROVE No...jail...can...hold...me. \nA CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS. \nVILLAGER 'E's done it! Indiana Jones has captured the killer! \nThe crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE. \nINDY'S POV \nBaron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle. Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a GHOST! \nIndiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE expression on Indy's face. \nMACGOWAN What is it, man? You look as if you've seen a screamin' banshee! \nIndy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED. It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS, turning back to MacGowan. \nINDIANA Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing at all. \nCAMERA DOLLIES INTO INDIANA'S TROUBLED, UNCERTAIN FACE. THE BARON'S LAUGH FILLS THE SOUND TRACK. \nSLOW DISSOLVE: \nPORTER You left this aboard ship. \nINDIANA (puzzled) There must be some mistake... I didn't -- \nThe Porter POINTS to a section of the barrel that reads: DELIVER TO: DR. INDIANA JONES. \nPORTER That's you, ain't it? \nINDIANA Well, yeah...but... \nThe Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS back to the ship. \nSGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet away. In a DARK alleyway. \nA puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning. \nSCRAGGY Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of Goodness! \"Before body make contact with foreign object -- \" \nIndiana IGNORES Scraggy and begins to PRY OPEN the barrel. \nSCRAGGY \"...you must cast out bad spirits!\" \nIndiana still IGNORES Scraggy. He STRUGGLES with the barrel top, FLIRTING with Clare. \nINDIANA May I call you \"Clare\"? \nCLARE Please. \nINDIANA Well, Clare... We've obviously got a lot of notes to compare... Let's get started tonight...over dinner. \nCLARE I'd like that very much. \nINDIANA Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll get us a nice quiet table. No disturbances. Just the two of us -- \nAt that moment, the barrel lid FLIES OFF! The inside if FILLED with old, brown BANANA PEELS. Suddenly, BETSY'S HEAD POKES THROUGH the peels! Indiana is SHOCKED. Scraggy SIGHS. \nSCRAGGY I warn you, Indy! You must always cast out bad spirits! \nA dirty, unkempt Betsy LEAPS OUT OF THE BARREL! She THROWS her arms around Indy. \nBETSY My precious! \nCLARE (puzzled, to Indy) Your daughter? \nINDIANA My assistant. \nBETSY His girlfriend. \nCLARE (revolted) A child! \nINDIANA (to Clare) It's nothing. Really. (to Betsy) What the hell are you doing here'? \nBETSY Proving my love for you. \nCLARE How terribly sordid. \nINDIANA (to Clare) Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll get over it. \nBETSY Never. This proves that nothing can come between us. Not an ocean. Not two separate Continents. \nCLARE Think I'm going to be ill. \nINDIANA (puzzled, to Betsy) How...I mean... How could you stay alive? \nBETSY Hey... I'm from Brooklyn. \nINDIANA But we'ye been sailing for three weeks! \nBETSY Stowed away in the banana barrel. Ate my way to the bottom. \nCLARE (nauseous) Charming. \nBETSY (pointing to Clare) Hey, Indy... Who's the babe? \nCLARE Your intellectual and emotional superior. \nBETSY Yeah...well you're gettin' on my nerves, Miss... Miss... \nCLARE (extends her hand) \"Doctor\" Clare Clarke. \nBETSY (reluctantly shaking Clare's hand) Betsy Tuffet... \nCLARE (shrugs) Just basic manners. What it takes most men a lifetime to learn... Tyki's accomplished in two weeks. (introduces Scraggy) This is our guide, Scraggy Brier... and Miss Bets-- \nClare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS. \nEXT. COMPOOND \nBonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for help. \nINT. CAGE \nEveryone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma. \nCLARE It appears that Bonzo is attracted to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De Banana Peel. \nTyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the pygmy's shoulder. \nINDIANA Where did you find him?... \nCLARE About ten miles from here. We were on a photographic expedition...in the thick of the jungle... I heard sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took a few steps, and found Tyki. He was lying in a shallow swamp...semi conscious...a high fever...nearly dead from exhaustion. He had obviously been travelling on foot for many days, over countless miles... So I brought him back to the compound...nursed him back to health... \nIndiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face. \nINDIANA Clare, I hate to quibble with your anthropological abilities... \nCLARE Quibble. \nINDIANA ...but if this little fellow is over 200 years old... I mean... What accounts for his youthful appearance?...his vitality?... \nClare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the ground. Still WRESTLING. \nCLOSE UP: PEACE STONE. \nA FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface. \nCLARE (O.S.) Tyki was wearing this when I found him. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED. \nCUT TO: \nSGT. GUTTERBUHG. \nHe stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation. \nCLARE (O.S.) Dr. Jones, you are obviously familiar with the legend of Sun Wu- King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?... \nINDIANA (O.S.) A bite from the fruit of that peach tree would give a person eternal life...make them forever young... \nThe vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg underlines the words \"FOREVER YOUNG\". \nCUT BACK TO: \nINDIANA \nSTUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around Indiana's head. \nINDIANA There's nothing unusual about this ...nothing to indicate that it's from Sun Wu Kung's garden... \nThe fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS. \nCLARE This fruit fly had a normal life- span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS. (frustrated sigh) As an experiment...the fly was put in this room...alone...with only the peach stone to sustain its existence. The fly stayed alive for THREE WEEKS. (looks at dead fly) Until now. \nShe FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG. \nINDIANA Sorry. \nIndiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room. \nINT. CAGE \nScraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy, giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana. \nCLARE He understands him? \nINDIANA (nods) Scraggy knows hundreds of languages... He's the best guide in Africa. (turns to Scraggy) Ask Tyki where he came from. \nScraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES. \nSCRAGGY He say... \"I come from 'Land Of City On Clouds'\". \nINDIANA (puzzled) Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed to mean? (to Scraggy) Can he take us there? \nABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table. \nDASHIELL Enjoying your dinners?... \nEveryone NODS, expressing their thanks. Dashiell LEANS close to Indiana and WHISPERS. \nDASHIELL Watch yourself, sport. Most of the talk here tonight is about you. And it isn't good. \nIndiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS. WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell continues WHISPERING to Indiana. \nDASHIELL I don't know what you've done to the Nazis. But they are certainly no friends of yours. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND \nDARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS. \nTHE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS Guard places a hand on his holster. \nGUARD Who's there?... \nWe hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD. \nCLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS \nThe sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS! \nTHE SECURITY GUARD \nlies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY, BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the boot's SHOELACES are untied. \nTYKI \nSTARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER. \nSuddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN. \nGUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE (who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is POINTING ahead. \nTyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS HEAD. \nGutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM is actually a A MACEINE GUN! \nThe bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked, tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified Tyki WATCHES. \nGutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DASHIELL'S BAR \nIndiana, Scraggy and Clare CONTINUE to excitedly STUDY the map. A NEGLECTED Betsy POURS herself the last of the wine. She is very DRUNK, singing along with the band's version of Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\". \nBENEATH THE TABLE \nBetsy continues to RUB her FOOT against Indiana's leg. \nINDIANA \ntries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the scroll. \nSCRAGGY \"With his Golden Hooped Rod, And its powerful lightning rays, Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave, Where he live for 500 days.\" \nCLARE The Golden Hooped Rod? \nINDIANA A heavenly staff with many different powers...most notably, it had the ability to transform itself into hundreds of objects... (staring) It remains the most priceless treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire. \nCLARE And what is the...the Water Curtain Cave? \nINDIANA Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an enormous secret cave, hidden behind a running waterfall. \nClare again REACHES for her coffee. The cup and saucer are still TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana EXCITEDLY explains Scraggy's translation. \nINDIANA This proves that the Water Curtain Cave exists in Africa... (to Scraggy) Does it mention anything about Sun Wu Kung's travels? \nSCRAGGY (reading scroll) Only place called...\"Twisted Snake Water\". \nINDIANA The Zarnbesi River! It has a reputation for its deadly water snakes... \nCLARE It would have been Sun Wu Kung's logical path. \nThe Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS. \nThe speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER! \nUNDERWATER \nIndiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER... toward a SPINNING DEATH. \nIndy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana... \nBut Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE PROPELLERS! \nIndiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to safety. \nABOVE WATER \nIndiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES \nGOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY. Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES. \nGUTTERBUHG Goodnight, Doctor Jones. \nThere is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound. Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS. \nDASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT... \nWith a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat. \nDASHIELL Scraggy said you might be needing some help, sport. \nDashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis. \nA FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.) \nThroughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO Nazi headquarters for help. \nDashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING. \nUp ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS. \nDASHIELL Indy! Rollout! \nIndy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat. Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into the pole! CRUSHED! \nDashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana. \nDASHIELL You okay, sport? \nIndiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS. \nINDIANA Dash!... \nDashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE. \nThe Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck. The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air. \nINT. WAREHOUSE \nDashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell gets out. Indy RUNS to the window. \nINDIANA'S POV \nThe NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water. \nIndiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window. \nGutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK. His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS OPEN. \nIndiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to BREAK THE CONNECTION. \nIndiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind. Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at Indiana. \nMeanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip. Only a FEW THREADS remain. \nIndiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING. JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind. Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat! \nTyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has met a GRISLY DEATH. \nThe Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength! Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure of the rushing water. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING. \nINDIANA Scraggy's takin' a shower. \nIndy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare. \nINDIANA He believes that onions keep bad spirits from entering his body. \nCLARE (writing in her notebook) In all my years of anthropology... I've never run across anyone or anything quite like Scraggy. \nINDIANA (chuckles) He's a rare breed. (turns, looks at Clare for the first time) You're looking very lovely. \nCLARE You're looking very lecherous. \nINDIANA (turns away, angry) Just tryin' to be friendly. \nCLARE Save it for the schoolgirls. \nINDIANA Look, Clare... Betsy's just an anxious archeology student...she admires my work... (egotistical shrug) Who can blame her?... (back to his point) But it's just some kinda' hero worship thing... \nThere was never any romance. \nBETSY (pops in from OFF SCREEN, kisses Indiana) I dreamed about our first night together! \nIndy SIGHS. Clare DISGUSTINGLY shakes her head. She continues to scrawl more into her notebook. Indiana gives her a STARTLED look. \nINDIANA You're writin' this down?... \nCLARE (nods) I'm keeping an accurate record of our journey. \nINDIANA What's that got to do with my personal life? \nCLARE Evidence. I plan on testifying at your child molestation trial. \nIndiana SHAKES his head. STARING into the distance. He SIGHS. \nINDIANA Why do I do this to myself? \nHolding her head in PAIN, Betsy turns to Clare. \nBETSY (holds her head in pain, to Clare) Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a Doctor...you got any cures for a hangover?... \nCLARE The best I've heard was used by a New Zealand Tribe... (pauses, thinking) One part crushed owl skull...two parts rhino saliva...one part zebra dandruff. \nBetsy's face becomes PALE. Indy INTERRUPTS. \nINDIANA No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat ...two spoons of skunk hair...and one pint of shredded lizard tongue. \nBetsy turns a light shade of GREEN. Scraggy ARGUES. \nSCRAGGY I always use family cure! Two spoons chopped leeches... Half cup horse mucous...two quarts crocodile urine! \nBETSY (ready to throw up) Ex...cuse...me...! \nBetsy runs OFF SCREEN. The others exchange a SHRUG. Scraggy LOOKS at the river ahead. \nSCRAGGY How far we travel, Indy?... \nINDIANA Almost 20 miles. \nCLARE Any sign of the Nazis? \nINDIANA (shakes his head, confident) Long as we keep up this pace... they'll have trouble tracking us. \nCAMERA PANS from the hopeful faces of Indiana, Scraggy and Clare, to the CABIN behind them. Here, a CREW MEMBER HIDES in the shadows. His face HIDDEN. He HOLDS a small radio receiver. He WHISPERS into the receiver. Speaking in perfect GERMAN. \nCUT TO: \nGUTTERBUBG. \nHe is seated in NAZI HEADQUARTERS. He repairs his detached, MACHINE GUN ARM, which sits on the table before him. Behind Gutterbuhg, a GROUP OF NAZIS listen to the radio transmission of Scraggy's treacherous Crew Member, who discloses the LOCATION of the River Boat. The Nazis CHART out the boat's exact location on a large, WALL MAP. LIEUT. MEPHISTO supervises the project. Tyki, BOUND, GAGGED and BRUISED, watches from a corner. MEPHISTO looks at all the Nazis. \nMEPHISTO (German, English subtitles) We must leave. Immediately. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNIGHT IN THE JUNGLE. \nVARIOUS SHOTS of exotic animals. A creeping PANTHER. A sleeping WHITE BAT. A tense SCORPION. A family of CROCODILES. \nABOARD SHIP \nIndiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player. \nINDIANA Betsy... \nBETSY (serious) One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear. I'll wake the whole boat. \nIndiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS. \nINDIANA OKay. Just one. (leans toward her, pauses) Keep your mouth closed. \nThey KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a PASSIONATE KISS. \nAt that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM. An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers her face. \nTHE FOLLOWING MORNING \nSUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY. \nIndiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy GLANCES to her. CURIOUS. \nINDIANA What's that you're writing?... \nCLARE \"The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana Jones, Professor Of Perversity\". \nINDIANA (back to shaving) Very funny. \nCAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT. \nScraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered with SHOCK. FEAR. \nINT. LOWER CABIN - KITCHEN \nBetsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES \nAN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK. FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet. THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of the kitchen. \nINDIANA \nhas nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him. \nINDIANA You are blowing this Betsy thing all out of proportion... \nIndiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED. UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He still tries to REASON with Clare. \nINDIANA It's not as if I have this sleazy reputation... \nClare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket. ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head. \nINDIANA I am a respected...honored... admired... \nClare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and Clare TURN. \nTHREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED, they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER... \nSuddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to SWORDFIGBT the Pirates. \nClare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear- like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder. \nThe river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING. \nUsing her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD. ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on. \nBETSY C'mon... You ain't so tough. You wouldn't last ten minutes in Brooklyn. \nThe Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT. \nIndiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He TURNS. \nA PIRATE SHIP \nhas APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS. COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND ARROWS and CANNONS. \nEXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK \nKEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat, to the Pirate Ship. \nINDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER. \nIndiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS and FLYING ARROWS. \nEXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK \nThe swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY. Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill. He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy gives her a THANKFUL NOD. \nThe River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE. \nKEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare. Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT. \nINDIANA Wait... \nKezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through Kezure. \nINDIANA Free the girl... (glances to his captive friends) ...and my friends... (lights a match, moves it toward TNT fuses) ...or I blow your hideout here out of the water! \nKezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a wide, DEFIANT SMILE. \nKEZURE Good. We will all die. \nA STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED. PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure. \nINDIANA We can take you to the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung! \nKEZURE Hah! Better men than you have tried to find the Lost City... They have all failed. (cynical laugh) You are a fool. \nINDIANA (as the TNT fuse burns LOWER...LOWER...) No... You're the fool. You and your friends are hiding out in Sun Wu Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you don't even know it. \nKEZURE (puzzled, looking around) Huh?... \nScraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY SECOND... Indiana removes the ANCIENT SCROLL from his pocket. He EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure. \nINDIANA The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll. \nKezure GRABS the scroll. Attempting to READ it. Indy INTERRUPTS. \nINDIANA Don't bother. Only WE can translate it. \nKezure EXAMINES the scroll. PUZZLED by the writing. Indiana and Scraggy exchange a HOPEFUL glanpe. Kezure PAUSES. THINKING. He MUMBLES to himself. \nKEZURE The Lost City... Said to have streets paved in gold...treasures far greater than any mortal man could imagine... \nKezure PUSHES Clare away. TOWARD Indiana. Clare EMBRACES Indy, as he BLOWS OUT the dynamite fuse. Kezure GROWLS at Indy. \nKEZURE Your pathetic lives will be spared. For now. (scratching his neck) But everything we find in the Lost City...belongs to ME. \nINDIANA Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or you've got no deal. \nKEZURE (vicious smile) It is my way. Or you've got no head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WATER CURTAIN CAVE - THAT NIGHT \nA group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy. \nINDIANA Read that last proverb again... \nSCRAGGY (reads translation) \"High tide drowns curiosity, Low tide quenches thirst\". \nINDIANA (stands, looking at the surroundings) There's something here...something that could help us... \nMeanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare. \nBETSY Look at 'em. It's like they've never seen a woman before. \nCLARE To them... We're the ultimate women. \nBETSY Kinda' flattering, isn't it?... Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams? \nClare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE. \nMeanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure. \nINDIANA Is there an area... A place where the tide changes?... \nKezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water. \nKEZURE In a few hours...the water will be lower...much lower... \nINDIANA And the remainder of this wall will be visible?.... \nKezure NODS. Indiana's eyes LIGHT. A REALIZATION. He excitedly TURNS to Kezure. \nINDIANA We're gonna need light. A lot of light. On this wall. \nKezure NODS. Indiana EXCHANGES an anxious, hopeful glance with Scraggy. \nA GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO! \nSoon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS A CORNER... They COME UPON... \nAN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM! \nIndiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS. Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM! \nAs the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT. SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out. CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions. \nIndiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY. Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans. \nEveryone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST. The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS. FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING. \nINDIANA Clare! What are you...?!? \nThe lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK. Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS. \nCLARE I imitated the sound of a Lion Mother calling her babies. \nBetsy is IMPRESSED. Indiana SMILES. RELIEVED. \nINDIANA C'mon. Let's get outta' -- \nIndy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure. \nINDIANA Is this the Tribal Chief you told me about?... Your friend?... \nKEZURE (points to shrunken head) No. That is him. \nIndiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed. Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path. \nEXT. MONGOOBO VILLAGE \nSeveral GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village. Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the penetrating, unfriendly glares of the villagers. Kezure EXPLAINS to Indiana. \nKEZURE This is a different tribe. New. They have taken over the village. \nINDIANA What happened to the other tribe? \nKezure SHRUGS. Indiana TURNS to Scraggy. \nINDIANA You recognize their language? \nPAGE 73 MISSING FROM HARD COPY \nSuddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN. Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven. The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and Scraggy. \nScraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words. The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy WHISPERS to Indiana. \nSCRAGGY I tell him we divine messengers of Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with our mission... Jade Emperor come down from heavens and destroy his village. \nIndy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana. \nSCRAGGY I tell him we lose path to city... I ask if he have something to help us. \nThe chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT. \nINT. GRASS HUT \nEMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The chief PICKS up the mirror and GIVES it to Scraggy. The chief EXPLAINS. Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana. \nSCRAGGY (translating) He say this will help us. And since we are divine messengers...we will know how to use it! \nIndiana SMIRKS. He EXAMINES the mirror. Totally CONFUSED by it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE - DAWN \nThe village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here. Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that they have CAMPED here for the evening. \nSuddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE. \nINT. GRASS HUT \nIndiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM! BETSY. \nBETSY Indy. I'm frightened. \nINDIANA I'm claustrophobic. \nSHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG. Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL, is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON. Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND LEVEL. \nThe tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground. \nINT. TANK \nGUTTERBUHG is here. He views the outside action through a PERISCOPE. TWO NAZI GUNNERS are behind him. WAITING for orders to shoot. TYKI sits in the background. The confused pygmy is BOUND and GAGGED. \nOUTSIDE \nScraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains. RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them. Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out. \nSCRAGGY Indy?... Indy?... \nIndiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino CHASES him! \nMeanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS. \nINT. TANK \nGutterbuhg LOOKS into the periscope. Indy's friends are in his SIGHTS. Gutterbuhg SCREAMS to the gunners. \nGUTTERBUHG (German; English subtitles) Fire! \nOUTSIDE \nThe tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm trees to smithereens. \nINDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering, Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS! \nScraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The tank FOLLOWS. \nIndiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle, the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank. HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY. \nScraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT. They run toward a RAVINE. \nThe tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at FULL SPEED. \nINT. TANK \nThrough the periscope, Gutterbuhg SEES Indy and the rhino. \nINDIANA \ncontinues to RIDE the uncontrollable rhino. They are within THIRTY FEET of the oncoming tank. \nINT. TANK \nGutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi Gunner to \"Fire\". \nEXT. PLAINS \nThe tank FIRES. The blast is LOW. The ground in front of Indy and the rhino EXPLODES. A cloud of dust ERUPTS. \nINT. TANK \nGutterbuhg LOOKS through the periscope. His view is BLOCKED by dust. \nEXT. PLAINS \nThe tank is UPON Indy and the rhino. The rhino SCREECHES to a stop. FRIGHTENED by the blast. Indiana LEAPS ONTO THE TANK. GRIPPING the front section. HOLDING ON for dear life. Moments before he is crushed beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF. \nScraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE. Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree. \nSCRAGGY Safest place from bad spirits...is in branches of tree. \nThe others SHRUG. They have NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW Scraggy up into the branches of the tree. \nIndiana CLIMBS along the side of the monstrous tank. He searches for a PASSAGEWAY inside of the tank. \nINT. TANK \nThe Nazis are UNAWARE of Indy's presense on the tank. Gutterbuhg CONTINUES to look through the periscope. The dust begins to CLEAR. He FOCUSES his sights on Indy's friends. LOCATED several feet away. They CLIMB into the TREE. Gutterbuhg SMILES. \nEXT. TANK \nIndy CANNOT FIND a passageway into the tank. He SEES the GUN BARREL. OVERHEAD. It SWIVELS. AIMING toward the tree filled with Indy's friends. Indy GRABS one of the tank's LARGE HEADLIGHTS. He PULLS HARD. SNAPPING OFF the headlight. Indy LEAPS upward. He quickly STUFFS the headlight inside of the barrel opening. \nINT. TANK \nThe tree of Indy's friends are in Gutterbuhg's SIGHTS. A PERFECT SHOT. Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi gunners to SHOOT. They FIRE. But the barrel BACKFIRES! EXPLODING in the face of the two Nazi gunners. It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio. He SCREAMS into the microphone. \nINT. TANK \nIndy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg. \nINDIANA Call your mommy. \nGutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the microphone. INTERRUPTING. \nINDIANA This is Jones. I've got your tank. (pause) It's all over, pal. You lose. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO \nHe is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana. \nMEPHISTO Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For a supposedly intelligent man...you jump to childish conclusions. Remember... You are driving our tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere. (vehement) You are far from defeating us, my friend. The battle has only just begun. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS. Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an ENTIRE ARMY! \nINDIANA \nDROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank. Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING. \nEXT. PLAINS \nIndiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT glance to Scraggy. \nINDIANA We've got to move. Fast. (points to Tyki) Ask him if he knows the way to the City from here. \nScraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana. \nSCRAGGY He do not know exact place... But it is somewhere over there. \nIndy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away, we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround the mountains. Indiana SIGHS. \nINDIANA A lotta' good that does us... It could take us months...years...to search everyone of those. \nBetsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket. \nBETSY Maybe he knows what to do with this... \nBetsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana. \nSCRAGGY It is \"Magical Mirror of Sun Wu Kung\"... \nINDIANA But whattayou do with it? \nScraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror. Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. \nThe mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS! \nIndiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN. But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier. \nCLARE \"I come from Land Of City On Clouds\". \nIndiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical REFLECTION. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TANK \ntravelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls. \nINT. TANK \nIndiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS. Kezure EXPLAINS. \nKEZURE This is called \"Taskipi\". Only the bravest play. \nUpon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game BEGINS. \nIndiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him. \nBETSY I've been talking to Dr. Clarke about our problem. \nINDIANA (struggling with tank) Problem?... Hey... What're you two doin' talkin' behind my back?... \nCLARE Betsy needed help. I obliged. \nINDIANA Since when did you become the female Sigmund Freud? \nINT. TANK \nIndy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at Gutterbuhg. \nINDIANA How do I work the big gun? \nGutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games. He LOOKS at Kezure. \nINDIANA Want your souvenir? (grabs Gutterbuhg's left arm) Start with his good arm. \nKezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT. \nGUTTERBUHG W-W-Wait!... Please!... \nIndy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel. \nGUTTERBUHG There. That is what you want. \nIndy NODS. He TURNS to the switches. \nEXT. RAVINE \nCLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area. \nINT. TANK \nIndy HITS the gas. \nEXT. RAVINE \nThe tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above. The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path. \nThe tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS that surround the mountain. \nINT. TANK \nIndiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN \nThe tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK, BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops. The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank. \nINT. TANK \nIndy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN \nThe dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED. CRACKED. \nINT. TANK \nIndiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS. SCREAMING. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN \nThe injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE. And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS! They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders. \nINT. TANK \nIndiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN \nThe tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank. \nThe tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN! \nIndiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla. The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE! \nTyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS. UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns, seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE. They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING Indy. \nScraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank. Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki. \nINDIANA (pointing to Gorilla) Tell him to take off my stuff! \nThrough laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket, RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana. \nTyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people. The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM, ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward. Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward the MOUNTAIN TOP. \nAROUND THE CORNER \nIndiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY on Scraggy's leash. \nGUTTERBUHG Your friend makes a wonderful interpreter. \nIndy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy. \nGUTTERBUHG \"The Nazi Party will exist for one thousand years...and I wish to be alive for every year!\" (pause) That is a favorite philosophy of our feuher. \nINDIANA Your feuher's philosphies belong on a bathroom wall. \nGUTTERBUHG (angry, slapping Indy across the face) This is a very serious matter, Doctor Jones. It could save your life. (pause) I understand that somewhere in this City...there is a Garden of... Immortal Peaches?... (Indy doesn't respond, Gutterbuhg continues) I want information about this Garden... And I would greatly appreciate it, if you would share everything you know, with me. \nINDIANA I don't share anything with Nazis. \nGutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING look to Indiana. \nGUTTERBUHG Very well. My friends will be here soon. They will rest...enjoy the pleasures of my newfound kingdom... (kisses a woman, and pushes her away) Then we shall exterminate these worthless people! Destroy their City! And we will carry away all of its riches...in pieces. \nGutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE with Indiana. \nCUT TO: \nTHE NAZI ARMY \nTRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to his driver, who REPORTS to Mephisto. \nDRIVER (German, English subtitles) Sir... We shall reach the mountain top in less than sixty minutes. \nMephisto NODS. ANXIOUS. \nCUT TO: \nTHE LOST CITY - COLISEUM \nAn enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the village. All GATHERED for a special event. \nGutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET. \nTWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box. Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS. \nBetsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members, all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS. \nIndy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana. \nA DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana. \nGUTTERBUHG Doctor Jones... Those beasts are anxious to run wild. Free. (vicious smile) How long will you be able to ride... before they TEAR YOU IN TWO? \nIndy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED. \nGUTTERBUHG Goodbye, Doctor Jones. \nGutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS. \nINDIANA Heil Hitler! \nUpon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his mechanical arm in a \"Heil Hitler\" POSE. \nGUTTERBUHG Heil Hitler! \nThe FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating. \nThe crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED. \nScraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER! \nGutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo. Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP from their seats. CHASING the Nazi. \nEXT. COLISEUM \nGutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through. ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER. They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO THE MOUNTAINS. \nINT. COLISEUM \nIndiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT. WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone. \nINDIANA Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta move fast. \nScraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki, their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm. HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum walls. \nEXT. CITY \nCUT TO: \nSCRAGGY AND THE CREW MEMBERS \nThey stand at the CITY GATE. PROTECTING the City entrance. They hurriedly load a large, wooden CATAPULT with a huge BALL OF HAY. A crew member TORCHES the hay. It BURSTS INTO FLAME. Scraggy CRIES \"Fire!\" His men LAUNCH the fireball. It SAILS over the City Walls. \nTHE FIREBALL \nLANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the side of a mountain wall. \nCUT TO: \nA NAZI TANK \nROLLS toward the city. Its GUN BARREL aimed at the city walls. CAMERA PANS AWAY, SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THE TANK. CAMERA MOVES UPWARD, TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A GROUP OF GORILLAS are beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine. \nOn the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS, MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP! \nThe apes SWING from the mountain. RIDING the vines. TOWARD the tank. The Gorillas LAND on the tank. They CLIMB aboard. EXPLORING the tank's surface. \nINT. TANK \nFILLED with Nazis. The gunner looks into the PERISCOPE. He is met with the reflection of a SNARLING GORILLA'S FACE. He SCREAMS and JUMPS BACK. \nThere is a sound of RIPPING METAL. Suddenly, the tank's top HATCH is TORN OPEN. COUNTLESS GORILLAS pour inside! The apes ATTACK. OVERPOWERING the Nazis. \nEXT. TANK \nAs the Gorillas climb inside of the tank, Betsy SWINGS across the passageway to Clare. She EXCHANGES a congratulatory handshake with Clare. Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE. A SHOCKING SIGHT. \nA GROUP OF NAZIS have climbed to the mountain top. The soldiers SPOT Clare and Betsy. They RUN TOWARD the women. Betsy and Clare DASH OFF. Into the THICK of the jungle. The Nazis FOLLOW. In HOT PURSUIT. \nCUT TO: \nTWO LARGE CANVAS TRUCKS \nBARRELLING along the mountain path. KEZURE, the Pirate King, LEAPS from the side of the path, between the two trucks. Kezure climbs onto the REAR BUMPER of the FIRST TRUCK. The DRIVER of the SECOND TRUCK spots Kezure. He begins to FIRE SHOTS at the Pirate King. As bullets whiz by him, Kezure hurriedly removes a thick METAL CHAIN from around his neck. He securely CONNECTS the two truck BUMPERS with the chain. \nINT. SECOND TRUCK \nFilled with NAZI TROOPS. SEATED. ARMED. Waiting to FIGHT. There is a sudden RIPPING SOUND. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The NAZIS are STARTLED to see the BLADES OF COUNTLESS SWORDS. PIERCING the canvas. Through all SIDES of the truck. SEVERAL PIRATES leap through the canvas. ATTACKING the Nazis. The Nazis FIGHT BACK with bayonets and daggers. \nINT. FIRST TRUCK - CABIN \nTwo Pirates BURST into the cabin. They STAB the Nazi driver. The CACKLING Pirates take control of the steering wheel. They madly STEER the truck toward the steep EDGE of the mountain path. \nTHE FIRST TRUCK \nPLUMMETS over the eage. The second truck, ATTACHED by the metal chain, FOLLOWS the first truck. The two canvas trucks FALL into the moat! SPLASHING into the shark infestea waters! \nCUT TO: \nINT. CITY \nThe Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN. \nGutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE. It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful electrical blast. \nIndiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof. Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall. FOLLOWING Indiana. \nEXT. ROOFTOP \nGutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge. \nIndiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE... FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi RELIGHTS the fuse. \nIndy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the dynamite. \nIndiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop, between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT. Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED. \nTHE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any second! \nGutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY, revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED. \nIndiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS. \nMEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS. \nCUT TO: \nTYKI \nA very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TANK \nThe Gorillas, still dressed as NAZIS, continue to DRIVE THE TANK FORWARD. \nEXT. TANK \nThe tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED. \nINT. TANK \nThe Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING. \nCUT TO: \nKEZURE AND THE PIRATES \nThey have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to the snapping sharks... \nSuddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line. Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY. \nOn the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating Kezure's earlier threat. \nSCRAGGY You owe me, old man. \nKezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city. The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED. But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY. \nScraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color LEAVES his face. \nSCRAGGY'S P.O.V. \nA group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face. \nScraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words... \nCLARE He's...dead... \nTEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT. The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN. SILENT. \nA SLOW DISSOLVE: \nCLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY. \nIt is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long \nFUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall. \nHe FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession FOLLOWS. \nINT. WALL \nThe procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER. Indiana's body is CARRIED through. \nTHE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES! \nA breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS. Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is PUZZLED by the bright sunlight. \nBETSY But... It's... It's the middle of the night... \nTyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy. \nSCRAGGY Sun always shine in the Garden of Immortal Peaches. \nClare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy. \nKEZURE These are the peaches that make one ...forever young?... \nScraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden. Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala. \nA few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small, glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy. \nCLARE What does it say?... \nSCRAGGY (translating) \"Our Lord... Our Master... Sun... Wu... Kung\" \nTHE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING. Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the still body of Indiana. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY GATES - THE FOLLOWING MORNING \nIndiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members, have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are saying \"Goodbye\" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES. \nClare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for his help. Betsy says \"Goodbye\" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls. \nIndiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor ARRIVES. \nDISSOLVE T0: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - A FEW HOURS LATER \nEarly AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST. They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members. \nIndiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in front of him. He SMILES at Indiana. \nKEZURE She is a wonderful treasure... Eh?... \nINDIANA We had a deal. \nKEZURE (moves sword closer to Indy's throat) I have no deals with dead men. \nINDIANA Son of a bitch. \nKezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana. \nKEZURE (shrugs, laughs) I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do you suddenly expect me to treat you with kindness and fairness?... It is not my way of life! \nIndy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and the others. \nKEZURE Kill them... (takes another bite of the peach) But save their hair. I will make a coat out of it. \nThe men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members. Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the GROUND. \nIndy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN. \nThe Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR. \nKezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground. \nThe remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the mountain. SCARED to death! \nIndiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED. \nBETSY I thought the peaches promised immortality...eternal youth?... \nINDIANA The garden of immortal peaches promises life only to those who are pure in heart. (pause) Kezure was evil. His heart was filled with greed. \nIndiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOZAMBIQUE - DOCK - A FEW DAYS LATER \nPassengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States. INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden crate, covered with the words \"FRAGILE\". The Golden Hooped Rod is obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself. \nINDIANA Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in five minutes... \nSuddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND. It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered, bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word \"TAXI\" is painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana. Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy. \nSCRAGGY Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you something for your journey! \nScraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy. \nSCRAGGY Take one drink before bed. It keep out all bad spirits. \nIndy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat pocket. \nINDIANA Thanks, Scraggy... \nBut this'll keep out all the bad spirits. Scraggy SHRUGS. They are suddenly INTERRUPTED. \nBETSY (O.S.) Indy!... \nIndiana TURNS. BETSY and CLARE walk toward him. Indy LOOKS at Betsy. PUZZLED. \nINDIANA Where're your bags? \nBETSY I'm not leaving. \n", "test1_input": "INDIANA JONES IV \nINDIANA JONES IV a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Monkey King a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life \nA Screenplay by Chris Columbus \nFIRST DRAFT \nUNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling, fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the fly, deciding whether or not to bite. \nCAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD. A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT. \nIt is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake, surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the entire area. \nTITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937. \nSuddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face. CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his catch. \nA VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE. \nMACGOWAN (O.S.) Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !... \nIndy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the line. \nINDIANA'S POV \nCountless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny, bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache. MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy. \nMACGOWAN We need your assistance! \nINDIANA (struggling with the fishing line) C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite I've had all week... \nMACGOWAN Please... It's very importantl... \nIndiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back to shore. \nTHE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER \nNIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING... their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows. \nAn expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES to MacGowan. \nINDIANA Do you value our friendship, Mac? \nMACGOWAN More than me' nightly pint. \nINDIANA Then this better not be some wild goose chase... \nMACGOWAN T'ain't wild geese we're after, Doctor Jones. You got me' word on that... (sincere) ...and a MacGowan's word is truer than an angel's kiss! \nThere is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager. \nA CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance, as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock. The villagers WHISPER among themselves. \nYOUNG MAN Scotty Ferguson. \nOLD WOMAN He's the eighth. \nMAN Just like the others...all his bones busted...crushed... \nOLD MAN Whatever's killin' people around here ain't human. \nWOMAN (pointing OFFSCREEN) It's there! Again! \nThe woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS. \nThe woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE \nAN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE. \nAn enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers, lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small, flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW. \nIndiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to the castle's upstairs window. \nMACGOWAN That light...only burns after a murder's been committed. \nINDIANA (nods, turning toward the castle) Let's go. \nThe villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin' in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING himself to be strong. \nMACGOWAN Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're here for...eh, men?...ah... (points to men) Hennesey... Galbraith... Bottomley... You're comin' with us. \n", "test1_true": "ELDERLY WOMAN May God help them. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CASTLE DOORS. \nTwo enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons, serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window. The candle still FLICKERS. \nA long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle stairs. \nIndiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches. \nBehind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS, holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors. \nINT. CASTLE \nIndy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms. \nHENNESEY It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could a human bein' survive?... \nHearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW. \nIndiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT. MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac. \nINDIANA This guy's got one hell of an ego. \nMACGOWAN Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say 'e walks the moors every midnight... others claim e's been dead for years... \nIndy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance. Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their pistols. They FOLLOW. \nINT. ROOM \nA BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room in ORANGE LIGHT. \nIndiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY... \nThere is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh has SOBSIDED. \nMacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE! \nMACGOWAN Hennesey?... Hennesey?... \nGALBRAITH (panic) 'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a second ago... Standin' right beside me!... \nTHE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM. \nINT. CASTLE \nIndy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES. MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the others to FOLLOW. \nINT. BASEMENT \nA decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN with their every move. \nMacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing! FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY. MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING. \nMACGOWAN Thanks for catchin' me. \nINDIANA I'd rather be catchin' trout. \nThey CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large, MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS. There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the ringing bell is much LOUDER down here. \nIndiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the liquid. He TASTES. \nINDIANA Interesting blood type... \nThe Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES. \nINDIANA Cabernet sauvignon. 1897. \nIndy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith CRIES OUT. \nGALBRAITH (pointing OFF SCREEN) Look! \nEveryone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS. Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening. He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind. \nBEHIND THE DOOR \nA FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE! \n", "test1_id": 2112, "test2_input": "POSTMAN (staring at Indy's signature, puzzled) What's this? \"B+\"? That's how you sign your name? \nIndy GRABS the paper. He's signed a \"B+\" on the LINE where his name is supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name. Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana. \nDEAN COVENTRY Marshall University is not the place for sloppy behavior... \nAt that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE from the envelope. It reads, \"A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN ANGEL'S KISS\". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy. \nDEAN COVENTRY I have one final warning for you, Doctor Jones -- \nTHE PHONE RINGS! INTERRUPTING the Dean! Indiana quickly ANSWERS the phone. A FUMING Dean Coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat. Indiana SPEAKS into the receiver. \nINDIANA Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look, can you hold on?... (back to Dean) You were saying, sir? \nDEAN COVENTRY Either you begin concentrating on your -- \nINDIANA (interrupted by phone) Yes, Marcus... I'm still here... Just hold on! (back to Dean) I'm very sorry, sir... \nDEAN COVENTRY (boiling) -- concentrating on your teaching duties or -- \nINDIANA (into phone) Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here with Dean... What?.. Just how important?... (listening, impatient) It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes. Yeah. I'll be right over. But this better be important, Marcus! \nIndiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red faced Dean. \nDEAN COVENTRY You are on probation, Jones! Ten days! If there is no improvement, you will be dismissed! \nThe Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his way through the crowd. \nINDIANA I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have all of these graded...and DRIED! \nIndiana continues making APOLOGIES and EXCUSES. The obnoxious student again SHOUTS at him. \nVIRGIL VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I... R... \nINDIANA (hands him paper) \"F\"! \nVirgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED \"F\"! Indiana EXITS the room. \nINT. HISTORY MUSEUM - PREHISTORIC ROOM \nThe large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath his arm. Indiana is very IMPATIENT. His eyes dart to a full sized skeleton of a TYRONOSAURUS REX. \nINDIANA This better be important, Marcus... or the museum will soon be displaying my bones. My teaching career is in danger of extinction. \nMARCUS (smiles) You will not be disappointed, Indiana. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright, wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in the CLOUDS. \nMARCUS (O.S.) ...Look familiar? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper, Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the painting of Sun Wu Kung. \nINDIANA \"Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey King\". Big deal. That was ten years ago, Marcus. (going back to papers, wanting to change subject) Geez! This Heller kid's got the worst grammar. \nMARCUS Ten years or fifty years. It will always be in your blood. \nINDIANA (ignoring Marcus) Don't believe this... He spells \"repeat\" with two \"E's\". \nMARCUS Think back, Indiana. Remember your desire? Your passion? \nINDIANA (still ignores Marcus) Kid gets an \"A\" on content...a \"D\" on form. \nMARCUS (angry, slams his fist on the desk) Damn it, man! You can't bury those feelings forever! \nIndiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his head. \nINDIANA Two years. Nearly two years of my life...looking for the remains of that Monkey...a piece of his legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or some sign of the Lost City. (shakes his head) Nine men perished on the journey. Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered... (looks back to papers, in a near whisper) We still came back empty handed. \nMARCUS (threading the projector) One mustn't give up so easily, Indiana. \nINDIANA Give up?!?... Marcus, we spent thirteen months in China!...another seven in India!... \nMARCUS But none in Africa. \nINDIANA (puzzled expression) There was no proof...archeological or anthropological...to indicate that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited Africa... \nMARCUS Until now. \nMarcus TURNS OFF the room lights. \n", "test2_true": "Marcus STARTS the projector. A BLACK AND WHITE image flickers on the far wall. We see a PYGMY, standing in what appears to be a grassy area. The pygmy's name is TYKI. He is ADORABLE. A little Over FOUR FEET TALL, his body is TAUT, MUSCULAR. His long black hair is SHAGGY, his eyes are WIDE and BRIGHT. Almost CHILDLIKE. His face is CUTE. IMPISH. Covered with a very INQUISITIVE expression. Tyki's energy is BOUNDLESS. He cannot stop MOVING. Standing BESIDE Tyki, is \nDR. CLARE CLARKE. 32 years old. A tall, strikingly BEAUTIFUL woman. She is COMMUNICATING with Tyki in sign language. \nMARCUS The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The famous zoologist. She works in Africa, studying animals in their natural habitat. \nINDIANA Very interesting, Marcus. Now if you'll turn the lights back on -- \nMARCUS (continuing) Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke discovered that cute little fellow... \"Tyki\"...a pygmy of an unusual race...unrelated to any known African tribe... \nINDIANA (bored) Marcus. The lights. \nMARCUS Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes from the Lost Civilization of Sun Wu-Kung. \nIndiana PAUSES. He STANDS, walking closer to the flickering image. Suddenly INTERESTED. \nINDIANA What?... But how did Miss -- \nMARCUS \"Doctor\". \nINDIANA \"Doctor\" Clake. How did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis? \nMARCUS The pygmy speaks in a language that has no African origins...but bears a strong resemblance to Chinese. \nINDIANA Means nothing. The rivers of Africa have been plagued by various Oriental Pirates and Scavengers since the 16th Century. (turns from screen) Not much evidence, Marcus. \nMARCUS There's more. The pygmy was found wearing an ornamental peach stone around his neck...believed to come from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden Of Immortal Peaches. \nINDIANA (skeptical) Marcus, there are countless undiscovered African tribes...all with various obscure beliefs and practices... (smirks) One tribe may wear peach stones... another may wear banana peels... \nIndiana WALKS back to his papers. Marcus PAUSES. \nMARCUS There is one final bit of evidence... \nINDIANA Enlighten me. \nMARCUS The pygmy is over 200 years old. \nIndiana ADJUSTS his spectacles. He STARES at the black and white image. The cute pygmy appears to be in his MID-TWENTIES. He walks to the CAMERA, STARING into the lens. Tyki examines the camera with CURIOSITY. \nINDIANA That's impossible. \nMARCUS Dr. Clarke has done a considerable amount of testing on the pygmy's clothing...his sandals...everything was over 200 years old. \nINDIANA (skeptical) He's probably wearing his Great Grandfather's stuff. \nCAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image. Tyki begins to UNSCREW the camera lens. The picture goes OUT OF FOCUS. The film RUNS OUT. Marcus TURNS OFF the projector and flips ON the overhead room lights. Indiana gives Marcus a PUZZLED look. \nINDIANA What does all of this have to do with me? \nMARCUS Dr. Clarke wants to mount an expedition to find the Lost City of Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar with your reputation...she'd like you to come along. \nINDIANA (gathering his papers) No chance. \nMARCUS There will be money involved... The museum is willing to fund the expedition... \nINDIANA Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this bridge. \nIndiana TURNS and begins to WALK out of the room. Marcus CALLS him. \nMARCUS Indiana... \nIndy TURNS. He WAVES the papers at Marcus. \nINDIANA Marcus. Please. I've got to finish these... \nMARCUS You've got to finish something much more important. You crossed the threshold over a decade ago...and it's been tearing at your insides ever since. (passionate) My friend, if there is even one iota of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings... then you can lift the veil of mystery that has surrounded this Chinese legend for Centuries. You may uncover the secrets to a Lost Civilization...and possibly, to man's never ending search for immortality. \nIndiana STARES at the painting of Sun Wu Kung. \nMARCUS Indiana... Can you afford to pass up the single most important adventure of your life? \nIndiana has NO ANSWER for Marcus. Indy PICKS up the painting. A THRILLING expression slowly covers Indiana's face. His eyes GLIMMER. Filled with a long, lost EXCITEMENT. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP: THE STACK OF TERM PAPERS \nThe papers are slightly CRUMPLED. Still WET. A DROP OF WATER hits the papers. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. BETSY TUFFET, Indy's student assistant, sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that evening. \n", "test2_id": 2113, "test3_input": "INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags. His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase. Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at Indy. \nBETSY You can't do this to me! \nINDIANA (shaking tears off the papers) C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin' 'em all wet again. \nBETSY You just can't go away...I mean... Africa is so far away, and...well... (heartfelt) I love you, Indy. \nINDIANA Thought we agreed this was s'posed to be casual... \nBETSY You call what happened last night \"casual\". \nINDIANA My dear...a momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make. \nBETSY (very upset) Momentary lapse! So that's all I am to you! \nBetsy SHOOTS to her feet, walking OFF SCREEN. \nINDIANA Betsy... Wait... \nIndiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to READ, making a few CORRECTIONS. \nWe see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed. \nIndiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN. \nOne end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair. Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor. \nINDIANA (angry) Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin' to ruin my whip!... \nBETSY If I can't have you... I don't want to live. \nIndiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON. \nINDIANA Drink this. You'll feel better. \nIndiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE her body with the liquid. \nIndiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match, moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the shoulders. \nINDIANA C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of yourself. You're young. There are a lot of other guys... \nBETSY Not like you. \nINDIANA (succumbing to his ego) That's true... (realizing his mistake) But that's no reason to stop living! Besides, I'm too old for you. By the time you're seventy five, I'll be... (calculates, the thought of it makes him grimace) Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting. \nIndiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section of BOOKSHELVES. \nMeanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase. \nCLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's head. \nIndiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase. \nThe urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly around Indiana. \nBETSY Don't leave me, Indy! \nIndiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy. \nINDIANA (cruel) Look... You're just a flighty kid. Twenty minutes after I walk out this door, you'll have a date with the college Romeo. Two hours from now, you'll be madly in love with him. By tomorrow, you'll forget I ever existed. \nHurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face. \nBETSY Never underestimate the determination of a Brooklyn girl, Doctor Jones. Never. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT - AN OCEAN LINER \nThe SILHOUETTE of the ship sails across the water. A beautiful ORANGE SKY fills the background. \nINDIANA JONES \nstands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He anxiously AWAITS his adventure. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMAP OF THE WORLD \nA MOVING RED LINE traces Indiana's journey across the ocean, toward AFRICA. The red line comes to a stop at MOZAMBIQUE. \n", "test3_true": "Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS, SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story, low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area. \nAn OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS AROUND, expecting to MEET someone. \nINDY'S POV - THE DOCK \nThere is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way. A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word \"TAXI\" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS. \nUpon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES. \nAt the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP! \nSCRAGGY BRIER \nIndiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough, unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet. \nScraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS... \nSCRAGGY Indy! At last we are reunited! (looks to sky) Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship...I thank you for granting my wish! \nIndy RESTS Scraggy back onto the ramp. Scraggy MOVES to assist Indiana with his luggage. Before picking it up, Scraggy RAISES his arms over the baggage. Again, he BLESSES the suitcases. Scraggy then PICKS UP the bags. Indy CHUCKLES. \nINDIANA I see you haven't changed, Scraggy. \nSCRAGGY Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say... \"Before body make contact with foreign object...one must cast out bad spirits, or -- \" \nINDIANA \" -- or bad spirits will enter your body!\" \nSCRAGGY Yes! You have excellent memory, Indy. \nINDIANA I should! Last time we saw each other...you made me wear the same clothes for 3 weeks straight. \nSCRAGGY Never separate body from clothes, or bad spirits will hide in pockets! \nINDIANA In other words... If people never changed clothes...there would be no evil in the world. \nSCRAGGY Exactly! \nINDIANA (chuckles, puts his arm around Scraggy) I missed all a' your crazy philosophies, Scraggy. \nSCRAGGY They not so crazy, Indy. (serious, eyes wide with fear) These days... There is much evil in the air. I feel it. Everywhere. \nIndy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see that this is the SLEEVE OF A GERMAN SOLDIER. CAMERA STOPS on the face of \nSGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG \nA thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE. STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side. \nGutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER. Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it. \nGUTTERBUHG (German, English subtitles) Are we making contact? \nThe mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING SMILE. \nMeanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of him. Scraggy RUNS to the open door, scolding the person INSIDE. \nSCRAGGY Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr. Jones?... \nDR. CLARE CLARKE \nSTEPS OUT of the shadows of the car. We RECOGNIZE her from Marcus' film, but she is even MORE BEAUTIFUL in person. She is the SAME AGE as Indy. Her hair is BRIGHT RED. She removes her glasses, revealing sparkling GREEN EYES. She is very PRIM. Very PROPER. But extremely INTELLIGENT and QUICK WITTED. She is dressed in KHAKI SLACKS and SHIRT. She speaks in a slight BRITISH ACCENT. She hurriedly ASSISTS Indiana to his feet. \nCLARE Dr. Jones! Forgive me. \nINDIANA No sweat. \nCLARE Thought I was being attacked by a degenerate sailor. \nINDIANA No. Just a degenerate archeologist. \nCLARE Your appearance is deceiving. \nINDIANA Likewise. \nThey exchange a handshake and a SMILE. Immediately ATTRACTED to each other. \nPORTER (O.S.) Indiana Jones! Calling passenger Indiana Jones! \nIndiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front of him. \n", "test3_id": 2114}

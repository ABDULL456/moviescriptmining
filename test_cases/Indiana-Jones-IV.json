It rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS. \nA TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an order to his men. \nMACGOWAN Galbraith... You come with me! We'll search for Hennesey... Out here! Bottomley... You go with Doctor Jones... (finger shaking, points to inside of crypt) In there. \nMacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS. \nINT. CRYPT \nIndy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes. Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER... \nIndiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER. Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by his feet, is the DEAD BODY of \nHENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING. \nBottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm. \nINDIANA Let's get outta' here. \nIndy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help. \nBOTTOMLEY Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open the door! \nUsing his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK, another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley. \nINDIANA (motioning to candle) I need more light. \nBottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy TURNS from the door. \nINDIANA Bottomley?... \nNO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD. \nINDIANA Bottomley?... \nAGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a SHOCKING SIGHT! \nBOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt. There is NO SIGN of anyone. \nINDIANA Who is it?... Who's there?... \nThe same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE! \nIndy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back his hand. His fingers are BURNT. \nINT. BASEMENT \nMacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.

There's some kinda' hot ice coverin' the... \nIndiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM! \nIndy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS! \nIndy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING HIS GRIP. \nSeconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy SWINGS DOWNWARD. \nINT. ABYSS \nAt the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge SNAPS! \nIndiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH! \nBOTTOM OF THE HOLE! \nA POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS. \nINDIANA NOW they bite! \nIndy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND. Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side. \nTWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other... and Indy's HEAD! \n", "test1_true": "UNDERWATER \nIn desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE. But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside. \nA WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS. CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet. He finds himself STANDING in the fountain. \nINDY'S POV \nHe is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE. \nAt the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron. \nTwo powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair. Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat. \nIndiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense. Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron. \nINDIANA Excuse me, sir...? Hello...? \nBaron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He speaks LOUDER. \nINDIANA Canyou hear me?... \nCLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE \nBaron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings. \nINDIANA \nstill WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy is ANNOYED. \nINDIANA Listen, pal... There are two dead Policemen upstairs and... \nThe Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY. TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG Indy to the floor. \nBaron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to the scene before him. \nIndiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana. \nIndy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack. For a MOMENT. \nTattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He RUNS. \nThe Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths FOAMING. \nBaron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action. \nIndy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain. \nThe FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The dog is TRAPPED. \nIndy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window. The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW! \nEXT. WINDOW \nThe Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room. \nINT. BANQUET ROOM \nBaron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana walks toward the Baron. \nINDIANA Chow time's over, mister. You better start talkin'. \nThe Baron still IGNORES Indiana. \nINDIANA There's a lot of strange things happening around here... \nA SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES. Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS. \nIndiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS. \nINDIANA ...and I want some answers! Do you hear me? (louder) I want some answers! Now! \nThere is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see \nA GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward \nANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED! \nThe black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone crunching grip. \n", "test1_id": 2112, "test2_input": "INDIANA Betsy... \nBETSY (serious) One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear. I'll wake the whole boat. \nIndiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS. \nINDIANA OKay. Just one. (leans toward her, pauses) Keep your mouth closed. \nThey KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a PASSIONATE KISS. \nAt that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM. An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers her face. \nTHE FOLLOWING MORNING \nSUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY. \nIndiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy GLANCES to her. CURIOUS. \nINDIANA What's that you're writing?... \nCLARE \"The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana Jones, Professor Of Perversity\". \nINDIANA (back to shaving) Very funny. \nCAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT. \nScraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered with SHOCK. FEAR. \nINT. LOWER CABIN - KITCHEN \nBetsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES \nAN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK. FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet. THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of the kitchen. \nINDIANA \nhas nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him. \nINDIANA You are blowing this Betsy thing all out of proportion... \nIndiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED. UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He still tries to REASON with Clare. \nINDIANA It's not as if I have this sleazy reputation... \nClare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket. ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head. \nINDIANA I am a respected...honored... admired... \nClare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and Clare TURN. \nTHREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED, they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER... \nSuddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to SWORDFIGBT the Pirates. \nClare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear- like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder. \nThe river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING. \nUsing her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD. ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on. \nBETSY C'mon... You ain't so tough. You wouldn't last ten minutes in Brooklyn. \nThe Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT. \nIndiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He TURNS. \nA PIRATE SHIP \nhas APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS. COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND ARROWS and CANNONS. \nEXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK \nKEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat, to the Pirate Ship. \nINDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER. \nIndiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS and FLYING ARROWS. \nEXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK \nThe swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY. Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill. He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy gives her a THANKFUL NOD. \n", "test2_true": "Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the Pirate Ship.

Getting LOWER...LOWER... \nEXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK \nClare has been TIED to a mast pole. Kezure STANDS in front of her. As his men BATTLE around him, Kezure leans forward. The drooling Pirate King sloppily KISSES Clare. Along her NECK. Clare is NAUSEOUS. \nINT. CANNON COMPARTMENT \nIndy and the Pirate continue to FIGHT. The cannon fuse SPARKS. BURNING toward the bottom. The Pirate pushes Indy's head INSIDE OF THE CANNON OPENING. The FUSE will BLOW at any second. At the last moment, Indiana OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES! Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK. \nEXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK \nKezure kisses the bare shoulder of the STRUGGLING, HELPLESS Clare. Indy EMERGES from the cannon compartment. Upon seeing the Pirate King ATTACK Clare, Indiana SHOUTS. \nINDIANA You son of a bitch. \nKezure TURNS. He emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck, curiously STUDYING Indiana. Indy EXTENDS his sword. The Pirate King removes a long, sharp GOLDEN SWORD. They begin to FIGHT. Moving ALONG the deck. A FAST PACED, HEATED swordfight. \nEXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK \nA PIRATE has taken over the boat's WHEEL. He STEERS the river boat OFF THE REGULAR PATH. It SPEEDS toward the base of a LARGE, THRASHING WATERFALL. The Pirate ship moves ALONGSIDE of the river boat, also HEADED for the waterfall. SCRAGGY and BETSY sees the waterfall ahead. PANIC fills their eyes. They DASH to the steering wheel.

Indy SCREAMS above the cannon fire. \nINDIANA (still fighting) Scraggy!... No!... Keep goin' straight!... Full steam ahead!... \nSCRAGGY \nis CONFUSED by Indy's orders. He SCREAMS back to Indiana. \nSCRAGGY What?... You crazy Indy?... We be crushed!... We smash into rock wall!... \nINDIANA \nstill SWORDFIGHTING the Pirate King, SCREAMS to Scraggy. \nINDIANA No!... Trust me!... Full steam ahead!... Full steam ahead !... \nSCRAGGY \nBLESSES himself. His face is STRONG. CONFIDENT. He REVS the engine. FULL SPEED. He TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the wheel.

Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE. It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful electrical blast. \nIndiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP.

Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY, revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED. \nIndiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS. \nMEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS. \nCUT TO: \nTYKI \n", "test3_true": "INT. CITY \nScraggy and his crew members load ANOTHER FIREBALL onto the catapult. Scraggy cries \"FIRE!\" The fireball FLIES over the city walls. It lands DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the Nazi troops who are about to attack Tyki. Many of the soldiers CATCH FIRE. The others RUN from the flames. Tyki is UNHURT. He REJOINS his friends in the battle. \nCUT TO: \nCLARE AND BETSY \nBREATHLESS...FRIGHTENED...they continue to RUN through the jungle. The Nazis are a few feet BEHIND THEM. Moving FAST. Getting CLOSER. The women turn a corner, scramble through a section of bushes and find themselves face to face with...ANOTHER TROOP OF NAZIS. \nClare and Betsy STOP. TRAPPED. SURROUNDED by Nazis. The soldiers MOVE TOWARD the women. The Nazis eyes are LECHEROUS. HUNGRY. Clare WHISPERS to a TREMBLING Betsy. \nCLARE Do exactly what I do. \nBetsy NODS. The Nazis MOVE CLOSER. Clare looks to the SKY. She begins to make BIZARRE...HIGH PITCHED...NOISES. A CONFUSED Betsy makes the same noises. The Nazis LOOK at each other and CHUCKLE. The women CONTINUE to make the sounds. \nSuddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED. \nThere is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds' screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM. The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy. \nCLARE I made the sound of a baby Swandola bird, crying for help... The Mother birds immediately reply to the cries ...angrily protecting their children, and murdering the baby's attackers. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO CANVAS TRUCKS \nThey crookedly FLOAT along the shark infested moat waters. The battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking PIRATE SHIPS. Kezure and the Pirates BATTLE the Nazis along the truck frames. The pirates fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS. \nAt one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for him. The Pirate King DISAPPEARS beneath the water surface. A few of his men PAUSE. WORRIED. AFRAID. Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin. Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames continue to SINK. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TANK \nSeveral Nazis are SPRAWLED on the tank floor. UNCONSCIOUS. UNDRESSED. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. The Gorillas have TAKEN CONTROL of the tank. They have DRESSED THEMSELVES IN NAZI UNIFORMS! \nEXT. TANK \nAs the battle RAGES around them, the Gorilla's tank makes a sudden U-TURN. It heads straight for the SECOND NAZI TANK. \nINT. SECOND TANK \nThe Nazis stare through their PERISCOPE. Puzzled by the sight of their own tank COMING TOWARD THEM. \nEXT. TANK \nThe Gorilla's tank FIRES A DIRECT SHOT at the other Nazi tank. BLAM! The Nazis' tank is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. \nINT. GORILLA TANK \nThe Gorillas break into a VICTORIOUS CHEER. JUMPING. SCREAMING. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COLISEUM \nIndiana WALKS across the coliseum floor. REVOLVER in hand. He moves SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. He is looking for a SIGN of Mephisto. But everything is SILENT. CALM. DESERTED. \nMephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the coliseum stairs. \nIndy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM! Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being CRUSHED by the heavy bells. \nMephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING. \nIndy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind. The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS DIRECTLY OVER the pit. \nBut Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the countless TIGERS. \nThe bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off. \nIndiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into the waiting tigers. \nMephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs. He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED. His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell. This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward. \nMephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL... \nMephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL. Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT. \nMephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY. \n", "test3_id": 2114}

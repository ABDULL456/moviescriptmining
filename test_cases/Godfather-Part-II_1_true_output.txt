INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY 
to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children. 
NEW VIEW 
The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children have been using, and left on a sofa or a table. 
He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the SOUND of a sewing machine running. 
Quietly he opens the door. 
MICHAEL'S VIEW 
into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with her work. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so that she doesn't see him. 
VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE 
onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he moves to the house next to his own. 
INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children, Connie so rarely is there. 
He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers. 
MICHAEL Mom... Mom... 
She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age. 
MICHAEL (Sicilian) It's Michael.  How are you, Mom? 
MAMA (Sicilian) I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile? 
MICHAEL (Sicilian) There are still things I have to do. 
MAMA (Sicilian) Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes? 
MICHAEL Alright.  They bother me once in awhile. (a pause as he thinks) Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead? 
MAMA (Sicilian) You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby. 
MICHAEL (Sicilian) No, I meant lose his family. 
MAMA (as best she ever understood it) Your family?  How can you ever lose your family? 
MICHAEL (almost to himself) But times are different... 
FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER 
Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY 
Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band, playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men, with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the occasion. 
The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with bodyguards following. 
EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY 
The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the garden. 
INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY 
A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given to all of the children. 
All typically American representing some of the prosperity and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war. 
EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY 
The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito shakes hands warmly with the priest. 
INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT 
The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room. We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered by mosquito netting. 
VIEW ALTERS 
and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN. 
We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man. 
EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW 
Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil Depot which is the link to his New York importing business. They go inside. 
INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY 
They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to their new importing business and share a toast of wine. 
EXT. THE BAY - DAY 
A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets. One sings accompanied by a guitar. 
VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN 
He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels, it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little sound. 
Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden by the drying sails. 
EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY 
We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino. Sitting in the car with him is Vito. 
The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter. 
MED. VIEW 
on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don Tomasino is speaking. 
We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders. 
TOMASINO (Sicilian) Don Francesco, if you will honor me, by allowing me to introduce my associate in America, in New York. His name is Vito Corleone. 
The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who has taken the name of this town as his name. 
TOMASINO We will supply him with olive oil exclusively in the town of Corleone. His company is called the "Genco Olive Oil Company." Here we have brought you an indication of how he will sell the product. 
Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion of this business. 
TOMASINO (Sicilian) We have come to ask your blessing and permission to continue this enterprise. 
DON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) (in a shrill, high, raspy voice) Where is this young man? 
TOMASINO He is right here, standing next to me, Don Francesco.

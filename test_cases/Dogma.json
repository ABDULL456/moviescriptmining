{"train": "DOGMA \nEXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAY \nJersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier, the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline. \nAn OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from besmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat. His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises than one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small, satisfied smile cross his face. \nBehind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the boardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a street hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them briefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean. \nThe skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to their faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod. \nTheir skates glide out of frame. \nP.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach. We get closer and closer to him until... \nOne of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales violently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely beating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them. Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head. \nOC VOICE \nI don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the writings Lewis Caroll? \nThe three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse. Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk. \nINT AIRPORT - DAY \nLOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the metal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can. \nLOKI \nLeaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking Glass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the metaphorical meaning? \nNUN \nI wasn't aware there was one. \nLOKI \nOh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized religion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to either the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god, Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a carpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do they do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the oysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to you, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological figures insures the destruction of one's inner-being. \nBARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats popcorn and stares at... \nA steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family. \nOC LOKI \nOrganized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says \"No, no!\" \nBartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him, kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun. \nLOKI \n'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not. \nNUN \n(really dazed) \nI've... I've never really thought about it like that... \n(beat; shocked; off her cassock) \nWhat have I been doing with my life...?'. \nLOKI \nDon't look back. Just get out there and taste life. \n(off donation can) \nLeave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it's another way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you've been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice piece of ass. You deserve it. \nThe Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something. A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the still-transfixed Bartleby. \nBARTLEBY \n(looking OC) \nHere's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God. You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I just heard you claim to be an atheist. \nLOKI \nC'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. I just like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. will she have a bunch to confess. \n(looks around) \nNow here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to come here all the time? \nBARTLEBY \n(off travelers) \nI like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them. \nA reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on, making way for two young LOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately. \nOC BARTLEBY \nAll that tension, all that anger and mistrust, forgotten for one perfect moment when they come off that plane. See those two? The guy doesn't even know that the girl cheated on him while he was away. \nOC LOKI \nShe did? \nBartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals. \nBARTLEBY \nUh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both so relieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could all feel that way more offen. \nLOKI \nMaybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Now what was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? If it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'm going to slug you. \nBARTLEBY \n(still looking OC) \nYou're never going to believe this: we're going home. \nLOKI \n(off Bartleby's popcorn) \nLet me have some? \nBARTLEBY \n(pulls out envelope) \nLook what somebody sent us in the mail. \n(hands him a newspaper article and corn) \nLOKI \nDid you say we're going home? \n(reads) \n\"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!\" \nCampaign.\" \n(to Bartleby) \nAnd? \nBARTLEBY \nKeep reading. \nLOKI \n(reads) \n\"Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent... rededication... \n(to Bartleby) \nAgain - and? \nBARTLEBY \n(snatches article) Give me this \n(getting up; reading) \n\"The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversary is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church back into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to the centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all who pass through it's arches a morally clean slate.\" \n(looks at Loki) \nYou still don't get it, do you? \nLOKI \nNo, I don't get it. Are we leaving now? \nWhat's that? \nLOKI \nLet's kill people. \nA guy beside Loki reacts. Loki smiles at him as the elevator doors close. \nOPENING CREDITS \nBetween black cards with white credits there are shots of the OLD MAN from the boardwalk being wheeled into a hospital on a gurney, being treated in the emergeny room, being hooked up to life support system, and finally resting in an intensive care wing. \nEXT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY \nThe church sits on a grassy knoll in Mc Henry - a suburb of Chicago. Some kids tear by on bikes and egg it. \nOC PRIEST \nThe greater Illinois chapter of the Right to Life foundation will be holding it's bi-annual softball game against the Cook County Pro-Choice league next Sunday at two. \nINT ST. STEPHEN'S PARISH - DAY \nThe PRIEST speaks from the lectern, addressing semi-filled rows of the faithful. \nPRIEST \nThose who find the weekly demonstration outside of \nthe Twelfth Street Planned Parenthood Clinic hard to make due to work schedules are urged to show their support in the fight against the thoughtless and wanton destruction of life by cheering on our boys on the field. Refreshments. as always, will be served. \nDollying down the rows while the Priest rattles on. we pass the parishoners. Some listen intently, others are nodding off. One surreptitiously listens to a Walk-man; a man and a woman quietly argue while their kid colors in a coloring book, going off the page and marking the pew; two kids play cards; one guy leafs through a copy of Hustler hidden by his hymnal book. \nOC PRIEST \nToday's second collection will be donated to the John Doe Jersey Life Fund. For those of you who haven't been following the news, an unidentified homeless man who was accosted and severely beaten at the New Jersey shore last Tuesday lies in critical but stable condition in one of that area's hospitals. He lacks identification and police have had no luck in tracking down any possible family. While he shows no signs of recovery, the Arch-Bishop of the Trenton Diocese has disputed the state's decision to remove the indigent man from life support systems, asking that Catholics all over the country join in this protest against Euthanasia. And finally - will whoever keeps parking in my spot, stop doing that. Thank you. Now, please rise for the recession of faith. We believe in one God, the father... \nAs the congregation flatly joins in the prayer, we stop on BETHANY - a beautiful twenty-something woman who struggles to stay awake. She checks her watch and exhales softly. \nOC VOICE \nI don't really want to be here. \nENT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC - DAY \nA small gaggle of signcarrying RIght-to-Lifer's march in front of the sterile looking building. \nOC VOICE \nBut then again, I guess nobody ever does... except maybe you. \nINT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe source of the voice - a GIRL - sits beside Bethany's desk, stretching out her gum. Bethany offers her an understanding smile. \nGIRL \nYou know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tells me I should be more careful in the future, I should show' some responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time the counselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch. It's kind of hard to take abortion advice from a woman who's too gross to get laid in the first place. \nBETHANY \nI'm not here to lecture you - I'm here to make sure you really want to go through with this. \nGIRL \nI'd rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down he was sterile. Short of that, there aren't many choices left, now are there? \nBETHANY \nEver think about having it? \nGIRL \n(beat) \nWhat woman doesn't on some level. \nBETHANY \nI never did. \nGIRL \n(incredulous) \nYou had an abortion? \nBETHANY \n(lights a smoke) \nMy first year in college. All through high school, I'd dated the same guy - Walter Flanagan. We were really in love, right? So much so. that we decided to go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. So there we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worry about anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it. And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says we should quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screw up our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being there was no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a couple of years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... I mean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we got married and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell for the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to see if everything was okay on my end. \n(beat) \nIt wasn't. \n(takes a drink) \nMy uteran wall had this fissure. It seems that the doctor who performed the procedure on me years before had somehow botched it. I'd never be able to have a child. \nThe Girl's face says it all. Bethany takes a drag and continues. \nBETHANY \nSo there I am - devastated. And now I have to go home to break the news to my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby. And after I explain it to him through my tears, he sits on the couch and rubs his eyes. And in the calmest, most rational voice I've ever heard anybody use in my life, he asks me for a divorce. And I fought him, you know? I tried to talk him out of it; told him there were alternatives - like we could adopt. And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his children. \nGIRL \n(beat) \nWhat happened? \nBETHANY \nHe remarried. He had two kids in two years with his new wife. We never spoke again. And now I do this. \nGIRL \nThat's like... such a sad story. \nBETHANY \nI dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books. He told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong that had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else. Kind of like Batman, he said. The only difference is I don't put on tights to do it... unless all my other clothes are in the wash. \n(smiles and puts out her smoke) \nSo... let's go over your paperwork. \nEXT CLINIC - DAY \nA well-dressed LIZ maneuvers through the small thrall of Right-to-lifer's. They shake their placards at her accusingly. \nPROTESTOR 1 \nYou should be ashamed of yourself! \nPROTESTOR 2 \nChild killer! \nLIZ \n(looking over their shoulders) \nHOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE POPE!! \nAs the thrall turns excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary pontiff, Liz ducks inside the clinic. \nINT CLINIC COFFEE ROOM - DAY \nA NEWSPAPER HEADLINE fills the frame - \"CHURCH SAYS NO TO DEATH OF JOHN DOE\". It's lowered to reveal Bethany, reading. Liz enters and hangs up her coat. \nLIZ \nJesus! You're a Catholic, aren't you? Can't you talk \nto them or something? \nBETHANY \nThey hate me more than you, no doubt. At least you have an excuse - you're ]ewish, \nyou don't know any better. \nLIZ \nI don't think they'd accept that one - we already used it as our excuse for killing Christ. So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us went out for brunch? \nBETHANY \nI went to church. \nLIZ \nThat kills me. You and church. We work in a field that specializes in pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread with them every week. \nBETHANY \nLook at my suit...! \nBETHANY \nTake whatever you want, just don't kill or rape me... \nMETATRON \nEnough with the raping already! I couldn't rape you if I wanted to. \n(unzips pants and pulls them off) \nAngels are ill-equipped. \nBethany stares. There, before her, stands the exposed Metatron. There is nothing where some sexual genitalia should be - it's as smooth and anatomically impaired as a Ken doll. \nMETATRON \nSee? I'm as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll. \n(rings out pants) \nYou meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyone's just waiting to rape you. \nBETHANY \nWh..what are you? \nMETATRON \nI'm pissed is what I am. You go around drenching everyone that comes into your room with flameretardent chemicals? No wonder you don't get laid. \n(pulls pants back on) \nGo get me a towel, will you? \nBethany blinks. She exits the room and comes back with a towel. She holds it out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off. \nMETATRON \n(taking off jacket) \nStand back. \nBethany steps back. Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from it's back, dripping water. Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the wall. \nMETATRON \n(tosses towel away) \nLike I was saying - I am the Metatron. \nBethany stares, saying nothing, pinned against the wall. Metatron looks insulted. \nMETATRON \nMetatron. Don't tell me the name doesn't ring a bell? \nBethany remains silent and wideyed. Metatron gets testy. \nMETATRON \nYou people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right? \n(beat) \nI am a seraphim. \n(beat) \nThe highest choir of angels? \n(beat) \nYou do know what an angel is, don't you? \nBethany slowly nods. \nMETATRON \nMetatron acts as the voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahoo claims to have spoken with God, they're speaking to me. Or they're speaking to themselves. \nBET HANY \n(beat) \nWhy doesn't God speak for himself? \nMETATRON \nAh. So glad you decided to join the conversation. To answer that - human beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome \npower of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, you're mind would cave in and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adam's before we figured that out. \nBETHANY \nAre you going to kill me? \nNi ETATRON \nI could for what you did to this suit. Unfortunately I can't. You're called. \nBETH ANY \n(beat) \nCalled how? How called? \nMETATRON \nAll that from two words. Color this angel impressed. \nBETHANY \n(beat) \nHow do I know you're an angel? \nMETATRON \nOh, you mean besides the fiery entrance and the expansive wingspan? You people kill me. Fine. You want more proof? How about a tequila? \n(snaps fingers) \nINT MEXICAN BAR - NIGHT \nBethany and Metatron sit at a table. Bethany immediately clutches at her pajamas. Metatron waves a WAITER over. \nBETHANY \nWhere the hell are we?! \nMETATRON \nThe only place one can go for good tequila. \n(to Waiter) \nDos tequilas, por favor. And an empty glass. \nWAITER \nSi. \nThe Waiter turns to leave. Metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as he goes. \nMETATRON \nGracias, senor. \nBETHANY \nWe're in Mexico?! \nMETATRON \nActually, we're in the Chilli's down the street from your house, but it was still an impressive trick \n(lights smoke) \nYou don't mind that I lost the wings, do you? I'm trying to keep our profile low. \nBETHANY \nI suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the weirdest dream I've ever had. \nMETATRON \nCan you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have them insist you're a dream? If I had an ego, it'd be bruised. \nBETHANY \nWhat do you want with me? \nMETATRON \nI'm to charge you with a holy crusade. \nMETATRON \nNo, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions will result in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet? \nBETHANY \nIf this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God do something? \nMETATRON \nHe could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turn them into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally. \nBETHANY \nWhy me? \nMETATRON \nBecause of who you are. \nBETHANY \nAnd who am I? \nMETATRON \nThe girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve your purpose. \nBETHANY \nI'll pass. \nMETATRON \nI beg your pardon? \nBETHANY \nWhen some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? When my \nhusband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children - where was \nGod? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in my life, He \nsends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, and as what - \nsome sort of test? To Hell with Him. \nMETATRON \nDo yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your petty crap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you even less now when the fate of existence \nhangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinked out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator. \nBETHANY \nA grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way of saying \n\"fuck you\" to God. \nMETATRON \nAnd any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoy yourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body. So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance to play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it. \n(swigs her drink and spits it out) \nBut I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you should decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't be alone. You'll have support. \nBETHANY \nWhat, more angels? \nNIETATRON \nProphets - although they don't quite get it yet. You'll know them right away - one speaks, the other listens. The one who speaks - and he will at great lengths, whether you want him to or not - will make mention of himself as a prophet. The other one won't say anything, but he'll be helpful \njust the same. \n(looks at watch) \nI have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we're working in a time frame here. \nMetatron moves to exit. \nBETHANY \n(beat) \nHey. \n(Metatron turns) \nYou work for God. \nMETATRON \nThey tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - what with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and expectorating perfectly good tequila. \nBETHANY \nWhat's he like? God? \nMETATRON \n(thinks) \nLonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor. \nBETHANY \nI'll bet. \nMETATRON \nLook at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to look so stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all the time, just for fun. \nBETHANY \nBut we do. \nMETATRON \nI know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs. \nBETHANY \nSex is a joke in Heaven? \nMETATRON \nThe way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too. \nAnd with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-man mariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little Red Corvette'. \nINT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little Red Corvette'. She lays back down. \nINT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY \nBethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl speaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied. \nINT CLINIC - NIGHT \nBethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag and turns on the alarm. \nEXT CLINIC - NIGHT \nBethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking. \nAs her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move toward her. \nBethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for her keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard moving slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly. \nNobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed. \nBETHANY \n(calling into the darkness) \nGod, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it for tomorrow, alright? \nThere's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped against the ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source. \nSuddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her knee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but she ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her purse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his stick. Bethany looks up. \nThe Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They tap their hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and faces them defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her. \nAnd from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing on the ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short and regard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensive stance, Batman-style. \nThe Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew. \nFrom behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into the streetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick. He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in the face, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it into the air behind him. \nThe stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the large figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai. He swings it out before him, knocking the other two Triplets off balance. The smaller figure back flips into the larger figure's arms and kicks his feet into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets. They go down, and the smaller figure leaps forward with a shriek, landing between the fallen pair, elbows into their backs. \nThe flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure, screaming something unholy. The large figure catches the kid by the throat and quickly \nBatman never uses guns. \n(off gun) \nI don't know. It feels impersonal. \nBARTLEBY \nThen don't use a gun. Just lay the place to waste like Sodom and Gommorah. Now that was something. \nLOKI \nOh yeah, for you maybe. You got to stand there and read. I had to do all the work. \nBARTLEBY \nWhat work? You lit a few fires. \nLOKI \nI rained down sulfur, man. There's a subtle difference. \nBARTLEBY \nSure. \nLOKI \nAre you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire. Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the most exhausting activity one can engage in, next to soccer. \n(to Salesman) \nI'll take this one. \nSALESMAN \nFive seventy five to walk with it right now. \nLoki starts sifting through his wallet. \nBARTLEBY \nSoccer? \nINT DINER - NIGHT \nAn English muffin is covered with a knife-full of jam. Bethany raises the bread to her mouth and takes a bite. She glances at the OC pair and stops chewing. \nJay and Silent Bob study her intently. Jay smiles widely, anticipatory, and nods. \nAll three sit at a small table near a window. Bethany puts the English muffin down and brushes off her hands. Jay's feet are moving a mile a minute. \nBETHANY \nAre you both from around here? \nJAY \nI'm hard as hell. \nBETHANY \nDo you live in the city? \nJAY \nDo you have a friend for Silent Bob, or are you going to do us both? If so, I'm first. I hate sloppy seconds. \nBETHANY \nYou're a man of principle. Where do you come from? \nJAY \nWe used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real small town. We practically knew everybody. \nBETHANY \nWhat brought you to McHenry? \nJAY \nHollywood. \nBETHANY \n(beat) \nHollywood? \nJAY \nOh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of this video store. And one day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we did, only we didn't have anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall and popped it into a VCR at Macy's and sat on the floor and watched it. It was called 'Sixteen Candles'. Did you ever see it? \nBETHANY \nYes. \nJAY \nSo the next day we rented 'The Breakfast Club', and then 'Weird Science' where these two fucks have a chick that'll do anything for them and they don't do nothing because it's a PG movie. But then we got thrown out of Macy's when we watched 'Pretty in Pink', because of this bitch. \n(points to Silent Bob) \nBETHANY \n(to Silent Bob) \nWhat'd you do? \nJAY \nYou know how at the end the red-headed bitch gets together with her dream guy at the prom? \n(Bethany nods) \nWell pussy here starts fuckin' sobbing all sorts of loud and shit. And the manager's like \"Get the hell out of here!\" And I'm like \"Fuck you, you bald cocksucker! I'll kick your lard.. \nBETHANY \n(speeding him along) \nSo what exactly brought you to Illinois? \nJAY \nOh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in Illinois. And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson - he was harsh. But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says to Silent Bob \"Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in Shermer, Illinois!\" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a bus. But when we got here, \nyou know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit! \nBETHANY \nAnd now you live here? \nJAY \nFuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with a stupid accent so you don't know what they're saying, and it's too fuckin' cold. We were talking about taking off. Until we met you, that is. \n(kisses her hand) \nBETHANY \n(retracts her hand) \nRight. So how much longer are you staying here? \nJAY \nUntil you're ready to skip out and make with the sex. \nBETHANY \nNo. How long are you staying in McHenry? \nJAY \nWe're leaving tomorrow. \nBETHANY \nWhere are you going next? \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nJesus - this broad asks alot of questions. \n(to Bethany) \nBack to Jersey. We've been going straight for like five \nyears now. It's about time for us to retire or something. Enjoy our salad years. No more adventures. \nBETHANY \nI see. \n(defensively) \nWell what do I know from shifting?! Like I ever drove before! \nSilent Bob shrugs and smokes. Bethany walks away, shaking her head. \nJAY \nChicks. \nSilent Bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket. He begins working on the engine as a cross~ountry bus races by. \nINT BUS - NIGHT \nBartleby and Loki sit in the back. Bartleby reads a map and Loki stares at the gun in his lap. A COUPLE makes out in the seat in front of them. \nBARTLEBY \nWe have to pass through three more states to get to New Jersey: Indianna, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. \nLOKI \nWith a very important stop in Cleveland. \nBARTLEBY \nOh right. The Angel of Death Returns. Sounds like a bad movie. \nLOKI \nMovies are bullshit. And don't start with me, airight. The last time you bugged me about my job, you got us sentenced to life in Wisconsin. \n(looks out window) \nAll this time we've been down here, why didn't we ever leave the Cheese? \nBARTLEBY \nHe said to stay where he put us. We feared worse punishment if we disobeyed Him again. \nLOKI \nWhere were we afraid He'd send us? \nBARTLEBY \nNew Jersey. \nLOKI \nNow that, my friend. is irony. \nBARTLEBY \n(beat) \nYou know, maybe you're wrong about this slaughter. How can you even be sure of what incurs the Lord's wrath these days? Times change. Remember when eating meat on Friday was supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass? Or when people weren't even supposed to shop on Sundays? \nLOKI \nThat stuff was small potatoes. The major sins never change. And believe me - I can spot a commandment breaker a mile away. \nBARTLEBY \nSure. \nLOKI \nYou don't believe me? \n(looks around; eyes fall on kissing couple) \nThere. There's one. \nBARTLEBY \n(off couple) \nSo what? They're kissing. \nLOKI \nAdultery. \nBARTLEBY \nThat's a stretch. How do you know they're not dating? \nLOKI \nYou'd know better than me - let's hear it. \nBARTLEBY \nOh, I know the truth. But let's see how boned up on the job you really are. \nLOKI \nA test? \nBARTLEBY \nOf sorts. So what's your proof? \nLOKI \nHe's wearing a wedding band. \nBARTLEBY \nSo? Maybe that's his wife. \nLOKI \nNo married man kisses his wife like that. You get married and the passion dies, man. Don't you ever watch talk shows? \nBARTLEBY \nWhat are you talking about? \nLOKI \nA guy makes his best plays when wooing. When the object of his desire is won, there's no need to expend the effort anymore. He relaxes, satisfied with the spoils of victory, which he then decides isn't so victorious because he's saddled with a life-mate. \nBARTLEBY \nVery romantic sentiment. \nLOKI \nThat's the problem - romance. You think about it :back in the old days, nobody got married out of quote, unquote, love. People married for property', dowries, or to procreate - to immortalize oneself through offspring. When did all this love stuff start? What the hell happened to the status quo? \nBARTLEBY \nThe Troubadors. \nLOKI \nLionel Richie's old group? \nBARTLEBY \nNo, that's the Commodores. The Troubadors were wandering minstrels and dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love. \nLOKI \nSounds like the Commodores. \nBARTLEBY \nThe Troubadors made 'love' fashionable. And their influence altered the balance in a significant fashion. Until them, people got married because they had to. After them, people started 'falling in love'. Romantic courtships became the norm. What started out as simple entertainment made such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates. \nLOKI \nThat's human beings for you - easily misled. From the Garden of Eden to the 'Thigh Master' - thev believe what they're told. I'm telling you - one day they're all going to watch one too many John Hughes flicks and start looking for Shermer, Illinois. \nBARTLEBY \nBe fair. Humans are dumb, but not that dumb. \n(off couple) \nSo is it adultery or not? \nLOKI \n(thinks; to couple) \nExcuse me. \nThe Couple stops kissing. The MAN looks at Loki. \nLOKI \nAre you married? \nMAN \nBecause you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is that you got shit for brains. \nThe Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment. \nGANG LEADER \nWell I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without the explanation. \nJAY \nNo. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine's firing in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass is gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away? Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring a coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through it and stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach. \nThe Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so frightened. \nJAY \nYou think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fucking plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will. \n(thumbs at Silent Bob) \nWhat do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta be with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words - he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he's gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to see the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think of it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't even understand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain it to you. \n(to Silent Bob) \nSilent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches. \nSilent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks at him. \nJAY \nWhat are you waiting for?! \nSilent Bob shrugs. \nJAY \n(flabbergasted) \nYOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!? \nSilent Bob kind of nods \nJAY \n(shocked) \nWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN?!? \nSilent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly. \nJAY \nTHAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK I \nWOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOU \nDIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!? \n(beat) \nHUNHH?!? \nSilent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles. \nGANG LEADER \nWhat was that about a coconut? \nJay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob. \nJAY \nNo gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got no gun! \nGANG LEADER \nOh boys! We have some unfinished business here. \nJAY \n(sheepishly) \nCan we talk this over? \nGANG LEADER \nTell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like. \nBethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. He puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action, smiling. \nJay fumes. \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nI can't believe you. \n(to Gang Leader) \nDo me a favor. \n(points to Silent Bob) \nShoot this piece of shit first. \n(to Silent Bob; disgusted) \nNo gun! \nSuddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay and Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones and begins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins. \nThe Gang watches, perplexed. \nSilent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing. \nSILENT BOB \nHEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT! \nAND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!! \nAND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!! \nWE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW! \nWITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG! \nLEARNING FROM EACH OTHER - \nWHILE WE DO OUR THANG! \nThe Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens and smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up. \nJAY \nNA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME! \nSILENT BOB \n(as Fat Albert) \nHEY! HEY! HEY! \nJAY \nNA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME! \nBethany and Rufus look on. amazed. \nRUFUS \nI thought she looked familiar. \nBETHANY \nWho? \nRUFUS \n(he nods toward the stage) \nSerendipity. \nBethany looks to the stage. \nThe Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow. \nINT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAY \nOh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby, the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on Barney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in the middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in a stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue of the insipid creature. \nDoors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. They chatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters, taking his place at the head of the conference table. \nWHITLAND \nGood morning, shoppers. \nBARTLEBY \n(not liking his job) \nMister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in a third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house to purchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe and toxic materials because it was less costly. \nBartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved. \nBARTLEBY \nYou, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and have never misused your power here. \nShe stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on. \nBARTLEBY \nBut you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than this assembled party. I can't even mention them aloud. \nBartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear. Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland. \nLOKI \nYou're her father, you sick fuck. \nWhitland begins sobbing. \nBARTLEBY \n(to Loki) \nCan I go now? \nLOKI \n(cheerily rubbing his head) \nGo on, you crazy kid. \nBartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others. \nLOKI \nWith the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongst you. Do you know what makes a human being decent? \n(beat) \nFear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fear anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behind your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even from one another. But not from God. \nLoki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around. \nLOKI \nI forgot my little voo-doo doll. \n(looks at Whitland) \nWow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough... \nLoki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure. Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. He sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out a shriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed. Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed. \nLOKI \nI don't believe in voo-doo. \nLoki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doors burst open and Loki storms back in. \nLOKI \nBut I do believe in this. \nGun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in a flurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head with her arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair. \nLOKI \n(smiling) \nIt's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a pure soul. \nShe looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens. \nLOKI \nBut you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed. \nHe quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut. \nOC BARTLEBY \n(cautionary) \nLoki! \nLoki freezes and looks OC. He grimaces and holsters his piece. \nLOKI \n(to woman) \nSorry. Force of habit. \nHe surveys his handiwork and exits. The female Board Member slowly opens her eyes and looks around. \nINT STRIP JOINT - LATER \nJay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the other gangsters and Silent Bob. They laugh and chug their '40's. \nGANG LEADER \n(to Gang) \nWatch this shit. \n(to Jay) \nDo it again, G. Do the Mush-mouth. \nJAY \n(swigs his beer; as 'Mush-mouth') \nHey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert. \nThe Gang laughs hysterically. \nGANGSTER 1 \nFat Albert like a mother fucker and shit! \nBethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away. \nRUFUS \n(elated) \nI forgot you were down here! How long now? \nSERENDIPITY \nThree years this August. What about you - is this another temporary expulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign? \nBETHANY \nWhat does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down here specifically to help me? \nSERENDIPITY \nIs that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once a month, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few days of peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric. \nRUFUS \n(joking) \nArtsy-fartsy bitch. \nSERENDIPITY \nWho you calling artsy-fartsy? \nRUFUS \n(to Bethany) \nSerendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem. \nBETHANY \nLet me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she's a woman. \nRUFUS \nThe girl's not a woman. \n(to Serendipity) \nNo offense. \nBETHANY \nSERENDIPITY \nIn some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch. \nBETHANY \nWhat have I seen that you've been involved with? \nSERENDIPITY \nOff the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example: I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time. \nBETHANY \nNine? \nSERENDIPITY \nThe one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in and he fights them off? \n(Bethany nods) \nI had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of shit. \nRUFUS \nWhich brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing stripping? \nSERENDIPITY \nWell you remember why I left, right? \nRUFUS \nYou were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for your ideas. \nSERENDIPITY \nAnd sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn out real trash. \n(to Bethany) \nSo I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks notice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my fortune. \nBETHANY \nSo what happened? \nSERENDIPITY \nWriter's block. \nRUFUS \nWriter's block? \nSERENDIPITY \nCan you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of the typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write a grocery list. \nBETHANY \nWhat about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them. \nSERENDIPITY \nThat's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second, but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor. \nBETHANY \nWhose? \nSERENDIPITY \nGod's. \nBETHANY \nYou're saying God's a woman. \nSERENDIPITY \nWas there ever a doubt in your mind? \nBETHANY \nThe possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him. \nSERENDIPITY \nI didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person that holds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men. One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the editorial process. \nRUFUS \nAnother one's that you can't jerk off. \nSERENDIPITY \n(to Bethany) \nSee. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests felt threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their fates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - the whole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for the first sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts Sampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist. Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagonists than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined. \nBETHANY \n(stunned) \nGod is a woman... \nSERENDIPITY \nI don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that can create life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mother could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has with humanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, so psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel completely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feel at ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore the aid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who can make it all better is... \nBETHANY \n...mom. God, it makes sense. \nRUFUS \n(to Serendipity) \nShit, you still have a knack for words. \nSERENDIPITY \nNot really useful in my new line of work. \nRUFUS \nWhat about that? Why'd you choose stripping? \nSERENDIPITY \nIn an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own. See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it's dancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me that much - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which results in no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts forms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing to save and enjoy... or sell. \n(takes a drink) \nBelieve me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse. \nRUFUS \nHow long are you going to keep this up? \nSERENDIPITY \nBelieve me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time to time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the prodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore - especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of the aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can't take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as an excuse not to get laid... \n(conspiratorily to Bethany) \n...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand. \nRLFLS \nWell we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. You remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby? \nSERENDIPITY \nSure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience. \nRUFUS \nThey found a way back. \nSERENDIPITY \n(shocked) \nGod no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole? \nBETHANY \nYou know about that? \nSERENDIPITY \nI always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics to destroy existence. \nRUFUS \nINT BASEMENT \nOur heroes cower beneath the floor door. \nJAY \nWhat is that thing? \nSERENDIPITY \nYou ever hear of Golgotha? \nBETHANY \nSkull place. The hill where Christ was crucified. \nSERENDIPITY \n(peering above) \nYeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers, brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you, girlie. \nSilent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips through it. \nBETHANY \nWhat are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting through that door! \nSERENDIPITY \nShit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget what he came for. \nSuddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts. \nRUFUS \n(indicating trickling shit) \nLooks like it's been taking memory training courses... \nSERENDIPITY \n(off trickle) \nJUMP!!! \nThe five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode, dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself off, rolling it around in It's hands. \nSERENDIPITY \nIf anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them out. \nSilent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then, something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others continue moving back. \nBETHANY \nBob, get down! Jay! \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nYou tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor! \nSilent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's hand drops to the floor, and then so does It. \nBethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent Bob. \nBETHANY \n(off Bob's canister) \nWhat was that? \nSilent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob. \nBETHANY \n(reading can) \n'Knocks strong odors out.' \nRUFUS \nWay to go. tubby. \nBETHANY \nWhy would you ever carrs this? \nJay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at jay. \nJAY \nWhat?! \nRUFUS \n(to Serendipity) \nWho has dominion over this thing? \nSERENDIPITY \nOnly Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never allow it. It usually has some kind of backup. \nRUFUS \nCan you get some answers? \nSERENDIPITY \nI can give it a shot. \nBETHANY \nWhat's going on? \nRUFUS \nSerendipity's going to talk to that demon. \nJAY \nCool! Can we watch? \nSERENDIPITY \nNot a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded. \nJAY \nFuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own language! See...? \n(makes the universal metal sign) \nhe'd understand this. \nSERENDIPITY \n(shakes her head; to Rufus) \nWhoever sent this might send mor~. I suggest you take the princess and get as far away as possible. \n(to Bethany) \nI'll do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there's anything helpful. I'll get it to you somehow. \nBETHANY \n(hugs her) \nThank you. And... you're a great dancer. \nSERENDIPITY \nI'm a better juggler. \n(to jay and Silent Bob) \nYou know you're supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets. You should have seen that thing coming. \nJAY \n(to Bethany) \nWhy the hell are we getting yelled at?! \nSERENDIPITY \nJust watch out for Bethany. Go. \nBethany leads Jay and Silent Bob up the stairs. \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nYou had to drag that judgement out. You couldn't just hit and run. \n(to Woman) \nWhen's the next one? \nWOMAN \nSame time tomorrow. \nBARTLEBY \nWhat?! Doesn't this place warrant at least two buses a day? \nWOMAN \nI take it you've never been to the Garden State. Next. \nBartleby and Loki look around. \nLOKI \nThere's no one else here. \nWOMAN \nThen I guess it's lunch time. \n(she shuts her window) \nLOKI \nWe should have learned to drive a long time ago. Infinite celestial power and we can't catch a bus. \nBARTLEBY \nJust shut up, this is your fault. \nLOKI \nYou can either lament over our mass transit folly, or you can listen to my suggestion. \nBARTLEBY \nIt's your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be a simple matter of catching or staying on a bus! \nLOKI \nWhy fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above? \nBARTLEBY \n(stares at him) \nFly? \nLOKI \nWe got wings, right? Let's use them. \nOC VOICE \nI wouldn't suggest that. \nThe pair spin and gawk. \nAZRAEL leans in the doorway. He removes his hat, revealing two stubby horns. \nAZRAEL \nYou wouldn't want to stand out, now would you? \nINT STRIP JOINT BASEMENT - DUSK \nNoMan is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor. Serendipity draws a circle around him with lipstick. Once finished. she takes a glass of water and throws it into No Man's face. It roars to life. The Golgothan shakes of his daze, turning his attention on Serendipity. \nNoMAN \nThe Muse. They told us you were up here. \nSERENDIPITY \nMatter of perspective. NoMan. I like to think of it as 'down here'. I have a few questions for you, sir. \nNoMan \nFree us from these binds, that you may have answers. \nSERENDIPITY \n(heads toward it) \nOkay. \n(stops; sarcastic) \nOh wait. I'm smarter than that. \nNoMan lets out a bellow. \nSERENDIPITY \nFace it, big guy - I'm not releasing you until I get answers. This can go hard or easy. The sooner I get what I want, the sooner you'll be free. Now, you can start by telling me why you're on this plane? \nNoMAN \n(beat) \nLiquidate the Last Scion. \nSERENDIPITY \nSee? That wasn't so hard. Now - who sent you? Was it Lucifer? \nNoMan laughs in a sinister fashion. \nNoMAN \nOur master is no one and all. For a time, he will be prince of this world - and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his whimsy. And then he will sever reality and crush existence, like a thumb punctures a fontanell, giving peace to those who've been without for so long. \nSERENDIPITY \nDid Bartleby and Loki send you? \nNoMAN \nResist no further, Muse. Deliver over to us the conflicted one, that this world may die screaming. No power - divine or inherited - threatens the crusade. You cannot win. Soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned, begging your God to put an end to the madness. And only as being becomes not, will they know that the God of Abraham lay dormant while the dream perished in a blink. Your God is not dead - He's brain dead. \nSERENDIPITY \nShe, you chauvinist bastard - She's brain dead. And no She's not. Stop trying to be so spooky. Tell me who sent vou, or I'll use whatever influence I have below' to make Hell even worse for you. \nNoMAN \nYou speak of Azrael. \n(he laughs) \nWe pity you. Muse. You're still playing the old game. The one that could have made good on your threat is gone. \nSERENDIPITY \nWhat do you mean. gone? He escaped? \nNoMAN \nNo soul escapes Hell, but one. \n(beat - as if It's heard something) \nWould that I could cross the threshold of your confining circle, I would crush your half-life throat. But my Master does not abandon me to this mockery of a prison. We will come back for the girl. And when we do, it will take more than fragrant mist to keep our hands from crushing her head. \nNoMan goes stiff and then limp. His body begins to melt. \nINT TOY STORE - DAY \nAzrael leads Bartleby and Loki through the aisles, passing tons of stuffed animals. \nBARTLEBY \nJesus Christ, Azrael - how'd you get out of Hell? \nAZRAEL \nI told them I was coming up on a routine possession. I don't have much time. If they figure out my ruse, they'll come looking for me. \nBARTLEIBY \nYou lied? \nLOKI \nGo figure. Him. A demon. \n(to Azrael) \nWhy'd you bring us in here? \nHe was big on life? \nRUFUS \nIt was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engaged in that most ancient of life-affirming activities. \nBETHANY \nSex. \nRUFUS \nDebate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive - by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating: we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. We believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and give up. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'm even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity, fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only way I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it? \nBETIIANY \nNot if you believe it's important for people to know. \nRUFUS \nA belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill for it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the Catholic Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether they know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if they're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat. \n(beat) \nAll over a belief. \nBethany nods. Rufus looks around. \nRUFUS \nI haven't seen the moron twins in awhile. \nBETHANY \nThey went to the lounge car to smoke. \n(getting up) \nI'll go find them; make sure they're not getting into any trouble. \nRUFUS \nI'm going to catch a few z's. Forgot how tiring living can be. \nBethanv heads off Rufus looks out the window, then shuts his eyes. \nINT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT \nBethany enters and spots jay and Silent Bob, talking to an unseen party. \nBETHANY \nYou two aren't getting into any trouble, are you? \nJAY \nNope. Just about to smoke a bowl with our new friends. You in? \nBETHANY \nAnd who are your new friends? \nJAY \nThey just got in at the last stop. \nSilent Bob moves over, revealing the new friends. \nJAY \nThis is Larry and Barry. \nBartleby and Loki smile at Bethany. \nLOKI \nJay tells us you're going to sleep with him. \nEXT TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT \nThe train rushes over head. \nINT LOUNGE CAR - LATER \nLoki, Jay, and Silent Bob pass a joint under the table and take quick hits, trying to remain casual. Jay pounds the table happily. \nBartleby and Bethany lay on either side of the table in their booth. \nBETHANY \nYou can smoke up with them if you want. You don't have to keep me company. \nBARTLEBY \nIt's a long trip. There'll be plenty of time later. \n(beat) \nSo why are you heading to Jersey? \nBETRANY \nThere's just this thing there I'm supposed to do. How about you? \nBARTLEBY \nWe're going home. \nBETHANY \nDo you two live together? \nBARTLEBY \nUnfortunately. Do you live with those guys? \nB ETHANY \nGod, no. Not they just sort of adopted me. \nBARTLEBY \nThey're funny as hell. The big one never says a word. \nBETHANY \nI wish the little one would take a cue from him. But they're okay, as far as stoner's go. \nBARTLEBY \nLo... Larry's taken an immediate shine to them, and he usually hates people. \nBETIIANY \nHow long've you two been together? \nBARTLEBY \nAwhile. He's great company. He can be a little flaky sometimes, but we've got a lot in common. \nBETHANY \nHow'd you meet? \nBARTLEBY \nWe were stationed together. \nBETHANY \nSee? That's beautiful. And everyone's always up-in-arms about this 'out-in-the-military' issue. \nBARTLEBY \nWhat do you mean? \nBETHANY \nWell there's all that macho bullshit about it being 'This Man's Army'. And you two meet and hook up while in the service, which is so special - because it's so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to... \nBARTLEBY \n(catches on) \nYou think we're lovers?! Oh no. No, we're not gay. \nBETHANY \n(laughs) \nOh God, I'm sorry'. I just assumed... \nBARTLEBY \nNo. We live together and all, but at the end of the night, I go to my room. and he goes to his. \n(beat) \nBARTLEBY \nDon't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul. \nLOKI \nThat sounds thin. \nBARTLEBY \nFine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst the body count, He won't notice. \nLOKI \nOh, that's being realistic. \nBartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall. \nBARTLEBY \nI'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going to make that otherwise. \nBartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him. \nLOKI \nShit. \nHe follows. \nEXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT \nAnother Newspaper headline regarding 'John Doe Jersey' fills the frame. It is lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift fire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the paper. \nBETHANY \nI don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guys off. \nRUFUS \nA very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be there. \nBETHANY \nAnd what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for God's sake! \nJAY \nHe had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife at your stomach. \nBETHANY \nSemantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question. \nRUFUS \nWell, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy. \nBETHANY \nWhat do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them from going into that church. \nRUFUS \nAnd how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo? \nBETHANY \nI've never killed anything before in my life! \nJAY \nI'll do it. \nRUFUS \nShut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let alone an angel. \nJAY \nFuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy. \nRUFUS \nOh yeah? How' would you do it? \nJAY \nI'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that flick? \nRUFUS \n(ignoring jay; to Bethany) \nKilling an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick. \nBETHANY \nYou say it as if it's easy. \nRUFUS \n(oblivious to Jay) \nProblem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker - and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them - someone with juice. \nBETHANY \nSo then we're screwed? \n(shrugs) \nShit, that's the best news l've heard in days. \nRUFUS \nThis doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them. \nBETHANY \nCount me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor ordered. \nJAY \nI'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die. \nRUFUS \nWhat are you babbling about now? \nJAY \nIf I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be okay, because I know I'm not missing anything. \nBETHANY \nSee? You know it's right when even he's making sense. \nJAY \nBesides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob. \nRUFUS \nSo you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid? \nJAY \n(thinks) \nNo. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid. \nBETHANY \nNow that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally know - why me? \nJAY \nBecause you've got nice tits. \nBETHANY \nI wasn't talking to you! \n(to Rufus) \nWhy me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's come \nclean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come I got tapped? \nRufus looks at her. He shrugs. \nRUFUS \nFamily ties. \nJAY \nRUFUS \nI think we're beyond euphemisms at this point. \n(to Bethany) \nGod's a skee-ball fanatic. \nMETATRON \nLet's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright? \n(to Bethany) \nYes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years - He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children. Isn't that sweet? \nBETHANY \nBut She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're getting at? \nMETATRON \n(to Rufus) \n'She'? I take it she's met the Muse. \n(to Bethany) \nNo, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her. \nRUFUS \nMaybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback. \nM ETAT RON \nNo - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion - He's trapped in a body. \nRUFUS \nSo God's not dead... \nJAY \nHe's brain dead. \nMETATRON \nSo it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves. \nRUFUS \nCan it be Lucifer? \nMETATRON \nThankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as everyone else. \nRUFUS \nThen what about the Golgothan and the Triplets? \nMETATRON \nDon't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one. \nJAY \n(excited) \nYeah? \nSilent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads. \nBETHANY \nDon't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a test? \nMETATRON \nNo, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough - how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God belonged on the back of a milk carton? \nRUFUS \nSo what do we do now? \nM ETAT RON \nI say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas. \nJAY \n(off paper) \nWhy don't we just ask this guy to close the church? \nMETATRON \nI beg your pardon? \nJAY \nHere. \n(hands group the paper) \nBETHANY \n(reading) \n'Glick Takes Heat for Campaign'? \nJAY \nIt's the guy in charge of the church thing. \nBETHANY \n(reading) \n'Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and questionable direction of his church-sanctioned 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign. When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded \"Come on - who doesn't like a pool party?\" \nJAY \nMaybe you could tell him to shut down the church. If it's closed on that day, those guys can't get blessed or whatever - right? \nMETATRON \nGood Lord - he's got a point. \nBETHANY \nI think Silent Bob had a point. But sure - we can go to him and explain the situation somehow. \nRUFUS \n'We'? You're back in? \nBETHANY \nWell, mine is a heritage Divine... and I wouldn't want to let down the family. \n(smiles) \nMETATRON \n(off Silent Bob) \nWell, well, well - the prophets finally live up to their titles. \nSilent Bob shrugs. Jay is trying to look down Serendipity's shirt. She back-hands him. \nTELEVISION SCREEN - COMMERCIAL \nTwo cartoon ALTAR BOYS sift through their bowls of cereal. \nALTAR 1 \nThe same boring cereal again? \nA cheesy CARTOON CHRIST floats down from above. \nCHRIST \nMan cannot live on boring cereal alone! \nALTAR I & 2 \nIT'S JESUS! \nJesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal from his sash. \nCHRIST \nWhy not try Hosties! \nCL on cereal pouring into a bowl. It's shaped like Eucharistic hosts. Milk follows. \nGLICK \n...then these loonies will show up and go nuts, thus endangering the lives of all assembled, including the Governor, the press, me, the leaders of the Council of Churches. Heck, let's not stop there, maybe even God Himself. \nBETHANY \nYou can't say Himself; it could be a woman. \nGLICK \n(rubs temples) \nYour passion for all topics insignificant, including the gender of our almighty lord, tests my patience, people. Now I'm a very important man with very important matters that demand my attention, so if you'll please... \nRUFUS \nI'm telling you man. this ceremony is a mistake. \nGLICK \nThe Catholic Church does not make mistakes. \nRUFUS \nWhat about the church's silent consent to the slave trade? \nBETHANY \nAnd it's platform of non-involvement during the Holocaust? \nCLICK \n(beat) \nAlright, those were mistakes. But one can hardly hold the current incarnation of Holy Mother Church responsible for oversights of old. Now I've indulged you for more time than I should have. Please go. \nBETHANY \nBut tomorrow... \nCLICK \n(losing it) \nTomorrow goes off without a hitch! Do I make myself clear?! I did not labor two years and exhaust eve~ ounce of my being to insure that this ceremony be a cornerstone in the most important liturgical event since Vatican Two just to cancel it at the zero hour at the insistence of a wandering band of pranksters who've targeted me as the focus of their evening's merriment! This occasion is important for the congregation of this parish, for the massive crowds coming for the plenary indulgence, for me, for his Holiness the Pope, and - most importantly - for the 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign! And neither you, nor any other influence short of the hand of God... \n(glares at Bethany) \n... HIM -self will prevent it from occurring successfully! \nHe violently grabs the Miter/shark fin 'swimming' behind the partition. \nGLICK \nAND TAKEOFF MY GODDAMN HAT!!! \n]ay slowly looks over the partition. \nEXT SEASHORE \nThe sun slowly rises. The day has arrived. \nEXT TURNPIKE - EARLY MORNING \nAmidst very little traffic, two figures emerge from the shadows on the Pennsylvania side. Bartleby and Loki step purposefully past the green sign that welcomes motorists to New Jersey. \nINT BAR - DAWN \nThe place is empty, except for Bethany, Rufus, Jay and Silent Bob and A BARTENDER. \nBETHANY \nI can almost see the headlines - if there were going to be any - \"Existence Erased - Thanks to some prick in a scarlet cape. \nRUFUS \nIt's a crime that a guy like him even gets to wear a scarlet cape. \nJAY \nThat ain't no crime. You wanna see a crime? Look what we stole from the guy in the dress. \n(to Silent Bob) \nHand it over. \nSilent Bob pulls a golf club from out of his coat. \nBETHANY \nOh my God. We're going straight to Hell, I know it. \nRUFUS \nYou stole the Cardinal's driver? \nJAY \nI told him to. You know how much these things are worth? That's at least a couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right there. \nBETHANY \nWhat do we do now? \nRUFUS \nLet them keep it. In a couple of hours, it won't matter anyway. \nBETHANY \nNot that - about Bartleby and Loki! \nRUFUS \nWe have no choice but to try to kill them. \nBETHANY \n(to Rufus) \nBut you said they couldn't be killed. \nOC VOICE \nCorrection : they won't be killed. \nThe gang turns to see Azrael sitting at the bar. \nAZRAEL \nAnd just to insure that, we're all going to sit tight, right here, until the two idiots pass through that arch. \nJAY \nHey...! \nBETHANY \nHe wasn't talking about you two. \nOC VOICE \nThere's only one idiot here, .Azrael... \nBethany and Rufus react, as does the very surprised Azrael. Serendipity stands in the doorway. \nSERENDIPITY \nAnd that's you. \nAZRAEL \nThe Muse. Just in time to join us for a drink. \nBARTENDER \n(suddenly noticing Azrael) \nHey. Where'd you come from? \nAZRAEL \nNothingness. And that's where I'm returning to in approximately... \n(checks watch) \n...onehour. \nBARTENDER \nAlright Plato - sounds like you've had enough drinks already. Let's go. \nAZRAEL \nCome on Barkeep - just one drink for the road. Then I'm gone. \nSerendipity joins Bethany and Rufus. She whispers. \nTell them, Serendipity. Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty. \nSERENDIPITY \nYou got what you deserved, you yellow shithead. \nAZRAEL \nEver the apple polisher. I'd hoped that when you left Paradise, you did it finally because you couldn't tolerate the injustice that was visited upon your own brother. \nBETHANY \nHe's your brother?! \nSERENDIPITY \nNot technically. We were created at the same time. \nAZRAEL \nTo compliment one another. Two spirits of pure inspiration. \nBARTLEBY \nSo what happened? \nAZRAEL \nYes. What. Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne. Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the renegades. The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle, angel against angel. And when it was all over, Cod cast the rebels into perdition. \nSERENDIPITY \nBut Azrael refused to fight. He wouldn't ally himself to God or Lucifer. He remained in the middle, waiting to see who came out victorious. \nJAY \nWhat are you - some kind of fucking chicken?! \nAZRAEL \nI was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse has no place in battle! Our job is to create - not destroy! \nSERENDIPITY \nSo after the fallen were banished to Hell, God turned on those that wouldn't fight, and my brother here was sent down with the demons. Something he considers a grave injustice. \nAZRAEL \nDon't tell me that you never questioned the judgement, Serendipity; that you don't think the Almighty acted too rashly? \nSERENDIPITY \nYou've been waiting for millions of years to ask me that, haven't you? It's been on your mind since the moment you fell. It's been gnawing at you this long. \nAZRAEL \nWell? \nSERENDIPITY \nNo, Azrael. It never bothered me, and I'll tell you why: \nyou stood behind your office, you prick. So you were an artist - big deal. Elvis was an artist, but that didn't stop him from joining the service in time of war. That's why he's the King... and you're a schmuck. \nBETHANY \nSo all this is about revenge?! You're going to unmake existence because you have a grudge against God?! \nAZRAEL \nAfter the first million years, revenge was the farthest thing from my mind. Self-preservation became the only necessity. \nRUFUS \nMeaning? \nAZRAEL \nEscape. Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason. So I studied the religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself; which flnallv did. in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldn't exercise it myself. I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself from torment. \nRUFUS \nBartleby and Loki. \nAZRAEL \nAfter that, it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate their Centennial, and when that finally happened, applying some of the old inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven's radars, and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had a clue as to what was going on. \n(smiles) \nWon't proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power in a way he never dared or dreamed. \n(shakes it off) \nBut no plan, no matter how intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in the realm of the quick. So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion. \nBETHANY \nHow so? \nAZRAEL \nOh no. I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav. \n(gets up) \nThe only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's say-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that train. But alas, here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable. \nBETHANY \nLook, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but if you succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you. \nAZRAEL \n(beat) \nHuman, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hell was nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in His presence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kind came along - and made it so much worse. \nBETHANY \nHumans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like yourself is. \nAZRAEL \nEvil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsible nature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his dark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough for him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt - fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you commit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a foundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there, begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and solitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg. \n(beat) \nWould you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look... \nAzrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we see some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into 240 frames of film. \nAzrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably. \nAZRAEL \nI'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go down with me, so be it. \nSERENDIPITY \n(holding up Bethany) \nYou're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child. \nAZRAEL \nNow, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch a little t.v. \n(grabs remote control) \nJAY \nPut on channel nine - 'Davey and Goliath'! \nA Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick. \nJAY \nHey! \nAZRAEL \nI was thinking more along the lines of current events. \nOn the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera, obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard. \nREPORTER \n...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St. Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on the scene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees, identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I'm not a man of faith, but I'm inclined to agree with them.. \n(looking OC) \nNO! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!! \n(pulls gun) \nPLEASE!! Please... \nRUFUS \nThey could already be in the church. \nSERENDIPITY \nWhich means that if they come out, nobody touches them. \nJAY \nAre you shitting me? The brother here is going to shred them with his Schwarzenneger special - ain't you, homey? \nSERENDIPITY \nIf they've passed through that arch, they come out clean. And if they die, they go straight up - and we know what happens then. \nJAY \nWhat if they just kill themselves? \nBETHANY \nThey can't - it's a mortal sin. You die with a mortal sin on your soul and you burn. They'd go to hell, and that's not what they're after. \nJAY \nSo then what the fuck are we supposed to do?! Just wait for a solution to fall out of the sky?! \nOn cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the group, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start. This body, however, bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height. Jay looks at Rufus. \nJAY \nFriend of your's? \nRUFUS \n'fraid not. \nOC VOICE \nIt was a Cardinal. \nThey all turn to see Loki, leaning against a body or two, drinking from a bottle of champagne. His wings lie beside him, filthy - blood spattered and ashen. He looks exhausted. Rufus trains the gun on him. \nLOKI \nKind of hard to tell with his face like that, but the Rosaries are a dead giveaway. \nJAY \n(goes for the Uzi) \nIT'S ONE OF THEM!! KILL IT!!! \nBETHANY \n(struggling to stop him) \nNO...! \nShe slaps the Uzi out of Jay's grip. It clatters to the side. \nBETHANY \n(to Jay) \nDon't you listen?! We can't touch them! \nJAY \nI wasn't gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot him! \nLOKI \n(looking skyward) \nHe's been at it for awhile now. \nIn the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something winged soars and stops, releasing what looks like a very panicky human being. \nOC LOKI \nWe ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off the street. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged. If only we'd been able to jerk off. \nLoki drags himself a few feet backwards. \nLOKI \nI'd step back if I were you. \nThey jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes. Bethany charges at Loki, grabs his lapels, and shakes him furiously. \nBETHANY \nWHY?!? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE?!? ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY?!? \nJAY \n(to Rufus) \nI thought we weren't supposed to touch them? \nRUFUS \nI think our Bethan's about hit her ceiling. \nLoki slaps Bethany away, non-chalantly. \nLOKI \nThis wasn't my idea. alright? I just wanted to go home. \n(takes a big champagne swig) \nWe both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who you were and what you'd have to do, he just lost it. \n(smiles) \nYou know what's funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He said he always felt son~' for you people - that you didn't know any better. \n(looks up) \nNow look at him. \nJAY \nThis guy's drunker than hell. \nSERENDIPITY \nWhich means he's human now - his wings have been cut off. \n(slapping Loki to sober him up) \nLoki! Loki! \nLOKI \n(recognizing her) \nThe Muse. Haven't seen you in a long time. What's with the tits? \nSERENDIPITY \nLoki - have you walked through the arch yet? C'mon. tell me! Have you gone in and come out through the archway yet?! \nVOICE \nNo. \nBartleby lands beside them, draping his wings at his sides, brushing himself off. \nBARTLEBY \nWe were awaiting your arrival. \nSERENDIPITY \nBartleby - listen to me! You can't go through with this! Azrael was just using you! If you go back this way... \nBartleby slaps her down. \nBARTLEBY \nI've become aware of the reprocussions, Muse. I know what I'm doing. \nBethany leaps at him, all fists and fury. \nBETHANY \nYOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! LOOK AT All you've \ndone...! \nBartleby subdues her. He strokes her hair. \nBARTLEBY \n", "test1_input": "BETHANY \nI think he was aiming a bit further south. \n(to Rufus) \nSpeaking of which, you're awfully nude - Rufus, is it? \nRUFUS \nRufus it is, Miss. \n(to Silent Bob) \nHey, tubby... how's about lending a brother your coat 'till I can find my own threads? \nJay looks at Silent Bob. \nJAY \nDude, he fell out of thin air! \nSilent Bob shrugs and passes his coat to Rufus. Jay bugs. \nJAY \nDude, his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor! \nRUFUS \n(to Silent Bob) \nI'll do my best to tuck it back, brother. \nSilent Bob nods. Something OC catches his eye. He stares OC and exits. \nBETHANY \nWhere exactly did you fall from? \nRUFUS \nSome might say grace. \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nDude, he's talking about your mom. \nJay turns to see that Silent Bob isn't there. \nSilent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side. The bush rustles slightly. \nOC BETHANY \nYou know, normally I'd have a hard time with this, but somehow you falling out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff I've been deaiing with. \nOC RUFUS \nBelieve me - you ain't seen nothing yet. \nSilent Bob peers closer at the bush. Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet leaps out at him, pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick. \nThe other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY \nRufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side. \nJay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse. He rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it. \nSilent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up hard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's side and plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC. \nThe Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and rips downward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it, disappearing. \nJay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately. \nThe Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick in lancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself, grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in an arch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and it seals shut. \nBethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock. \nJAY \nAlright - what's with you, lady?! That's the second time you got attacked by the fucking Mighty Ducks! \nRUFUS \n(wiping off hands) \nMan, they're onto you bad, already. I got here just in time. \nBETHANY \nHow can you be so composed? We were almost killed. \nRUFUS \nDeath is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay and necrophiliacs. \nJAY \nSee! I told you he was the undead! \nRU FUS \nNot the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrection once when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it. \nBETHANY \n(incredulous) \nWait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ? \nRUFUS \nKnew him? I saw him naked. \nBETHANY \nLet me guess - you're another angel? \nRUFUS \nNo, I'm a man - just like you and him. \n(looks at Jay) \nWell, maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two thousand years. Here. \n(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear) \nJAY \nNo wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj. \nBETHANY \n(unrollingit) \nIt's not a joint. \n(looks at it) \nI can't read this. \nRUFUS \nIt's Sanskiit. It says \"Rufus - see you in two years. Jesus.\" Freaked me out because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor out of the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place long enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continue this discussion over something to eat? \nBETHANY \n(snaps) \nWAIT A SECOND! \n(inhales deeply) \nI'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those... kids came from?! \nRUFUS \nThey came from Hell. I came from Heaven. \n(walking away) \nLet's start walking. \nJAY \nWalk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere? \nRUFUS \nBack in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear of a fat apostle? \n(exits) \nBethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability. \n", "test1_true": "What's an apostle? \nBethany shakes her head and exits. Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each other. \nEXT MOOBY CORP. BUILDING - DAWN \nA large office building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn't started up yet. A pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby and Loki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering waved thank-you's to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out the article and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to Bartleby, smiling. They head toward the front doors. \nINT QUAlNT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN \nA ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair. We move from the seated Figure, passing by the dead bodies of the home's original owners, and come to a stop on the bruised and worn Stygian Triplets seated on a couch. They look scared. \nFIGURE \nHello?... No, they're not in right now... I'm the phone guy... I'll leave them a message... Bye. \nThe Figure hangs up the phone and rises. \nFIGURE \nYou say the girl has already met the prophets? \nThe Stygian Triplets nod. \nFIGURE \nShe grows closer to learning her true identity. If that happens, our plan is jeopardized. I can't afford to go into the field - that might compromise us further. The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is not found. And being that I can't even trust you enough to kill a girl, I'm left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package. \n(sighs) \nI'm going to have to summon the Golgothan. \nThe Figure exits. The Stygian Triplets register shock. \nEXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWN \nRufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food to an outdoor table. Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob. \nRUFUS \n(off new clothes) \nIt's amazing the shit people throw out. Didn't I tell you I'd find some threads? \nA car full of teens whip past them. \nTEEN \n(yelling from passing car) \nGARBAGE PICKER! \nRUFUS \n(waves to them) \nThank you. \n(to group) \nWhat's that mean? \nJAY \nIt means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster. \nRUFUS \nSo it's a good thing, then. \n(handing coat back to Silent Bob) \nI appreciate the loan, brother. You can have this back. \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nLucky you. \nRUFUS \n(off food) \nDamn, I remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and goat's milk. What do you call this shit? \nBETHANY \n(to Rufus) \nEgg McMuffin. Now how about you start explaining some things to me. \nRUFUS \nLike what? \nBETHANY \nLike - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me? \nRUFUS \nNasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets. They're not really related. When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a neighbor's toddler and smashed it's skull in - \"just to see what it looked like\" I believe was their defense. They were killed in a car wreck on the way to a detention center. \nBETHANY \nSo they're dead too? \nRUFUS \nYou'd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around - we're stubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are supposed to be in Hell. Which means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly they're willing to summon demons. \nBETHANY \nIs it those two angels I'm supposed to stop? \nRUFUS \nCouldn't be. They're not evil - they're just stupid. \nJAY \n(to Bethany) \nWait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit? We don't even know who this guy is. For all you know, he's in with those fucks. They both showed up at the same time. \nBETHANY \nI hate to say it - but he does have a point. How did you know where to find us? \nRUFUS \nYou know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living. Especially in the shower. \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nI can't wait to die. \nBETHANY \nAnd why are you watching me? \nRUFUS \nBecause you're the one who's going to help me get some changes made in that book you all hold so much stock in. \nJAY \nHustler? \nRUFUS \nThe Bible. \nBETHANY \nWhat's your beef with the Bible? \nRUFUS \nI'm not in it. \nJAY \nNeither are any of us, but you don't hear us bitching. \nRUFUS \nBut I'm supposed to be in it. I was the Thirteenth Apostle. \nBETHANY \nI've been going to church my entire life and I've never heard of a thirteenth apostle named Rufus. \nRUFUS \n", "test1_id": 153, "test2_input": "See? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add. But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just my pet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are basing a faith on. \nBETHANY \nWhat's that? \nRUFUS \nJesus wasn't white; He was black. \nRufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him and then each other. \nJAY \nBullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blue eyes. \nRUFUS \n(wiping hands) \nThat's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He established the faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be decided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was black was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric, even though the brother was blacker than Jesse. \nBETHANY \nIf that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out? \nRUFUS \nWell He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the New Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His ethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles to choose from. \nJAY \nI don't buy it. \nRUFUS \nThat's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass. \nBETHANY \nYou were martyred? \nRUFUS \nThat's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world and spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian following, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about Jesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was black, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed the point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not to accessonze. \nBETH ANY \nWhy didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting? \nRUFUS \nBecause it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the good shit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're getting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is called Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior. \n(to Silent Bob) \nYou going to eat that hash brown? \nBETHANY \nSo you went to Heaven? \nRUFUS \nShit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time, did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His message. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He was black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels from getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign. \nBETHANY \nHow do you know about that? \nRUFUS \nHeaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium is news. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you. \nBETHANY \nI find that hard to believe. \nRUFUS \nWhen you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand. \nJAY \n(shocked) \nYou did that? \nBETHANY \nYeah... but I never told anyone about it. \nRUFUS \nNeither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later. His name was... \nBETHANY \n...BryanJohnson. \nRUFUS \nYour exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven. Probably in Hell, too. \nBethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go. \nJAY \n(intrigued) \nTell me something about me. \nRUFUS \n(preoccupied with the OC Bethany) \nYou masturbate more than anybody else on the planet. \nJAY \nShit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows. \nRUFUS \nYou think about guys when you do it. \nRufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked. \nJAY \nNot all the time! \nBethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufus joins her. \nRUFUS \nI'm sorty if I spooked you. \nBETHANY \nI just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively. \nRUFUS \nThat's the way it goes with celebrities. \nBETHANY \nWhat are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from the suburbs who counsels pregnant teens. \nRUFUS \nYou sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who He was, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sure you'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to. \nBETHANY \nWhy not get the pope or someone holy like that? \nRUFUS \nJust because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man for the job. Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time it's you. \nBETHANY \nWhy me? \nRUFUS \nCan't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carry the burden. It all rides on you. \nBFTRANY \n(rubbing her temples) \nTwo thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know, yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass in Christian Mythology. \nRUFUS \n", "test2_true": "BFTHANY \nWell then let's ask the quote, unquote 'prophets' what we should call it instead. \n(looking OC; concerned) \nNow where did those two assholes go? \nINT STRIP JOINT \nIt's your typical strip club. One woman on a stage and a crowd of men paying way-too-much attention. The place is dimly lit with red lights and chock full of smoke. Off to one side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting the music. The crowd is rather thin. \nJay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on... \nThe DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, and growing littler by the second. \nJay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nice pile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. The Dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot and performs his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge of the stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in her G-string. She rubs his head and slinks away. Jay humps Silent Bob's chair, excitedly. Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them. Bethany hits Jay. \nBETHANY \n(shouting above the music) \nWhat are you doing? \nJAY \nProving to this bastard that I ain't gay. \nBETHANY \nWhat? \nRUFUS \nLong story - forget it. But we should get moving. How can we get to New Jersey? \nBETHANY \nI had a car. \nShe slaps Jay upside the head, but - riveted by the Dancer - he doesn't feel it. \nBETHANY \n(to Rufus) \nWe could go by train. \nRUFUS \n(looking OC) \nSounds cool. \nBETHANY \nThere's a phone out there. I'll call for reservations. \nRufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side. \nBETHANY \nNo, it's okay. I can handle it. \nRufus half-nods. Bethany shakes her head and exits. \nThe Dancer gyrates on the stage, revealing more and more of herself. \nJay pounds on the stage, hoots, and dances, flashing more bills. \nACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing, angry-looking blacks watch the OC Jay with little amusement. The Dancer dances toward them. \nJAY \n(banging on stage) \nSweet thing! \n(Hashes another five) \nLook what I found! Snoog! \nThe Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay, but is interrupted by more banging. \nThe GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage. He produces a ten dollar bill from his jacket and casually holds it up. The other three members of his posse smile and slap hands. \nThe Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading toward the Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob. \nThe Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously loud throat~learing. \nJay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding. \nThe Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The Gang Leader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly. \nThe Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leader produces two twenties. On the other side, jay - staring at the Gang Leader - produces three twenties. The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more cash. Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash. The Dancer stays in the middle, gyrating and sizing up the best offer. \nJay then produces the creme'de Ia creme': three hundred dollar bills. He sneers at the OC Gang Leader. The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps her legs around him from the stage, gyrating against his groin. Jay stares at the Gang Leader, a victorious smirk on his face. \nThe Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat, producing a gun from his jacket. He fires into the ceiling. The music scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door. The Gang Leader points his piece at Jay, his posse backing him up. \nGANG LEADER \nYou a smart ass, ain'tcha, white boy? Come in here and ruin my good time. \nJAY \nIt's a free country. The bitch just came to the man with the most. \nDANCER \nBitch? \nJAY \nNo offense, baby. \nGANG LEADER \nThe bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man with the most led in his piece. While you and tubby are leaving with the most led in your dead fucking carcasses, know what I'm sayin? \nJAY \n(to Dancer) \nStep to the side, baby. I've gotta slap this pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-be down. \nDANCER \n(to Gang Leader) \nCome on, Kane. This isn't necessary. \nGANG LEADER \nShut the fuck up and back away from the midget! \nThe Dancer moves to the side. \nGANG LEADER \n(to Jay) \nNow I believe you were about to apologize. I believe you were about to intone some pleas for mercy. You were about to say \"Please, Mister Kane, I didn't mean to disrespect you in your club. Please accept my most humble apology. \nBethany comes back and sees the mess. She moves to rush to Jay's side, but Rufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs. \nJay leans on Silent Bob, laughing. The Gang stares back, angrily. \nJAY \nYou want an apology? \nGANG LEADER \n(cocks gun) \nGive me at least one \"I'm sorry,\" and ltll put a kill shot through that thick fucking skull of your's. Otherwise we go slow and long in the pain dispensation. \nJAY \n(beat; zips jacket closed) \nKnow what I'm doing? \nGANG LEADER \nNo. What you doing? \nJAY \nI'm closing my jacket, so that when we start this up, I don't get your filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt. You know why? \nGANG LEADER \nWhy? \nJAY \n", "test2_id": 154, "test3_input": "INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT \nBethany and Bartleby talk further. Bartleby's intrigued. \nBETHANY \nI was told that I'm supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering the church. They're trying... \n(laughing) \nThis sounds so stupid... They're trying to get back into Heaven. \nINT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT \nRufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end. \nINT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT \nBartleby grows very tense. Bethany rattles on, half-toasted. \nBETHANY \nSee, they got tossed out of Heaven years ago, right? And if they get back in, it proves God wrong. And since God is infallible, to prove Her wrong would... \n(laughing hard) \n..would unmake existence! I feel so stupid just saying it. \nBartleby's eyes are wide. He looks scared. Then, a calm falls over him. \nBETRANY \n(laughing) \nBut the thing I don't get... is how do I stop an angel? Two, even! I guess I'm supposed to talk them out of it or something. \nBartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table. \nBARTLEBY \nMaybe you're supposed to kill them? \nBethany breaks into hysterics. \nINT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT \nRufus pulls open another door and exits. \nINT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT \nBethany's still cracking up, oblivious to the on-the-defensive Bartleby. \nBETHANY \nOh yeah! Kill them! Even if that was the case... I mean. how do you kill an angel? \nBARTLEBY \nI don't imagine it's much different... \n(slowly lifts the knife) \n...from killing a human... \nThe door behind them slides open. Rufus steps in. \nRUFUS \nWhere the hell is everybody? I wake up, and... \nHe sees Bartleby. They both freeze. \nBARTLEBY \nThe Apostle! \nRUFUS \nHoly shit! \nBETHANY \n(stumbling to her feet) \nRufus, I want you to meet my friend, Barry... \nBartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs Bethany, holding the knife to her throat. \nBETHANY \n(chuckiing) \nBarry! Don't be such a show off! \nRUFUS \nTake it easy, Bartleby. Just let her go and let's talk about this. \nBARTLEBY \nAfter all this time, this is what it comes down to -slaughtered by this meat puppet?! \nRUFUS \nThere doesn't have to be a slaughter. We can work this out... \nBETHANY \nIs that a knife? \nBARTLEBY \nOh. we can work it out, alright. I'm going to work the blade in and out of her thorax! \n(calling over shoulder) \nLoki! \nLoki catches the action and reacts. \nLOKI \nHoly shit - the Apostle! \nHe leaps from the table. Jay stirs and wakes up. \njAY \n(half asleep) \nI didn't come in you, I swear... \n(looks around) \nBartleby, with Bethany in hand, faces off against Rufus. Loki joins them. \nLOKI \n(to Rufus) \nWhat are you doing here? \nBARTLEBY \nThey're here to thwart our journey home, my friend. This one just told me that she's supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church. \nLOKI \nYou think she was talking about us? \nBARTLEBY \nI'd say there was a pretty good chance. What do you say, Rufus - we're to be liquidated? \nRUFUS \nIt doesn't have to go down like that! You haven't thought about the consequences of re-entry! \nLOKI \nConsequences, schmonsequences. \nBARTLEBY \nI have to agree with him. No one - not you, and especially not this finite-lifer - no one is going to impede us. We're going home, regardless of whose pride it may hurt! \nRUFUS \nIt's not a question of pride, it's... \nBARTLEBY \nLoki - kill the girl \nLOKI \n(beat) \n", "test3_true": "BARTLEBY \nDo it! \nLOKI \nI can't kill her if she hasn't done anything, you know that. And it looks like she's 'on the job', so to speak... \nBARTLEBY \nFine! I'll kill her myself... \nA hand lands on Bartleby's shoulder. \nJAY \n(oblivious to the situation) \nHey man - now it's your turn. We got enough for a fatty boom-batty, biggety blunt! \nBartleby turns the knife on him. \nJAY \n(not quite getting it yet) \nWe having cake or something? \nLoki backhands Jay, stunning him. \nJAY \n(dazed) \nIn grates... \nJay drops to the floor, out cold. Silent Bob grabs Loki and hurls him down the aisle. Rufus grabs Bartleby's knife hand. They struggle. Bethany collapses. \nRUFUS \nTUBBY! THE DOOR! \nSilent Bob jumps over Loki and opens the back door of the car. He grabs Loki by the collar. \nLOKI \nWait, man! Can't we talk about this?! \nHe throws Loki out the door, off the train. \nRufus squeezes Bartleby's hand. Bartleby drops the knife and punches Rufus in the face. Bethany jumps on Bartleby's back, covering his eyes. They careen down the aisle, toward Silent Bob. He pulls Bethany off Bartleby's back and kicks him out the back door, off the train. He quickly slams the door closed and leans against it. \nThe Bartender stares at him. \nSilent Bob brushes off his coat and thumbs toward the door. \nSILENT BOB \nNo ticket. \nRufus rubs his jaw. Bethany crawls up beside him, breathing heavily. \nBETH ANY \nI should have known something was wrong when he paid for all the drinks. \nINT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT \nA door is kicked open.

Bartleby follows. \nLOKI \nThe Apostle is here! \nBARTLEBY \nI noticed. \nLOKI \nIf that's the case, then chick with him must be... \nBARTLEBY \nThe Scion, I'd imagine. \n(leans against the wall; slides down) \nLOKI \n(in a panic) \nWell, shit man! Maybe we should rethink this whole thing! I mean, you heard the guy - he said there were consequences. Azrael tells us we're marked. Maybe there's more to this than we thought about. \nBartleby leans against the wall, sitting on the ground. His demeanor has changed. He stares into space. \nBARTLEBY \nThere sure is. \n(beat) \nIt's them. \nLOKI \n(beat) \nWhat? \nBARTLEBY \n(shakes his head) \nThem. \nLOKI \n(thinks) \nThe movie about the giant ants? \nBARTLEBY \nThem - the humans. It's what it all comes down to. you know? Us against humanity... kind of like that giant ant movie. \nLOKI \n(beat) \nAre you alright? \nBARTLEBY \nI'm better than alright. I've had an epiphany, my friend. \nLOKI \nAn... epiphany. Yes, well... that'll happen. \nBARTLEBY \nWhen that sweet, innocent girl let her mission slip, I suddenly understood it all - everything. For the first time in all these eons, I get it. \nLOKI \n(beat) \nGet what? \nBARTLEBY \nIn the beginning, it was just us and Him. Angels and God. And then He created the humans. And He gave them more than He ever gave us. Our's was designed to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration. But He gave the humans more - He gave them a choice. They can choose to ignore God, choose to acknowledge Him. All this time we've been down here, everyday I felt the absence of the Divine presence. And it pained me... as I'm sure it must have pained you sometimes, even though you'd gloss over it with jokes. But we feel his absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants. Had we been given free will, we could ignore the pain... like them. \nLOKI \nYou know - maybe you should take a nap or something. \nBARTLEBY \nLoki, don't you get it? It's the humans - it's always the humans. They were given paradise; they threw it away. They were given this planet; they destroyed it. They were favored best among all His endeavors; and some of them don't even believe He exists. Their ego-mania corroded Hell and made it dark and crimson. \n(looks at Loki) \nI asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why? \nBecause I felt sorry for them. And where did it get us? \nThrown out. \n(smiles) \nWe've paid our debt. Don't you think it's time we went home? And to do that, I think we have to dispatch our would-be dispatchers. \nLOKI \nWait, wait, wait - kill them?! You're talking about the Last Scion, for Christ's sake! And what about Jay and Bob - I mean, those guys were alright. \n", "test3_id": 155}

{"test1_input": "Look at my suit...! \nBETHANY \nTake whatever you want, just don't kill or rape me... \nMETATRON \nEnough with the raping already! I couldn't rape you if I wanted to. \n(unzips pants and pulls them off) \nAngels are ill-equipped. \nBethany stares. There, before her, stands the exposed Metatron. There is nothing where some sexual genitalia should be - it's as smooth and anatomically impaired as a Ken doll. \nMETATRON \nSee? I'm as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll. \n(rings out pants) \nYou meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyone's just waiting to rape you. \nBETHANY \nWh..what are you? \nMETATRON \nI'm pissed is what I am. You go around drenching everyone that comes into your room with flameretardent chemicals? No wonder you don't get laid. \n(pulls pants back on) \nGo get me a towel, will you? \nBethany blinks. She exits the room and comes back with a towel. She holds it out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off. \nMETATRON \n(taking off jacket) \nStand back. \nBethany steps back. Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from it's back, dripping water. Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the wall. \nMETATRON \n(tosses towel away) \nLike I was saying - I am the Metatron. \nBethany stares, saying nothing, pinned against the wall. Metatron looks insulted. \nMETATRON \nMetatron. Don't tell me the name doesn't ring a bell? \nBethany remains silent and wideyed. Metatron gets testy. \nMETATRON \nYou people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right? \n(beat) \nI am a seraphim. \n(beat) \nThe highest choir of angels? \n(beat) \nYou do know what an angel is, don't you? \nBethany slowly nods. \nMETATRON \nMetatron acts as the voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahoo claims to have spoken with God, they're speaking to me. Or they're speaking to themselves. \nBET HANY \n(beat) \nWhy doesn't God speak for himself? \nMETATRON \nAh. So glad you decided to join the conversation. To answer that - human beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome \npower of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, you're mind would cave in and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adam's before we figured that out. \nBETHANY \nAre you going to kill me? \nNi ETATRON \nI could for what you did to this suit. Unfortunately I can't. You're called. \nBETH ANY \n(beat) \nCalled how? How called? \nMETATRON \nAll that from two words. Color this angel impressed. \nBETHANY \n(beat) \nHow do I know you're an angel? \nMETATRON \nOh, you mean besides the fiery entrance and the expansive wingspan? You people kill me. Fine. You want more proof? How about a tequila? \n(snaps fingers) \nINT MEXICAN BAR - NIGHT \nBethany and Metatron sit at a table. Bethany immediately clutches at her pajamas. Metatron waves a WAITER over. \nBETHANY \nWhere the hell are we?! \nMETATRON \nThe only place one can go for good tequila. \n(to Waiter) \nDos tequilas, por favor. And an empty glass. \nWAITER \nSi. \nThe Waiter turns to leave. Metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as he goes. \nMETATRON \nGracias, senor. \nBETHANY \nWe're in Mexico?! \nMETATRON \nActually, we're in the Chilli's down the street from your house, but it was still an impressive trick \n(lights smoke) \nYou don't mind that I lost the wings, do you? I'm trying to keep our profile low. \nBETHANY \nI suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the weirdest dream I've ever had. \nMETATRON \nCan you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have them insist you're a dream? If I had an ego, it'd be bruised. \nBETHANY \nWhat do you want with me? \nMETATRON \nI'm to charge you with a holy crusade. \n", "test1_true": "You do know what a crusade is, don't you? \nBETHANY \n(sarcastically) \nUh, yeah. \nMETATRON \nDon't give me that. Last time I charged someone with a crusade they had to look the word up. \nBETHANY \nWhy am I supposed to go on a crusade? \nMETATRON \nYour's is a heritage divine. Also, you didn't seem to be doing much lately. \nThe Waiter arrives with their drinks. \nMETATRON \nOh - Gracias! \n(he leaves; off the tequila) \nOne of the only things your people have mastered since you crawled from the primordial ooze. \n(sips) \nBETHANY \nI work in an abortion clinic. \nMETATRON \n(spits tequila into empty glass) \nMoses was a drunk. Look what he accomplished. And no one's even asking you to part an ocean. All you have to do is go to New Jersey. \nBETH ANY \nNew ]ersey. \nMETATRON \nSure. Go to New Jersey and visit and small church on a very important day. Agreed? \nBETHANY \nThat doesn't sound like a crusade. \nMETATRON \nAside from the fine print, that's it. \nBETHANY \nWhat's the fine print? \nMETATRON \n(mumbles into glass) \nstopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence. \nDamn, this is good tequila. \n(sips) \nBETHANY \nWait, wait, wait. Repeat that. \nMETATRON \nDamn, this is good tequila? \nBETHANY \nThe first part. \nMETATRON \n(spits into empty glass) \nDetails. Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all existence. God, I hate when people need it spelled out for them. \nBETHANY \nClarify that. \nMETATRON \nThat's the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified. No leaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Here goes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and his wrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped out everything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. And he was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath any longer. \nBETHANY \nWhy? \nMETATRON \nBecause he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby. \nBETHANY \nGrigori? \nMETATRON \nOne of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do? \nBETHANY \nSo they're like Guardian angels? \nMETATRON \nExactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all the first born of Egypt... \nBETHANY \nThe Tenth Plague. \nMETATRON \nSee? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy; mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenly theology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted? \n(Bethany nods) \nSo once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby out for a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into this discussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now, Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention the fact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartleby convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that doesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits: throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for the rest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could no longer imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting. \nBETHANY \nSounds reasonable. \nMETATRON \nMaybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature. \nBETHANY \nI mean about the angel of Death's resignation. \nMETATRON \nFor a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about. The Angel of Death can't be a conscientious objector. The Angel of Death is charged with meting out whatever justice God demands. So for their insolence, God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowed back into Paradise. \nBETHANY \nWere they sent to Hell? \nMETATRON \nWorse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of human history. And when the world ends, they'll sit outside the gates for eternity. \nBETHANY \nAnd what's this have to do with me? \nMETATRON \nSomebody's clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allow them to reenter Heaven. \nBETHANY \nSo what? They beat the system. Good for them. \nMETATRON \nIt's not that simple. If they get in, they will have reversed God's decree. Now listen up because this part is very important: existence in all it's form and splendor functions solely on one principle: God is infallible. To prove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is. Up would become down, black would become white, existence would become nothingness. In essence - if they are allowed to enter that church, they'll unmake the world. \nBETHANY \nAre these guys that bitter? \n", "test1_id": 153, "test2_input": "SERENDIPITY \nIn some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch. \nBETHANY \nWhat have I seen that you've been involved with? \nSERENDIPITY \nOff the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example: I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time. \nBETHANY \nNine? \nSERENDIPITY \nThe one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in and he fights them off? \n(Bethany nods) \nI had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of shit. \nRUFUS \nWhich brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing stripping? \nSERENDIPITY \nWell you remember why I left, right? \nRUFUS \nYou were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for your ideas. \nSERENDIPITY \nAnd sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn out real trash. \n(to Bethany) \nSo I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks notice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my fortune. \nBETHANY \nSo what happened? \nSERENDIPITY \nWriter's block. \nRUFUS \nWriter's block? \nSERENDIPITY \nCan you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of the typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write a grocery list. \nBETHANY \nWhat about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them. \nSERENDIPITY \nThat's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second, but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor. \nBETHANY \nWhose? \nSERENDIPITY \nGod's. \nBETHANY \nYou're saying God's a woman. \nSERENDIPITY \nWas there ever a doubt in your mind? \nBETHANY \nThe possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him. \nSERENDIPITY \nI didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person that holds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men. One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the editorial process. \nRUFUS \nAnother one's that you can't jerk off. \nSERENDIPITY \n(to Bethany) \nSee. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests felt threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their fates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - the whole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for the first sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts Sampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist. Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagonists than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined. \nBETHANY \n(stunned) \nGod is a woman... \nSERENDIPITY \nI don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that can create life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mother could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has with humanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, so psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel completely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feel at ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore the aid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who can make it all better is... \nBETHANY \n...mom. God, it makes sense. \nRUFUS \n(to Serendipity) \nShit, you still have a knack for words. \nSERENDIPITY \nNot really useful in my new line of work. \nRUFUS \nWhat about that? Why'd you choose stripping? \nSERENDIPITY \nIn an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own. See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it's dancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me that much - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which results in no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts forms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing to save and enjoy... or sell. \n(takes a drink) \nBelieve me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse. \nRUFUS \nHow long are you going to keep this up? \nSERENDIPITY \nBelieve me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time to time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the prodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore - especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of the aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can't take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as an excuse not to get laid... \n(conspiratorily to Bethany) \n...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand. \nRLFLS \nWell we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. You remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby? \nSERENDIPITY \nSure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience. \nRUFUS \nThey found a way back. \nSERENDIPITY \n(shocked) \nGod no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole? \nBETHANY \nYou know about that? \nSERENDIPITY \nI always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics to destroy existence. \nRUFUS \n", "test2_true": "SERENDIPITY \nMy condolences. \nBETHANY \nWhat do you have against Catholics? \nSERENDIPITY \nEver been to a Catholic mass? \nBETHANY \nOnce or twice. \nSERENDIPITY \nIt's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave. \nAnd the whole time you'd rather be watching t.v. \nYou people don't celebrate your faith - you mourn it. \nBETHANY \nSo if we're so wrong, then what's the right religion? \nSERENDIPITY \nWhen are you people going to learn? It's not about right or wrong - it's a question of faith. It doesn't matter what you believe in - just that you believe. \nJay and Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas. \nJAY \nLook! They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang! \nSuddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~im room. A huge figure stands in the doorway, backlit and acting as a sepia filter - the light and vapors surrounding him are brown. \nFIGURE \n(deep, gutteral hiss) \nNot born... shit into existence. \nOur group stares at the OC brute. Jay sniffs the air. \nJAY \nWho farted? \nSERENDIPITY \nSweet Christ, someone wants you bad. \nBETHANY \nWhat do you mean? What's that smell? \nRUFUS \nDon't tell me that's who I think it is. \nSERENDIPITh \nThe stench should say it all. \nBETHANY \nWho the hell is it?! \nSERENDIPITY \nAn excremental - the Golgothan. \nBETHANY \nA what? \nRUFUS \nA shit-demon. \nThe Golgothan moves slowly from the door, toward the group. \nNO-MAN \nNo... man. ..of...woman.. born... \nThe Gang join the others. They hold and cover their noses. \nGANG LEADER \n(to Jay; loading his piece) \nFriend of your's? \nJAY \n(to group) \nIs this smelly fuck with us? \nRUFUS \nHe's coming for Bethany. \nJAY \n(to Gang Leader) \nSmoke that mother fucker like it ain't no thang! \nGANG LEADER \nI knew I'd get to wax someone today. Represent! \nThe Gang charges OC, guns blazing, while we hold on the group. Suddenly, the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises. The group goes from staring wide-eyed, to shielding themselves. The noise stops and Jay and Silent Bob look up. \nThe Gang lay about NoMan in trashed, dead positions. They are covered in murky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror. NoMan scoops a finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it, smiling. \nOur heroes start backing up slowly, as to not be noticed. \nJAY \n(to Silent Bob) \nI guess we're in charge of the gang now. \nBETHANY \nWhat the fuck happened?!? \nSERENDIPITY \nGo for the bar. We might have a few seconds - his short-term memory's for shit. \nJAY \nSo's the rest of him. \nRUFUS \nNo chance of taking him down? \nSERENDIPITY \nGee. I don't know. Let's ask the gangstas. \nRUFUS \nYou're right; let's book. \nThey dash. NoMan snaps to attention and throws it's arm at them, launching a huge glob of shit through the air. \nJAY \n(running; seeing it coming) \nSHIT!!! \nEveryone leaps behind the bar. The shit flies over them and slams against the mirror above. Immediately, it stretches - Blob-like - over the entire frame, and burns in an acidic fashion. \nJay stares, horrified. \nJAY \nNow that... is some powerful shit. \nSerendipity pulls at the floor, yanking open a door. \nSERENDIPITY \nQuick! Get in! \nBethany, Rufus, jay and Silent Bob leap into the darkness. Serendipity follows, pulling the door shut on top of them. \n", "test2_id": 154, "test3_input": "GLICK \n...then these loonies will show up and go nuts, thus endangering the lives of all assembled, including the Governor, the press, me, the leaders of the Council of Churches.

The day has arrived. \nEXT TURNPIKE - EARLY MORNING \nAmidst very little traffic, two figures emerge from the shadows on the Pennsylvania side. Bartleby and Loki step purposefully past the green sign that welcomes motorists to New Jersey. \nINT BAR - DAWN \nThe place is empty, except for Bethany, Rufus, Jay and Silent Bob and A BARTENDER. \nBETHANY \nI can almost see the headlines - if there were going to be any - \"Existence Erased - Thanks to some prick in a scarlet cape. \nRUFUS \nIt's a crime that a guy like him even gets to wear a scarlet cape. \nJAY \nThat ain't no crime. You wanna see a crime? Look what we stole from the guy in the dress. \n(to Silent Bob) \nHand it over. \nSilent Bob pulls a golf club from out of his coat. \nBETHANY \nOh my God. We're going straight to Hell, I know it. \nRUFUS \nYou stole the Cardinal's driver? \nJAY \nI told him to. You know how much these things are worth? That's at least a couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right there. \nBETHANY \nWhat do we do now? \nRUFUS \nLet them keep it. In a couple of hours, it won't matter anyway. \nBETHANY \nNot that - about Bartleby and Loki! \nRUFUS \nWe have no choice but to try to kill them. \nBETHANY \n(to Rufus) \nBut you said they couldn't be killed. \nOC VOICE \nCorrection : they won't be killed. \nThe gang turns to see Azrael sitting at the bar. \nAZRAEL \nAnd just to insure that, we're all going to sit tight, right here, until the two idiots pass through that arch. \nJAY \nHey...! \nBETHANY \nHe wasn't talking about you two. \nOC VOICE \nThere's only one idiot here, .Azrael... \nBethany and Rufus react, as does the very surprised Azrael.

And that's where I'm returning to in approximately... \n(checks watch) \n...onehour. \nBARTENDER \nAlright Plato - sounds like you've had enough drinks already.

Then you're gone. \nAZRAEL \nGimme a Holy Bartender. \nBARTENDER \nNever heard of it. \nAZRAEL \n(to the group) \nHe doesn't know how to make a Holy Bartender. \nYou know - don't you, Muse? \nSERENDIPITY \nAzrael... don't. \nAZRAEL \n(ignoring her) \nAnybody? Well - I know how to make a Holy Bartender. \nAzrael pulls an Uzi from his coat and blows a dozen holes in the Bartender.

He is no longer amused, and has abandonned you - His favorites - to the whim of judgement.

You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. \nCOP \nIs that so? Well, let's just... \nBartleby throws his other hand forward and twists the Cop's head around in one brisk motion. Loki's eyes bug out.

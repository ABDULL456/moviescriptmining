Clay and Wyatt. Clay takes the makings from his pocket, rolls a cigarette, lights it. 
CLAY I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was. 
WYATT (quiet) All right, you didn't know. 
CLAY I can't take her with me. 
WYATT Nobody asked you to. 
O.s. Steve whistles the tune of the A B C song as he comes out of the barn. 
WYATT Just get those two out of here. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Steve approaches from the barn. 
CLAY You're not bein' quite fair.

MED. SHOT 
wagon. Steve picks up a couple of valises and some blankets and heads for the house, still whistling. In the b.g. can be heard the mutter of voices as Clay and Wyatt talk. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Helen is sitting at the table, eating a piece of bread and drinking coffee. Mary stands at the window. Steve is heard coming up the steps and across the porch. He pushes the door open and enters. 
STEVE (cheerfully) Where do I put your things? 
Mary turns from the window. 
MARY Back in the wagon. 
Steve stands with his arms full, looking at Mary. 
STEVE Aren't we stayin'? 
MARY No. We're not stayin' -- 
She crosses to him and smiles wryly. 
MARY Everything's all mixed up, so don't ask questions. 
Steve hesitates. 
MARY (soft) Go on, Steve. 
Steve exits. 
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT 
MED. CLOSE. Steve stops on the porch. He is puzzled, worried. He glances back then over toward the fence where Wyatt and Clay are talking. He shrugs and starts off toward the wagon. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
MED. SHOT. Mary crosses to the stove. 
HELEN Sit down and eat, why don't you? 
Mary lifts the stove lid and puts a stick in the firebox. 
HELEN It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of. 
MARY That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this -- 
HELEN Quit worryin' about Elaine. 
She motions to the bedroom door.

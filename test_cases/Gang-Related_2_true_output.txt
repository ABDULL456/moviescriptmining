DIVINCI When you asked if I was thinkin' about us and I said I wasn't, I just want you to know that I do. 
A beat, then -- 
CYNTHIA Just don't ask me to marry you. 
DIVINCI (smiles) Why aren't more women like you? 
Divinci leans in and they kiss. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol. 
A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun in his hand. 
Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when -- 
THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a gun. 
DIVINCI (lowers gun) You fuckin' idiot. 
The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now we recognize Joe. 
Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops. Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light with an arm. 
We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's JACKET POCKET. 
DIVINCI What've we got here? 
He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at Joe. 
DIVINCI Where were you last Friday night? 
Confused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING) 
Divinci drives. Joe up front. In an alcoholic daze. 
DIVINCI'S VOICE What's your name? 
Joe looks at Divinci. Having trouble focusing. 
DIVINCI Your name, what's your name? 
WILLIAM ...Joe... 
DIVINCI Where'd you get the gun, Joe? 
Joe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the .44. 
DIVINCI It was in your pocket, Joe, your coat pocket. You must keep it for protection, right? 
WILLIAM I don't know. 
DIVINCI Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs protection. Especially a guy like you lives on the street, right? 
Joe just stares at the gun. 
DIVINCI Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You don't have to worry about me, I'm not gonna hurt you. 
Joe puts the gun into his jacket pocket. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING 
The LOCATION of HUDD'S MURDER. The street is empty. Quiet. Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died. 
INT. DIVINCI'S CAR - EARLY MORNING 
Joe is asleep, leaning against the window. Divinci reaches across and yanks him. 
DIVINCI Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at something. Out the window, Joe. Look out the window. 
Joe's eyes open. Divinci forces his head to the window. 
DIVINCI This is where it happened, Joe. I want you to remember it. This is where you killed him 
Joe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his head. 
DIVINCI You remember it now? How you shot him through the head? You remember it? 
WILLIAM I... don't... 
DIVINCI (lets go of Joe) You will.

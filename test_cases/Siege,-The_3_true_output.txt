ATLANTIC AVENUE - BROOKLYN 
The Third World. Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow. Hand-written shop signs in Arabic and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest neo-Palestinian techno-rock. 
KHALIL pays the taxi driver and starts off on foot. Hub's CONTOUR pulls over a safe distance behind and waits. An AGENT passes by and slips a WALKIE-TALKIE through the open window. 
MAN CARRYING GROCERIES 
Falls in behind Khalil, who ducks into a storefront, where WE CAN SEE him buying a Coca Cola and a Baby Ruth bar. 
IN THE CONTOUR 
FRANK (notes the purchase) Twelve bucks in Gaza. 
HUB America's the place to be if you're a terrorist. (on the walkie-talkie) Fred's hovering. Patsy, take over... 
A WOMAN WITH A STROLLER replaces the man carrying groceries. 
HUB ...Tell her to watch out for reflections. 
FRANK (hands him the phone) I got the Judge. 
HUB (on the phone) ...Good morning, Sir. How're things in the Second Circuit this morning...? ...I hear you... Listen, Judge, we're in a kind of situation here... 
KHALIL is on the move again. 
HUB (on the phone) Hold on, will ya, Judge? (into walkie-talkie) Is he talking to somebody, who's he talking to? Are we getting film? 
FROM A GREAT DISTANCE 
An AGENT with a TELEPHOTO snaps a picture of Khalil, who has paused to chat with a PALESTINIAN of patrician good-looks. 
HUB (covering the phone) -- Frank? 
FRANK Don't know him. If we were allowed to get sound on them, we'd know him. 
The walkie-talkie CRACKLES TO LIFE, confirming the photos. 
HUB (covering the radio) ...What's that? No, Judge, not yet we're not... but we have reason to believe he may be involved with -- (covers the phone again; keys the radio) Damnit Tommy! (to Frank) He's overacting! Tell him -- (back to the phone) Sorry, Judge... No... I just -- 
FRANK He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's -- 
Khalil has a sixth sense from a lifetime on the West Bank. All of a sudden, he BREAKS INTO A RUN. 
HUB (keys radio) Go, go, go!!! All units -- 
He slams the car into gear and PEELS OUT into traffic. 
SIX SURVEILLANCE TEAMS 
In various guises, break cover and SPRINT after Khalil, who shifts into overdrive. Cars SCREECH to avoid flattening him. 
Hub's CONTOUR pulls into traffic and finds his way blocked by a narrow passage between double-parked cars. He goes for it, SCRAPING his way between them. 
FRANK Christ! 
HUB (on the phone) Judge, I'm gonna have to call you back... 
KHALIL SPRINTS 
Into an open-air MARKET, KNOCKING DOWN veiled WOMEN with bags of fruit and vegetables. He VAULTS over stalls. 
The CONTOUR scrapes PARKED CARS as it swerves into an alley, desperately trying to cut off Khalil's escape route. 
FRANK Shit --! I didn't take the insurance. 
A SOCCER BALL bounces into Hub's peripheral vision, followed by TWO BOYS. 
HUB SLAMS THE CONTOUR INTO THE WALL 
To avoid killing the two boys. Hub gets out of the car and continues the pursuit on foot. He's gaining on Khalil, when: 
A VAN 
Bears down on Khalil, its doors sliding open as TWO PAIRS OF HANDS reach out and ANOTHER MAN appears out of nowhere and BODYCHECKS Khalil into the van and jumps in after him. 
HUB What the --? 
The van BURNS RUBBER and DISAPPEARS into traffic. 
MINUTES LATER -- 
An impromptu huddle in the alley. AGENTS gather in a circle as RADIOS SQUELCH and HELICOPTERS circle above. 
FRED They just found the van. Doesn't look like they're gonna find any prints. 
The Agent who took the pictures pulls a color xerox-type PHOTO from a digital printer in his car. Hub looks at the picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian. 
HUB Run him down, bring him in. 
Fred hands a cell phone to Hub. 
FRED Floyd Rose.

MATTY I don't know why he's so crazy about her. Maybe because he never had any of his own. She's a cute little girl, all right, but other than that... I know this, though, her mother has worked plenty hard to keep Heather on Edmund's mind, Always bringing her around, reporting everything she does in school. That Roz is a smart one. And you know that anything Heather inherits goes straight to Roz. Heather won't even get a look at it. That's the part I can't stand. That's why it seems so wrong to have half of it go to her. 
She hands him his glass and stands next to him, her hand playing with his hair. 
RACINE That's the way it is.       There's nothing we can do about it. 
She kneels beside him. 
MATTY Are you sure, Ned? I've been thinking about it. Maybe there is. The will is with his lawyer in Miami I know that. What if I could get him to bring it home? He did it once, he'd do it again. If I could swing it, couldn't we rewrite it? Change it. Then when he dies, I could find the new one. We could just change it a little. Every little change would mean a lot to us, End. You're a lawyer. You know how to write it. It wouldn't seem so odd. I could say he brought it home and we talked about it and decided to make some changes up here. And I knew you already -- 
Racine is shaking his head. 
RACINE No.   Forget it. 
MATTY I just don't see why Heather should take half --

Racine puts down his drink and turns to look down at her. 
RACINE Listen to me, Matty. Nothing strange can happen in his life right now, not one thing out of the ordinary. That's vital, that's the main thing. If anything does, the chances double that we get caught. You and I are walking out there on the edge every second now. One false move and we're gonna fall off. It'll be all over. You've got to remember that all the time. (he studies her face) You'll get half of everything and it'll be plenty. No matter what it is, we're gonna be satisfied. We're not gonna get greedy. If we do, we'll get burned. You gotta believe me, baby, the odds that we'll get burned are good enough without looking for trouble. 
She studies him with frightened eyes, then nods her agreement and lays her hand in his lap. 
MATTY You're right, darling.   I'm sorry. I know you're right. 
EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - NIGHT 
Middle of the night. No one in sight. Now comes the only movement -- a Miranda Beach Police Patrol Car drives slowly up the street next to the old hotel and turns south on Ocean Avenue. When it is gone, all is dead again. 
EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT 
Racine has   watched the patrol car from the  darkness of the beach.   Now he sits in the sand again,  his back against the raised   bank of sand on which he runs.   He lights a flashlight   and makes a notation in a small  notepad. 
INT. "THE BREAKERS" - NIGHT 
Racine's footsteps creak through the blackness. Then his flashlight reveals a corridor in the crumbling basement of the old hotel. Racine is not the first to have violated the premises -- scattered about are beer cans, whiskey bottles, beds made of newspapers, the remains of food. Rats CHITTER and scamper in the shadows. A lizard scoots over the pipes. 
Racine goes through a doorway and is in what used to be a supply area at the bottom of a stairway.

Scattered about are empty wooden food crates. The walls are lined with tall wooden shelves; one of these units is tipped over across the room, Racine shines his light in that direction and sees what caused the shelves to fall. One of the beams which cross the ceiling has rotted loose and dropped one end to the floor. 
Racine has found what he wanted. 
EXT. WALKER HOUSE - PARKING AREA - MIGHT 
We're CLOSE ON RACINE'S WATCH; it reads 2:30. 
RACINE Okay.   Gotta go. 
Racine, at the wheel of the Stingray is looking at his watch. Matty is leaning down to the window dressed only in a robe. 
MATTY Be careful. 
RACINE I'm just going for a ride.   I wish it was all this dangerous. 
She kisses him deeply. 
MATTY I love you. 
He looks at his watch again and pulls away.     Matty stands watching. 
EXT. FROM PINEHAVEN TO "THE BREAKERS" - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT 
Racine drives his murder route. The roads are almost totally deserted. Intermittently he passes signs welcoming him to the towns as he travels south. 
A. The first stretch of his trip, Racine travels on a deserted back road with overhanging trees. A Teenage Hotrodder passes him and he is alone again. As he turns off the road, he checks his watch. B. He drives through a neighborhood of neat houses. No life. C. He turns onto a four line interstate. More traffic here -- long haul truckers, late night drinkers. D. He drives across a graceful drawbridge, rimmed by lights, over a canal. E. He drives toward the ocean beside a pretty lake in a park. A patrol car passes the other way. Racine checks his watch. F. At "The Breakers." Racine follows the same path as the police car he'd watched.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VISITING ROOM - DAY 
A seedy-looking Thief is brought out of the visiting room by a Uniformed Deputy, followed by Racine, briefcase in hand. Racine shakes the Thief's hand. The Deputy leads the Thief away down the hall. Racine glances at his departing client, then heads in the other direction. Before he has gone too far a heavy, metal, barred door at the other end swallows up the Thief with a piercing CLANG! Racine jumps. He puts a hand against the wall. 
INT. BED - MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Racine and Matty, just their heads on one pillow, inches apart. They look at each other in silence. Finally -- 
RACINE And? 
MATTY The side door. 
RACINE And? 
MATTY Two A.M. I send him down. 
RACINE We won't talk again after     I leave here tonight. I'll be in      Miami by noon Friday. You won't be      able to reach me. When I see you      again, he'll be dead. 
Matty nods.   She begins to cry.     Racine touches her.

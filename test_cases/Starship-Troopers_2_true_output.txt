JOHNNY It's a general retreat ! The boats are coming down. 
They come to the rear lines where the Net Correspondent and his CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion. 
NET CORRESPONDENT We've just landed here on what cap troopers are calling the "Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery Division. It's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we kow iGKKKKK ! 
The Correspondent is cut in half by a warrior. Johnny blows it away. 
JOHNNY C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE ! 
The cap troopers move out. Kitten Smith looks up as a purple beacon streaks acroos thr sky. 
KITTEN SMITH I can see the beacon...! 
ACE Retrieval ! 
A hopper pounces on Kitten Smithm, and he goes down screaming. 
JOHNNY KITTEN ! 
Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee. Johnny opens up with his pulse cannon. The hopper attacks, puts a claw right through Johnny's thigh. 
JOHNNY AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! 
Crushing jaws close around him, crushing, cutting his flesh. Johnny brings the muzzle of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and SPLAT !	blows its head apart. 
DIZZY Johnny !	JOHNNY !	WHERE ARE YOU ? JOHNNY !	Johnny...! 
But Dizzy can't find Johnny, and soon she's lost in the smoke. Johnny looks down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes. 
JOHNNY Medic... MEDIC...! 
Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately, dragging his useless leg. 
JOHNNY Oh, God... Oh, God, help me... please help me...! 
A third Arachnid warrior rears up in front of him, deadly jaws slashing down toward him, when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a point-blank pulse cannon. 
VOICE (O.S.) Take my hand ! 
Johnny reaches out. A STEEL HAND takes his, dragging him back as bugs attack. His rescuers's pulse cannon thunders overhead. Bug parts fly as insects swarm in for the kill.

Chris raises his hands and the sheriff chuckles. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Did I scare ya with that one? 
CHRIS Lil bit. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Ya. Let's go. 
INT. POLICE CAR 
SHERIFF WATKINS You were gone a while huh? 
CHRIS 8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then. 
SHERIFF WATKINS Harstad, yeah. Sad story. About 5 months back he fell asleep at the wheel and uhhh... hit a tree. Good man, good man and a good sheriff. 
EXT. THE FAMILY HOME 
CHRIS Thanks for the ride. 
SHERIFF WATKINS No problem, and uh Chris (hands him a piece of paper). It's election month... I'm your man. 
Chris takes the paper and smiles. He walks up the lane toward the house, a simple white building clad in wood. A lady dressed in a police uniform comes out. 
MICHELLE Can I help you? 
Chris laughs. 
MICHELLE Lil' brother.. You come over here and gimme a hug. 
They laugh together.

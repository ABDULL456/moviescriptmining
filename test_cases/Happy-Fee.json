{"train": "HAPPY FEET \nWritten by \nGeorge Miller \nScreenplay by \nJohn Collee \n(Early Draft) \nSPACE \nDistant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense cosmic ocean. \nMUMBLE (VO) You ever feel small? \nMoving in on.... \nPLANET EARTH \nThe spinning blue marble. \nFADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto ANTARCTICA \nTHE ICE SHELF \nVast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us. \nMUMBLE (VO) Like you're no-one, cos the world is full of us, and everyone's the same \nWait a minute. These aren't humans... they are PENGUINS! \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) How do you stand out from the crowd? How do you find someone special? \nA GREAT COMMUNITY \nEMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand central station - with everyone SINGING to each other. \nMUMBLE (VO) I know. I know. \"You sing your heart out.\" That's how mum found dad in the first place \nFollow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive crowd past an assortment of crooning males \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nKEEN MALE (trying to connect) \"Babe...I got you Babe...\" \nShe ignores him \nNEXT MALE (giving it his all) \"When a man loves a woman...\" \nShe keeps moving, until she sees the male of her dreams: \nWISHFUL \"Love me tender love me true, all my dreams fulfil. \nHe stands a bit apart from the rest. And what a voice. What a hip movement. She sings along. \nNORMA J. AND WISHFUL ...for my darling I love you and I always will. \nMUMBLE (VO) With them it was love at first song. \nClose up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine. \nMUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D) But with me everything was a different, right from the moment I was born \nAs the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J \nNORMA J. (Sings) \"I wanna be loved by you, alone and nobody else by you boo boo pee doo\" \nWISHFUL raises his head, breaking the seal. A little puff of steam escapes \nWISHFUL Amen to that honey \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nVARIOUS PENGUINS Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, pal! Ya lettin' out the heat! \nPenguins around him start jostling to close the gap \nPENGUINS ...Quit shovin'! ...Hey watch where you're putting your feet \nCARUSO Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions! \nAn egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE. \nWISHFUL Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg! \nWISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and waddles back into the warmth again. \nWISHFUL (CONT'D) S'okay. S'okay. No harm done. \nMUMBLE (VO) I guess he was wrong about a lot of things. \nPulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned out by the HOWLING GALE. \nWISHFUL But I did learnt this from him:    the power of positive thinking \nWe are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts. \nLouder and louder, until... \nELDER By the power of our Devotions... \nALL PENGUINS We turn the world once more. \nELDER By our devotion to the Wisdoms \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nALL PENGUINS We bring back the sun. \nThe CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the sound of the gale, and, as if in response \nTHE EARTH TURNS! \nThe CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more. \nON THE ICE SHELF \nThe ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing. \nA SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks again. \nThe whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs. \nSomewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same time... \nTHE EMPEROR COMMUNITY \nAn EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like POPCORN. \nWISHFUL Well tell em don't. \nMUMBLE But Why Dad? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nCaruso waddles past: A stern glance down at little Mumble as he carries on along the line \nWISHFUL `Cos it ain't penguin. \nLATER \nMIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying. \nMUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's concentrated gaze. \nMUMBLE Gee I'm hungry \nWISHFUL Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are bringing fish soon. \nLong pause \nMUMBLE What's fish look like. \nWISHFUL You'll see it when she brings one \nSTILL LATER \nThe baby penguins are HOWLING now. \nAnxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance. \nOut of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS materialises. \nPENGUIN LOOKOUTS ...Wives-ho! Wives-ho! ...Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho! ...Better late than never. \nThe distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks and rush towards the distressed females. \nMALE PENGUINS ...Barbra-Ann! ...Peggy Sue! (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: MALE PENGUINS (CONT'D) ...Hey Paula! ...Roxanne!! \nA tumult of re-unions as partners find each other. But no luck for WISHFUL. \nWISHFUL NORMA J.?! \nWeaving anxiously through the throng, overhearing: \nMALE#1 You're not as fat as I thought you'd be. \nFEMALE#1 It was pretty slim pickings. Something's happened I tell you \nFEMALE#2 Even the squid were hard to get We had to swim forever \nFEMALE#3 Everyone split up. A lot of the gals never made it back. \nMALE #2 ...Delilah? \nMALE #3 ...Gloria?! Gloria??! \nWISHFUL, is running frantically through the crowd, singing all the time in the hope of being recogniosed \nWISHFUL Since my baby left me. I found a new place to dwell. Down the bottom of lonely street at heartbreak hotel \nMUMBLE hippity-hops after his father, trying to keep up... \nWISHFUL (CONT'D) Woah I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely I could... \nMICK Me! Me! I've got one! (sings) \"I can't get no...satisfaction.... I can't get no...girly action...\" \nTEACHER Well Michael, if you think that's really you. What have you got for us, Ella? \nELLA (sings) Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...ce soir? \nMUMBLE (laughs) That doesn't make any sense. \nTEACHER Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better \nMUMBLE Mine is more sort of a... \nHe hesitates, as if listening to something in his head.Then, he sings UTTERLY TUNELESS, like a drum solo. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom \nTEACHER You heard that in there? \nMumble is still going. TITTERS and SNIGGERS from the class. \nMUMBLE You like it? \nTEACHER Dear, that's not even a tune. \nMUMBLE It's not? \nTEACHER No, a tune is like... (she sings a scale) La la la la la la la la. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nMUMBLE Oh, La la la la la \nA croaky monotone.   The class LAUGHS OPENLY. \nTEACHER (getting worried) Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la la la la!! \nMUMBLE La la la la la la la la!! \nTEACHER (emphatically) La La La La La La La La! \nMUMBLE But that's what I'm doing, \nThe class fall about in HYSTERICS. \nMUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D) Whats funny? (genuinely perplexed) What's funny? \nLATER \nMUMBLE's PARENTS are talking to the TEACHER. \nTEACHER (sotto) It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did anything happen - you know...- during early development? \nNORMA J. No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't it honey? \nWishful shuffles guiltily. \nWISHFUL Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter I guess, and he did hatch a little late, but... (at a loss.) Is there really nothing we can do? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nTEACHER Of course there is. Thats why we have Mrs Astrakhan. \nMRS ASTRAKHAN'S \nSome distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher. \nHe stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who are now performing with increasing virtuosity. \nElla is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the wind. \nMumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever be able to sing like that. \nMUMBLE Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult \nA piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) I couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going. \nMusic over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice, \nGradually the colony begins to thin. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Looking for what? I don't know? A different type of penguin? \nThe noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and looks up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) And that's exactly what I found. \nTHE EDGE \nBefore him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird. \nA Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings angrily...\"There's no business like show business. \nCU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony and then back out over the wasteland \nMUMBLE Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here. \nFade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off, skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing to his hearts content until.... \na shadow passes over him and \nWhump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him. \nSKUA Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird? \nMUMBLE Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing? \nTHREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded. \nSKUA#1 Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch. Hey hey hey... \nMUMBLE (hopefully) Lunch?...There's food? Here? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSKUA#1 (to others) Leg or wing? \nTheir dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy and backs away. \nMUMBLE But ...but. I'm a penguin. \nSKUA#1 Exackly! De flipperbirds - dat's you - eat de fish. De flyinbirds - dat's me - eat de flipperbird an' de fish. Right now D'ain't no fish -- so...you do the math. \nThe FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE. \nFIRST SKUA And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits. \nMUMBLE I don't have juicy bits! Look... all bone and feather! Feel for yourself. \nHe opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls into a narrow CREVICE in the ice. \nFIRST SKUA (CONT'D) Hey! Whatcha think ya doin' down dere flipperbird? Get back up here dis minute! \nThe other Skuas move in to help. MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK as they spear at him with their beaks. \nSKUAS ...Come on, out witcha! ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird! \nThey can't get hold of him. Frustrated, they turn on the FIRST SKUA, squabbling and whacking each other with their wings. \nSKUAS (CONT'D) ...Great, Yellaleg. ...What did we tell ya ...ya leddim geddaway, dincha with ya screwy alientalk. \nFIRST SKUA Hey, Don't peck me or I'll peck you and when I peck you know you've been pecked...(fade) \nMUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and argue viciously among themselves \nMUMBLE (VO) Compared with that, school almost seemed like fun \nTHE CRECHE \nMUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young penguins are taking school lessons. \nMUMBLE (V.O.) Most days I hid at the back, dreaming about the world beyond \nMUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with bulging eyes and tentacled hands. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE Time passed. We all grew up \nTIME LAPSE \nAs the class transforms into moulting adolescents \nMUMBLE (V.O.) But right up to graduation I never did find my heartsong \nLATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY \nDozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers underneath. \nThey stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent \nCARUSO Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep. \nMUMBLE (VO) Caruso. He couldn't help himself. \nCARUSO. Things are not as they were. For five years now we have known nothing but famine. But you are our hope. Upon your survival depends the very future of the entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim far. May the Great Penguinus go with you. And remember... \nWith solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air and shouts. \nCARUSO Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah! \nMASSED GRADUATES Excelsi-yah ! Yah yah yah! \nAWAY FROM THE CRECHE \nFollow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head which has not yet moulted off. \nMusic Over: Schools Out by Alice Cooper \nMUMBLE Dad, Ma, can I go with the others \nNORMA J. puts a protective flipper around her son. \nNORMA-J I don't know Wishful. I still don't think he's ready. \nELLA Mumble? \nThey tentatively crane over the edge. No sign of him. They peer into the water. \nGRADUATE ...Lunatic! ...where did he go? ...See any blood? \nThen...MUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile... \nMUMBLE Whatcha waiting for? It's fantast...(splosh) \n... as he falls back under water again. \nELLA Go Mumble! \nWithout hesitation ELLA follows him. \nThe others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en masse leap yelling and hollering. \nSURFACE/ UNDERWATER \nThe penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking \nMUMBLE I had an instinct I'd be good at this. Actually we all were. We were the best. \nUNDERWATER \nTransformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles. \nOver this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS. \nBEACH BOYS \"Suntanned bodies and the waves of sunshine. Those California girls and the beautiful coastline. In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again...\" \nTwo PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE... \nTHE SURFACE \nSkidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a breathless heap on top of each other. \nELLA Mumble? \nMUMBLE Ella? \nThey scramble to their feet...but the ice is slippery.They clutch together, slipping and sliding. \nELLA Woah! \nMUMBLE I've got you! No I don't. \nLeaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close now, eyes meeting. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Yes I do. \nA brief moment then. \nMALE PENGUIN Hi Ella. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE (V.O.) The only bad thing about being with Ella. It was always so darned crowded. \nAs others pop up all around \nMALE PENGUINS ...Ella! ...Where da get to? ...there you are! \nLaughing, she dives into the water. The young males follow her. MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after her. \nMUMBLE (spent) You're welcome. \nON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT \nThe entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the AURORA AUSTRALIS. \nThe PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing: \nELLA AND THE OTHERS \"Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations a happenin' with her, \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" \nThe HARMONIES are exquisite until... \nMUMBLE (very loud and tuneless) \"...Good, Good, Good...Good VibRatiOns...\" \nThe singing STOPS. \nMALE PENGUINS ...Mumble, ...Knock it off. \nThe singing RESUMES. \nELLA AND THE CHOIR \"Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations A happenin' with her.\" \nAnother CRESCENDO... \nELLA AND THE CHOIR (CONT'D) \"Ahhh...\" \nIt's too much for MUMBLE. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE \"...AaahhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhh...\" \nThis stops the whole thing dead. ELLA pads over to him. \nELLA (gently) Mumble, the thing is... \nMUMBLE I know. I know \nELLA ....It's better if you just listen. \nShe returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE. \nELLA AND THE OTHERS MUMBLE!!! \nMUMBLE (retreating) OK! I'll quit. OK! \nAN ICE-FLOE \nWe find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the others on their iceberg. \nAs their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE. \nTIME LAPSE \nAs night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current \nMusic Over: \"The tracks of my tears\" \nMORNING \nHe is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice. \nMUMBLE (sleepily) Woah. Whose there. \nAnother nudge. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nAN ADELIE That thing with The feet. (to the others) \u00a1Hola muchachos! (to Mumble) Show them! \nMUMBLE Well...I just kind of go ...like this...and then this... \nBolder now, he does a few neat steps. \nTHE ADELIES ...\u00a1Oye! Ritmo Cubana! ...\u00a1Riba Riba! Shake those hips! ...Yo penguino, bust a move! \nThey COPY HIM, improvising little riffs on his dance step. The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them. \nTHE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...Then mebbe something like... ...No. I got it. Watch me! \nAn Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own. The LEOPARD SEAL is almost upon them. \nMUMBLE Or how about ... \nMUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face comes down hard on the ice \nTHE ADELIES (to the winded Seal) ...Eat my ice, lardface. ...Kiss my frozen toosh, rubber butt \nThey fall about laughing. The Leopard Seal returns to the water. \nLEOPARD SEAL I know where you live. \nTHE ADELIES ...Yeah, it's called The Land, tubby. ...Flop back anytime! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nLaughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off. MUMBLE watches them go. \nADELIES ...Hey, ain't you coming, tallboy? ...Or you got something better to do? \nMUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes, all the way to the horizon. Nothing... \nHe shrugs and hurries off after his new friends. \nFURTHER ON \nA strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and MUMBLE crest the rise, to see... \nADELIE LAND \nA vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio, very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony. \nMUMBLE Wow, there are so many of you! \nTHE ADELIES ...Hey, this is nothin'. ...Used to be twice as many of us. ...Yeah, back when you could still catch a fish. \nMUMBLE The shortage has affected you too?! \nAN ADELIE ...Who you calling shortish? ...All I know is a lot of us ain't comin' back. ....And Some folks so hungry they eating rocks \nSure enough An ADELIE walks by, a PEBBLE in his beak. \nTHE ADELIES (laughing) ...Eating rocks!!? ...That is major funny. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE Why funny? That's terrible \nADELIES ...Just kidding the rocks are for nest- building ...That's how its works here. The one with the most rocks gets the chicas. ..Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom BOOM! \nMUMBLE So why aren't you guys collecting them \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nMUMBLE Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you? \nLOVEDAY Enough! How many questions is that? You don't have enough pebbles. \nADELIES IN QUEUE ...Yeah, one pebble, one question. ...We've all got stuff to ask, pal! \nMUMBLE But I haven't had any answers yet! \nLOVEDAY SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are speaking. They say show some respect stranger. Especially to the One who Knows. \nA hush falls over the gathering. \nLOVEDAY (CONT'D) The reason there are not enough fish is simple: There is not enough love in the world. Love is the answer! \nOne cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love \nLOVEDAY (CONT'D) (over this) Okay, everybody, turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a safe place. \nThe gathering hug awkwardly. Mumble, because of his towering height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him. \nLOVEDAY (CONT'D) Now. The Mating Season starts today so here's what everybody should do: go forth and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be first \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nMUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him \nFEMALE ADELIES ..Me Loveday. ..Me! ..No Me ! \nLOVEDAY One at a time! And don't touch the Talisman! \nADELIES ....I liked him better when he was just plain Pedro. ...Did he say it starts today ...why didn't someone tell us. ...We gotta get to work guys!! \nThey start posturing for the any FEMALES they can attract \nTHE ADELIES ...\u00a1Hola Baby! Get your chica boom-boom here. ... Turn round, look at us!. \nA couple of females look up from the scrum \nFEMALE ...How many rocks you got. \nHER FRIEND ...Forget `em honey. They only one between the six of them...and they just spent it. \nAN ADELIE (getting desperate) Wait. Look. \nThe Adelies all start DANCING MADLY, but it is too frenetic, too desperate. \nADELIES ...You like it ...Arriba! ...What do you need stones for \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) \nFEMALE FRIEND Try sitting on the ice for a month. It might come to you Salsa Boy. Come on, Consuela. \nRejected, the Amigos stop dancing. \nTHE ADELIES ...Their loss, guys. ...Ramon, where you going? \nRamon is SEARCHING frantically for PEBBLES. \nRAMON Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere! (to Mumble) Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from? \nMUMBLE We don't collect them. All we have to do is , well... We sing \nAN ADELIE ...Easy as that? ...So why aren't you over there? \nELLA (shakes her head, tearful) When you left without saying goodbye I thought something had happened, then I thought he just doesn't care. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nMUMBLE Don't care? I never stopped thinking about you. \nELLA And then when I saw you singing, for a second I thought... \nMUMBLE I can't sing. \nELLA I know. I know. Its impossible. \nShe walks off. \nMUMBLE But I'll show you something better \nHe TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Sing something to this! \nELLA (her back to him) What's the point. It's embarrassing \nMUMBLE Just try it. This once. \nElla begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and without conviction. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going. \nThe singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic \nTHE ADELIE \"...turn around you fool You know I love you more and more...\" \nRight on cue, the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of him, singing back-up. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nTHE ADELIES \"Tell me why is it so Don't wanna let you go I never can say goodbye, no...no no no...\" \nCurious, ELLA TURNS. \nFramed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it for a moment... then lets rip. \nHe TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS \nFEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps. \nNow ELLA is caught up in it. AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE! \nMUMBLE This is it Ella! This is the song inside me! \nELLA is ecstatic. Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be swept up into the abandon. A DARK FIGURE steps forward \nCARUSO (bellows) STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!! \nELLA STOPS DANCING. MUMBLE misses a beat, loses his footing, trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO and the ELDERS. \nCARUSO (CONT'D) WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ABOMINATION?!! \nMUMBLE I'm just showing them Happy Feet \nCARUSO Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE! \nThe ADELIES shuffle uncomfortably. Caruso turns to the rest of the emperors \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nMUMBLE Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried \nELLA But... \nMUMBLE Now go back. I love you. Go. \nElla returns to the community. As she does so, CARUSO begins to CHANT the Gathering answers. \nCARUSO \"Together we stand\" \nALL \"Divided we freeze.\" \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (7) \nALL (CONT'D) Recite the Wisdoms! \nALL (CONT'D) \"In the Wisdoms we trust.\" \nCARUSO \"When all others leave...\" \nALL \"We Remain.\" \nCARUSO Louder. More fervent bretheren. \"When the Sun vanishes...\" \nALL \"We Remain.\" \nELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist. \nTHE ICE SHELF \nMumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind, trekking homewards \nADELIES Tell me again where we're going. \nMUMBLE To find the mystic beings. \nADELIES How do we know where they live. \nMUMBLE We'll ask Loveday. He's been there. \nADELIELAND \nMost of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at them. \nMOTHER ...Not so close. We got babies on board \nADELIES ...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nThey find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted. \nTHE ADELIES ...LOVEDAY, you okay?? ...what happened ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin? \nMUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him. \nMUMBLE Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings? \nLOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling rumbles from his throat. \nAN ADELIE Why don't he speak? \nLOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC round his neck. \nAN ADELIE (CONT'D) Talisman...sounds like Talisman!! \nLOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains. \nAN ADELIE (CONT'D) He wants to go to the top of the mountain. \nLOVEDAY shakes his head. \nMUMBLE The forbidden place is over the mountains... \nLOVEDAY nods. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) ...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!? \nLOVEDAY gestures wildly with his flippers! \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) ...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nLOVEDAY nods `YES!!' and falls back in exhaustion. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) So who's coming \nLOVEDAY Oi \nA MOUNTAIN RIDGE \nThe Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging behind, breathing hard. \nEven MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the climb. \nMusic Over: He aint heavy he's my brother. \nADELIES ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even close. \nThen on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'. \nMUMBLE Hear that?! \nAs they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the LAND of the ELEPHANT SEALS. Thousands of them. \nTHE ADELIES ...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin? ...No, no...jus' krill and fish. ...Sure of your facts are you? \nNot waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side, slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES follow. \nADELIES Well I guess we're about to find out \nTHE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS \nThe beach is literally heaving. \nMUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to two HUGE SEALS. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nELEPHANT SEAL 1 (big-bellied, booming southern voice) Well roll me over and call me a dugong. What the heck have we got here \nThe Adelies bunch up behind Mumble \nMUMBLE Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore. \nELEPHANT SEAL 2 Sure. Just git yourselves over them there hills I'd come with you myself but... \nELEPHANT SEAL 1 Woah Woah. You aint told em half of it: over them hills, beyond the great glacier, `n' through the blizzard country. \nThe Good Ole Boys are into ONE-UPMANSHIP. \nTHE ADELIES ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! ...We should be migrating out to sea by now! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE We need to huddle! \nTHE ADELIES Huddle??! \nMUMBLE Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth! \nHe turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him. \nTHE ADELIES ...Oh yeah, nice. ...That's definitely better. ...Good call big guy. \nMUMBLE I said a circle! \nThey form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from the upwind position, the Adelies complain. \nAN ADELIE ...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way. \nThey scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops the FULL BLAST of the GALE. \nHe gives up and marches off into the driving snow. \nTHE ADELIES ...Hey! ...What happened to the Huddle?! \nMUMBLE (shouts back) Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!! \nThe others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their fronts \nTHE ADELIES ...Oh no, now I got chest pain ...tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) THE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...just keep moving or you'll get my beak up your butt \nFLARE OUT TO WHITE \nThe blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness. \nOne by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance. \nThey have finally reached the sea again \nMUMBLE You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore? \nLOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'. \nADELIES ....The way I feel\": the \"frostbitten\" shore ....So what are those black things?. \nClose to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings \nAN ABANDONED WHALING STATION \nThe PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing- sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned, and half concealed by snow. \nAround and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting twisted METALWORK. \nMUMBLE Hello?! Is there anyone out there? \nAn ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the wind. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Hello!! \nTHE ADELIES ...No need to shout. ...Yeah, somebody might hear you. ...I think we seen all there is to see round here. \nLOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nLOVEDAY is FLUNG high, high into the air and...SPLASHES DOWN some distance away. \nThe KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in its teeth. \nICE SHELF \nMUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted. \nWondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS huddle nearby. \nSuddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars right over the top of them \nIt hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their good fortune. \nTheres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them through the fog. \nThe ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees HUMAN FIGURES... \nMUMBLE Aliens?! \nThe pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT JUGGERNAUT. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Stop! Please!.... \nFrom a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at THE SHIP as it advances towards him. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) ...It's very important! \nThe ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP, Mumble topples into the gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM, huge propellers churning, leaving a channel ninety feet wide. \nMUMBLE resurfaces. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) WE...HAVE...TO...TALK! \nHe chases after the ship. THE ADELIES chase after Mumble... \nTHE ADELIES ...AMIGO-O-O-O! ...LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!! \nAlready the ship is half a mile away. \nTHE ICEBERG \nBeyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to keep up. \nTHE SUMMIT \nMUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about a mile away. The Adelies join him. \nTHE ADELIES ...You found them, you found Aliens! ...Now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish. \nMumble's     eyes remain fixed on the horizon. \nTHE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...Don't feel bad Tall Guy. ...They were just too fast. Too big. ...Too everything. \nMUMBLE They've stopped! \nLOVEDAY Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I say this because I admire and deeply respect you. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking. You are out of your crazy head \nMUMBLE Say Hi to Ella for me \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPENGUIN HEAVEN \nBright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE. \nMUMBLE Wow. They brought me home \nHis voice ECHOES back at him, with a mocking edge. There is something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles by \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Excuse me, where are we. \nPENGUIN Heaven. Where d'you think? \nMUMBLE Oh. So we're dead. Right \nPENGUIN Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got water. You hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one. Perfect. \nMumble is looking around, trying to figure it out \nPENGUIN (CONT'D) Fish! \nMUMBLE Where? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nA fish hits him on the head. \nA moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of PENGUINS: Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins, emerging from holes in the rock face \nPENGUINS Fish time. Fish time! \nLying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. It's RAINING FISH! \nMUMBLE (VO) Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon. \nHis POV, Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky \nUNDERWATER \nFish hit the surface and sink \nMUMBLE (V.O.) Fish on land and fish underwater. \nMumble pursues one of them. \nMUMBLE Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it \nHe swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass. ALIEN FACES are pressed against it. Mumble yells and shoots to the surface. \nTHE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE \nHigh up he sees the viewing gallery. A great CROWD of ALIENS staring and chattering \nMUMBLE (V.O.) Aliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleep \nMumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON. He puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on it. This place is beginning to upset him. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMUMBLE (yells at the aliens) What have you done to my wing! This is not my home! I want to get out of here! \nThe other penguins stand around, immobile, chomping fish. \nOLD TIMER PENGUIN Guess he's new here \nTHE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) That's it! Excellent! \u00a1Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!! \nCARUSO. Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will protect us \nAs he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous gust of wind \nCaruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing the air. \nIt swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little distance away. \nMusic Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) \nNow the entire emperor community are dancing for all they are worth. \nPENGUINS ....Aliens. ... I never doubted it for a moment \nMrs Astrakhan dances past \nMRS ASTRAKHAN More feelink. BE SPONTANUOUS!! \nWishful dances over to her, his eyes on Mumble and Ella \nWISHFUL (dancing) You know who that is? That's my boy! \nMRS ASTRAKHAN (dancing) Know him? He ees my star pupol! I TEACH HIM EVERYTHINGK! \nBY THE CHINOOK \nHUMAN scientists disembark. Skidoos are kicked into life. \nWe TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony \nScientists POV: As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in astonishment. One of them lifts a video cam to record \nTHOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED JOY. \nMUMBLE (VO) From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more. \nA CONFERENCE ROOM \nSuited figures are seated round a large table, watching as IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen. \nWithout the music it's less obviously a dance. \nCHAIRMAN ...So what do you reckon? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nEXPERT Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. We'd certainly back the long-term study. \nCHAIRMAN And the international treaty? \nDELEGATE#1 Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. No fishing whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever. \nDELEGATE#2 So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing. \nDELEGATE#3 Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet... \nDELEGATE#2 Better if their government hear it from our government via your government... \nCHAIRMAN What the heck. The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop. \nTHE COLONY \n", "test1_input": "UNDERWATER \nThe Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks, slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the surface recede. \nMusic Over: \"Ground Control to major Tom\" \nON THE SURFACE \nADELIES ...Where's the tall-boy ...I thought he was with you. \nThey jump back in to look for him \nUNDERWATER \nMumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral- like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light. \nMUMBLE ....stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining. \nImbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of, An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier. \nIt hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem. \nMumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST. \nINSIDE THE BULLDOZER \nA rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard. \nHe pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the sound it makes. \nOUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER \nIn the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES congregate. \nTHE ADELIES ... You sure he went in there? ...Mumble! ...Done go near it, looks like it can bite \nOne of them smims closer to the great jaws \nADELIES Ramos! \nMumble pops his head out from between the jaws \nMUMBLE Oh! There you are \nTerrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like missiles. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Guys!    I want to speak to you. \nTHE ICE SHELF \nThe Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them \nADELIES ...Forget it ...We're not going back there ...Never \nMUMBLE But its dead. It can't hurt you \nADELIES ...Maybe its got a brother still alive. \nMUMBLE But that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish. \nThe idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their tracks. \nADELIES Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one. \nMUMBLE The who? \n", "test1_true": "MUMBLE Why stones? Wait for me \nLOVEDAY'S MOUND \nMUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their beak. \nAt the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a HOLY MANTLE. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nA group of Soul singers, mainly female, sway in the background, singing a soulful song of adoration as the Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward. \nLOVEDAY First, the devotion... \nThe PENGUIN adds his pebble to the pile. \nLOVEDAY holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over the gospel choir \nLOVEDAY (CONT'D) A moment... (composing himself) ... and your question? \nFIRST IN QUEUE Se\u00f1or Loveday, My wife is one of the Disappeared ones Tell me is she alive? \nLoveday hyperventillates, his eyes roll up in his head \nLOVEDAY The Mystic Beings are speaking to me. Yes! She is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts... \nFIRST IN QUEUE But is she with another male? \nLOVEDAY One pebble, one question. Next! \nThe AMIGOS push MUMBLE forward. He is at least a head taller than the others. \nLOVEDAY (CONT'D) I sense...you are the one with the question. \nADELIE ...How does he do it? ...He just one look and he know. \nMumble places the pebble on the pile. A long Pause \nLOVEDAY A little nervous? That's normal. Take your time. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nIn fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching LOVEDAY's six pack holder. He bends forwards to study it more closely \nMUMBLE I was wondering. Have You ever been abducted by Aliens? \nLOVEDAY No time wasters. Next! \nTHE ADELIES ...Se\u00f1or! That's not his question. He's new here. (prompting Mumble) ...The yellow thing ...Ask him what's taking the fish? \nMUMBLE (ignoring them) ...you see I met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs.... \nLOVEDAY ...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about? \nMUMBLE ... and he said he was abducted by Aliens. \nLOVEDAY (starts to wheeze and cough) Listen friend, this is my Sacred Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic Beings... \nMUMBLE Looks like they bestowed it very tight. \nLOVEDAY ...during my Epic Journey of Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore! \nMUMBLE So these Mystic Beings, did you see them? \nLOVEDAY I hear them.

Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the water. \nUNDERWATER \nIts peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!! \nA BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening. \nMUMBLE Too loud. \nHe surfaces, spluttering. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Too loud! \nA VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An ALBATROSS hovers overhead. \nALBATROSS He's looking for a mate, mate.

Fish is just the start of it Mate. Them aliens is the ones who took out the whales. \nMUMBLE They kill whales! That's impossible \nALBATROSS Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever lived. Decimated, mate. \nMUMBLE So if I wanted to talk to them, where would I go \nALBATROSS Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them fly.

Do you think the Whale would take me there? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nThe Blue Whale responds with a long mournful \"NO-O-O-O\" which the Albatross does not need to translate. \nALBATROSS No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. And neither should you. \nMumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the warnings. \nHe makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards the convergence. \nThe Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches. \nALBATROSS (CONT'D) Don't say I didn't warn you \nThe ALBATROSS wheels away. \n", "test2_true": "THE CONVERGENCE \nWe see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see.

It is MUMBLE. \nA creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible. \nWith great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS. \nA WHITE ROOM \nScientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on shelves line the walls. \nMUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp. \nThere is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil from his feathers with detergent.

Skua-talk? \nAnother SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is administered. \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Oh no! Not the pointy thing! \nDrowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE.

You haven't changed a bit. \nAs he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY CHICKS following behind her \nMUMBLE (CONT'D) Are these all yours? \nELLA They're my singing students. \nMUMBLE So.

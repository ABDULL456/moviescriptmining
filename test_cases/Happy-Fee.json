The ships are only half a mile away when Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH. \nMumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as. \nUP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the water and is winched on board. \nMUMBLE (yells) HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! WHAT ABOUT US?! THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!! \nAs if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the sea around him erupts in churning foam. \nSwamped by the wake, Mumble goes under.

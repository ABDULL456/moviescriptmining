{"train": "At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting or stammering - just friendly and relaxed. \nKIRK Morning. \nMOLLY Oh, hello again. \nKIRK Second trip in two days? \nMolly is putting her laptop back in her bag. \nMOLLY Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop to L.A. but they've got me going back and forth three days in a row. This client is killing me. \nKIRK Well hang in there kiddo and I guess I'll see you tomorrow. \nMOLLY It's a date. \nMolly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk. \nFULLER Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever like to...you know...put my penis in her vagina. (wink) \nBack at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine. Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes. \nROCKER What the hell!? \nHe grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch. \nSTAINER Dude, I am so sorry. \nROCKER Sorry my ass! This thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker! \nSTAINER Yeah, I bet it was but... \nStainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) \"TSA is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process...\" \nStainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand- written on the back. He reads them aloud. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) \"...so fuck you.\" \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nKirk enters to find his MOTHER, an attractive old woman, sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age. \nKIRK Hey Mom.   Hey Marnie. \nMRS. KETTNER Oh, hi Sweetie. \nAcross the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment. \nKIRK Who's that guy Dad's with? \nMARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside. \nMARNIE Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and I staying so close since we broke up but I know how much Grammy meant to you... Well, is it okay with you that I'm here? \nKIRK Sure.   It's fine.   (it's not) \nMARNIE Okay, good. Then can I introduce you to my new boyfriend? \nShe leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his father. They are laughing again. \nMARNIE (CONT'D) Ron, this is Kirk. \nRON Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! (Ron and Mr. Kettner laugh) No! I'm just jack-assin' with you, pirate. Great to meet you. How you doing? \nKIRK I've been better. \nRON Right. Of course. I'm sorry about your grandmother. It's just so... Well, old people, you know, what are you gonna do? \nKIRK Yeah.   Thanks. \nKirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the hall. They are both in their late thirties and good-looking for trailer trash. Debbie is about seven months pregnant. \nERIC Little brother.   Grammy wants to see you. \nKIRK Okay.   Well, I better get in there. \nMOLLY Oh Geeze. Please tell me I didn't get you in trouble back there. \nKIRK No, no. It's not that.    I ah...I lost somebody today. \nMolly sits down and puts her hand on his hand. \nMOLLY Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I know... I lost my grandmother a few months ago and I... \nKirk tears up again and so does Molly. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Your grandmother too? And you were close? Oh, you poor thing. \nKirk tries to keep it together.   Molly looks at the photo. \nKIRK She used to be a blackjack dealer at the Horseshoe. When I was little, she taught me and my friends how to play poker. Turned us into a bunch of eight-year-old degenerate gamblers. \nThey share a sad laugh. \nKIRK (CONT'D) So, your grandmother too, huh? \nMolly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother. \nMOLLY My Grammy Keenan was ninety four but independent right to the end. She was always trying to cook for everyone. You couldn't stop her. \nKIRK Oh, God, I know. Grammy used to change her own oil. Right up until a few months ago. She was... Do you change your own oil? \nMOLLY (LAUGHS) No. I wouldn't know where to begin. \nKIRK I know, me neither. She could barley walk and I'd come over and find her lying under her Cadillac all covered in grease. \nThey share a laugh and Kirk is cheering up a bit.   An announcement comes over the PA. \nGATE AGENT ...final boarding call for United flight 94 to Burbank... \nMOLLY Oh, geeze, that's me. I'm so sorry. \nKIRK No, no.   Go catch your flight. \nMolly stands and offers her hand to Kirk. \nMOLLY I'm Molly. \nKIRK Kirk Kettner. \nMolly squeezes Kirk's hand, grabs her bags and trots off toward her gate. A businessman near Kirk's table reaches over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder. \nBUSINESSMAN Dead Grandma. (a nod and a cheek click) Nice one. \nINT. AIRPORT GATE \nMolly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight. \nINT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP \nKirk gathers his things and notices that Molly left her pictures on the table. He looks through them. In the last pouch are some business cards that read, \"Molly McCall - Event Planner.\" Her cell number is on the card. \nINT. AIRPLANE 737 \nMolly is sitting in a window seat. The flight is mostly empty. The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat next to Molly. He casually smiles as though there is nothing odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and many full rows) are open. Molly looks at the vacant seats and then at him as if to say, \"You've got to be kidding.\" \nCREEPY BUSINESSMAN How you doin'? \nMolly's phone rings and she fumbles to answer it.   A FEMALE PASSENGER sitting two rows back looks annoyed. \nINTERCUT: AIRPLANE / AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP \nMOLLY Hello? \nKIRK Oh, hi.   Molly McCall? \nMOLLY Who's calling please? \nKIRK It's Kirk... From the coffee shop. You left your pictures with me. If you tell me which gate you're at, I can run them right down to you. \nMOLLY Oh, no. I'm already on the plane and we're pushing back right now. \nKIRK Okay, well I'll leave them at the lost and found and when you get... \nSTAINER (CONT'D) ...Marnie...don't you think Marnie Tomkins is kind of nasty? \nMARNIE I don't know who that is. \nSTAINER Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins? She's just this girl. I thought you knew her. Anyway, she's pretty nasty looking... but you're looking good. \nMARNIE Kirk, I'm sorry about Grammy. \nThe guys slink away to give Kirk and Marnie some privacy. \nMARNIE (CONT'D) I realize she was never that crazy about me but I know how much you loved her and I hope you're okay. \nKIRK Thanks.   Thanks, I'll be alright. \nMARNIE Listen, are you going to Branson with your folks next month? \nKIRK No.   It's not really my thing. \nMARNIE What's wrong with Branson?     You too good for Branson now? \nKIRK No.   Branson's...awesome. \nMARNIE Well, your mom invited Ron and I along. We'd love to go but not if it's going to be weird for you. \nKirk considers this.   It will be weird. \nMARNIE (CONT'D) ...I mean the tickets are non- refundable but it's up to you. \nStainer overhears this and groans out loud. \nKIRK No. You should go. I'm sure you'll have a great time. Totally. \nMarnie hugs Kirk.   This makes him uncomfortable. \nMARNIE Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened with us. You're going to make someone very happy someday, but you have to get over me first, okay? Is it a deal? \nMarnie hugs him again and then departs. \nSTAINER She's going to Branson with your fucking parents? And bringing her new fucking boyfriend!? \nKIRK Yeah. He seems like a good guy, though.  He's an entrepreneur. \nAcross the room they see Marnie return to Ron with a hug. \nJACK Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that guy. He owns a Pizza Hut. \nKIRK So?   That's a business. \nSTAINER It's not even a real Pizza Hut. It's one of those strip-mall take- out ones. They don't even have chicken wings. The guy's a fuckin' douche bag. \nKIRK He's got more going on than I do. That's all I'm saying. \nSTAINER Dude, you can do a hell of a lot better than her. \nDEVON One door closes, another door opens. \nSTAINER Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even make any sense. But take this broad that's coming here tonight - I got a feeling about her. You're gonna get on that. \nJACK Absolutely. Visualize it. \nKIRK I appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, I'm telling you, I have zero chance with this one and I'm completely okay with that. \nDEVON That's defeatist thinking. \nKIRK No it isn't. It's just like saying I'll never go to the moon and I'm okay with that too. \nSTAINER You're saying you don't want to go to the moon? That's bullshit. \nKIRK No. I'm saying that I never will go to the moon but I'm not going to get down about it because, you know - I never expected to. \nSTAINER You don't know. Technology and shit. You might go to the moon. \nKirk waves to someone at the door.   The guys look up. \nThe guys' POV: Molly is stepping toward them - dressed in a beautiful gown. They laugh the way you might laugh at a particularly brutal football tackle. \nDEVON Holy Frijole. \nSTAINER Blindo? \nPATTY Kirk, Molly's sister is blind. \nKIRK Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... \nMOLLY (not offended) Oh, I know. It's fine. \nINT. BROADCAST BOOTH \nThe radio announcers are calling the game. \nANNOUNCER Forty Five seconds left on the Power Play and the Sharks are knocking at the door. \nINT. HOCKEY ARENA \nREESE So, after the game, you wanna party? \nMOLLY You know my policy on players, Bobby. And you might have noticed we've already got dates. \nThe penalty ends and the ref opens the box but Reese is not paying attention. \nREESE Come on, Molly. Just give me a chance, eh.   I'm a great guy - ask any of these assholes. \nThe crowd is booing Reese. \nMOLLY Reese, you'd better... \nREESE You can't seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers. \nSTAINER Hey! Fuck you Reese!    You suck this year anyway! \nReese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts Stainer. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) You dick! \nStainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and trying to pummel the huge player. Security is on him in a flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena. \nReese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late. The Sharks score and the crowd revolts. A red-haired redneck woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to Molly and company. \nRED-HAIRED WOMAN You idiots just cost us a goal!    I hope you're happy! \nPATTY You'd better check that tone, Reba! You do NOT want me comin' up there! \nMOLLY Patty! Stop it! I'll go see what I can do about Stainer. \nKIRK No, this is my fault, I'll take care of it. \nMOLLY No, it's okay. I know the head of security. I'll be right back. \nMolly exits and Patty sits back down next to Kirk. \nKIRK God, I'm really embarrassed. \nPATTY That's okay, if Reese did that to me I'd have gone over the glass too. But I would have landed a few before they got me. Reese has been all over Molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend. I tell you, that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men. \nKIRK What? How is that even possible? She's so... \nPATTY Tell me about it. I'm no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on - if know what I'm saying. \nKIRK Yeah.   I think I do. \nPATTY It's a curse, looking like that. Who has the balls to hit on her? Just the most arrogant A-holes like Reese out there. \nKIRK Yeah, I suppose. \nPATTY Listen, Molly brought me along tonight because, you know, she thought I might be 'interested.' \nKIRK Oh.   Oh yeah? \nPATTY But, just for honesty's sake, I'm not interested. No offense. \nKIRK No! Hey! None taken. I don't blame you. I know I'm no Brad Pitt. That's cool. \nPATTY What? You? No, I'm talking about your pal, Stainer. I know he's your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit. (THEN) Wait. Why would you think I was talking about you? \nKIRK I'm sorry.     I didn't mean to assume anything. \nSTAINER Okay. Anyway... I love Kirky but let's face it, the guy's a three. \nDEVON Stainer, that's just dirty pool. He's at least a four. \nSTAINER You're outta your fuckin' mind - four! You go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass. I'm just being honest. \nStainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the glass. It projects onto the overhead scoreboard. \nKIRK I can live with three. \nSTAINER He's a nice guy and he's funny. Those are a half a point each. \nStainer continues the equation on the projector. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) But he drives a shit box so we gotta deduct a point for that. \nDEVON Kirk said she likes his Taurus. \nSTAINER That's so fucked, I won't even dignify it with a response. So we're back to three. Meanwhile, this Molly is a hard ten. \nDEVON A hard ten? \nSTAINER Generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind. That's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare. A seven point disparity - that's a chasm. The most you can jump is two points. I can't even get a ten. \nJACK Oh, not even you, huh? \nSTAINER I'm a five, okay? \nJACK Bullshit.    Then what am I? \nSTAINER You're a seven and a half. \nJACK Fine, you're a five then. \nSTAINER Okay, so I get a two point bump for being in a band. That puts me at seven. On a good day, most I can bag is a niner. \nKIRK What about your shitty car? \nSTAINER Artist exemption. I'm expected to have a shitty car. \nJACK Is there an artist exemption for being a jag-off? \nSTAINER Fuckin' A there is. \nKIRK Stainer's right. Patty was probably just messing around. It's not a big deal. Let's just bowl. \nDEVON What about Rick Ocasek?   Billy Joel, Donald Trump... \nSTAINER Yeah, dumbass. Those are the wild- cards. Money and fame. \nJACK So, if he were a millionaire? \nSTAINER A mil ain't what it once was, Jackie. Devon's practically a millionaire for Christ sake. A mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days - two million minimum. \nStainer finishes the equation by writing, \"Kirk = Fucked.\" Kirk's phone rings. He checks the ID and his eyes go wide. \nKIRK (into the phone) Hey, Molly... Um, yeah, sure... No, that sounds good. Yeah, I know where that is. Um, okay, yeah... see you then. \nKirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Holy crap. (dazed pause) She just asked me out for tomorrow night! \nKirk exchanges fives, fists, tips and hugs with Devon and Jack. Stainer shakes his head, still not buying it. \nINT. BOWLING ALLEY MEN'S ROOM \nKirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom. He stares into the mirror and his smile fades into panic. He splashes water on his face. He reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser is empty. \nKIRK (to himself) It's okay. Get it together. Guys do this all the time. You can do this. You can make it happen. \nRANDOM MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (from inside a stall) You better not be jerking off in the sink, man! \nEXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT - DAY \nKirk's Taurus pulls into a space. He climbs out and slams the door. As it closes, he reaches but too late. He looks through the window. The keys are hanging in the ignition. \nINT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS \nThe picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of Grammy sitting in her kitchen. She has just clicked the video camera on with a remote control. \nMAURY (CONT'D) Oh, good.    There she is. \nGRAMMY Testing. One, two, three, four. Oh, this God damned thing! \nShe gets up and fusses with the camera. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) Jap piece of shit! Is it on!? \nCutaway to Kirk tearing up.   Grammy sits back down. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) Okay, my name is Stella Edith Dakin and if you're watching this, I'm dead as a doorknob and I ain't spent all my money yet. I got shit to do today so I'm going to get right to it. This is my last will and testament and if you miss anything the old Jew's got the paperwork. Okay, here's the deal... \nEveryone besides Kirk leans in, excited to hear what they might get. A phone rings. Maury looks around but the ringing is coming from the TV. Grammy answers the phone. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) Hello? I'm kind of busy right now Eric... Oh, for God's sake, boy! How can you be sure it's even yours? It could be practically anybody's!... No, I'm not paying for that!... Well, then I guess you're going to be a daddy. Congratulations, now I gotta go! \nShe hangs up, puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) Anyway! I love all of you, despite some of the shit you pulled, but I spent my life a gambler and I always put my money on the best bet. The odds of any of you fish doing anything worthwhile with my stack are slim to none. So old Grammy's going all in on Big Slick. \nEveryone looks at Kirk who is stunned. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) I'm proud of you, Kirk. Don't let your old Grammy down. Do something good with it. \nShe blows a kiss, lifts the remote and aims it at the camera. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) Oh, for Christ sakes! \nShe throws the remote at the lens.    The picture goes to snow. \nERIC So Kirk gets it all!?   That is bullshit! \nKIRK Eric, it can't be much. \nERIC Well!? \nMaury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers.    He dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic. \nMAURY Let's see here... Looks like she had herself six G's in savings. (MORE) \nMAURY (CONT'D) Um, another three grand in bonds, give or take. Her life insurance will pay pert-near seventy grand. \nHe adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the hand crank) and writes $77,800 on a chalk board, which is mounted on the wall behind him. \nERIC She left him eighty grand!? \nMAURY Most of Stella's retirement home expenses were covered by her reverse mortgage. But, figure in thirty thousand still due to Arborwood Village. She racked up forty-seven thousand in medical bills. And my fee, of course, which now stands at two thousand and change - which is real reasonable, folks. \nHe writes \"Liabilities = $79,000    Total -$1,200.\" \nERIC So Kirk owes money!? HA! Shit, man! That is God damn hilarious! \nINT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe upscale restaurant is crowded. Kirk and Molly are eating at a small table. Kirk is not relaxed like he had been the last time they ate together. He is sweating and trying to remain cool. The Maitre d is eyeing them suspiciously. \nMOLLY But, you can't legally be held responsible for her debt. What kind of hack is this attorney? \nKIRK It's okay.     I had it in savings. \nThe waiter brings a drink to Molly. \nWAITER (French accent) Madame. From ze gentleman in ze grey suit. \nFrom his table, a good looking man smiles and raises a drink to Molly. She nods back - polite but annoyed. \nKIRK Anyway... Grammy hated owing anyone money. I'm afraid she couldn't rest if she wasn't square with the house. It's the least I can do. She practically raised me. \nMOLLY You're a good man, Kirk. \nMolly smiles and takes his hands. The maitre d is watching and getting angry. The waiter returns with another drink. \nWAITER From ze gentleman in ze purple tie. \nAnother guy raises his glass to her from the bar. Molly is getting irritated. Kirk is feeling smaller every minute. \nKIRK Okay.   Did I... \nMAITRE D Look, I can appreciate that this is not some common street-walker. You're obviously willing to pay for the best but we can't have this kind of thing at my place. \nKIRK What? I'm not paying anyone. We're just on a date. \nMAITRE D You are on a date with her? What am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish to embarrass you, sir, or make a scene. So, enjoy your dinner but, be warned, do not ever bring another professional into my place. (louder and back into the French accent) Tres bien Monsieur! \nINT. FRENCH RESTAURANT \nWhen Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are still talking. Kirk hides behind a plant. Molly is beaming. She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits the restaurant. Kirk returns to the table. \nKIRK Oh, no.   Did I miss Talon? \nMOLLY He had to go but he asked me tell you how much he enjoyed meeting you. \nKIRK Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a great guy. \nMOLLY He is. He's wonderful. I know, I know - the blue eyes and the rock hard abs, right? But he's really so much more than that. A gallery in New York just opened an exhibit of his photography. He's a genius. \nKIRK (to the waiter) Can we get the check? \nWAITER Madame, your bill has been covered by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket. \nA butch woman in the bar raises a glass in Molly's direction. \nINT. MOLLY'S CAR - NIGHT \nMolly and Kirk pull into a parking lot. \nMOLLY Oh my gosh! This is your apartment? I used to live in this neighborhood back in college. \nKIRK Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better place pretty soon. \nMOLLY We used to come to parties over here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I come up and see your place? \nEXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nIt's Friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nKirk and Molly enter.   The apartment is neat, clean and fairly sparse. \nKIRK It's not much, I know. \nMOLLY No, I like it! \nMolly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears. Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life, revealing a \"Hot Back-Door Asians\" website. Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She moves on to a rack of DVDs. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Wow, we have a lot of the same DVDs. Life of Brian, Cool Hand Luke, Family Guy... Beaches, Kirk? \nKIRK What?   It's a good movie. \nMOLLY I love that movie. \nShe spots a crate full of vinyl records. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Wow, records. No Way! Look at all this Cheap Trick! \nKIRK You like Cheap Trick? \nMOLLY Are you kidding? Heaven Tonight is the first album I ever owned! A hand-me-down from my big sister. She was the coolest person in the whole world. \nShe notices an upright piano in the corner. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) You play the piano? \nKIRK A little. My grandma taught me. It was kind of our thing. She was a great player. Ragtime, show tunes, that kind of thing. I'm really not very good. \nShe plops down on the couch. \nMOLLY Oh, I'll bet you're great.   Play something for me. \nKIRK No, I can't really play in front of people. \nMOLLY What, the stage fright thing?    Come on it's just me. Please? \nMOLLY Are you okay? \nKIRK (O.S.) Yeah, fine. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN \nKirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll. \nMOLLY (O.S.) I just think we should get to know each other first.   I'm no prude. I mean, I'm pretty generous in bed. Once I trust a person, I like to experiment and get pretty wild. \nKIRK Oh, dear God. \nMOLLY (O.S.) But, I just need to feel safe first. \nKirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his profile in the reflection from the window. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nKirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner. \nKIRK Hey.   I'm totally fine with that. \nMOLLY You're the best. \nKirk gives an \"aw-shucks\" head tilt.    Molly stands. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Okay, well, I'd better go then. \nThey walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her fist over her mouth. \nKirk's POV:   As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch. \nKirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way. She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) I had a really nice time.    I'll call you tomorrow. \nKIRK Great! \nKirk opens the door for Molly. \nEXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nAs Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male college students are playing foosball on their patio. They stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk. Molly trots off. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT #1 Damn, man!     That chick is fine! \nKirk returns a cool \"whassup\" nod to the guys. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT #2 All right Mr. Kettner! \nCOLLEGE STUDENT #1 You wanna play some foos!? \nKIRK No thanks fellas. \nKirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nHe drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing. \nKIRK Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum! \nKirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment. He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Ron seems like a swell guy. I love Pizza Hut. What? Who's this? Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly. Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there, there, now. Here's a tissue. \nHe drops the picture and continues the dance. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone - \"No Missed Calls.\" \nMONTAGE OVER MUSIC: \n1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom.   He checks his gut and hairline in the mirror. \n2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads, \"Happy Graduation - Love Mom and Dad.\" He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor. He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him. He checks his phone. \"No Missed Calls.\" \nSTAINER So, you're telling me you were sitting there, a sweating, quivering stutter-bucket and when you came back from the can, Molly's hugging a guy who's so good looking you'd probably fuck him. What do you think she's doing this weekend? \nKIRK So what am I supposed to do? \nSTAINER What can you do? She hasn't called - she's not going to. \nKIRK You're probably right. \nSTAINER Just count yourself lucky. You got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware. A chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up. \nKIRK No, you're right. You know what - it's good. It's better. I'm actually relieved. You should have seen this Talon guy. Man! All I've been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her. I don't need that kind of pressure. \nThe valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his head as if to say, \"Was there even a doubt?\" \nKirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings.   Kirk and Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID. \nSTAINER Don't do it! \nThe phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone. Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's wrist, pinning it to the table. RING! \nKIRK Cut it out! \nSTAINER Let it go! \nRING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone. \nKIRK Hello!?... Oh, no problem! Yeah I was super busy yesterday anyway. \nSTAINER Would you look at yourself? \nStainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away. \nKIRK Well, I have dinner with my folks tonight... Oh, I wouldn't want to subject you to them... Okay. If you want to. I can pick you up... \nKirk gives a confident smile and an \"I told you she'd call\" nod. Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Oh, sure. Well then let me call you back in a few minutes and I'll give you directions. Alrighty. Yeah. Buh-bye. \nSTAINER Well, I guess you just solved that. An hour with your family and she'll file for a restraining order. \nKIRK No. Eric's not going to be there. It's going to be good. You might be wrong about Molly. She might... \nStainer spots a round little boy posting a \"Lost Puppy\" flyer over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk. \nSTAINER (to the boy) Whoa! I don't think so Spanky!   A little lower! \nThe boy instead posts it over a \"Walk For a Cure\" poster. \nEXT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING \nMolly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a quaint residential street. \nShe climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small sheet of paper. She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch. \nKIRK You found it! \nMOLLY I had good directions! \nShe steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a little yellow note taped to the front door. \nKIRK I'm sorry. My folks aren't back yet. We're locked out. \nMOLLY You don't have a key? \nKIRK No. My dad's kind of obsessed with home-security. Like someone's going to break in and steal his Reader's Digest collection. \nA very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a beagle on a leash. The man struggles a bit with the dog. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Hi, Mr. Riley! \nMR. RILEY Well, howdy Kirk! \nKIRK Hey, what do say you take the night off and I'll take Noodle around the block for you? (to Molly) Are you up for a walk? \nMOLLY That sounds great. \nMR. RILEY Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice. \nMRS. KETTNER You two take it easy now. We have guests. (THEN) Eric honey, I'm sure if you apologize to Leroy, he'll take you back. \nEric returns to the table with the beers. \nERIC Nah, fuck him. Anyways, Leroy ain't payin' shit ever since he trucked in all those spics from Fresno. \nKIRK Geeze Eric! \nRon looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that... \nRON I got this, Kirk. Eric, before you go bad-mouthin' a whole group of people, you should know that my grandmother on my father's side is from Fresno. \nERIC Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know. (THEN) So, Molly. What do you do? \nMOLLY I'm an event planner. \nERIC You see? That's using your head. That's a business to get into. \nMOLLY Well, thank you Eric. \nERIC Book a band, blow up a few balloons and people pay out the ass for it. \nKIRK There's a little more to it than that, Eric. Molly handles some big events. She's even doing a benefit with Billy Joel next month. \nMOLLY (PLAYFULLY) Actually, Eric's right.   Just a few balloons. \nMolly smiles to reassure Kirk that she can handle herself. \nRON You know, Molly, I'm a business owner myself. A little restaurant. \nMARNIE I wouldn't really call it a restaurant, Ron. \nRON We serve food that people eat.   So - restaurant. \nMARNIE It's a Pizza Hut with no tables. It's a take out place. \nERIC So, Molly, me and Debbie here are getting hitched. What do you get for a wedding job? \nKirk raises his eyebrows into \"please-behave-yourself\" puppy dog eyes. Eric shoots back an \"oh whatever\" sneer. \nMOLLY Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a lot of weddings. I specialize more in fund-raisers, corporate events, that kind of thing. (MORE) \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Right now I'm working on the annual benefit for the Children's Cancer Center. \nERIC But you've done weddings. \nMOLLY I've done a few. \nERIC So, what do you get for one? \nKIRK Dad, could you... \nDEBBIE Don't get your panties in a wad, Kirk. He's just making conversation. \nMOLLY Geeze, there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding. \nERIC We're looking at about two hundred people and we're gonna do this whole Nascar theme. \nDEBBIE I'm getting a kick-ass dress made out of actual checkered flags and Eric is going to be in an orange tux with a big Home Depot logo on the back and Tony Stewart's number 20 on the shoulders. \nMOLLY Oh, how fun! \nERIC So what's the damage for supervising something like that? \nKIRK Eric, please. \nERIC I'm just talkin' ballpark. I'm ain't gonna try and Jew her down. \nMOLLY Okay. Before expenses, my base fee for a non-charity event is fifteen thousand. So, I'd ballpark that somewhere around twenty-five grand. \nERIC (STUNNED) Fuck a duck. \nFor a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the conversation. Kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter. \nERIC (CONT'D) So you're making a comfortable living, you seem like you got your head together more or less and Christ, look at ya. What the hell you doing with numbnuts here? \nMRS. KETTNER Eric! \nTALON It's Kirk right? (firm handshake) Excellent to see you again, sir. \nKIRK Oh, Talon.     You're a Blue Angel? \nTALON Yes sir, a Naval Aviator. \nKIRK Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is what - your call-sign? \nTALON No, it's my name. \nKIRK Then what's your call-sign? \nTALON Oh, I'd rather not say. It's embarrassing. Just something the guys gave me... \nTalon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the booth. \nTALON (CONT'D) Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to say that you and Mol are close? \nKIRK Yeah, I guess. \nTALON Well, I understand that fellas like yourself tend to have uniquely candid relationships with the women they befriend. Am I right? \nKIRK Fellas like myself? \nTALON Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with your lifestyle. What grown men do in the privacy of their homes is none of my concern. \nKIRK Talon, I'm not... \nTALON Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask and I don't expect you to tell. \nTalon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone. \nTALON (CONT'D) Now, I don't know what Molly's told you about me, but anything bad - I deserve. I hurt that girl. I hurt one of God's own angels and I've regretted it every minute since. \nKIRK No.   She speaks very highly... \nTALON God as my witness, I WILL make it right. I WILL get her back. Can I count on you to put in the good word for me, Poncho? \nKIRK Um... Sure. \nTALON You're the man. Come here. \nTalon embraces Kirk in a tight hug. \nTALON (CONT'D) There you go. Feel the tolerance. \nAnother Blue Angel calls over while signing Stainer's plane. \nBLUE ANGEL #2 Yo! Foot-Long! We scramble in ten. \nTALON Roger! \nTalon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk. \nKIRK That was Talon. \nSTAINER Who? The Blue Angel guy?    (cracking up) Duuuuude! \nMolly joins them. \nMONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE: \n1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd. Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell out \"MOLLY\" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.) \n2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look. The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is oblivious to this exchange. \n3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up, he is tackled by two cops. \nCOP Nice try pervert! \nMolly spins around, horrified. \nCOP (CONT'D) It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of shit was following you but we got him. \nMolly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the cop's grasp. \n4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him. \nMOLLY Oh, it's a DVD. \nKATIE Who's this from? \nNobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer. \nSTAINER What?   It's closed captioned. \nPatty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass to them. Patty gives Talon the finger. \nKIRK What did he do? \nPATTY Listen, Molly would kill me if she knew I was telling you this but I'm trying to do you a favor. \nKIRK Okay. \nPATTY Molly has this physical...um issue. You know, kind of like a birth defect? \nKIRK Oh, my God. \nPATTY It's not a big deal but she's really self-conscious about it. Talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak. \nKIRK What is it? \nPATTY It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again. \nKIRK No, no.   I wouldn't do that. \nPATTY Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be your last conscious act... (she stands) Cake? \nPatty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses the room and walks out to the... \nEXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK \nHe throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance similar to the one he had done after their first kiss. \nStainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys come around the front to join Kirk. \nSTAINER Dude? \nKIRK (playfully chipper) My friends! Whassup Bitches! \nDEVON What?   What's going on? \nKIRK My troubles are over boys! It's all going to work out! Check it out - Molly has... Wait for it... \nKirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up. \nKIRK (CONT'D) ...a birth defect! \nDEVON Excuse me? \nJACK That's terrible. \nKIRK No.   That's awesome!   Don't you get it? \nDEVON Ahhhh No. \nSTAINER Sure, I get it. She needs a good guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she dates can't handle it, right? \nKIRK It sent Talon packing. \nKirk and Stainer high five.    Jack and Devon look disturbed. \nDEVON Well, what's wrong with her? \nKIRK I don't know yet. Patty just said she had a physical issue. \nDEVON Well that could be anything. Did she say it was a birth defect? \nKIRK She said it was, \"something like a birth defect.\" \nJACK What if it's something really bad? \nKIRK I hope it is. I hope it's something that would make most guys run screaming. It won't matter to me. I love her. \nJACK That's cool that you love her but it's pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity. \nMOLLY A three what?   What are you talking about!? \nKIRK Look! What the hell is going on here!? What are you up to!? \nMOLLY What am I up to!?    Good God! \nKIRK Please, tell me you're a terrorist! Tell me you're on a scavenger hunt! Just tell me something that makes sense because all you're doing is driving me nuts! \nMOLLY (hurt and resigned) The only thing I'm going to tell you is that I'd like you to leave. \nKIRK Fine! I'm going! Webbed feet!? Are you fucking kidding me!? \nKirk grabs his coat and heads out the door.    Molly slumps onto her bed and cries as the door slams. \nINT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY \nKirk is at his post looking terribly sad. Stainer is working at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend. \nFuller taps Kirk on the shoulder to alert him that Habib is coming through. Habib sees this and takes his bag straight to the search table, where he opens it for Kirk. Kirk doesn't look inside. \nKIRK Go on, Habib. You're good. \nHABIB Really!?   Great! \nHabib steps off to his gate.   Fuller gets in Kirk's face. \nFULLER You think you're pretty smart don't you Kettner. Thin ice mister! \nKirk stomps away from the checkpoint. \nFULLER (CONT'D) Good! Don't come back, Kettner! America is safer without you! \nStainer goes after Kirk. \nEXT. AIRPORT CURB \nKirk walks out the doors. Stainer catches up to him and they walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace. \nSTAINER Kirky! Hold up, man! What are you doing!? You can't let her screw up your life! \nKIRK Get away from me Stainer! \nSTAINER Whoa! Don't take it out on me! We both knew this Molly thing wasn't going to work out! It ain't my fault! \nKIRK You're right. It's not your fault. It's my fault for listening to all your... pernicious advice. \nSTAINER What the fuck you talkin' about? \nKIRK All you did was fill my head with all this crap about threes and tens and how I'm not worthy. \nSTAINER Are you worthy of a chick like that? \nKIRK Maybe! I don't know. But that's not the point! You're supposed to be my God damned best friend. You know what!? (MORE) \nKIRK (CONT'D) I think you were jealous and you set out to sabotage us from the start! \nSTAINER That is total bullshit! \nKIRK Then why weren't you there for me? What if she actually liked me!? Maybe with a little help, I could have pulled it off! \nKirk steps onto an... \nINT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS \nWilly (the Russian) is behind the wheel and as happy as ever. A few others are seated on the bus. Stainer follows Kirk on board. They remain standing, holding onto poles. \nWILLY It is Kirk and his crazy friend Stinker and they are most upset! \nWilly steps on it and drives like a maniac, knocking Kirk and Stainer around as they argue. \nSTAINER Kirk, she was going to hurt you. \nKIRK Look at me! I'm hurt now! \nWilly occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their argument, which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore, like... \nWILLY He's hurting now! \nSTAINER (CONT'D) Ahhh!!   Jesus Christ!!! Kirk!! \nPATTY Who's your Mommy!?   Come on!   Who's your Mommy!? \nSTAINER You are! \nPATTY That's right! Patty is, isn't she! \nKIRK Patty! Cut it out! I just came to tell her that something happened! Something really major happened! \nPatty stops punching and looks up curiously.      Stainer remains in the headlock - also curious. \nSTAINER What happened? \nPatty punches him again. \nPATTY You shut your hole! (to Kirk) What happened? \nKIRK First off, I'm sorry.   Okay? \nPatty rams Stainer's head into the door. \nPATTY Every time you say you're sorry, dumbshit here gets his bell rung. \nKIRK Okay, okay! Sorry!     I just... \nPatty slams him again. \nSTAINER Dude!   Stop apologizing! \nKIRK Look! I know I was acting like an idiot. She's just so... Well, I was really having a hard time with everyone thinking I was Molly's brother or her co-worker or her gay friend or whatever. I mean, nobody believed that we were together. \nPATTY It's too late for this shit, Kirk. \nKIRK But I've got it worked out now. \nPatty and Stainer wait for it. Kirk decides how to phrase it. \nKIRK (CONT'D) My Grandmother left me three million dollars. \nSTAINER Seriously? \nPatty drops Stainer on the floor. \nPATTY I thought she was a blackjack dealer. \nKIRK It turns out she bought stock in Caesars Palace back in the sixties. Nobody knew she still had it. I don't think she even knew. \nPATTY Wow. So, what does this have to do with Molly? \nKIRK See?    Now it makes sense - me with her.    I'm a millionaire now. \nPATTY So, what, now you can afford her!? \nSTAINER No! No! I get it! It's not a whore thing! Now it works out in his own mind. Right!? He can relax and stop acting like a freak because now he's bringing something to the table! Right, Kirky!? \nKIRK Right. Well, no. Now that you say it out loud... I don't know. \nPATTY You know what, Kirk - I told Molly you were different but you're just as shallow and full of shit as the rest of them, aren't you? \nKIRK Yeah, maybe I am. \nKirk walks out. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY \nStainer is at his post watching the luggage on the x-ray monitor. Suddenly, he sees Kirk coming through followed by Marnie, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Eric and Debbie (still pregnant). They are all wearing bright yellow sweatshirts. Stainer runs around the machine to hug Kirk, who looks a little numb. \nSTAINER Kirky! How you been, brother!? What are you doing here? \nKIRK Me and Marnie and the family are going to Branson. You know. \nSTAINER So you're \"Branson Bound.\" \nStainer is referring to Kirk's shirt that reads, \"BRANSON BOUND\" in big letters. \nSTAINER The fuck you just call me!? \nTINA Oh, for Christ's!     Tammy!   Can you cover me!? \nINT. AIRPORT - SOUTHWEST GATE \nA large crowd of passengers are waiting to board.   The gate agent, makes an announcement. \nGATE AGENT Okay folks, we're going to start by boarding the A group. All A's are now welcome to board. \nMarnie butts into the line. \nMARNIE (SNOTTY) Look, I've got seven people in my party so we're going to need to board right away. \nGATE AGENT Are you folks in the A group? \nMARNIE What difference does that make!? \nGATE AGENT Well, because you seem like a little bit of a B. May I see your boarding pass? \nMARNIE Fine. We're not in the A group but we're still getting on next. \nShe hands him the pass - marked \"C.\" \nGATE AGENT Oh, it looks like you're a raging C. So, you're gonna want to take a seat until your group is called. \nShe stomps away. \nINT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - LATER \nStainer and Tina sit at a table. He sits with his head down like a sad little boy. She pities him. \nTINA I really liked you Elmer, but all that stuff about me being a ten and how lucky you were and always checking up to see if I was going to dump you... \nSTAINER Well, you did dump me, so... \nTINA What could I do? You were all up in my business all the time. I couldn't breathe. \nSTAINER It was my stupid job, wasn't it? You were embarrassed. \nTINA I work at Orange Julius, Elmer! If you would have just chilled out and been yourself... \nSTAINER Okay, I can do that. \nShe holds up her finger with an engagement ring on it. Stainer drops his head onto the table. Tina rubs his hair for a second and then walks away. \nINT. AIRPLANE - 737 - EVENING \nKirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the plane. From two rows back, Eric reaches over some other passengers to tap Kirk on the shoulder. \nERIC Tom fuckin' Wopat, bro! \nEric hangs up a high five and Kirk leaves it hanging. Kirk takes a seat on the aisle next to Marnie. He gives Marnie a forced smile. She puts her head on his shoulder. Pan over to the window seat where Ron sits watching them, wearing his new travel pillow. \nSuddenly, there is a commotion at the front of the plane. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT What!? You don't have authority on board this aircraft! \nStainer barges past the flight attendant, holding up his TSA badge. \nSTAINER It's okay folks! TSA! This guy's drunk as fuck and he shit himself. We gotta get him off the plane. \nStainer grabs Kirk by the shoulder, pulls him out of his seat and about two rows down the aisle before Kirk overpowers him and stops. \nKIRK Stainer!   What are you nuts!? \nSTAINER You were right! I messed you up. We gotta fix this thing! Let's go. \nKIRK Stainer! No! Believe it or not, this isn't about you! In fact it's none of your business! \nSTAINER Kirky! In junior high I peed my pants in class and Eric started calling me Stainer, remember? \nKIRK Okay, yeah? \nSTAINER Pretty soon everyone else started calling me Stainer because they knew it would make me cry. Then you told me to own that name, to call myself Stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore. \nKIRK What's your point? \nA jacket is hanging by the door. Kirk reaches in and grabs the keys. He turns fast and exits. Fuller jacks Stainer's head onto the table. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) Kirky wait! \nThe door opens more slowly and Kirk regards his friend with great reverence. Stainer strains to lift his head against Fuller's strength. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) Listen, Kirk. (dramatic pause and music) It's three on the tree and the clutch sticks. \nSLAM!   Stainer's head is jacked back onto the table. \nKIRK Thanks buddy! \nKirk bolts. \nINT. HILTON - SMALL BANQUET ROOM \nThis room is set up as a staging area for the cancer benefit. Patty and several others are buzzing around preparing for the next phase of the evening. Molly enters, holding a walkie talkie up to her head and speaking into it. \nMOLLY No, I need the staff ready to help with bids when the auction begins. - over. \nVOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE I don't think we can spare anyone - over. \nPatty grabs the walkie talkie. \nPATTY Leslie! We're not here to feed these people, we're here to cure fucking cancer! (MORE) \nPATTY (CONT'D) Now I want every one of those motherfuckers back there taking bids in fifteen - out! \nPatty tosses the walkie-talkie back and then crosses to help a group of young cancer patients, some in wheelchairs, to unpack their sculptures and label them for the auction. \nA stressed-out woman in a BEEHIVE hairdo picks up a SMALL BOY's sculpture. She hails Molly. \nBEEHIVE Ms. McCall, we've got a big problem. \nMOLLY What is it? \nBEEHIVE This young man has made an ashtray. \nMOLLY Okay. Well, what do you want from me? Kids make ashtrays. \nBEEHIVE It's a cancer benefit. Don't you think this sends the wrong message? \nSMALL BOY It's a really nice ashtray. \nMOLLY They're not bidding on the artwork; they're bidding on the kids. It's fine. \nBeehive sighs hard and hands the ashtray back to the boy. \nMolly turns around and a look of surprise comes over her. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) What are you doing here!? \nReverse to show Talon holding a ridiculously large flower arrangement. \nTALON I came to say I'm sorry and to put in a request for a second chance. \nVOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE Ms. McCall, the auction is underway - over. \nMOLLY I'm sorry. I have to get in there. Can we talk about this afterwards? \nTALON I'm looking forward to it. \nINT. HILTON BALLROOM \nThe emcee is taking bids on a little sculpture of an abstract four-legged animal. \nEMCEE Timothy Brigg's sculpture of a... fire truck? Sold to the woman in the green dress for four hundred fifty dollars. Congratulations ma'am and thanks so much. \nMolly picks up the small boy's ashtray and joins the emcee on stage. She takes a deep breath before facing the crowd. \nEMCEE (CONT'D) Our next item... Well, here she is folks, the woman who donates her time to make this amazing event possible, our own Molly McCall! \nHuge applause. \nMOLLY Thank you. Thanks, Bob. I'm so sorry for my tardiness. The next item up for bids is from nine-year- old Walter Benegan. And this is a... little something that you can put your paper clips or do-dads in... Oh, who am I kidding, it's an ashtray. (audience laughs) Let's start the bidding at one hundred dollars. \nMAN One hundred. \nThe young sculptor beams. The crowd cheers again. Kirk gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room. \nINT. HILTON BAR \nKirk and Eric sit at the bar, each nursing a drink.   Eric is fuming. \nERIC You are such a numbnut. I am telling you - absolute numbnuttery! \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Excuse me.     May I use that ashtray? \nKirk turns to find that he is sitting next to BILLY JOEL, who is smoking a cigar. Eric passes him the ashtray that Kirk just bought. \nERIC Sure. Careful with it there, Captain Jack. It cost him three million bucks. \nBilly Joel, ashes in the ashtray. \nBILLY JOEL Yeah, I saw that. Tough break in there, my friend. Still, that was a hell of a good thing you did for those kids. \nKIRK Thanks. \nBILLY JOEL Beautiful women huh? What are you gonna do? \nKIRK I guess I'm going to go home. \nBILLY JOEL It's none of my business but I do know a thing or two about hooking up with women who are out of your league. Can I tell you a little secret? \nKirk and Eric look at one another in disbelief and then at Joel. \nKIRK Sure. \nBILLY JOEL Look, it's not about money, fame or power... \nERIC Whoa! All due respect there, Big Shot. How would you know? You had all that shit when you bagged the big ones. \nBILLY JOEL Yeah, but I had all that shit when I lost 'em too. It's not enough. \nERIC You believe this fuckin' guy? \nKIRK Jesus Christ, Eric! I'm trying to get some advice from Billy Joel. Do you think you could manage to shut the fuck up for two minutes!? \nERIC Fine.   Geeze. What's up your ass? \nBILLY JOEL Thank you. Look kid, it's not what you can give 'em or even what you can give up. It's what your made of. \nJoel places a cocktail in front of Kirk and then clinks his own against it. \nINT. HILTON BALLROOM - LATER \nANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome The Piano Man! The Entertainer! And our foundation's greatest champion! Mr. Billy Joel! \nThe crowd cheers as the curtain rises.   The crowd's excitement turns to confusion. \nFrom the back of the room, Molly notices the crowd's reaction. She turns to see Kirk seated before the huge white grand piano, his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys. \nKirk looks at the crowd.   Hundreds of confused faces stare back at him. \nBeehive rushes Patty in a panic. \nBEEHIVE Aren't you going to do something about this!? \nPATTY Lady, he just gave three million dollars. He can go up there and try to blow himself for all I care. \nKirk wrings his hands as they shake harder. \nBilly Joel stands in the wings and gives Kirk a nod of, \"You can do it.\" \nMolly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano and she stops. \nKirk plays and sings \"Just the Way You Are\" - badly. His voice and hands shake but he forges on. The audience is confused, cringing and restless. \nSomeone starts booing.   Kirk can't help but glance up to see who it is - it's Eric. \nWhen Kirk reaches the instrumental break, he settles in a bit - he can actually play. \nAs the last note fades, Kirk leaps up, and runs out into the... \nEXT. HILTON BACK ALLEY \n", "test1_input": "SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE \nWritten by \nSean Anders & John Morris \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM \nA dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room. A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry figure - it could be any of about a billion people. \nFULLER ...So, let's keep a steely eye out for this bastard. (THEN) Before we dismiss, this is your monthly reminder of why we're here. \nFuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties. He politely pays close attention to the presentation. \nFULLER (CONT'D) The American people want to travel. (Slide: Family in front of a fake dinosaur) They want to attend baseball contests (Slide: Fat guys spilling beers as they go for a foul ball) and popular music concerts. (Slide: John Tesh) \nClose on another face in the group. A doughy man with three- day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored, rolling his eyes at the speech. \nFULLER (CONT'D) They want to be happy. (Slide: People line dancing) But, Security comes first. (Slide: Army soldier with a massive machine gun guards a play- ground) Without security there can be no happy. You are America's front line in the global war on terror. Let's hit the trenches and let's be careful out there. (Slide: TSA logo) \nThe lights come up and as the group files out we get a better look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the... \nINT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY \nThe agents take their places, manning the screening equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and demeanor are pleasant and kind. \nThe scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer. \nSTAINER Kirk, bro.     Tonight? \nINSERT: The flyer reads, \"Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night!\" Stainer is pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo. \nKIRK I don't know, Stainer. \nSTAINER Dude, you never come see us anymore. It's been like four months. Time to forget about Marnie and get back on the whores. \nStainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable. Fuller shoots a stern look from his office. \nKIRK It's not that. It's my Grandma. I'll probably be at the hospital for the next few nights. \nSTAINER Oh, shit. I spaced that.   How's she doing? \nKIRK She's hanging in there but it doesn't look good. \nSTAINER Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great lady. That sucks. \nA Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr. Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly motions to the Arab. Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist. \nKIRK Hey there, Habib. \nHABIB (perfect English with a southern accent) Howdy Kirk. Lemme guess; I been flagged for a random search. \nKIRK Yeah, sorry. I'll get you out of here quick. You off to Boston again? \nHABIB No, sir. Pediatric convention in Delaware. \nKirk opens Habib's bag. \nHABIB (CONT'D) Kirk, I know you're just doing your job but, for Pete's sake, ya'll know me. \nKIRK I'm sorry.     It's just... \nKirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Okay, Habib, you're all set buddy. Have a good trip. \nHABIB Thanks Kirk. See you next time. \nFuller again appears behind Kirk. \nHABIB (CONT'D) (to fuller - now in a thick Arab accent) Praise be to Allah. \nFULLER You think that's funny!? You wanna sit in first class or you wanna sit on my gloved and jellied finger!? \nEXT. AIRPORT CURB - DAY \nFollow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see several men stare as she passes by on her way into... \n", "test1_true": "More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow the legs to the check-in line. The legs glide to the front and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent. \nFrom the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket agents. (One on each side of the legs.) One is black and one white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the race is on. Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next. \nAngle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple. \nWHITE AGENT (RUSHED) Okay, how many bags are you checking? Any bags!? \nYUPPIE MAN Is this one too big to carry on? \nWHITE AGENT No.    Carry it on. Good call. \nYUPPIE WOMAN Grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport. \nThe agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. He looks to his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT, who is waiting on an old Asian woman. \nBLACK AGENT (RUSHED) Did you pack your bags yourself? \nThe Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the question but she smiles and nods along. \nASIAN WOMAN Yes. \nBLACK AGENT Has anyone unknown to you asked you to carry anything onto your flight? \nMore smiles and blank nods. \nASIAN WOMAN Yes. \nBLACK AGENT I think you mean NO. \nWHITE AGENT You can't do that! \nBLACK AGENT She doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about! \nYUPPIE MAN Where exactly is gate F5? \nWHITE AGENT Just past F4. Have a day now folks. Let's hustle it up. \nASIAN WOMAN Sank you! \nBLACK AGENT No sweat.     Keep it moving. \nThe Asian woman is not going anywhere. The black agent leans into her face and barks once like a dog. Her smile turns to fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie. \nBOTH AGENTS Next! \nReverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men. She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co- worker, who is being an overtly sore loser. \nMOLLY Hi, I'm booked on flight 94 to Burbank. Molly McCall. \nBLACK AGENT (trying way too hard) California. Fantastic. So do you travel quite a bit? \nThe white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's station, just to get a better look at MOLLY. \nWHITE AGENT Hey Derek. You got the     numbers on the (making it up as he    goes) new, um, procedures for the,    um, airport thing... regarding the,    ah, planes? (to Molly) Whassup? \nINT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY \nKirk is at his post. \nStainer works the next x-ray belt, where a young rocker type is running a guitar case through. Stainer stops the belt and moves it back to get a better look. \nSTAINER Les Paul Classic re-issue? \nROCKER (SMUG) No, it's a sixty-five.   Mint. \nSTAINER Fuck you.    No way. \nThe rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case through and pops it open. \nROCKER Dude, I'm late for my flight. \nSTAINER Sorry, I have to search this case for, you know, explosives and such. This thing is sweet! \nStainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the bins and bags pile up before him. \n", "test1_id": 1194, "test2_input": "WAITER Great.    Sorry. \nThe waiter exits. \nKIRK So... You know what I do, what about you? Your card said event planner. How'd you get into that? \nMOLLY Well, it wasn't the original plan. I went to law school. Ended up at a big firm but I hated it. Then, they asked me to plan the Christmas party. It was a big hit and a few months later I was done with law. \nKIRK Wow. \nMOLLY I know.    Pernicious career move, right? \nKIRK Oh, I don't know what that word means. What was it? \nClose on Molly's smile. She finds Kirk's unabashed admission very refreshing and endearing. \nMOLLY I'm sorry.     Like, destructive or... \nKIRK Oh, okay. No, I don't think that's so perni...gious? \nMOLLY Pernicious. \nKIRK Good - new word. No, not pernicious at all. Not if you enjoy the work. \nMOLLY I really do. We do a lot of charity events and I get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects. Next month I'm doing a cancer benefit with Billy Joel. \nKIRK Wow.   I love Billy Joel. \nMOLLY The only downside is I have to do a lot of public speaking and I've always struggled with stage fright. \nKIRK Oh man - That's my number one fear. I'm terrified of getting up in front of people. I'd rather get a Kentucky root canal. \nMolly laughs. An older GOOD-LOOKING MAN steps up to the table and stands facing her with his back to Kirk. \nGOOD-LOOKING MAN Excuse me, I was just sitting over at the bar and I was wondering; has anyone told you today that you are absolutely stunning? \nMOLLY Are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend? \nHe turns to Kirk and both men start to laugh. \nGOOD-LOOKING MAN This is your boyfriend? \nKIRK Oh, yeah right! (Catches Molly's unspoken instructions.) But, yeah. I'm her boyfriend, I guess, so... \nGOOD-LOOKING MAN Really?   Wow. Well... sorry. \nKIRK Honest mistake. \nThe man gives Kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar. \nMOLLY Did you get a load of that hair- piece? What is it with men? I mean, look at you. You're bald and you're fine with it. A little dignity is all I'm saying. The toupees and plugs and the teen- dream sports cars... Oh geeze, I'm sorry. Do you drive a sports car? \nKIRK I drive a 94 Taurus. It's got AM/FM but I wouldn't call it a sports car per se. \nMolly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh. \nKIRK (CONT'D) So here's this little old lady trying to go through security with six pounds of weed in her girdle! \nCut.   The food is being served. \nMOLLY Oh, my God! I love that book! \nCut.   The waitress is picking up the empty plates. \nKIRK So, a duck walks into a bar... \nCut.   Molly is laughing while she's paying the bill. \nMOLLY Well, I've got an early morning. I should go. Thanks for coming along. This was really fun. And thanks again for helping me out. \nKIRK No, thank you for dinner. I feel bad that you won't let me... \nMOLLY Oh, stop it. Listen, I handle some of the charity events for the Coyotes and I've got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night. You interested? \nKirk is a bit taken aback and confused.     Is she actually asking him out on a real date? \nKIRK (NERVOUSLY) Um, sure. Yeah, great. I mean, I'm free tomorrow night. \n", "test2_true": "MOLLY Perfect. I hate to see them go to waste. There's two so maybe bring Stainer? \nKirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment. \nKIRK Oh, right.     Thanks!   Thank you. \nEXT. HOCKEY ARENA - NIGHT \nKirk and Stainer are on their way through security. A huge security guard runs a metal-detector wand over Stainer. \nSTAINER Whatcha runnin' there a PX-235? \nGUARD I don't know sir. \nSTAINER The two hundred series are dog shit. You couldn't find a bazooka with that thing. You should look into the new eight fifties. \nGUARD Can you keep it moving sir? \nINT. HOCKEY ARENA \nKirk and Stainer arrive at the third row to find two open seats right next to the penalty box. To Kirk's surprise, in the next seat - Molly! Kirk elbows Stainer. \nKIRK Hey, it's Molly.       She's here. \nSTAINER (PERPLEXED) Huh. \nMOLLY Hey guys! You made it! Hooray! Thanks for coming. \nKIRK Oh, yeah.     Wouldn't miss it. \nSTAINER Thanks for the sweet seats! \nMOLLY Guys, this is my best friend in the whole world, Patty. This is Kirk and, um, Stainer, right? \nPatty is over 200 pounds with a pretty face and an edge that comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons. \nPATTY Hey boys.     Nice to meet you. \nMOLLY Patty's my assistant and my go-to gal. Whatever you need, she can make it happen on a moments notice. \nPATTY You need a cock-shaped cake with a cotton-candy bush delivered by four o'clock? I'm your connection. \nMOLLY Oh, and she likes to shock people so don't let her freak you out. \nKIRK How 'bout that. So, we're going to grab some beers. Can we bring you ladies anything? Beer? Nachos? Patty, cotton candy? \nINT. HOCKEY ARENA CONCESSIONS AREA \nStainer and Kirk stand in the beer line. \nSTAINER That's it. She's setting you up with the fat chick. \nKIRK Ooohhh! Okay! Okay! That makes sense, right!? When Molly was here I was like, \"what!?\" But, okay! Well, Patty seems cool. She's funny. \nSTAINER Well, yeah, she has to be. \nKIRK What does that mean? \nSTAINER Nothing. The fat chick seems great. You never know, bro, that fat chick could wind up being the love of your life. \nKirk returns a look of annoyance. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) Patty, I'm saying. Patty could be the love of your life. \nINT. HOCKEY ARENA \nThe game has started. Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are cheering. The puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it. As he mucks it from the edge, he looks up and sees Molly. He's distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass. A penalty is called on the player who hit him. That player skates into the penalty box near Molly. The name on his jersey reads, \"REESE.\" He speaks with a thick Canadian accent. \nREESE Hey Molly!     Yer lookin' good, eh! \nMOLLY That was a bogus call, Bobby.    Your skates barely left the ice. \nREESE I know.   What's that aboot, eh? \nKIRK (nervously to Reese) Yeah, that ref is like a total blindo, man. \n", "test2_id": 1195, "test3_input": "MR. KETTNER Now don't be that way, boy. All your big brother is trying to say is that we're worried about you. \nERIC You show up here with that piece of ass!? Either you're fucking with us or she's fucking with you so which is it? \nKIRK Look, I know she's a little out of my league but... \nERIC A little!? Are you shitting me? Alright, alright! I think we can all agree that Debbie here is one wicked hot box. \nDebbie smiles and squeezes Eric's hand. Mr. Kettner nods and raises his glass. \nKIRK She's um... very attractive. \nERIC Yeah, and this Molly makes her look like a pig. \nDebbie lets go of Eric's hand and storms upstairs. \nERIC (CONT'D) You see? This girl of yours is already startin' shit. (Calling after Debbie) Come on baby! Kirk didn't mean nothing by that! \nKIRK Look, I don't know what's going on either but... \nERIC I'm goin' upstairs and gettin' to the bottom of this. \nKIRK Eric!   No! \nERIC I think this gal is messing with my little brother and I'm not going to sit still for it. \nKIRK Eric! Okay! I know! I'm sure she's just slumming or something and it's all going to be over any minute but, Jesus Christ! She'll come to her senses without any help from you! She's up there with... \nKirk turns to point up the stairs. As he glances back, he finds Molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down at him. Before Kirk can get a word out, Molly storms out of the house. Kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he can get out the front door. Eric appears behind him. \nERIC Way to go numbnuts. You should have let me handle it. \nINT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY \nKirk stands at work, searching Habib's bag and looking grouchy. Fuller monitors Kirk, arms crossed. Habib lets out a long irritated sigh. \nKIRK I know.   I'm sorry, man. \nKirk hands the bag back to Habib and sends him on his way. Randy, another agent, hands Kirk a note. \nINSERT: The note reads, \"Kirk, We need to talk.     I'm in the food court. -M.\" \nKirk sighs.   Stainer is now reading over Kirk's shoulder. \nSTAINER Well, I guess this is it. I'm surprised she even bothered. \nINT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT \nThe food court is crowded.     Kirk looks around for Molly but does not see her. \nMARNIE (O.S.) Good, you got my note. \nKirk turns to find Marnie sitting at a table working on a Burrito Supreme. \nKIRK Oh.     Yeah.     Hi. \nMARNIE I'm sorry to bug you at work but this couldn't wait. \nKirk sits down. \nMARNIE (CONT'D) Kirk, I think I messed up. I see a change in you and I like it. So, I was thinking that we should maybe... get back together. Just to try it out, you know? \nKIRK Wow.    I don't know, Marnie. \nMARNIE Why not? Please don't say it's because of this Molly person. \nKIRK No, I think I already screwed that up anyway. \nMARNIE Good. I was really worried about you with her. She seems like kind of a bitch. \nKIRK What?    She is not. \nMARNIE Well, she acts like she's better than everyone with her hybrid car and her la-de-da charity work. \nKIRK She doesn't do that at all, Marnie. You're just putting that on her. \nMARNIE Okay, maybe so. See? This is what I mean. You never argued with me before. You're really growing. \n", "test3_true": "MARNIE If you want to get back together, of course, I'll break up with Ron. \nKIRK You mean you're still with him? \nMARNIE I'm not going to risk being all alone just because you don't know what's good for you. Come on, Kirk. Deep down, you know where you belong. \nKIRK You're right, I think I do.   Say hi to Ron for me. \nKirk stands and walks away. \nEXT. AIR SHOW ENTRANCE - DAY \nKirk and Stainer are at the ticket gate. Kirk pays for his ticket but Stainer stands staring at him. \nKIRK What? \nSTAINER This wasn't my idea. I ain't dropping twenty bucks to go in there. God-damned planes are in the sky. I can see 'em just fine from the parking lot for free. \nKirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket. \nEXT. AIR SHOW \nKirk and Stainer move through the crowd. Stainer now carries a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of Air Show memorabilia, including an inflatable F/A-18 Hornet. \nKIRK She's working one of the kids' charities. I'm guessing they might be down by the rides. \nSTAINER Whoa dude, check it out.   The Blue Angels! \nFive men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through the crowd in slow motion. They exude masculine confidence. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) Those are the coolest guys in the entire world. Think about it - George Clooney or Derek Jeter would trade places with those guys in a second. Can you imagine the sheer magnitude of puss those fuckers tag? I'm gonna get 'em to sign my Hornet! \nStainer runs toward them. He joins some kids and beautiful women who are already getting autographs. \nKirk spots Molly working a charity booth. He crosses to her. She turns to him with a this-better-be-good stance. \nKIRK Molly. \nMOLLY Kirk. \nKIRK I just wanted to apologize for last night... for my family. \nMOLLY Your family I can deal with. \nKIRK And for me... For what I said. \nMOLLY Do you really think I'm that shallow? You think I need to slum? \nKIRK No. I don't know what to think. You just have to understand that this is a new area for me. Believe it or not, I don't have gobs of experience with beautiful women. \nMOLLY Is that all I am to you? \nKIRK No, but I don't have much experience with brilliant, successful, wonderful women either. \nThis melts Molly a bit. \nMOLLY Kirk, this can't work if you put me up on some kind of pedestal. \nKIRK It's not that I... Okay, look... When I was a kid, we played a lot of baseball in my neighborhood. The worst part was picking teams because I was always picked last. Every time. Like they couldn't start a friggin' game without first establishing how much I sucked. So, now you come along and make me feel like the first pick. But... what if I can't hit? \nMolly softens and smiles. \nMOLLY You already got to first base. Just keep your eye on the ball. \nKirk nods and smiles back.   Molly steals a quick kiss. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Let me tie up a couple things and I'll show you around the grounds. \nKIRK Sounds good. \nMolly goes into a tent to speak to Patty.    Kirk watches her with a calm, relieved smile. \nVOICE (O.S.) Boy, she sure is something, huh? \nKirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing behind him. The pilot removes his shades - it's Talon. \n", "test3_id": 1196}

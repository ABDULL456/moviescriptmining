{"test1_input": "At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting or stammering - just friendly and relaxed. \nKIRK Morning. \nMOLLY Oh, hello again. \nKIRK Second trip in two days? \nMolly is putting her laptop back in her bag. \nMOLLY Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop to L.A. but they've got me going back and forth three days in a row. This client is killing me. \nKIRK Well hang in there kiddo and I guess I'll see you tomorrow. \nMOLLY It's a date. \nMolly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk. \nFULLER Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever like to...you know...put my penis in her vagina. (wink) \nBack at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine. Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes. \nROCKER What the hell!? \nHe grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch. \nSTAINER Dude, I am so sorry. \nROCKER Sorry my ass! This thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker! \nSTAINER Yeah, I bet it was but... \nStainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) \"TSA is not responsible for items lost or damaged in the security screening process...\" \nStainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand- written on the back. He reads them aloud. \nSTAINER (CONT'D) \"...so fuck you.\" \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nKirk enters to find his MOTHER, an attractive old woman, sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age. \nKIRK Hey Mom.   Hey Marnie. \nMRS. KETTNER Oh, hi Sweetie. \nAcross the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment. \nKIRK Who's that guy Dad's with? \nMARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside. \nMARNIE Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and I staying so close since we broke up but I know how much Grammy meant to you... Well, is it okay with you that I'm here? \nKIRK Sure.   It's fine.   (it's not) \nMARNIE Okay, good. Then can I introduce you to my new boyfriend? \nShe leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his father. They are laughing again. \nMARNIE (CONT'D) Ron, this is Kirk. \nRON Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! (Ron and Mr. Kettner laugh) No! I'm just jack-assin' with you, pirate. Great to meet you. How you doing? \nKIRK I've been better. \nRON Right. Of course. I'm sorry about your grandmother. It's just so... Well, old people, you know, what are you gonna do? \nKIRK Yeah.   Thanks. \nKirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the hall. They are both in their late thirties and good-looking for trailer trash. Debbie is about seven months pregnant. \nERIC Little brother.   Grammy wants to see you. \nKIRK Okay.   Well, I better get in there. \n", "test1_true": "ERIC Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants to discuss the will. She won't tell us dick, so we're kind of hoping you can grease the wheels. \nKIRK Okay, but you know Grammy didn't have all that much. Once the hospital and... and the ah... \nERIC Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what not... \nKIRK Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over. \nDEBBIE We've got a wedding to pay for, Kirk and... \nERIC Debbie, let me handle this. We've got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts, and you know Mom and Dad are going to Branson next month. Now you always been Grammy's favorite so we're counting on you to get in there and sort out what's what. \nINT. HOSPITAL - GRAMMY'S ROOM \nIn a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed. She is hooked up to an I.V. and several monitors. Kirk comes in and forces a smile. Grammy's voice is weak and shaky. \nGRAMMY There you are Big Slick.   Did you bring 'em? \nKIRK Grammy, you really shouldn't... \nGRAMMY Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's door and you know it. \nKirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) Oh, for Christ's sake. Filters? \nGrammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. Kirk tears up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life. \nKIRK I love you Grammy. \nGRAMMY Don't start that shit now. You're looking at one lucky old broad who's done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby, colored fellas. I got no complaints. So when the check comes I don't want any blubbering or bullshit outta you. Just enjoy your life like I did mine and raise a glass to your old Grammy once in a while. \nKirk hugs her and he cries a bit. \nGRAMMY (CONT'D) You know how much I love you Kirk. \nINT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY \nMolly is coming through Kirk's lane again. Mr. Fuller steps in and stops her before she crosses through. \nFULLER Ma'am, could you please remove your jacket and shoes? \nMOLLY Oh, sure. \nShe does. Fuller is leering at her stellar body.   She's about to go through when he stops her again. \nFULLER Why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it. \nMolly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt. She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a raised palm. He then motions to her breasts and crotch. \nFULLER (CONT'D) Any piercings you'd like me to know about? \nKIRK Why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine. \nMolly steps through. The machine does not go off. She gathers her things and mouths a silent, \"Thank You\" to Kirk as she walks on. Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say anything, RANDY, a young agent, calls out from the office. \nRANDY Kirk buddy! Phone call! \nKirk walks over to take the call. \nFULLER You best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too, mister! \nKirk takes the phone from Randy. \nKIRK This is Kirk Kettner. \nKirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in. \nINT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nKirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee. He opens his wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an eight-year-old Kirk in a casino. Grammy is smoking a cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table. \nKirk tears up and puts his face in his hands. \nMolly is passing.   She sees Kirk and stops. \n", "test1_id": 1194, "test2_input": "KIRK Okay.   Did I... \nMAITRE D Look, I can appreciate that this is not some common street-walker. You're obviously willing to pay for the best but we can't have this kind of thing at my place. \nKIRK What? I'm not paying anyone. We're just on a date. \nMAITRE D You are on a date with her? What am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish to embarrass you, sir, or make a scene. So, enjoy your dinner but, be warned, do not ever bring another professional into my place. (louder and back into the French accent) Tres bien Monsieur! \nINT. FRENCH RESTAURANT \nWhen Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are still talking. Kirk hides behind a plant. Molly is beaming. She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits the restaurant. Kirk returns to the table. \nKIRK Oh, no.   Did I miss Talon? \nMOLLY He had to go but he asked me tell you how much he enjoyed meeting you. \nKIRK Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a great guy. \nMOLLY He is. He's wonderful. I know, I know - the blue eyes and the rock hard abs, right? But he's really so much more than that. A gallery in New York just opened an exhibit of his photography. He's a genius. \nKIRK (to the waiter) Can we get the check? \nWAITER Madame, your bill has been covered by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket. \nA butch woman in the bar raises a glass in Molly's direction. \nINT. MOLLY'S CAR - NIGHT \nMolly and Kirk pull into a parking lot. \nMOLLY Oh my gosh! This is your apartment? I used to live in this neighborhood back in college. \nKIRK Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better place pretty soon. \nMOLLY We used to come to parties over here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I come up and see your place? \nEXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nIt's Friday night and several college parties are raging in the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nKirk and Molly enter.   The apartment is neat, clean and fairly sparse. \nKIRK It's not much, I know. \nMOLLY No, I like it! \nMolly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears. Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer comes to life, revealing a \"Hot Back-Door Asians\" website. Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She moves on to a rack of DVDs. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Wow, we have a lot of the same DVDs. Life of Brian, Cool Hand Luke, Family Guy... Beaches, Kirk? \nKIRK What?   It's a good movie. \nMOLLY I love that movie. \nShe spots a crate full of vinyl records. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Wow, records. No Way! Look at all this Cheap Trick! \nKIRK You like Cheap Trick? \nMOLLY Are you kidding? Heaven Tonight is the first album I ever owned! A hand-me-down from my big sister. She was the coolest person in the whole world. \nShe notices an upright piano in the corner. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) You play the piano? \nKIRK A little. My grandma taught me. It was kind of our thing. She was a great player. Ragtime, show tunes, that kind of thing. I'm really not very good. \nShe plops down on the couch. \nMOLLY Oh, I'll bet you're great.   Play something for me. \nKIRK No, I can't really play in front of people. \nMOLLY What, the stage fright thing?    Come on it's just me. Please? \n", "test2_true": "Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into a little dance of almost sitting. He finally commits to sit. \nMOLLY So you've never played in front of anyone? \nKIRK Nope. Almost did once. A talent show in high school. I just sat up there drenched in sweat. I really thought I could do it but then I made my big mistake. \nMOLLY Let me guess. You looked at the audience. \nKIRK Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm shaking, my head is spinning, I'm trying to remember if I even play the piano... and then, I puked. \nMOLLY Right there on the stage? \nKIRK INTO the piano actually. \nMOLLY Shut up! You're lying!      Why would you do that? \nKIRK It was a reflex. I was trying not to barf on the floor. Turns out it's a lot easier to clean puke off a stage than out of a baby grand. \nMOLLY Yeah, that has to be a real bitch. Oh, I shouldn't be laughing. You poor thing. \nMolly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic but he does his best to keep it together. \nKIRK Sorry. I'm a little cotton-mouthed. I'm going to get a glass of water. How 'bout for you? Water? A nice glass of, you know...water? \nMOLLY Yeah.   That sounds good. \nKirk steps away from her and disappears into... \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN \nHe pours a glass of water. He's about to return when he sees his reflection in the window. The boner under his khakis is not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic. \nKIRK Um... You want anything to eat? \nMOLLY (O.S.) No thanks. \nKirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. He takes a few deep, calming breaths.   He closes the fridge - still at full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building. He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article. \nKIRK Oh come on! \nHe is sweating like crazy. \nMOLLY (O.S.) Can I give you a hand? \nKIRK No.   I got it! \nKirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush.   He stares at it hard. His boner begins to retreat. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nMOLLY Listen Kirk, I want you to know that I would really like to, you know, to be with you tonight. \nKIRK (O.S.) Really? \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN \nThe boner pops back up. Kirk silently mouths, \"MOTHERFUCKER!\" at his mischievous little man. \nMOLLY (O.S.) Well, sure. But... I just don't think I'm ready yet. \nKirk's reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief. \nKIRK Sure! Sure! Yeah! No problem! Great! That's...that's great! Ice!? You want some ice!? \nMOLLY (O.S.) Sure. \nKirk opens the freezer. He puts a few cubes in her water and then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants. \nINT. KIRK'S APARTMENT \nMolly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier. \nMOLLY I mean, don't get me wrong. I want to! Believe me - getting naked and crazy sounds fantastic right now. \nKIRK (O.S.) Shit! \n", "test2_id": 1195, "test3_input": "MOLLY Oh, it's a DVD. \nKATIE Who's this from? \nNobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer. \nSTAINER What?   It's closed captioned. \nPatty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass to them. Patty gives Talon the finger. \nKIRK What did he do? \nPATTY Listen, Molly would kill me if she knew I was telling you this but I'm trying to do you a favor. \nKIRK Okay. \nPATTY Molly has this physical...um issue. You know, kind of like a birth defect? \nKIRK Oh, my God. \nPATTY It's not a big deal but she's really self-conscious about it. Talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak. \nKIRK What is it? \nPATTY It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again. \nKIRK No, no.   I wouldn't do that. \nPATTY Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be your last conscious act... (she stands) Cake? \nPatty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses the room and walks out to the... \nEXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK \nHe throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance similar to the one he had done after their first kiss. \nStainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys come around the front to join Kirk. \nSTAINER Dude? \nKIRK (playfully chipper) My friends! Whassup Bitches! \nDEVON What?   What's going on? \nKIRK My troubles are over boys! It's all going to work out! Check it out - Molly has... Wait for it... \nKirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up. \nKIRK (CONT'D) ...a birth defect! \nDEVON Excuse me? \nJACK That's terrible. \nKIRK No.   That's awesome!   Don't you get it? \nDEVON Ahhhh No. \nSTAINER Sure, I get it. She needs a good guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she dates can't handle it, right? \nKIRK It sent Talon packing. \nKirk and Stainer high five.    Jack and Devon look disturbed. \nDEVON Well, what's wrong with her? \nKIRK I don't know yet. Patty just said she had a physical issue. \nDEVON Well that could be anything. Did she say it was a birth defect? \nKIRK She said it was, \"something like a birth defect.\" \nJACK What if it's something really bad? \nKIRK I hope it is. I hope it's something that would make most guys run screaming. It won't matter to me. I love her. \nJACK That's cool that you love her but it's pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity. \n", "test3_true": "STAINER Hey, if that chick has a dick, I'll suck it! \nINT. RESTAURANT - LATER \nKirk and Molly are cleaning up after the party. Kirk is relaxed and in a fantastic mood. Patty gets her coat and hugs Molly before exiting. Molly sheepishly approaches Kirk. \nMOLLY Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano thing. It was stupid of me. \nKIRK No. I know what you were trying to do. It's okay. I wish I could have played for her but... \nMOLLY Well, anyway, thanks for all your help with Katie's party. I know it meant a lot to her. \nMolly kisses Kirk. Now he's calm and kisses her back passionately. She smiles a naughty smile at him. \nMOLLY (CONT'D) Tonight? \nKIRK Tonight. \nThey start cleaning up as fast as they can.   Kirk is beaming! \nINT. MOLLY'S CONDO - NIGHT \nMONTAGE OVER LOVE SONG: \nKirk and Molly enter her modern, luxurious condo.   Kirk takes her coat. They kiss. \nKirk opens a bottle of wine.   He pours one glass to share. \nThey sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on!    He is confident and silly and Molly is eating it up. \nThey are making out passionately on the couch. \nMolly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at it as if to say, \"How 'bout them apples!?\" Molly laughs and leads him into the bedroom. \nKirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out. \nKirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this.   He decides to sit. \nMolly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and sits down next to Kirk. They kiss but Molly stops. \nMUSIC REDUCED TO BACKGROUND \nMOLLY Kirk, before we do this, there's something I'm really insecure about and you're going to see it sooner or later so... \nKIRK Hey, take a look at me. \nMolly smiles nervously. She stands in front of him, Crying Game style. She removes her feet from her slippers and looks down at them. Kirk looks down. Even her feet are fantastic. \nKIRK (CONT'D) What? \nMOLLY Don't rush me... Okay, look. \nShe parts her toes.    They are webbed.   Kirk's face drops. \nKIRK That's it? \nKirk jumps up and paces around. \nKIRK (CONT'D) That's it? That's the best you can do? This is your big flaw? \nMOLLY If you can't handle it... \nKIRK Jesus Christ! I can't! I thought you were going to show me some kind of hairy growth or a third nipple or something I could work with! \nMOLLY What the hell is wrong with you!? \nKIRK You know what's wrong with me!? I'll tell you! I'm fat! I'm bald! I'm ugly! I'm hairy! I'm uncoordinated! I'm uncreative! I'm not a college graduate! I've never been to Europe! I have a shitty job! I drive a shitty car! You want me to go on!? Because I can! \nMOLLY No. \nKIRK So, here I think that the perfect Molly McCall is finally going to show me a good reason why she's messing around with the likes of me! And this is all you got!? You can't wear friggin' flip-flops!? \nMOLLY Kirk, I've given you plenty of good reasons. \nKIRK Oh, yeah! I'm nice! I'm funny! I ask cute, stupid questions! Right! That doesn't get a three hooked up with a ten! Not in this world! \n", "test3_id": 1196}

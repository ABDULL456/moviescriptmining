SAMANTHA What? 
FIGURE I want to show you something! We look back, over our shoulder, then back at the Figure. You mean me? This close now, we see the Figure is Kurt Damon. 
SAMANTHA You want to show me something? Her manner of speech is childish, like a grade-schooler's. 
KURT 
(CHARMING) Well, of course! I don't see anybody else around! We start up the steps of the porch. Kurt smiles, beguilingly, and holds a hand out to us. 
SAMANTHA What is it? 
KURT It's a surprise. He tugs. She resists. 
SAMANTHA What kind of surprise? 
KURT Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be much of a surprise, would it? We let him pull us through the door. 
INT HOUSE DAY Kurt leads us into the living room. The windows are covered with tinted plastic, casting an eerie blue light through the place. Adam McCarthy is in the living - loom too, drinking from a bottle of schnapps. He's drunk, slurring. He sees us. 
ADAM Happy St. Patrick's Day. 
SAMANTHA What's the surprise? 
ADAM Uh... don't you have it? He giggles. 
KURT Oh yeah, the surprise. 
ADAM The surprise. They laugh and look at each other. Kurt drinks, then forces the bottle back at Adam. ADAM (cant' d) I'm too wasted. 
KURT Drink, motherfucker, drink motherfucker, drink motherfucker 
DRINK! He wrestles with Adam, forcing him to drink. Half of it runs down Adam's chin. 
SAMANTHA I don't think there is a surprise. We turn and start for the door. Kurt hurries around, intercepts us. 
KURT Yeah there is, yeah there is. He puts his arm around us, leads us back into the room. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: KURT (cont' d) The surprise is... we decided we want to be your friends. 
SAMANTHA You do? 
ADAM Oh, yeah, so bad. He laughs. 
SAMANTHA Why do you want to be my friend? 
KURT Are you kidding? Look at yourself! Kurt turns Samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the fireplace. She's good-looking, if she knew it. Terribly insecure, doesn't even like looking at herself. We turn away, embarrassed. KURT (coast' d) Ah ah ah, look! He makes us look in the mirror again. KURT (cont' d) Mama, you are hot. He turns her toward him, looks at her, closely. KURT (coast' d) 
(SOFT) Come on, let's be friends. 
SAMANTHA Well.., you can kiss me if you want to. Kurt leans in close, kisses us. After a moment, we force our head away, looking down. Kurt's hand is on Samantha's breast. We push him back. SAMANTHA (cont'd) Not like that! But Kurt pulls us closer, roughly. We struggle. 
KURT Come on, Samantha, I'll be your friend, I swear I will.

QUINCY I'm alright.  But you can sit. 
MONICA I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL. 
QUINCY Yup. 
MONICA What are the doctors saying? 
QUINCY (shrugs) A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months. 
MONICA I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve. 
QUINCY Not for Quincy McCall. 
MONICA I forgot, "Q-man." 
An awkward beat. 
QUINCY So, how's pro-ball, Europe? 
MONICA We won the championship. 
QUINCY Still working on being the first girl in the NBA? 
MONICA Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical. 
QUINCY Funny.  I never did. 
MONICA Kiss my ass. 
Monica cracks up.  Quincy laughs with her. 
MONICA (cont'd) I can't believe it's been five years. 
Quincy nods. 
QUINCY Tried calling you a couple times. 
MONICA Oh yeah? 
QUINCY Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again. 
MONICA (lying) Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up. 
QUINCY Figured it was something like that. 
They look at each other.  The moment is building. 
QUINCY (cont'd) So, when do you go back? 
MONICA Actually, I don't... 
QUINCY What do you mean? 
MONICA I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile. 
QUINCY (completely thrown) A rest? 
MONICA Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know? 
QUINCY No. 
He stares at her.  Into her. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Quincy! 
Quincy and Monica turn, as KYRA KESSLER, black, 26 and beautiful, rushes into the room.  She wears a flight attendant's uniform.  She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss. Monica reacts. 
KYRA I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me. 
QUINCY It's okay. 
KYRA Why are you up?  Get in bed. 
She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed.  Monica watches. 
KYRA (cont'd) Tell me you're going to be okay. 
QUINCY I'm gonna be okay. 
Kyra relaxes.  Then she glances over at Monica. 
KYRA Hello. 
QUINCY Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh... 
KYRA (recognizing) Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you. 
Monica smiles awkwardly. 
QUINCY This is Kyra.  My fiance. 
The shock hits too quick to cover.  But Monica tries.

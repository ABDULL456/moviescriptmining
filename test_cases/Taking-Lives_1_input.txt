Reynaud takes a picture of the screen. Laval checking the door's lock. Finds no marks. Gives Costa a look. 
COSTA 
Is this about the strangling?   Is that guy after me? 
GRACE 
Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don't know if there's a connection yet. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Is anything missing. 
COSTA 
No.  Everything's here. (a beat) Shit. He took my organizer and my business checkbook. Grace nods for Laval to step outside with her. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GALLERY - DAY 
Grace and Laval. 
GRACE 
How do we know Costa didn't stage this? For attention or something. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
He's happy to see you. But the alarm was jumpered. Do you think Costa knows how to jumper an alarm? 
GRACE 
We should take the computer. Costa who has followed them out, overheard. 
COSTA 
Don't take the computer.    That's my brain. Costa turns to Grace. 
COSTA 
I'm not making this up.     Believe me. Grace shrugs, sees an ATM facing the alley. 
GRACE 
Should I believe you? Grace crosses to the ATM.   Peers into its security camera. 
GRACE 
Or should I believe this. 
COSTA 
Believe what you want. He's cocky, Grace likes that. 
EXT. ALLEY - ATM VIDEO - NIGHT 
Being fast forwarded. COSTA exits his office.        Locks the door. He walks TOWARD CAMERA and EXITS FRAME. A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing towards the office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM customer moves on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Nobody is there.     Then: MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door. APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME. Fast forward some more until Costa ENTERS FRAME and crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER. 
CUT WIDE TO: 
INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Costa, Grace, Laval and Reynaud. Costa stands there looking at Asher's image on the video monitor. 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Is that the man you saw choking Mr. Ford? Fear flashes across Costa's face. 
COSTA 
I must of walked right past him. 
GRACE 
Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot? 
COSTA 
Yes. That's him. That is the man I saw murder Todd Ford in the parking lot outside my gym. No doubt. Now will you go catch him, please? 
GRACE 
Thank you.   I just needed you to say it. 
COSTA 
Who is this guy? He's like a Ninja. Sneaking into my office. How dangerous is he? Does he want to kill me? 
GRACE 
John, no harm will come to you. Listen to me. No harm will come to you. I promise. Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She gestures at Laval and Reynaud.     Costa turns to them. 
COSTA 
How many people have you killed? 
Reynaud shrugs.

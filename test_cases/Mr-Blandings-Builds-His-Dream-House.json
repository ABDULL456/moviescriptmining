The CAMERA MOVES UP to a HEAD CLOSEUP of one of them. It is Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas), a well-dressed, intelligent, attractive looking young man. \nBILL I suppose you're wondering what all this has to do with Mr. Blandings and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell you. Jim Blandings is part of the fabric of this town. Born and raised right here, he's as typical a New Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. At least he was. (confidentially) And if you want to know the real story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer and quote, best friend, unquote. Jim's one of those bright young men from Yale. Advertising business, lovely wife, two fine kids, makes almost fifteen thousand a year. Want to know why? Just look up there. \nA BILLBOARD \nA billboard -- against a white background is a large ham. In large letters across the ham is printed: \nWHAM! (A WHALE OF A HAM) \nAnd below this in quotes: \nMURIEL Why don't you look in your sock drawer? \nJIM (with restraint) That's where I found my underwear. \nMURIEL Oh. (brightly) Well, try your underwear drawer. \nJIM I'm in my underwear drawer. \nHe reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips. \nMURIEL (sipping coffee) Well, they must be somewhere. (attempt at morning cheeriness) Socks just don't get up and walk away by themselves. \nJIM (strained patience) Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a- half drawers were to be mine! I wish you'd tell Gussie -- \nMURIEL The closet! That's where they are. We put them in the closet. \nJIM Socks? In the closet? \nMURIEL Well, there didn't seem to be any room in the drawers... \nJIM And there's so much of it in the closet! \nMURIEL ...so Gussie and I decided that from now on we'll keep them in a basket on the shelf. \nJIM Well, thanks a lot! \nHe strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to explode, he looks at Muriel. \nMURIEL Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy. \nJIM (barely containing himself) I'll try, dear. \nJim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, takes another sip of coffee. \nINT. THE HALL \nJim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe around her. \nJOAN (sharply) Father, just one morning I wish you'd knock! \nJIM (to her back as she walks away) 'Morning, dear. \nJoan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom. \nINT. THE BATHROOM \nVery small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use, frowns. \nWHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE \nWHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves. \nCLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE \nCLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET \nCLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life. \nCLOSE SHOT - JIM \nCLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of \"Home On The Range.\" \nDISSOLVE \nJIM \nJim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is singing a lusty chorus of \"Home On The Range.\" Jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach for a towel, start to dry herself. \nThe mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene. \nMURIEL (reaching for toothbrush) Excuse... \nShe takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he continues shaving. \nCLOSE SHOT - MURIEL \nCLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to her brush. \nJIM AND MURIEL \nJim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his original position as he follows the mirror. \nJIM Excuse... \nMuriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They both hum \"Home On The Range\". Her mouth full, Muriel taps Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her face in the mirror. \nJIM Just an overall figure. \nFUNKHAUSER Well!... I shouldn't like to be tied down. But I suppose if you must have a figure, I'd say -- mm -- (lightly) -- somewhere in the neighborhood of seven. \nJIM Mm... Seven. \nFUNKHAUSER (nodding) Mm. \nJIM That would be seven... thousand? \nFUNKHAUSER Mm. \nJim looks at Muriel, considers. \nJIM (soberly) We-ll. That seems fair. (gathering up materials) After all, we're not running away from color -- (picks up wallpaper) -- and we are tearing out walls -- (picks up sketches) Mr. Funkhauser, do you have a card? \nMURIEL Jim, we haven't even discussed the rest of the house. \nJIM We will, dear. (leads the whole batch on Funkhauser) \nFUNKHAUSER (huffy) Well, really, I -- \nJIM (deftly steering him toward the door) We'll talk it all out and then we'll get in touch with Bunny. \nCAMERA TRUCKS with them to the door. \nFUNKHAUSER Well, really, I mean, I was under the impression we'd come to some decision today. \nJIM I'm sure we will. \nFUNKHAUSER We-ll! \nJIM So nice of you to come. (puts Funkhauser's hat on his head) Good day. \nAnd Funkhauser is gone. Jim closes the door, turns ominously. \nMURIEL (apprehensively) Now darling, you -- you just don't go to a man like Funkhauser and ask how much it's going to cost before you even know what he's going to do! \nJIM No, that would be too logical! Seven thousand dollars! Blueberry pie! I wouldn't put seventy-five cents into this broken-down rat trap! \nMURIEL (sentimentally) It's our home, Jim. Betsy was practically born in this apartment. \nJIM That does not make it a national shrine! (vehemently) Seven thousand dollars and not one word about closets. \nMURIEL Closets! You wouldn't even let him get to the bathroom! \nJIM I haven't got that kind of money! \nMURIEL The way you talk, Jim Blandings, you'd think I was some kind of congenital idiot! \nJIM Sometimes I'm beginning to wonder! \nMURIEL (furious) You can just get out of here! \nJIM That's not a bad idea! \nHe angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a tennis racket tumbling down on his head. Jim jams his hat onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming the door. Muriel walks over to the closet, is about to bend down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent-up emotions explode. She kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the door, starts to cry. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. RADIO CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - (STOCK) \nDISSOLVE \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF JIM'S OFFICE - DAY \nExiting from the elevator, Jim enters a door marked: \nDASCOMB AND BANTON ADVERTISING \nDISSOLVE \nINT. JIM'S OFFICE - DAY \nOn the wall are various framed copies of Jim's handiwork. Most prominent are advertisements for a meat product called \"Wham!\" \"A Whale of a Ham!\" There is ample evidence of the fact that Jim's most successful slogan is: \"When you've got the Whim - say 'Wham!'\" \nJim enters, goes to his desk, sits down, still emotionally upset. He glances at a photograph of Muriel, looks guiltily away, then back. \nJIM (to photograph) Sorry. \nHis secretary enters. \nMARY Good morning, Mr. Blandings. \nJIM (briefly) 'Morning. \nMARY You wanted to see the color copy from this month's House and Stream. \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nJim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - The car pulls to a stop. \nBILL'S VOICE Now we're ready to gaff 'em. \nSMITH (proudly) Well, folks, there she is -- the old Hackett Place. \nThe Blandings look off, react with interest and approval. \nWHAT THEY SEE -- BURROWED INTO THE UPWARD SLOPE \nWhat they see -- Burrowed into the upward slope of the land is the old Hackett farmhouse. If the roof seems to sway a little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy years come next April. However, the overall effect is definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. In the back are a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as Bald Mountain. \nSMITH'S VOICE Fifty mighty pretty little acres... \nJIM, MURIEL AND SMITH. \nJIM, MURIEL AND SMITH \nMURIEL (involuntarily) It's simply charming! \nJim's look cautions against her over-enthusiasm. \nMURIEL That is, for an old house. \nJIM (casually) Of course, you understand, Mr. Smith, we're just window shopping, so to speak. Nothing really definite in mind. \nSMITH Perfectly all right. \nJIM (studies house; with assumed indifference) Mm. Not a bad-looking place, but it's certainly a lot older than anything we had in mind. \nSMITH She's no spring chicken -- (sagely) -- but that's just what makes her such a buy. \nThey look at him curiously. Smith's attitude is matter-of- fact, almost without enthusiasm. \nSMITH This isn't just old timber, or a virgin stand oak grove other side of the trout stream, or a couple of fruit orchards... You're buying a piece of American history. \nJIM (interested in spite of himself) You don't say! How's that? \nSMITH First year she was built, General Gates stopped right here to water his horses. \nJIM (impressed) Oh! Old General Gates -- Civil War. \nSMITH Revolutionary War. \nJIM Oh. Oh, that General Gates. Hear that, honey, General Gates! \nMURIEL (with concern) Wouldn't that make the house over a hundred years old? \nSMITH (proudly) Hundred and seventy come next April. \nThe Blandings exchange a doubtful look which Smith catches. \nSMITH Now I'm not trying to sell you anything -- all I'm saying is that one of these days someone with a little vision and imagination's goin' to come along, and just steal this place -- (confidentially) and I mean steal it. \nThe Blandings, as one, turn to the house with renewed interest. This is not lost on Smith. \nSMITH Mr. Blandings, I know you can look at that house and just about picture what a couple of coats of paint and a little pointing up here and there can do to it. \nJIM Mm. \nThe CAMERA MOVES TO a HEAD CLOSEUP of Jim as he begins to visualize \nWHAT HE SEES \nWHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place suddenly DISSOLVES into the New Blandings' Place -- Jim's version. It is a lovely country house. Massive. Masculine. Jim, in jodhpurs, tweed coat, pipe and accompanied by two large Irish Setters, is proudly surveying his property. He nonchalantly holds a sleek, beautiful shotgun in the most precisely correct position. \nCLOSE SHOT - JIM'S FACE. \nCLOSE SHOT - Jim's face. His lips don't move but we hear his voice. \nJIM'S VOICE Hm. Wonder what he meant by \"steal?\" \nTHREE SHOT. \nTHREE SHOT. \nSMITH And I guess I don't have to tell you, Mrs. Blandings, what a woman's touch could do to a place like this. \nMURIEL Well -- \nCAMERA MOVES to a HEAD CLOSEUP of Muriel as she starts to visualize. \nWHAT SHE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE \nWHAT SHE SEES - The Old Hackett Place DISSOLVES into a dainty, feminine cottage with criss-cross curtains at the window and a lovely little white rail fence enclosing \"her garden.\" Muriel, in delightful gingham, is in the garden, admiring her latest triumph - the largest rose ever grown in Lansdale County. \nJIM (with pride) Well, it wasn't much, Bill. I just saw a good thing and I -- (take) What do you mean? \nBILL Every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by bamboozling the American public. (picks up Smith's correspondence) I would say that a small part of this victimized group has now redressed the balance. \nJIM What are you talking about? \nBILL You! You've been taken to the cleaners and you don't even know your pants are off! \nMURIEL Dear, I told you. I said we should call Bill -- \nJIM Never mind, Muriel! (to Bill; challengingly) All right, just what's wrong with this deal? \nBILL First time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres, right? \nJIM What of it? \nBILL That's two hundred dollars an acre. I know that part of Connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top-gouge price to city slickers. When the natives sell to each other it's around forty or less. \nMURIEL Forty dollars an acre! \nJIM The man's entitled to a fair profit. \nBILL Not two hundred and eighty-four percent. (indicates papers) And besides, you're not getting fifty acres, you're only getting thirty- five, more or less. \nJIM Where does it say that? \nBILL (picks up letter) I refer to a rather obscure post- script on the back of the second letter from Friend Smith. \nHe hands the letter to Muriel. \nMURIEL (reading) \"Incidentally, Mr. Hackett has been a little over-optimistic about the acreage. It will probably survey somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five acres, more or less, but I feel sure...\" \nJIM (on the defensive) All right, so it's thirty-five! What's the difference? Do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty- five acres? \nBILL You're not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts! \nJIM That's not the point! \nBILL (very businesslike) That's precisely the point. We're going to write this Hackett a strong letter and tell him he can either kick in with those fifteen acres, reduce the price, or find another sucker. \nJIM (rising emotion) We'll do no such thing! I'm not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken- down acres! \nMURIEL (to Bill) We were just going window shopping and so far it's cost us eleven thousand five hundred dollars and they even made us pay the commission! \nJIM You don't understand business. \nBILL You mean extortion. \nAs Jim turns on Bill and is about to answer him explosively: \nMURIEL (thoughtfully) I wonder if we could get another two year lease on the apartment? \nJIM (heatedly) Now wait a minute! You can't measure everything on a slide rule. This house has certain intangibles. \nBILL Like what, for instance? \nJIM Like antique value, for instance! It just so happens that General Gates stopped right there, at that very house, to water his horses. \nBILL I don't care if General Grant dropped in for a scotch and soda -- you're still getting rocked! \nJIM That was a different war! \nMURIEL I think Bill's absolutely right. \nJIM (struggling to contain himself; quietly) Let me explain something. To both of you. For fifteen years I've been cooped up in a four room cracker box! Just getting shaved in the morning entitles a man to the Congressional Medal for bravery. \nBILL That doesn't make this a good buy. \nJIM Bill -- Muriel and I have found what I am not ashamed to call our Dream House. It's like a fine painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, how much was the canvas, how much was the paint? You look at it and you say, \"It's beautiful... I want it,\" and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it -- and gladly -- because you love it and you can't measure the things you love in dollars and cents! \nMuriel looks at Jim, impressed, her face softening with compassion. \nJIM (emotionally spent) Well -- that's how I feel about this place. And when I sign those papers Saturday, I can look the world in the face and say, \"It's mine! My house! My home! My thirty-five acres!\" \nMURIEL (coming over; moved, touched) Our house. Our home. Our thirty-five acres... \nThey tenderly kiss. \nBILL ...more or less... \nOn Jim's reaction: \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. LANSDALE COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY \nComprehensive Shot showing village green of a small, typical, quaint New England town. \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nJim and Muriel look at each other with disgust and resignation. \nJIM What in the world are \"Shrunk Mills?\" \nBILL They are probably mills that have shrunk. \nMURIEL Well, you certainly aren't much of a help. \nBILL (wearily) Look -- you really want to find that house of yours -- it's no problem. \nThey look at him curiously. \nBILL Just pretend you're one of General Gates' horses and you're thirsty... Now where would you go for a drink of water? \nJim looks at him darkly, drives through the bridge, turns right, as Muriel looks slightly triumphant. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - DAY \nJim, Muriel and Bill stand a little distance from the house, looking at it. A vast lilac spreads across it. The Blandings are in quiet rapture, and it is Bill who speaks first. \nBILL (frank and open) Well, I must admit it's a very beautiful thing. \nMURIEL (misty) The house and the lilac are just the same age, Bill; if the lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. It just needs someone to love it, that's all. \nThree shingles slide from the roof. As Jim and Muriel react: \nBILL It's a good thing there are two of you -- one to love it and one to hold it up. \nAs Jim gives him a look: \nBILL What'd your engineer say when he checked over the foundation and that roof? \nJIM Who needs engineers? This isn't a train, you know. \nBILL I just saw it move. \nJIM This house has been standing since the second year of the Continental Congress. You take one look at it and shingles start to fall off! \nAs if on cue, a few more shingles slide off the roof, nearly hitting Jim. \nBILL (solicitously) Look -- let me do you a favor. I've got a client, crackerjack structural engineer, Joe Apollonio; he practically built the George Washington Bridge single-handed. \nJIM Thanks a lot, but we're not building a bridge. \nBILL He's the follow who advised the Government not to raise the Normandie -- they didn't listen to him, cost them five million dollars. \nJIM You have my word, if I were raising the Normandie, I wouldn't make a move without Apollonio. (indicates door) Now would you like to come inside and look around? \nBILL (a skeptical look at the roof) No thanks, I'll just stay out in the car and listen to \"Life Can Be Beautiful.\" \nAs Jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash, followed by a series of other crashes. Muriel looks in, turns back to Bill. \nMURIEL I think you'd better contact Mr. Apollonio. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - DAY \nNear the front entrance. After a moment, the door opens, and the Blandings and Mr. Apollonio emerge. Jim, limping, is aided and abetted by a cane. Apollonio is a stolid, New York construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and cigar. A short rule sticks out of a back pocket. As they emerge, the Blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; Apollonio is thoughtfully noncommittal. \nMURIEL It has charm, hasn't it, Mr. Apollonio? \nAPOLLONIO (through his cigar) Uh-huh. \nJIM Of course, any small changes would have to conform with the character of the countryside. \nAPOLLONIO (through his cigar) Mm-hmm. \nMURIEL And yet still be functional. \nApollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house, kicks an exposed beam. It crumbles, apparently rotted by termites. Two shingles fall off. The Blandings watch him anxiously. \nAPOLLONIO (gazing upward; oblivious) Uh-huh. \nAs he thoughtfully rubs his chin, Jim, followed by Muriel, limps his way over to him. \nJIM Well, uh, what's your professional opinion? \nApollonio looks at the Blandings, at the house, then back at the Blandings. He takes the cigar from his mouth. \nAPOLLONIO Tear it down. \nJIM (appalled) Tear it down??! \nJIM Mm. New house... (as the notion sinks in, becomes attractive) New house. \nMURIEL (to Simms, with pleasant incredulity) You mean... for the same money... we could build a brand new house? \nSIMMS It certainly wouldn't cost any more. \nJIM (soberly) Hm... New house... \nHe turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an interested eyebrow. Then, to Simms: \nJIM (tentatively) Just... what sort of thing do you have in mind? \nSIMMS Well, I imagine the type of house you'd want would be something in quiet good taste, two story, frame and brick veneer construction -- modern, but of course fitting in with the architectural traditions of the countryside. \nJIM Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel? \nMURIEL I think it sounds fine. \nSIMMS Perhaps you'd like to see a basic floor plan -- (reaches into file behind him) -- something like this. \nSimms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him, the Blandings moving around, flanking him. They examine the plan with interest. \nWHAT THEY SEE -- THE PLAN. \nWhat they see -- the plan. A simple master plan of a two story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. As he talks, we see Simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the various rooms \nSIMMS First floor. Living room, study, dining room, kitchen, service porch, maid's room -- upstairs three family bedrooms with two adjoining baths. \nTHREE SHOT. THE BLANDINGS PRAISE THE PLAN \nTHREE SHOT. The Blandings praise the plan with the uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen such a plan before in their lives. \nMURIEL It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh -- well -- doesn't it seem just a little bit conventional? \nJIM Yes, Simms, if we were going to build a house we want it -- well, you know -- just a little bit different. \nSIMMS (he's heard all this before) Yes, of course. \nJIM Now, for instance -- (takes Simms' pencil) \nTHE DRAWING BOARD. \nTHE DRAWING BOARD. Jim's pencil traces as he talks. \nJIM'S VOICE -- here in the study if we could just push out this wall a little -- and put in a built-in bar we could -- \nMURIEL'S VOICE Excuse me, dear -- \nHer hand takes the pencil from his, starts to trace as she talks. Jim's fingers drum with the beginnings of impatience. \nMURIEL'S VOICE These bedrooms. They do seem rather small. And, of course we'd have to have a little dressing room -- and -- \nAs she draws it in, Jim's hand takes the pencil. Muriel's fingers drum nervously. \nJIM'S VOICE And closets, Simms, lots of closets. (traces them in) If there's one thing this family needs, it's closets. \nSIMMS' VOICE (as his hand reaches for the pencil) If I might make a suggestion -- \nBut Muriel's hand reaches the pencil first. \nMURIEL'S VOICE (as she draws them in) And bathrooms, Mr. Simms. Each bedroom must have at least one bathroom. \nSIMMS' VOICE But that would be four bathrooms, Mrs. Blandings -- (his hand reaches for the pencil) I think I'd better point out to you -- \nJim's hand reaches the pencil before Simms. Now Simms' fingers and Muriel's drum in unison. \nJIM'S VOICE Just a minute. Do you think -- (tracing) we might manage a little playroom in the basement, nothing tremendous, you know, something like this -- \nSIMMS' VOICE (as his hand reaches for the pencil; cautiously) Well, it's always possible, but at the moment our fundamental problem -- \nBut Muriel's hand has the pencil. \nMURIEL'S VOICE (as she traces) And I've always wanted a little sewing room upstairs -- (Jim's and Simms' fingers drum impatiently) You know, a little utility room where I can be alone, and sew, or sulk, or on a rainy afternoon... \nJIM'S VOICE (as his hand takes pencil) Pardon me, dear. On that playroom, Simms, not too small. You know, plenty of room for ping-pong, darts, nice big poker table... \nSIMMS' VOICE (as his hand reaches for another pencil) If you don't mind, I -- \nBut Muriel has reached the pencil first. As she and Jim sketch simultaneously and the scene begins to DISSOLVE, we hear: \nMURIEL'S VOICE ...And off the kitchen, I'd like a little flower sink just to putter around in... \nJIM'S VOICE ...And a terrace off the study, with an owning and little outdoor fireplace... \nDISSOLVE \nTHE DRAWING BOARD - THE ORIGINAL PLANS \nMINIATURE SHOT - What is left of the house collapses. \nEXT. HILL OVERLOOKING THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - PROCESS OF MATTE OR MINIATURE SHOT \nJim and Muriel are standing there, having watched the demolition. As the dust settles: \nJIM (sigh) Well, so far it's cost us thirteen thousand, three hundred and twenty- nine dollars and forty-five cents. \nMURIEL But we've got the nicest vacant lot in the state of Connecticut. \nThey exchange a look of mixed emotions. \nDISSOLVE \nSIMMS' NEW PRELIMINARY PLANS \nINSERT SIMMS' NEW PRELIMINARY PLANS - Fresh and workmanlike, a few small sections crossed out where cuts have been indicated. \nSIMMS' VOICE (wearily) Something will have to give somewhere, that I know. \nThe CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose: \nINT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJim, Muriel and Simms are going over the preliminary plans. Betsy and Joan are present, Betsy reading the Lansdale Blade and Joan reading a science book. \nMURIEL It's impossible. I don't see how we can cut another inch. \nJIM Honey, you heard Simms. As the house stands now it's over fifteen thousand dollars! \nMURIEL Well, it just doesn't seem possible -- (afterthought) for a house with such small rooms. \nSIMMS (patiently) Mrs. Blandings, I've already explained. It's not only the size of the rooms so much as it is the number. You see, our primary problem is one of cubage -- \nJIM That's right, dear, cubage. \nMURIEL What's that? \nJIM Oh -- (sorry he got into it) just a figure of speech. \nMURIEL But what does it mean? \nJIM (a little irritably) Cubage. It's just the number of cubic feet that -- (lost, lamely) -- go into a cubic foot. Go on, Simms. \nSIMMS (consulting plans) Now is it absolutely essential for each of your daughters to have her own room with two closets and a separate bath? \nJIM (a look at the girls; clearing his throat) Yes. You see, er, my daughters are, er, approaching womanhood, and, er -- \nSIMMS (brief look at the girls) I hadn't realized they were approaching it quite so fast. (to Jim) Perhaps what you need is not so much a house as a series of little bungalows. \nJIM Hmmm. (examining plans) What about that silly flower sink? We could eliminate that. \nMURIEL I beg your pardon. \nJIM Or that sewing room upstairs, that's certainly a waste. \nMURIEL If we're going to eliminate anything, we'll lose that ridiculous play room in the basement with that great big poker table. \nJIM Honey, I've got to have some relaxation. \nMURIEL We've got thirty-one and a half acres. Go out in the back and do a little gardening. \nJIM Sure, and get poison ivy! \nSIMMS (with dogged patience) If I may interrupt, I'd like to suggest that none of these are really major eliminations. Now if we could do with one less bathroom on the second floor -- \nMURIEL I'm sorry. We couldn't possibly. \nSIMMS Mrs. Blandings, a simple bathroom, eight by ten by eight with grade A fixtures will cost around thirteen hundred dollars. \nMURIEL I refuse to endanger the health of my children in a house with less than four bathrooms. \nJIM For thirteen hundred dollars they can live in a house with three bathrooms and rough it! \nSIMMS Look, perhaps the most practical thing would be -- \nBETSY Oh, look, we're in the Lansdale paper! (reading) \"Historical Society Blasts Vandalism!\" \nJIM Muriel, Simms explained to you. We've just got to cut, cut -- (reacts) What's that? \nBETSY (reading) \"Censure Vote Passed re Destruction of Famed Hackett Edifice.\" \nJIM Well, isn't that just too bad! Let me see that. \nHe takes the paper, scans it, suddenly bursts into laughter. \nMURIEL What's so funny. \nJIM (appalled) Now?! \nBILL You've got ten days. \nJim gulps. Pause. \nJOAN For six thousand dollars we could have had a Solaxion house and a Crane Mobile home. \nJIM Muriel! \nMURIEL (herding the kids toward the door) Girls, say your good nights and off to bed without another word. \nBETSY (reluctantly) Good night, Mr. Simms. Uncle Bill. \nJOAN (protesting) Miss Stellwagon says the problems of the parents should be the problems of the children. \nMURIEL (shooing them out) You keep that in mind, dear. It'll help prepare you for motherhood. \nThe children exit. An embarrassed pause. \nSIMMS Perhaps we'd better let the plans go for the time being and -- \nJIM (weakly) No, Simms, I'll work this out. You go ahead with your final plans and let's see some estimates. \nMURIEL And we'll just forget about that extra bathroom. \nSIMMS (preparing to leave) Very well. You'll hear from me as soon as possible. Good night. \nGood nights are exchanged. Muriel takes Simms out of scene toward the door. CAMERA HOLDS on Bill and Jim. \nJIM (defeated) Six thousand dollars! \nBill looks at Jim with compassion. \nBILL What'll you do for collateral on your building loan? \nJIM I don't know, turn in my insurance policies or something. \nMURIEL (coming into scene) Now, Jim, you can't do that. \nJIM Why not? \nMURIEL What if something should happen? You can't leave the children unprotected. \nJIM (somewhat irritably) I'm not dead yet! And if I die, there's plenty left to take care of them. \nMURIEL Not if you cash in your policies. \nAs Jim reacts with painful resignation: \nBILL I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll see the boys at the bank. Maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral. If necessary, I'll sign a personal note. \nJIM (wearily) Thanks, Bill. \nBILL (paternally) And Jim, do me a little favor. The next time you're going to do anything, or say anything, or buy anything, think it over very carefully, and when you're sure you're right -- forget the whole thing. Good night, Muriel. \nHe goes to Muriel and kisses her on the cheek. Jim sees it, is annoyed. \nMURIEL Good night, Bill. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS Muriel and Bill to the door. He exits. Muriel comes back into the room. \nMURIEL What a wonderful friend. \nJIM (darkly) What's with this kissing all of a sudden? \nMURIEL What's that? \nJIM Just because a man is helpful in a business way, it doesn't give him extra-curricular privileges with my wife! \nMURIEL That's a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years! \nJIM (testy) Well, I don't like it. Every time he goes out of this house, he shakes my hand and he kisses you. \nMURIEL (sharply) Would you prefer it the other way around?! \nJIM (irritably) Well, I don't like it, that's all! Why is he always hanging around? Why doesn't he ever get married -- or something? \nMURIEL (assumed innocence) Because he can't find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as I am. \nJIM Well -- it -- it doesn't look right. There are limits to friendship and -- \nMuriel comes over, puts a sympathetic arm around him. \nMURIEL Darling, let's not be silly about this. It's not Bill, it's the house you're upset about. \nJIM (sigh) I suppose so. \nJIM (same) I said, humming. \nBILL Oh. \nAs they get out of the car, there is an unusually loud crash from the well-digger's rig. \nBILL (loud) What's going on over there? \nJIM (same) That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging our well. \nBILL (same) Well? What happened to the trout stream, with that pure, clear, cold mountain water? \nJIM (same) I decided against it -- \nThere is a sudden cessation of the steam shovel and complete silence. Jim, unaware of it, continues to shout. \nJIM The trout stream -- (reacts; quietly) didn't seem practical. \nMURIEL It wasn't exactly a decision, dear. (to Bill) We discovered the trout stream dries up in August and the rest of the year it's polluted. \nJIM (defensively; groping) Well, anyway, I'd rather have artesian water. It's healthier. Calcium -- vitamins -- artesian -- \nBILL (indicating) What's wrong with that steam shovel? \nThey look off. \nWHAT THEY SEE. A CLUSTER OF WORKMEN \nWHAT THEY SEE. A cluster of workmen have gathered around Mr. Zucca, the driver of the steam shovel, who is swearing in voluble but undistinguishable Italian. \nJIM, MURIEL AND BILL. \nJim, Muriel and Bill. \nJIM Better take a look. \nHe starts off for the steam shovel, nimbly jumping over a drainage trench. Muriel starts to follow, pauses, unable to negotiate the trench. \nMURIEL Jim! \nJim turns in time to see Bill pick Muriel up and carry her across the trench. As he sets her down: \nMURIEL (sarcastic; to Jim) Thank you, dear. \nJim frowns, annoyed. They approach the group around the shovel. \nJIM What's the matter, Mr. Zucca? Something wrong? \nZUCCA How do you lika that? Broka my bucket. Two times this week I broka my bucket? \nJIM What did you do, strike a boulder? \nZUCCA (darkly) Atsa no boulder, atsa ledge. \nJIM (weakly) What does that mean? \nZUCCA Meansa we gotta blast! \nJIM Blast? \nZUCCA Blast. Witha dynamite. \nJIM What do you mean, dynamite? \nMURIEL (a little annoyed) What do you mean, \"What do you mean?\" Mr. Zucca just explained. He's going to use dynamite and blast until he gets rid of the rock. \nZUCCA Atsa no rock, atsa ledge. \nBILL What Mr. Blandings means is -- what precisely is a ledge? \nZUCCA Ledge. Lika bigga stone, only a- bigger. \nJIM Like a boulder? \nZUCCA No, like ledge. \nJim looks at Muriel and Bill. \nBILL ...Like a ledge. \nZUCCA But you don't gotta worry. Only cost twenty-four cents a cubic foot, plussa dynamite an'a fuse. \nJIM But how far will you have to blast? \nZUCCA Harda tell. Might be a lilla baby ledge -- mighta run the whole toppa the mountain. \nJIM (appalled) At twenty-four cents a foot? Do you realize what that means?! \nTESANDER 'Course it might turn out to be sandstone. \nJIM That's bad? \nTesander shakes his head, \"No.\" \nJIM That's good? \nTesander shakes his head, \"No.\" \nTESANDER Can't tell. Might be good. Might be bad. One thing you know -- you got plenty of shale, sandstone and limestone. \nJIM ...I see. \nHe turns a little helplessly to Muriel and Bill. \nBILL On a hot day there's nothing like a nice cool limestone shower. \nMURIEL (sweetly) Mr. Tesander, just for the record, of course, what ever happened to water? \nTESANDER Oh, it's there, all right. (he smiles, nods, tips his hat to Muriel) Just got to be patient. \nHe turns on his motor, goes back to work. Jim, Muriel and Bill start to move off. \nBILL If you ask me, this project's getting a little out of hand. \nJIM (defensively) Nothing's getting out of hand at all. I've made a chart of the whole operation, and -- (indicates Tesander) with a few minor deviations, I know exactly what every penny's going to cost. \nMURIEL Two pennies. \nJIM (coolly) And just what does that mean? \nBILL (drily) Meansa we gotta blast. \nThere is a loud dynamite blast o.s. As a shower of dirt and rocks cascade down and they run for cover: \nDISSOLVE \nJIM'S COST CHART \nINSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Jim stands casually above the house holding the line with one hand. The group pushing from below now consists of Smith, Hackett, Simms, Retch, Tesander, Zucca and assorted sub-contractors and workmen. As the house moves up a thousand dollars, Jim firmly pushes it back. It now rests at $33,500. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. JIM'S OFFICE - DAY \nJim and Mary. \nJIM You see, Mary, the average fellow who builds a house doesn't know where he stands from day to day -- but I do things a little differently. With a few minor deviations I know exactly where every penny is going -- \nThere is a knock on the door. It opens and Bill Cole appears, briefcase under his arm. \nBILL Hi. \nJIM Bill! Come in, come in. \nBILL (entering) Just going over the Knapp contracts with old man Dascomb and I -- uh -- (indicates Mary) Can I talk? \nJIM (a little concerned) Sure. What's up? \nBILL (obliquely) While I was in there with Dascomb the conversation kind of got around to you and -- uh -- \nJIM (impatiently) What is it? \nBILL Well, he didn't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you haven't turned in a decent piece of copy, but -- \nJIM But you kind of got the feeling... \nBILL ...that if I told you, you'd know that he knew that you knew that he knew... that you knew... or something. \nJIM What's he worrying about? The deadline's three months off. I've always -- \nThe phone rings. Mary answers. \nMARY Hello? Yes. Just a minute. (hands phone to Jim) Mrs. Blandings calling from Lensdale. \nJIM Yes, Muriel. What? What's that? Tesander struck water! Say that's wonderful! (to Bill) We've finally got our well. \nBILL (drily) Congratulations. \nHe extends his hand. Jim absently shakes it, then: \nJIM (listens at phone) Huh? What's that? (face falls) What do you mean we've got two wells? (listens; then, grimly) I'll be right out. (hangs up, rises) Come on, Bill, we'd better get out to Lansdale. \nMARY Anything wrong? \nJIM (soberly, as he slips into his coat) Mary, have you ever seriously considered building a house? \nBILL Maybe it's that little room off the hallway. \nJIM That's the breakfast nook. \nMURIEL It's not the breakfast nook, it's the powder room. \nJIM Oh. \nBILL Do me a favor -- don't ever invite me here for a meal. \nTwo workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of lumber. The workmen don't see the Blandings. \nFIRST WORKMAN I don't figure this Blandings at all. If you gotta build on the windiest hill in Connecticut, why do you have to pick the windiest side of the hill? \nBILL (to workman) You know these New York millionaires -- they're eccentric. \nThe workmen pass from view. \nJIM I think I'd like to go outside. \nBILL (gesture to door) After you, Rockefeller. \nAs they enter the foyer, a carpenter appears. \nCARPENTER (to Jim) Just the man I want to see. Would you step over here a second? \nJIM Sure. \nBILL (indicating) I'll browse around upstairs. \nAs Bill starts up the stairs, Jim and Muriel follow the carpenter. \nCARPENTER (pointing up) On them second floor lintels between the lally columns, do you want we should rabbet them or not? \nJIM (lost) The -- second -- floor -- lallys? \nCARPENTER The second floor lintels, between the lallys. \nJIM Oh. Oh, the lintels between the lallys? \nCARPENTER Yeah. From the blueprints you can't tell. You want they should be rabbeted? \nJim throws a brief look at Muriel who is regarding him skeptically. \nJIM Un -- umm. No, I guess not. \nCARPENTER Okay, you're the doctor. (calls) Hey, fellas, you got any of them rabbeted lintels set, rip 'em out! \nAfter the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails brutally withdrawn from timber, a loud splintering of wood and then something of the appearance of entrails comes hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at Jim's feet. The carpenter exits. Muriel gives Jim an accusing look. \nJIM (sheepishly) It sounded less... expensive to say no. \nThere is another loud screech and more \"entrails\" come hurtling down, narrowly missing them. Muriel yells in the direction from which they came. \nMURIEL Stop it! Stop it! \nFrom upstairs comes a long, shrill whistle. Instantly all sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard. \nVOICE Okay, fellas, let's quit! \nJIM (to Muriel) Now look what you've done. \nAs Muriel turns with apprehension, eighteen workmen come trooping down the stairs. \nJIM (conciliatory) Look, men, Mrs. Blandings didn't mean anything. (the workmen regard him curiously) I mean, there's no point in walking off a job just because... a woman makes a silly little remark. \nWORKMAN It's Saturday, mister. We quit at twelve o'clock. This ain't a chain gang, you know. \nAs the workmen exit the Blandings look at each other a little sheepishly, start up the stairs. \nCRANE SHOT - AS THE BLANDINGS GO UP THE STAIRS \nCRANE SHOT - as the Blandings go up the stairs. \nMURIEL I'm just sick. From the outside this house looks like a grain elevator, and on the inside everything's miles too small. \nAs they reach the second floor landing, we hear, o.s. a steady but muffled pounding. \nThey stop as they hear the thumping. \nMURIEL What's that? \nJIM What's what? \nMURIEL That noise -- listen. (again the thumping) It's coming from the closet! \nThey rush to the closet, open the heavy oak door. Bill is inside, leaning disgustedly against the wall. \nAs Muriel and Bill precede Jim out of the closet and down the stairs, Jim pauses, speculatively toying with the lock. \nJIM (muttering) Funny... always worked before. Huh. I wonder... \nINT. FOYER - STAIRWAY \nMuriel and Bill walking down the stairs. From upstairs comes a steady sullen pounding from the interior of the closet. Without a word, they stop, look at each other, turn and walk back upstairs. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY \nMuriel and the children are having breakfast. Jim enters, in fairly high spirits, once again improvising to \"Home On The Range.\" \nJIM (as he sits down) \"Home, home in Connecticut -- Where you have to conform to local traditions, customs, politics and etiquette...\" (picks up his morning mail, starts to thumb through it) \nJOAN Dad, do you suppose I could have a chemistry lab in the basement? \nJIM (preoccupied with mail) Sure, why not? \nBETSY I think it's awful. Smelling up the house with those horrible chemicals. \nMURIEL Never mind, Betsy. (to Jim) Dear, I'm going up to the place this afternoon to see about landscaping. Bill's driving me. \nJIM (preoccupied) That's nice. (looking up; darkly) What do you mean, Bill's driving you? \nMURIEL (a little annoyed) Why do you always say, \"what do you mean,\" when you know perfectly well what I mean and what you mean? \nJIM I mean that every time I turn my back Bill Cole's driving you some place or something. \nMURIEL He's only being helpful. \nJIM (annoyed; tears open a letter) I thought he was a lawyer! Why isn't he out suing somebody? \nJOAN Bicker, bicker, bicker. \nMURIEL (to Joan) Another word and you don't get your laboratory. \nBETSY Well, that's something! \nJim suddenly explodes, crumpling a letter he has just read. \nJIM We'll just see about that! \nMURIEL (concerned) What is it, dear? \nIgnoring her, he reaches for the phone, starts to dial. \nMURIEL Jim, what's the matter? \nJIM (into phone; sharply) Mr. William Cole, please. (pause; then with rising emotion) Hello, Bill? I want you to fight this thing! I know my rights as a citizen! They can't get away with it!... What do you mean, what am I talking about? The letter, of course. From the owner of this building. They want us to move! It's a thirty day notice! (listens a moment) But that's ridiculous. How can I move into a house that isn't even finished?! No windows, no plaster -- or paint, or -- or plumbing! (listens a moment; then with rising emotion) Now you listen to me! I have no intention of moving in thirty days! This is not legal! I'm going to fight this thing! And I don't care if it takes every penny I've got! (listens) Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... All right! (hangs up) \nMURIEL (expectantly) ...Well? \nJIM (quietly) We're moving in thirty days. \nOn Muriel's reaction: \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. ROAD AND COVERED BRIDGE - DAY \nTwo moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause, over this, we hear: \nBILL'S VOICE So-came thirty days -- and they moved. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BRIDGE. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - Entrance to bridge. As the cavalcade passes through we see in the rear of the trailer, jammed among the household effects, Gussie and a very uncomfortable Mr. Bill Cole. \nBILL'S VOICE I mean -- we moved. \nOTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK \nThe moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn. Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite direction. Over this: \nBILL'S VOICE (as Jim would say it) That's the wrong road! Any fool knows that! \nJim starts his car up leading the way. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. ROAD AT THE HOUSE - DAY \nThe moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops his car and they all look off at the house, react with pleasant surprise. \nWHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING COMPLETION. \nJIM Where's Simms? \nWORKMAN Around back trying to figure out what to do about them windows. \nJIM What's the problem? You put windows up. \nWORKMAN Not these. They don't fit. \nJIM (angrily; control going) Oh, they don't, don't they? \nHe continues on toward the back of the house, the newspapers flapping beneath him. \nEXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY \nSimms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch hands Jim a sheaf of papers. \nRETCH Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look these over. \nJIM What's this about the windows? \nSIMMS (calmly) I'm afraid there's a little slip-up. These windows seem to belong to a Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York. I talked to Mr. Landings this morning. \nJIM Well, has he got mine? \nSIMMS No, he seems to have some windows that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of Peekskill. \nJIM Where are my windows?! \nSIMMS As near as we can figure out they've either been sent to a Mr. Benton in Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger of Phoenix, Arizona. \nBill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder. \nJIM What are we supposed to do -- live the rest of our lives in a house without windows? \nSIMMS It'll just be a matter of a few days. \nBILL What's a \"Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R\"? \nJIM How should I know? \nBILL (indicating) You've got one. \nJIM (reading from bill) \"Furnishing and installing one Zuz- Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and eighty dollars!\" (explosively) I will not have any such piece of equipment in my house! \nSIMMS I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr. Blandings -- to save your boiler and water pipes. \nJIM From what?! \nSIMMS Rust. The plumbing man assures us the water from your well is the most corrosive in his entire experience in the trade. \nBILL Another first! \nJIM (pursing his lips) Mm. (irritably) Well, if it's necessary, put it in! We're moving in today, you know and -- \nRETCH It's in. \nJIM Oh. (a final show of authority; sharply) Then get me the bill for it! \nBILL (indicating bill) You've got it. \nJIM All right then. \nAnd he stalks off, his papers, shavings, etc. flapping behind him. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe moving vans are driving away. \nINT. THE FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON \nA general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel, list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss painter. In the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant. \nMURIEL Now I want the living room to be a soft green. (PeDelford nods) Not quite as bluish as a robin's egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil buds. \nPEDELFORD Mm. \nMURIEL (handing him a sample) The best sample I could get is a little too yellow, but don't let whoever mixes it go to the other extreme and get it too blue. It should just be sort of a grayish yellow green. \nPEDELFORD (making a note) Mm-hmm. \nThey turn to the dining room. \nMURIEL Now the dining room I'd like yellow. Not just yellow, a very gay yellow. \nPEDELFORD Mm-hmm. \nBETSY Uncle Bill, you're going to miss your train! \nMURIEL Jim, you clean up this mess. I'll drive Bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner. \nBetsy and Joan pick up some boxes and walk into the dining room. \nBETSY You'd better hurry! \nBILL (indicating upstairs closet) Kind of hate to leave that little place. Just four walls and a couple of mothballs, but to me it'll always be home. \nJIM (preoccupied with timetable) So long, Bill. \nBill and Muriel exit. \nINT. THE DINING ROOM \nAs Jim drifts in, still preoccupied with timetable: \nJOAN It's certainly going to be fun this summer when Uncle Bill comes up for his vacation. \nBETSY We'll get in a lot of doubles. \nJIM Hmm? (looks up from timetable) What are you talking about? Bill's going to Europe. \nBETSY No, he's not. I heard him and mother talking. He's going to move his vacation up and take a place in Lansdale. \nJIM (vaguely annoyed) Uh-huh... Mm-hm. Mm-hm... Uh-huh. (then, covering up) All right, come on, come on. Get busy. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. THE BLANDINGS' CAR - (PROCESS) \nEvening is beginning to fall as Muriel drives Bill into town. \nMURIEL I'll scout around and find you a place in Lansdale. (quickly) Now, you're not going to change your mind about coming up? \nBILL Don't worry, I'll be on the job. \nMURIEL It won't be easy. I promise you a Cook's tour of every lamp maker, rug weaver, and antique shop in Lansdale County. \nBILL (philosophically) When I married you two I suppose I took you for better or for worse. \nMuriel smiles warmly, and in a friendly gesture reaches over and pats his hand. \nMURIEL Good old Uncle Bill. \nBILL (drily) Good old Uncle Bill. \nAs they exchange an understanding smile: \nDISSOLVE \nINT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children are unpacking a last barrel. They have made a rather unsteady pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects. Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime accumulation of sentimental trinkets. \nJIM Now look what you've done! \nBetsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle. The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts to clear. \nBETSY Father, the first principle of lighting a fire is to see if the flue is open. A three-year-old child knows that. \nJIM Next time we want a fire I'll send out for a three-year-old child! (indicates trinkets) Get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help Gussie set the table. It's getting late. \nThe children start gathering up the debris. Joan picks up some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box. \nJOAN Look, Dad, your fraternity pins. \nJIM (busy cleaning the fireplace) Pins? I only had one. \nJOAN There are two of them here. \nJIM All right, all right. Just put them away. \nJOAN (examining them) Funny, this one says W.C. on the back. W.C.? (brightly) William Cole! It must be Uncle Bill's! \nJIM Huh? (reaching for it) Let me see that. (examining pin) Hmmmm. \nBetsy has picked up a small leather-bound book. She whistles. \nJOAN What's that? \nBETSY Mother's diary when she was in college. It's slightly torrid. \nJOAN (coming over) Let's see. \nJIM (sharply) That's none of your business! \nMURIEL (beginning to be a little angry) Because I wasn't in love with him! \nJIM (vindictively) That's not what you said in your diary! \nMURIEL (now really angry) Oh, now you've been reading my diary! \nJIM (a little guilty) Well -- it happened to fall open and... I... happened to look at it. It... just happened. \nMURIEL I'll just bet! \nJIM It's all over the book so why don't you admit it? You were in love with Bill Cole! \nMURIEL Don't be absurd! Of course I was in love with Bill. In those days I was in love with a new man every week. \nJIM Then why did you marry me? \nMURIEL I'm beginning to wonder! (exploding) Maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin! Maybe I knew that some day you'd bring me out to this thirty- eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried-up trout stream and no windows! Or maybe I just happened to fall in love with you -- but for heaven's sake, don't ask me why! \nMuriel stalks out of the bathroom. Jim looks after her, thoughtfully starts to dry his face. \nINT. THE BEDROOM \nJim enters. Muriel stands with her back to him angrily winding the clock. Jim noisily clears his throat. No reaction. \nJIM (tentatively) ...Muriel? \nNo reaction. \nJIM ...Honey? \nNo reaction. \nJIM Would it do any good to say I'm sorry? \nMURIEL I don't know. \nJim gently turns her around facing him. \nJIM Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy and I'm sorry. \nMuriel looks at Jim. Finally she smiles. \nMURIEL Oh, Jim! \nShe goes into his arms and they kiss intimately. As their lips part: \nMURIEL (dreamily) Why don't you take the soap out of your ears? \nJIM (same) Why do I love you so much? \nJim again kisses her tenderly, warmly. \nMURIEL (breathless) Darling, it's awfully late. \nJim kisses her again, a little more ardently. \nMURIEL (same) Maybe you ought to go down and lock the doors. \nJIM (kissing her ear) What for? The windows are all open anyway. \nMURIEL (as he starts to kiss her again) Jim, you have to get up at six o'clock. \nJIM (considers; logic prevails; brief sigh) Yes, I guess so. \nMURIEL (reluctantly) Goodnight, dear. \nJIM (same) Goodnight. \nEach gets into his own bed, still wearing the overcoats. \nDISSOLVE \nINSERT JIM'S COST CHART - The house now wavers at $37,000. As Jim and Muriel still try to stem the tide, the group that is pushing the house ever upward includes all of the previous people connected with the house and -- in addition --plumbers, painters, landscape gardeners, etc. Over this, and across the scene flutter more bills, more extras. \nBILL'S VOICE And so the days sped by -- and the bills -- and the extras -- and as the house approached forty thousand dollars, Jim approached his deadline for the new slogan. It was almost a photo finish. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. RADIO CITY - NIGHT (STOCK) \nIt is raining. The lights are on in the buildings. \nINT. JIM'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nMary is attending to some detail work as the door opens and Jim enters, disturbed. Mary looks at him questioningly. \nJIM You'd better send out for coffee and sandwiches,... It looks like an all night session. \nMURIEL How could they be, dear? The bridge was closed. \nJIM I just came across it. \nMURIEL Well, it was closed last night. \nJIM (pointedly) It's open now! \nEmbarrassed pause. \nBILL (attempt at breeziness) If you'll all excuse me -- I -- I think I'll just go up and slip into something a little more comfortable. \nBill exits. Another pause. Simms, aware of the tension, wants to get out of there. \nSIMMS (rapidly) Well, that's about the size of it -- \nThrough Simms' speech, Jim looks darkly at Muriel. \nSIMMS -- except that Retch had to repair the pantry wall and that meant getting a plasterer back. And of course, he couldn't have broken through that wall -- \nJIM All right, Simms, all right. We'll take care of it. \nSIMMS (preparing to exit) I'll admit it's a little steep. But I'll try to get Retch to knock a hundred dollars off the bill. If I can't get that, I'll certainly try for seventy-five. \nJIM Fine. \nSIMMS If he doesn't go for seventy-five, I'll take a stab at fifty. \nJIM You do that. \nSIMMS (at the door) Anyway, I'm almost sure we can get twenty-five. \nThere is no answer. \nSIMMS (lamely) Well. Good day. \nHe leaves. There is a deadly pause. \nMURIEL (carefully) Now dear, you're upset, you've got a lot of things on your mind -- \nJIM (with dangerous calm) Muriel, there's only one thing on my mind -- This house -- and how fast we can get rid of it! \nMURIEL That's not what you're thinking. \nJIM Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm thinking I was once a happy man! (the martyr) I didn't have a closet, I didn't have three bathrooms, but I did have my sanity, a few dollars in the bank, two children who loved me and a wife I could trust! \nMURIEL That's a fine thing to say! \nJIM I also had a job at Danton and Bascomb, something I don't happen to have at the moment! \nMURIEL Jim! \nJIM That's right, I've resigned! We're starting all over again! From scratch! And without this house! \nMURIEL (near tears) You love this house! \nJIM I hate it! \nIn the b.g. Mr. Tesander enters, cap in hand, stands there, nervous and embarrassed. \nMURIEL You don't mean that. \nJIM Every word of it! Anybody who builds a house today is crazy! The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list! Everywhere you turn they've got a hand in your pocket. If you take out their hands, they find more pockets! (explosively) It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own! Against every boy and girl who were ever in love! \nTesander clears his throat. Jim turns. \nJIM (sharply) What do you want?! \nA slight embarrassed pause. Then: \nTESANDER (shyly) Well, Mr. Blandings, there's a matter of twelve dollars and eighty-six cents. \nJIM (with a wild gleam) Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents! Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander? (emptying pockets) Take everything I've got! Spread it out among your pals! (advancing toward the bewildered Tesander) Wouldn't Retch like a little something? Maybe Zucca could use my new dinner jacket? It's open house, Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this isn't enough I'll come over to your place and do some odd chores. Maybe I can mow your lawn or scratch your back! \nTESANDER (simply) You don't understand, Mr. Blandings. This twelve dollars and eighty-six cents -- you don't owe me, I owe you. \nThere is a momentary pause. \nJIM ...W-what was that? \nTESANDER (taking out money) Found I overcharged you. Almost three feet. \nHe hands the money to Jim, who stares at it blankly. \nTESANDER Better count it. I think it's all there. \nJim looks haplessly at Muriel, sheepish, guilty. \n", "test1_input": "JIM (with great restraint) Muriel, I know it's asking a lot, but just one morning I would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance! \nPicks up his paper. \nMURIEL Jim, you really might take a little more interest in your children's education. \nJOAN (without looking up) You can't squeeze blood from a turnip. \nJim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts down the paper, turns slowly to Betsy. \nJIM All right. All right. I'll listen. \nBETSY (picking up her scrapbook) It's just twenty-four words. But in simple eloquence it mirrors a minor tragedy of our times. \nJIM (quietly) Well?... \nBETSY (reading) \"Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak grove, apple orchard, trout stream, hay fields, four barns, seclusion, superb view, original beams, paved highway, acreage... (with emotion) Will sacrifice...\" \nPause. \nJIM Go on. \nBETSY (simply) That's all. \nJIM That's all?! \nBETSY You don't see it, do you, father? \nJIM No. Fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper. What did you expect him to do, take it to the United Nations! \nMURIEL There must be more to it than that. (to Betsy) Isn't there, dear? \nBETSY Certainly, mother. What some people don't see is the whole sordid picture. A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the wall by hardship, soil erosion, mortgages, everybody gobbling, gobbling, gobbling, until finally, in desperation, he is \"forced to sell,\" and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspaper advertising. \nJIM (muttering) Oh, indeed... crass commercialism... advertising... \nJOAN (nose in her magazine) Miss Stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession. \nJIM (with extreme control) Oh, she does? \nJOAN Miss Stellwagon says that advertising makes people who can't afford it buy things they don't want with money they haven't got. \nJIM (elaborate sarcasm) Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right. Perhaps I ought to get out of this \"basically parasitic profession,\" which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition, those extra French lessons, her progressive summer camp and for that matter, the very braces on your teeth! \nMURIEL I wish you wouldn't discuss money in front of the children. \nJIM Why not, they spend enough of it! \nJOAN Bicker, bicker, bicker. \nAs Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the downstairs buzzer rings. Gussie enters, squeezes by Jim who automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g. \nGUSSIE Hello. Who? (calls) Miss Blandings, there's a Mr. Funkhauser wants to see you. \nMURIEL Funkhauser? (remembers) Oh, Mr. Funkhauser! \nGUSSIE That's what he says. \nMuriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied, reading his paper. Then she turns back to Gussie. \nMURIEL Uh -- better ask him to come up. \nGUSSIE (into phone) Says to come up. \nGussie hangs up, squeezes by Jim, exits into the kitchen. Pause. \nMURIEL (tentatively) Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's here. \nJIM (looking up) ...Who? \nMURIEL You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that clever young interior decorator we met at the Collins' cocktail party? \nJIM (distastefully) What's he doing here? \nMURIEL (nervously) Well, I imagine he's brought the -- uh -- estimates. \nJIM (blankly) ...Estimates? \nMURIEL (rapidly; to conceal a feeling of guilt) Darling, you know how long we've said we've got to do something about this apartment, and, well, he called last week, and I had him come over, and he's got some simply wonderful ideas! \nJIM (quietly) There couldn't be two Bunny Funkhausers, could there? \nMURIEL Why, no, dear. \nJIM Then this is the same clever young man who's responsible for that zebra- striped monstrosity in the Collins' living room? \nMURIEL That couch is terribly functional. \n", "test1_true": "SOUND of doorbell ringing. \nMURIEL Darling, please!

FOYER \nGussie has just admitted Mr. Funkhauser. He is a tall, slender, effete-looking, young man. He is loaded down with sketches, samples of wallpaper, bolts of material. Betsy and Joan brush by him on their way out. \nFUNKHAUSER Good morning. \nTHE GIRLS (with a sharp appraising look) Hi. \nAs they rush out and the door closes, Jim and Muriel enter scene. \nMURIEL Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You remember Mr. Blandings? \nFUNKHAUSER But of course. \nHe sweeps by them into the living room, taking over completely. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nFUNKHAUSER You'll have to pardon my bursting in at this dreary hour -- (puts a sketch on a chair) -- practically the middle of the night -- (puts wallpaper against mantel) -- but I did so want to catch you in. I've been at it hammer and tongs all week and I'm just a mess -- (drapes bolt of chintz over high-backed chair) -- but then Muriel and I thought we ought to talk it over with you before we take the plunge... \nFunkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds flowing down in front. As Jim reacts: \nFUNKHAUSER (smoothing out folds on the chintz) After all, it's your home, too, and it should reflect you. You know, Man's Castle, all that sort of thing. \nJim looks down at the chintz. \nJIM (ominously) Muriel! \nMURIEL (quickly) Jim, just wait till you hear. He's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer. \nFUNKHAUSER Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the whole thing! I just couldn't live with it! I said to myself, \"Bunny, what are the Blandings? How shall we do them?\" And the answer was perfectly obvious. Very American, very grass roots, very blueberry pie -- that sort of thing. \nJIM (dark look at Muriel) Mm. \nFunkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully removes his hand. \nFUNKHAUSER Now first, let's dig into this living room of yours, it's really a dreary. \nMURIEL (quickly; to Jim) We want this room to be very gay, dear. Something in bright reds, yellows and greens. \nJIM (appalled) Red, yellow and green?! \nFUNKHAUSER Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not run away from color. \nJIM Not running away -- (a lame joke) -- just backing off a little. \nFUNKHAUSER Uh -- yes. (brightly) Now as I see our room, it's definitely Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench, breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, hooked rug. But everything in good taste. It must not jump out at you and scream: \"Look -- see how antique I am!\" \nJIM Heaven forbid. \nFUNKHAUSER Of course, these things take imagination. You've simply got to be able to visualize. \nJIM (politely, removing chintz) If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser, what I'd like to visualize -- at this dreary hour -- is how much is this all going to cost? \nFUNKHAUSER Well, really, I hesitate to say. After all -- (indicates) -- by the time this wall is out we may find -- \nJIM (reacting) This wall is -- what? \nFUNKHAUSER Out. Source of light is from the east. Obviously if our room is to have any function at all -- \nJIM You're going to tear out the wall?! \nMURIEL Dear, it's a wonderful notion. \nFUNKHAUSER Visualize three feet of leaded panes, the rest -- \nJIM Can you give me a figure? \nFUNKHAUSER Well! Costs aren't what they used to be, you know, and -- \nJIM Just a figure. \nFUNKHAUSER Materials are impossible, labor has just run wild -- \n", "test1_id": 2466, "test2_input": "Hackett exchanges the briefest of looks with Smith who almost imperceptibly shakes his head \"no.\" \nHACKETT (firmly) Ain't for sale! \nAs the Blandings react with dismay: \nSMITH (smoothly) Why don't you folks just go out in back and take a look at the orchard? \nHe gives them a wink which says, \"Just leave it to me.\" The Blandings exchange a look, turn and walk off. \nHACKETT How'm I doin', George? \nSMITH Nice timin', Eph. Think we got something here. \nHACKETT They the same people you showed it to in nineteen-thirty-eight? \nSMITH They were lookers -- this is the real thing. \nHACKETT If they got five thousand dollars on 'em. don't let 'em get away. \nSMITH They already offered ten. \nHACKETT (mildly) Y'don't say...

THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY \nMuriel and the two children are having breakfast. Jim enters in high spirits. During this scene we repeat the business of passing, etc. used in the previous breakfast scene. \nJIM (singing gaily to \"Home On The Range\") \"Home, home in Connecticut With a closet to hang up your petticut...\" \nMURIEL (as he seats himself) ...Jim? \nJIM (going on, as he places his napkin in his lap) \"No hustle or fuss No Fifth Avenue bus --\" \nMURIEL Uh -- Jim? \nJIM Hm? \nMURIEL I was just wondering, dear. Ten thousand dollars is such an awful lot to offer -- \nJim looks suspiciously at her, at the children, then back at her. \nMURIEL That is, for two people who don't know anything at all about real estate, or anything... (Jim's look darkens) I mean, don't you think perhaps we should have asked someone's professional advice? \nJIM Like... say... a lawyer? \nMURIEL Well, Bill knows about these things and -- \nJIM Muriel, for once in my life I'm going to make one small decision, on my own, without the legalistic machinations of Mr. Bill Cole. \nMURIEL It seems very peculiar that when your very best friend happens to be one of the very cleverest young lawyers in New York City -- \nJIM Muriel, I don't want to hear another word about Bill Cole! (turns to children) Well, did your mother tell you about the house? \nBETSY Yes. \nJIM Well? \nJOAN Miss Stellwagon says the current craze for modernizing old farmhouses is a form of totem worship. \nJIM (with great restraint) Did it ever occur to you two that there may be some remote, intangible subjects upon which your Miss Irma Stellwagon is not the final authority? \nJOAN Why don't we buy a Solaxion house? \nJIM ...You know it's just barely conceivable -- What kind of a house? \nJOAN Solaxion. It's built on a mast like a tent and it revolves with the sun. \nJIM Oh, it... revolves... with the sun? \nJOAN That's right. \n", "test2_true": "JOAN It's the only practical way to live. When a new model comes out you trade the old one in like a used car. \nJIM (plaintively) Muriel -- \nMURIEL Children, you haven't even seen this house yet. \nBETSY Personally, I'd like a Crane Mobile home. It comes all folded up and all you do is plug it in for electricity and water and -- \nJIM Now just a minute! (to Muriel) What kind of children are these? (to girls) Do you want to spend the rest of your lives in chromium tents and portable merry-go-rounds? This house was built before our country became a nation. It has dignity. It's -- it's -- \nGussie enters with a letter. \nGUSSIE (handing it to Jim) Special delivery, Mr. Blandings. \nJIM (with suppressed; excitement) From Smith! \nAs he eagerly opens it and reads, his face falls. \nJIM Mm. \nMURIEL Well? \nJIM (reading) \"I have conveyed your offer of ten thousand dollars to Mr. Hackett and am sorry to say he is not interested. However, I feel...\" \nMURIEL Oh, dear. Maybe we should have gone a few dollars higher. \nJIM (stoutly) He's bluffing. Simple as that. \nJOAN For ten thousand dollars we could get a Rockford Trailer and a Zamboni Power Unit. It's kitchen, bathroom and air conditioning all rolled up into -- \nJim gives her a weary look, turns to Muriel. \nJIM (firmly) Muriel, I'll let him push me to ten thousand, two hundred, but not a penny more! \nDISSOLVE \nJIM'S COST CHART \nINSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Rising diagonally and bisecting the chart is a line graduated in scale starting at $5000 and running up to around $17,000. Resting on the line at exactly $10,000 is a miniature of the old house. Fluttering across the scene from left to right is a letter from Smith on the stationery of the Lansdale Realty Co. \nAs we see the letter and hear the voice of Smith, miniature figures of Smith and Hackett appear at the lower side of the house. Their shoulders start pushing the house up the graduated scale. Over this: \nSMITH'S VOICE \"Dear Mr. Blandings: While your offer of ten thousand two hundred is still not acceptable to Ephemus Hackett -- \nA letter on Danton & Bascomb's stationery flutters across the screen from right to left. A miniature figure of Jim appears above the house, desperately pushing it back. Over this, we hear: \nJIM'S VOICE \"Dear Mr. Smith: You may inform Mr. Hackett that the very highest I could possibly go --\" \nAs a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first from left to right and then from right to left, and the house is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the following lines: \nSMITH'S VOICE \"Dear Friend Blandings --\" \nJIM'S VOICE \"My dear Friend Smith --\" \nSMITH'S VOICE \"Dear Blandings --!\" \nJIM'S VOICE \"Dear Smith - !\" \nThroughout this Smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed while Jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man being slowly pushed to the wall. \nThe Special Effect concludes with the house finally and firmly at rest on the preordained $11,550. As the antagonists on both sides of the house relax, Smith reaches around in front of the house and shakes hands with Jim. It's a deal! \nAbout halfway through when the going gets tough, Jim beckons Muriel to help in the losing fight. As they now embrace, Smith and Hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation. \nDISSOLVE \nDOOR \nDoor - on it is printed: \nMR. COLE PRIVATE \nDISSOLVE \nINT. BILL COLE'S OFFICE - DAY \nA successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leather- bound books. Jim and Muriel are seated facing the large desk behind which sits Bill Cole. Bill finishes reading a series of papers, the sum total of correspondence between Jim and Mr. Smith. He sets down the papers, leans back thoughtfully. Jim and Muriel look at him with nervous but eager anticipation. \nJIM (not too sure) What do you think, Bill? Steal, huh? \nBILL (drily) It certainly is. \nJim looks triumphantly at Muriel. \nBILL Perhaps \"steal\" is an understatement -- \"swindle\" might be a little more appropriate. \n", "test2_id": 2467, "test3_input": "JIM \"If you'd buy better ham. You'd better buy Wham!\" \nMARY It's Boyle Petroleum. \"If you'd buy better oil, You'd better buy Boyle.\" \nHer eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it, kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. Mary looks up. \nJIM \"This little pig went to market As meek and as mild as a lamb. He smiled in his tracks When they slipped him the axe He knew he'd turn out to be Wham!\" \nA long silent look passes between them. \nJIM (quietly) \"...knew he'd turn out to be Wham!\" \nHe suddenly and angrily gathers all his papers, slams them into the wastebasket. \nJIM (rising panic) It's gone! I've lost my touch! Maybe I never had a touch! Maybe \"Whim Say Wham\" was an accident! Who knows? I can't think any more! All I've got on my mind is a house with an eighteen thousand dollar mortgage, and bills, and extras, and antiques, and -- and -- (dejected) I don't know... I don't know. \nMary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door. \nMARY (startled) Where are you going? \nJIM Home, to get some sleep -- and I'd advise you to do the same. \nMARY But -- but you haven't -- \nJIM Suppose I haven't! This isn't the only job in town! \nMARY But -- but -- what'll I tell Mr. Dascomb? \nJIM (sharply) You just tell him to -- to -- (with finality) You just tell him! \nHe exits. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. THE BLANDINGS' HOME - DAY \nIt is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural- looking taxi deposits a weary Jim, who pays the driver. As the cab drives off, Jim looks speculatively at Simms' car, which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and enters. Under this a slightly sour underscoring of \"Home On The Range.\" \nINT. BLANDINGS LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAs Jim comes into the foyer, he sees Muriel, in nightgown and robe, talking to Mr. Simms. She holds the rolled-up volume of blueprints that went into building the house. \nJIM 'Morning, dear. \nMURIEL (going to him; solicitously) Darling, you must be exhausted. How did it go? \nJIM Fine. Fine. \nThey kiss. \nMURIEL (obliquely) Is... everything all right? \nJIM (unenthusiastic) Everything's fine. (still in embrace; looking up) Hello, Simms, what brings you out with the morning dew? \nSIMMS Just dropped by to check the blueprints. Some extras came in from Retch this morning and there're a couple of things I thought we ought to go over together. \nJIM (arms still around Muriel; unconcerned) Really. What are they? \nSIMMS Well, let's see. (thumbing through sheets) Few little things here, all right, I guess. \"Mortising five butts -- a dollar sixty-eight.\" \nJIM Let's not quibble about that. A man's entitled to mortise a few butts now and then. \nSIMMS (next sheet) Extra nails and screws -- three dollars, eighty-nine cents. \nJIM Petty larceny, but let him get away with it. \nSIMMS Now there's one here I frankly don't understand. Ah, here we are. (reads) \"Changes in closet, twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars.\" Did you authorize that? \nJIM Well, we probably told him to -- (reacting) Twelve hundred and what?! \nSIMMS Forty-seven dollars. Changes in closet. (hands bill to Jim) \nJIM (explosively) Who does he think we are! (looks at bill; very businesslike) What's this notation: \"Refer to Detail Sheet Number one thirty-five?\" \nSIMMS (indicating blueprints) Far as I remember, that would be something in the back of the house. Let's just take a look. \nAs he unrolls the blueprints, Jim looks suspiciously at Muriel. She seems a little nervous. \nSIMMS Ah, here we are. It isn't a closet at all. It's off the back pantry... Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink. \nJIM Oh... Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink. \nSIMMS (to Muriel) You didn't authorize any changes, did you? \nMURIEL (defensively) Well... they certainly weren't changes. \nJIM What -- have -- you -- done? \n", "test3_true": "JIM What -- have -- you -- done?! \nMURIEL Well -- (rattling off) All I did was one day I saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and I asked Mr. Retch if he wouldn't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things. That was absolutely all I did. \nDuring the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't lost on Jim. \nJIM That's all you did? \nMURIEL Absolutely. Just four little pieces of flagstone. \nSIMMS (to Muriel; wearily) Did you by any chance authorize a drain? \nMURIEL (verge of tears) Of course I didn't. All I said was I wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. Retch was just as nice as could be and said, \"You're the doctor,\" and that's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything. \nJim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms. \nJIM ...Well? \nSIMMS (sigh; plunging in) All right, I think I can tell you what happened. First, the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid. Those planks run under the whole width of the pantry, so Retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them. \nJIM AND MURIEL \nJim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over this: \nSIMMS' VOICE Then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle. I guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement. What with that added load on the weakened joists, I'll bet he had to put a lally column down there for support, too. \nMURIEL It was just four little pieces of flagstone, and I only --- \nJIM Quiet! \nGROUP SHOT - DURING THE FOLLOWING SPEECH \nGROUP SHOT - During the following speech we see Bill Cole, in Jim's pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the room. Jim and Muriel are not aware of his presence. \nSIMMS Well, the main soil pipe runs under there on wall brackets, so Retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set. I guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other. (looks up) 'Morning, Mr. Cole. \nBILL 'Morning. Hello, Jim. \nJIM (turning) Hello, Bill. \nJim turns away, reacts, suddenly turns back to Bill, taking in the pajamas and robe. A little shocked but unwilling to believe the implication of what he sees, he looks to Muriel for an explanation. \nMURIEL (lamely) The bridge was roped off and Bill had to stay last night. \nJIM ...Oh. \nBILL (cheerily) Slept like a rock. \nJIM I'm delighted. \nJim looks at Bill, then back at Muriel. \nSIMMS (clearing his throat) And then, of course, there are hot and cold water pipes hooked to the joists right under that pantry. They go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor, and I'll bet my bottom dollar he had to relocate them. \nTHREE SHOT - JIM, MURIEL AND BILL. \nTHREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel and Bill. Jim turns to listen but finds himself looking speculatively at Muriel and Bill. \nSIMMS' VOICE And I guess the electrician had to rip out about sixty feet of armored cable between the main panel and the junction box by the oil burner, including the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove. \nFULL SHOT - GUSSIE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY \nFULL SHOT - Gussie appears in the doorway in raincoat, carrying umbrella. \nGUSSIE 'Morning, everybody. Whew! What a night! \nJIM Where have you been? \nGUSSIE Lansdale. Couldn't get back across the bridge. \nJIM You... weren't here last night? \nGUSSIE They weren't letting anybody across that bridge, Mr. Blandings. (to Muriel) I passed the girls over at the Williams. They'll be along any minute. \nAs Jim reacts: \nMURIEL (quickly) Thank you, Gussie. You'd better get breakfast started. \nAs Gussie exits, Muriel turns to Simms. \nMURIEL Where were we? \nBILL We were at the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove. \nJIM Just a minute.

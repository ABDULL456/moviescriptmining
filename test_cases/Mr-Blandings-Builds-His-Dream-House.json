All right. I'll listen. \nBETSY (picking up her scrapbook) It's just twenty-four words. But in simple eloquence it mirrors a minor tragedy of our times. \nJIM (quietly) Well?... \nBETSY (reading) \"Forced to sell. Farm dwelling, oak grove, apple orchard, trout stream, hay fields, four barns, seclusion, superb view, original beams, paved highway, acreage... (with emotion) Will sacrifice...\" \nPause. \nJIM Go on. \nBETSY (simply) That's all. \nJIM That's all?! \nBETSY You don't see it, do you, father? \nJIM No. Fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper. What did you expect him to do, take it to the United Nations! \nMURIEL There must be more to it than that. (to Betsy) Isn't there, dear? \nBETSY Certainly, mother. What some people don't see is the whole sordid picture. A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the wall by hardship, soil erosion, mortgages, everybody gobbling, gobbling, gobbling, until finally, in desperation, he is \"forced to sell,\" and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspaper advertising. \nJIM (muttering) Oh, indeed... crass commercialism... advertising... \nJOAN (nose in her magazine) Miss Stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession. \nJIM (with extreme control) Oh, she does? \nJOAN Miss Stellwagon says that advertising makes people who can't afford it buy things they don't want with money they haven't got. \nJIM (elaborate sarcasm) Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right. Perhaps I ought to get out of this \"basically parasitic profession,\" which at the moment is paying for her very fancy tuition, those extra French lessons, her progressive summer camp and for that matter, the very braces on your teeth! \nMURIEL I wish you wouldn't discuss money in front of the children. \nJIM Why not, they spend enough of it! \nJOAN Bicker, bicker, bicker. \nAs Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the downstairs buzzer rings. Gussie enters, squeezes by Jim who automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g. \nGUSSIE Hello. Who? (calls) Miss Blandings, there's a Mr. Funkhauser wants to see you. \nMURIEL Funkhauser? (remembers) Oh, Mr. Funkhauser! \nGUSSIE That's what he says. \nMuriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied, reading his paper. Then she turns back to Gussie. \nMURIEL Uh -- better ask him to come up. \nGUSSIE (into phone) Says to come up. \nGussie hangs up, squeezes by Jim, exits into the kitchen. Pause. \nMURIEL (tentatively) Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's here. \nJIM (looking up) ...Who? \nMURIEL You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that clever young interior decorator we met at the Collins' cocktail party? \nJIM (distastefully) What's he doing here? \nMURIEL (nervously) Well, I imagine he's brought the -- uh -- estimates. \nJIM (blankly) ...Estimates? \nMURIEL (rapidly; to conceal a feeling of guilt) Darling, you know how long we've said we've got to do something about this apartment, and, well, he called last week, and I had him come over, and he's got some simply wonderful ideas! \nJIM (quietly) There couldn't be two Bunny Funkhausers, could there? \nMURIEL Why, no, dear. \nJIM Then this is the same clever young man who's responsible for that zebra- striped monstrosity in the Collins' living room? \nMURIEL That couch is terribly functional. \n", "test1_true": "SOUND of doorbell ringing. \nMURIEL Darling, please! (changing subject) Children, you'll be late to school. Run along and -- \nThe children rise, pick up their school paraphernalia. \nJOAN Miss Stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture -- \nMURIEL Never mind, dear. \nShe hustles Betsy and Joan toward the foyer as Jim rises. \nINT. FOYER \nGussie has just admitted Mr. Funkhauser. He is a tall, slender, effete-looking, young man. He is loaded down with sketches, samples of wallpaper, bolts of material. Betsy and Joan brush by him on their way out. \nFUNKHAUSER Good morning. \nTHE GIRLS (with a sharp appraising look) Hi. \nAs they rush out and the door closes, Jim and Muriel enter scene. \nMURIEL Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You remember Mr. Blandings? \nFUNKHAUSER But of course. \nHe sweeps by them into the living room, taking over completely. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nFUNKHAUSER You'll have to pardon my bursting in at this dreary hour -- (puts a sketch on a chair) -- practically the middle of the night -- (puts wallpaper against mantel) -- but I did so want to catch you in. I've been at it hammer and tongs all week and I'm just a mess -- (drapes bolt of chintz over high-backed chair) -- but then Muriel and I thought we ought to talk it over with you before we take the plunge... \nFunkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds flowing down in front. As Jim reacts: \nFUNKHAUSER (smoothing out folds on the chintz) After all, it's your home, too, and it should reflect you. You know, Man's Castle, all that sort of thing. \nJim looks down at the chintz. \nJIM (ominously) Muriel! \nMURIEL (quickly) Jim, just wait till you hear. He's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer. \nFUNKHAUSER Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the whole thing! I just couldn't live with it! I said to myself, \"Bunny, what are the Blandings? How shall we do them?\" And the answer was perfectly obvious. Very American, very grass roots, very blueberry pie -- that sort of thing. \nJIM (dark look at Muriel) Mm. \nFunkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully removes his hand. \nFUNKHAUSER Now first, let's dig into this living room of yours, it's really a dreary. \nMURIEL (quickly; to Jim) We want this room to be very gay, dear. Something in bright reds, yellows and greens. \nJIM (appalled) Red, yellow and green?! \nFUNKHAUSER Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not run away from color. \nJIM Not running away -- (a lame joke) -- just backing off a little. \nFUNKHAUSER Uh -- yes. (brightly) Now as I see our room, it's definitely Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench, breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, hooked rug. But everything in good taste. It must not jump out at you and scream: \"Look -- see how antique I am!\" \nJIM Heaven forbid. \nFUNKHAUSER Of course, these things take imagination. You've simply got to be able to visualize. \nJIM (politely, removing chintz) If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser, what I'd like to visualize -- at this dreary hour -- is how much is this all going to cost? \nFUNKHAUSER Well, really, I hesitate to say. After all -- (indicates) -- by the time this wall is out we may find -- \nJIM (reacting) This wall is -- what? \nFUNKHAUSER Out. Source of light is from the east. Obviously if our room is to have any function at all -- \nJIM You're going to tear out the wall?! \nMURIEL Dear, it's a wonderful notion. \nFUNKHAUSER Visualize three feet of leaded panes, the rest -- \nJIM Can you give me a figure? \nFUNKHAUSER Well! Costs aren't what they used to be, you know, and -- \nJIM Just a figure. \nFUNKHAUSER Materials are impossible, labor has just run wild -- \n", "test1_id": 2466, "test2_input": "JIM (appalled) Now?! \nBILL You've got ten days. \nJim gulps. Pause. \nJOAN For six thousand dollars we could have had a Solaxion house and a Crane Mobile home. \nJIM Muriel! \nMURIEL (herding the kids toward the door) Girls, say your good nights and off to bed without another word. \nBETSY (reluctantly) Good night, Mr. Simms. Uncle Bill. \nJOAN (protesting) Miss Stellwagon says the problems of the parents should be the problems of the children. \nMURIEL (shooing them out) You keep that in mind, dear. It'll help prepare you for motherhood. \nThe children exit. An embarrassed pause. \nSIMMS Perhaps we'd better let the plans go for the time being and -- \nJIM (weakly) No, Simms, I'll work this out. You go ahead with your final plans and let's see some estimates. \nMURIEL And we'll just forget about that extra bathroom. \nSIMMS (preparing to leave) Very well. You'll hear from me as soon as possible. Good night. \nGood nights are exchanged. Muriel takes Simms out of scene toward the door. CAMERA HOLDS on Bill and Jim. \nJIM (defeated) Six thousand dollars! \nBill looks at Jim with compassion. \nBILL What'll you do for collateral on your building loan? \nJIM I don't know, turn in my insurance policies or something. \nMURIEL (coming into scene) Now, Jim, you can't do that. \nJIM Why not? \nMURIEL What if something should happen? You can't leave the children unprotected. \nJIM (somewhat irritably) I'm not dead yet! And if I die, there's plenty left to take care of them. \nMURIEL Not if you cash in your policies. \nAs Jim reacts with painful resignation: \nBILL I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll see the boys at the bank. Maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral. If necessary, I'll sign a personal note. \nJIM (wearily) Thanks, Bill. \nBILL (paternally) And Jim, do me a little favor. The next time you're going to do anything, or say anything, or buy anything, think it over very carefully, and when you're sure you're right -- forget the whole thing. Good night, Muriel. \nHe goes to Muriel and kisses her on the cheek. Jim sees it, is annoyed. \nMURIEL Good night, Bill. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS Muriel and Bill to the door. He exits. Muriel comes back into the room. \nMURIEL What a wonderful friend. \nJIM (darkly) What's with this kissing all of a sudden? \nMURIEL What's that? \nJIM Just because a man is helpful in a business way, it doesn't give him extra-curricular privileges with my wife! \nMURIEL That's a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years! \nJIM (testy) Well, I don't like it. Every time he goes out of this house, he shakes my hand and he kisses you. \nMURIEL (sharply) Would you prefer it the other way around?! \nJIM (irritably) Well, I don't like it, that's all! Why is he always hanging around? Why doesn't he ever get married -- or something? \nMURIEL (assumed innocence) Because he can't find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as I am. \nJIM Well -- it -- it doesn't look right. There are limits to friendship and -- \nMuriel comes over, puts a sympathetic arm around him. \nMURIEL Darling, let's not be silly about this. It's not Bill, it's the house you're upset about. \nJIM (sigh) I suppose so. \n", "test2_true": "JIM Do you think it's worth all this? \nMURIEL Of course, darling. We're not just building a house -- it's a home. A home for ourselves -- and our children -- and maybe our children's children. \nJIM (whimsically) It's getting awfully crowded with only three bathrooms. \nThey look at each other, smile and kiss intimately, as we \nDISSOLVE \nINT. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJim and Muriel are watching Simms, who has just taken a typewritten sheet from his files. Simms looks at the sheet, turns to them a little apprehensively. \nSIMMS Well -- here are the estimates. Before you look at them, I think I'd better explain -- \nJIM Don't bother, Simms. (takes the sheet) I'm getting to be an old hand at this sort of -- \nJim is halfway into his chair as his eye catches the first bid. There is a sharp MUSICAL EFFECT as Jim bounces out of his seat. \nJIM Jumping H. Mahogany --!! \nThe CAMERA GOES IN for a CLOSE SHOT of the column of estimates. As the CAMERA IRISES DOWN ON each sum, there is a dissonant MUSICAL EFFECT. \nAntonio Doloroso, Builders  $32,117.00 Caries & Plumline  $30,500.00 Julius Akimbo & Co.  $28,575.00 Zach, Tophet & Payne  $24,250.00 John Retch & Son  $21,000.00 \nTHREE SHOT JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS \nTHREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel, and Simms. Muriel has read the column over Jim's shoulder. \nSIMMS Now obviously these bids are way out of line, that is, all except John Retch and Son at twenty-one thousand. \nMURIEL (reacting) Twenty-one thousand! \nSIMMS And with some judicious cutting, I think we can pare that down to eighteen. \nMURIEL We've only asked for the barest necessities -- \nSIMMS Frankly, with all the extras you two have -- \nJIM Never mind. (hands estimates to Simms) If you'll just send us a bill for your services, I'll see that it's taken care of. (takes Muriel's hand and starts for door) Now, if you'll excuse us. \nMURIEL Where are we going? \nJIM I am going out to get my head examined! Then, if I don't jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to find the owner of our building and sign a twenty-year lease! \nAs they are about to exit, they pause as their eyes are caught by a drawing on an adjacent drawing board. \nWHAT THEY SEE - A BEAUTIFUL PENCIL AND CHARCOAL DRAWING \nWhat they see - a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of their completed prospective house. Under it, in neat letters is printed: \nRESIDENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JAMES H. BLANDINGS \nJIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS. \nJim, Muriel, and Simms. They look at the drawing, then at each other. Jim's face softens. Muriel looks at him appealingly. \nJIM (quietly) What's the name of that contractor? \nDISSOLVE \nINSERT JIM'S COST CHART. The house rests on the diagonal line at the figure of $13,500. As the miniscule Jim and Muriel watch with apprehension, the small figures of Smith and Hackett are joined by Simms, John W. Retch, and several sub contractors, who put their collective shoulders to the house and push it past the Blandings and up to $31,000.00 \nDISSOLVE \nEXCAVATION - LOCATION #2 - EARLY SPRING - DAY \nA sign on a sawhorse - it reads: \nJOHN W. RETCH AND SON \nOver scene is the thunderous dissonance of the various SOUNDS that go into preliminary construction. A steam shovel in action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig. \nAs the CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see the machines and workmen at their various tasks. The scene has all the rustic peace of the invasion of Hollandia. \nThe ANGLE CHANGES, and we see Jim, Muriel, and Bill drive up the improvised driveway very close to the scene of activity. \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nJim and Muriel look at their property with unconcealed pride. Bill is interested but would like it better if there were less noise. \nJIM (shouting over noise) Well, things are certainly humming. \nBILL (same) What's that? \n", "test2_id": 2467, "test3_input": "JIM Where's Simms? \nWORKMAN Around back trying to figure out what to do about them windows. \nJIM What's the problem? You put windows up. \nWORKMAN Not these. They don't fit. \nJIM (angrily; control going) Oh, they don't, don't they? \nHe continues on toward the back of the house, the newspapers flapping beneath him. \nEXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY \nSimms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch hands Jim a sheaf of papers. \nRETCH Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look these over. \nJIM What's this about the windows? \nSIMMS (calmly) I'm afraid there's a little slip-up. These windows seem to belong to a Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York. I talked to Mr. Landings this morning. \nJIM Well, has he got mine? \nSIMMS No, he seems to have some windows that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of Peekskill. \nJIM Where are my windows?! \nSIMMS As near as we can figure out they've either been sent to a Mr. Benton in Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger of Phoenix, Arizona. \nBill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder. \nJIM What are we supposed to do -- live the rest of our lives in a house without windows? \nSIMMS It'll just be a matter of a few days. \nBILL What's a \"Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R\"? \nJIM How should I know? \nBILL (indicating) You've got one. \nJIM (reading from bill) \"Furnishing and installing one Zuz- Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and eighty dollars!\" (explosively) I will not have any such piece of equipment in my house! \nSIMMS I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr. Blandings -- to save your boiler and water pipes. \nJIM From what?! \nSIMMS Rust. The plumbing man assures us the water from your well is the most corrosive in his entire experience in the trade. \nBILL Another first! \nJIM (pursing his lips) Mm. (irritably) Well, if it's necessary, put it in! We're moving in today, you know and -- \nRETCH It's in. \nJIM Oh. (a final show of authority; sharply) Then get me the bill for it! \nBILL (indicating bill) You've got it. \nJIM All right then. \nAnd he stalks off, his papers, shavings, etc. flapping behind him. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe moving vans are driving away. \nINT. THE FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON \nA general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel, list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss painter. In the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant. \nMURIEL Now I want the living room to be a soft green. (PeDelford nods) Not quite as bluish as a robin's egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil buds. \nPEDELFORD Mm. \nMURIEL (handing him a sample) The best sample I could get is a little too yellow, but don't let whoever mixes it go to the other extreme and get it too blue. It should just be sort of a grayish yellow green. \nPEDELFORD (making a note) Mm-hmm. \nThey turn to the dining room. \nMURIEL Now the dining room I'd like yellow. Not just yellow, a very gay yellow. \nPEDELFORD Mm-hmm. \n", "test3_true": "PEDELFORD (making a note) Mm. \nMURIEL This is the paper we're going to use here in the foyer. (hands sample to him) It's flowered but I don't want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers. There are some little dots in the background, and it's these dots I want you to match. Not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom. Is that clear? \nPeDelford looks carefully at the sample, then: \nPEDELFORD (making note) Mm-hmm. \nMURIEL The kitchen's to be white. Not a cold, antiseptic hospital white -- a little warmer but not to suggest any other color but white. \nPEDELFORD (note) Mm. \nMURIEL Now for the powder room, I want you to match this thread. (hands him thread) You can see it's practically an apple red. Somewhere between a healthy Winesap and an unripened Jonathan. \nPEDELFORD (making note) Mm. \nThere is a crash from the kitchen. \nMURIEL Will you excuse me? \nMuriel hastily exits toward the kitchen. PeDelford turns to his assistant. \nPEDELFORD Got it, Charlie? \nCHARLIE (deadpan; indicating rooms with his thumb) Green, yellow, blue, white, red. \nPEDELFORD Check. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. PANTRY - OFF KITCHEN - DAY \nJoan is on a stepladder helping Gussie put away some dishes. Remains of two broken plates are on the floor below them. \nMURIEL Joan, you know father was to take care of the heavy dishes. \nJOAN He disappeared. I haven't seen him for an hour. \nBetsy flies into the room waving a railroad timetable. \nBETSY Where's Uncle Bill? I just checked the timetable -- he's going to miss his train. \nMURIEL If they've run off somewhere it certainly isn't very -- (suddenly stops, listens) \nFrom upstairs comes the SOUND of a steady, methodical thumping of a hand on a solid oak door. \nMURIEL Heavens! \nShe rushes for the door. \nQUICK DISSOLVE \nUPSTAIRS LANDING \nMuriel opens the closet door revealing Jim and Bill, who have been locked in the closet for the last hour. Each leans against the wall, arms folded, in an attitude of boredom and disgust. Without a word Jim and Bill exit from the closet. The three start down the stairs. \nJIM (darkly) I thought you were going to take care of it. \nMURIEL I thought you were. \nBETSY (from below) You're going to miss your train, Uncle Bill! It leaves Lansdale in twenty-five minutes. \nBILL Isn't there a later one? \nBETSY Not till the Commuter's Special tomorrow morning at six-fifteen. \nJIM You mean seven-fifteen. \nBETSY No, Dad, six-fifteen. \nJIM What about the seven-fifteen I'm supposed to take to the office every morning?! \nBETSY (consulting timetable) There's a little asterisk. The seven- fifteen only runs Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. \nJIM (taking timetable) Let me see that! (scans table, tightlipped) Muriel! \nMURIEL Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it wrong. \nJIM That's fine! For the rest of my life I'm going to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning to catch the six-fifteen, to get to my office by eight, which doesn't even open until nine -- and which I never get to until ten! \nMURIEL Perhaps if you started earlier you could quit earlier. \nJIM (sharply) So I could get home earlier to go to bed earlier to get up earlier! \nBILL Maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four-fifteen -- then you won't have to go to bed at all! \n", "test3_id": 2468}

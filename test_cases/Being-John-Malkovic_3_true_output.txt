Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth. 
CRAIG I'll tell you all about it when I get home. 
Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow. Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into his eyes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa." The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie them up. The safari men laugh. 
SAFARI MAN Well, there monkeys ain't going nowhere. Let's get us a couple a brews 'fore the boss comes back... 
The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals. 
CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE) Son, untie your mother and me! Quickly! Before the great bald chimp-men return. 
A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two speaks. 
CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE) Hurry, Elijah! 
SAFARI MAN Why you little bastard! 
Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her mouth. 
LOTTE Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent! 
Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks the cage, and dials the phone. 
LOTTE Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him! 
MAXINE (O.S.) (beat, calmly) Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon. 
LOTTE But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved. 
MAXINE (O.S.) I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken. 
Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone. 
LOTTE Hello, Dr. Lester? 
CUT TO: 
INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands there, dressed in an evening gown. 
MALKOVICH Come on in. 
MAXINE I can explain about the portal, darling. 
MALKOVICH Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court. 
MAXINE Oh shut up. (beat) Craig, darling are you in there? 
Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward, puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be against him will. 
MALKOVICH Yes. How did you know it was me? 
MAXINE Lotte called me. 
MALKOVICH Oh, so the bitch escaped. 
MAXINE Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now. 
MALKOVICH I'm getting better all the time. 
MAXINE I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it. 
MALKOVICH (as Malkovich) No... damn... you... (as Craig) Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit. 
Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig) laughs wildly.

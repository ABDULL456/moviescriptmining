It is almost a scream. 
We can hear Mark breathing quickly. 
Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her. 
Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big power switches go out in the roof. 
The lights go out. 
There is a scream in the darkness. 
Then silence. 
The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of Mrs. Stephens. 
A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger. 
HELEN'S VOICE (O.S.) And that, darling, is the end of the news! Unless you want the football results? 
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens, a large glass of whisky - and the bottle - beside her. It is night. 
MRS. STEPHENS No thank you. 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. 'She's Got the Key of the Door' is overlaid. 
HELEN What else can I read you? 
MRS. STEPHENS The label on this whisky bottle! Are you sure it says seventy per cent proof? 
HELEN Certain. 
MRS. STEPHENS They're bigger liars than the press! 
From Helen's POV WE SEE her reach for her glass with a steady hand. 
HELEN Is that your last tonight? 
MRS. STEPHENS I doubt it. 
HELEN Your last but one? 
MRS. STEPHENS Don't haggle. 
HELEN (producing a coin) Toss me double or nothing? 
MRS. STEPHENS Done! 
Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs. Stephens listens intently... the coin stops spinning. 
MRS. STEPHENS Heads. 
Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin. 
HELEN Bad luck, darling. 
MRS. STEPHENS Huh. 
She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side. Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully at the ceiling. 
MRS. STEPHENS What are you looking at? 
HELEN The ceiling! 
MRS. STEPHENS Wondering if that young man is home? 
HELEN Yes. 
MRS. STEPHENS Well he is... I heard him come in... four paragraphs ago. 
From Helen's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes staring at her. 
MRS. STEPHENS Do you like him? 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen. 
HELEN Yes, darling. 
MRS. STEPHENS Why? 
HELEN He has a quality... 
MRS. STEPHENS (sipping her glass) Wish this had. 
HELEN ... and I think he could help me. 
MRS. STEPHENS With your photographs? 
HELEN Yes... 
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. 
MRS. STEPHENS Helen... 
HELEN Yes? 
Mrs. Stephens hesitates - which is rare. 
MRS. STEPHENS (abruptly) It doesn't matter. 
HELEN (quickly) Mummy, what's worrying you? 
MRS. STEPHENS The price of whisky. 
HELEN What else? 
MRS. STEPHENS What else matters? 
HELEN Don't you like Mark? 
MRS. STEPHENS Haven't met him. 
HELEN You don't like him! Now why not? 
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Again she hesitates. 
MRS. STEPHENS I distrust a man who walks quietly. 
HELEN He's shy! 
MRS. STEPHENS His footsteps aren't! They're stealthy... 
HELEN Now darling. 
MRS. STEPHENS Are you going up to him? 
HELEN May I?

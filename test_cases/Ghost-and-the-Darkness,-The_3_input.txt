CUT TO 
A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING DARK NOW. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use at the bridge, not far from the baboon. 
PATTERSON You're positive lions hate baboons? (Samuel is) Pebbles? (Samuel holds up a bag) Let's get it over with. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, fifteen feet from the baboon. 
They help each other into position. Almost night. 
CUT TO 
THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into the darkness. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but irritation- 
CUT TO 
THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. 
They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries out. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. 
He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; only nervous energy is keeping him going now. 
CUT TO 
THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and frightening black clouds gather and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to hallucinate. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM. 
Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm. 
CUT TO 
THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, hallucinating again. 
CUT TO 
JUST BEFORE DAWN 
and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Firing- 
CUT TO 
-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and- 
CUT TO 
-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, turning back, ready to fire again- 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS- gone. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around. 
PATTERSON Where is it? 
SAMUEL (pointing down) Underneath. (beat) Somewhere. 
CUT TO 
WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run. 
They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we 
CUT TO 
EARLY MORNING LIGHT. 
Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson releases the baboon which races away. 
CUT TO 
WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away before them. 
CUT TO 
They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully... 
..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, making sure they miss nothing. 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.

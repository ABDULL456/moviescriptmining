ROGOZHIN (to Petrova) On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei. 
PETROVA Pust nie bezpokoitsa.    Ja ostrighu sebe noghti. 
ROGOZHIN Madame says not to worry.    She will not scratch you. 
HOLMES That's reassuring to know.    But -- 
PETROVA (to Rogozhin) Pochemu on kolebletsa? On nie nahodit menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi? 
ROGOZHIN Madame says you talk too much.    You find her attractive or no? 
Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson sticks his head in. He is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear. From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music. 
WATSON Excuse me. (to Rogozhin) What does prokanzik mean? 
ROGOZHIN It means 'You little devil.' 
WATSON It does?   I am? Thank you. 
He hurries off, shutting the door. 
ROGOZHIN (to Holmes) I repeat question. You find Madame attractive or no? 
Holmes is still looking at the door where Watson exited, an idea forming in his mind. 
HOLMES (turning to Rogozhin) Oh, I find her most attractive -- for a woman, that is. 
ROGOZHIN Then no problem. 
HOLMES Maybe a slight one.       You see, I am not a free man. 
ROGOZHIN Not free?   You are a bachelor. 
HOLMES A bachelor -- living with another bachelor -- for the last five years. Five very happy years. 
ROGOZHIN What is it you are trying to tell me? 
HOLMES I hoped I could avoid the subject. But some of us -- through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature -- 
ROGOZHIN Get to point. 
HOLMES The point is that Tschaikowski is not an isolated case. 
ROGOZHIN You mean, you and Dr. Watson -- ? (Holmes nods) He is your glass of tea? 
HOLMES If you want to be picturesque about it. 
PETROVA (slightly agitated) Chto on govorit? Pri chom tut Chaikovsky? 
ROGOZHIN On pederast. 
PETROVA (on her feet now; flaring) Jescho odin? Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno! Kakoi vi idiot! 
HOLMES (picking up his silk hat and cane) Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine. But I would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in Venice. 
He takes her limp hand, kisses it.   Then he crosses to the door. 
HOLMES (imitating Rogozhin's accent) It would have been catastrophe. 
He exits.   Rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass of vodka.   Petrova slaps the glass out of his hand. 
PETROVA (screaming) Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe, prezhde chem posoritj menia! 
STAGE 
The party has built into a real wingding by now. It's wild -- drinking, laughing, singing. Everybody is turned on -- especially Watson. He is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music. Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of breath -- he is in paradise. 
Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches Watson. 
HOLMES Watson! (Watson pays no attention) Watson, are you coming? 
WATSON (without missing a step) What is it, old boy? 
HOLMES We're going home. 
WATSON Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest -- not the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo. 
He waves goodbye, and goes on swirling dizzily with the girls. Holmes puts on his silk hat and leaves. 
A shaken Rogozhin comes up to the buffet, pours himself a stiff drink of vodka. As he drinks his eyes follow the dancing Watson balefully. 
Watson spins off several of the girls, grabs another group. His ex-partners wind up close to Rogozhin. He whispers something to them. Their eyes widen, and they stare at Watson with disbelief. Watson again switches partners, and the first girls now whisper intensely to those who just left the floor. The same reaction. Watson, oblivious to all this, is whirling around with another set of girls.

ED Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI! 
DOLORES I thought he was dead. 
Ed's eyes pop. 
ED No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice. 
DOLORES Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture. 
ED It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore. 
DOLORES So did you get his autograph? 
Ed calms down.  He smiles beatifically. 
ED No.  It wasn't like that at all.  It was just the two of us, and we were talkin'... and he treated me like -- a friend... 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY 
Ed is back in the plant department, arguing with his boss. 
RUDE BOSS He's a bum. 
ED No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"! 
RUDE BOSS Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work. 
ED That's not true -- 
RUDE BOSS He's so great, you hire him. 
ED (defensive) Well, uh, if I could I would... 
The guy takes a mocking face and struts out.  Ed glares. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BELA'S ROUSE - NIGHT 
It's Halloween night.  CHILDREN in trick-or-treating costumes parade up and down the streets.  Through Bela's window, we see him and Ed watching TELEVISION -- a small fuzzy screen in a huge console. 
INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
ON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays.  Bela's evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture. 
ON ED AND BELA 
They are entranced.  The men drink beers in silence.  Bela's TWO DOGS lie at his feet. 
ON THE TV 
The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess, a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress. 
She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set.  There is a pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween." 
VAMPIRA (on TV) Ooo!  Those eyes!  He gives me the willies!  The only thing scarier than him is this guy I dated last week: Charlie from Pittsburgh.  Boy, talk about the living dead... 
ON THE MEN 
Ed is disgruntled. 
ED Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect. 
BELA (glued to the TV) I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs. 
Ed LAUGHS.  Bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic hand gesture at the TV. 
BELA Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love. 
ED (fascinated by Bela's hand) Hey Bela, how do you do that? 
BELA You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. (back at the TV) Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes. 
Ed joins Bela in this activity.  The two of them wave their arms spookily at the TV. 
Bela becomes fatigued. 
BELA I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine. 
ED Do you want me to get it for you? 
BELA No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright. 
Bela smiles.  He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps behind a curtain.  Ed is puzzled.  Bela's thin arm appears and draws the curtain tight.  We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers opening and closing, and then silence. 
Ed sits, waiting. 
Behind the curtain, something DROPS.  We hear a muffled "Shit!" 
Ed is getting worried.  But then the curtain whips open, and Bela bounds out, grinning.  He's a bundle of energy. 
BELA I feel better now. 
AT THE DOOR 
The doorbell RINGS.  Kids SHOUT "Trick or treat!"  Bela jumps up gleefully. 
BELA Children!  I love children. 
Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and sticks them in his mouth. 
OUTSIDE 
Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle expectantly. 
Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count Dracula!  The real Count Dracula.  YEOWWWW!!!  The kids SCREAM and run. 
Bela chuckles.  Every kid is gone... except one TOUGH BOY. 
BELA Aren't you scared, little boy?  I'm going to drink your blood! 
TOUGH BOY Ehh, you're not a real vampire. You can't turn into a bat, and those teeth don't frighten me. 
Suddenly Ed lurches out, menacingly. 
ED Well how about these teeth?!! 
Ed RIPS HIS TEETH out of his head and thrusts them at the kid.  The boy SCREAMS in terror and races away.

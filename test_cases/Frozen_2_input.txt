E DAN It's the mountains.    It snows every night. Relax. 
The chair moves on in silence for a few moments. 
PARKER Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. (a few beats) I'm not even kidding. 
18   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                      18 Rifkin kicks his feet around. He spies Jason's discarded cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes. 
X Nothing. 
He sighs. 
Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few 
R minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him. 
A voice from the top lift cuts through the radio. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
A Last chair is through. 
Rifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain. 
RIFKIN Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm 
M clear. 
VOICE (O.C.) Clear up here. 
He hangs up and moves over to the lever. 
Tight on the lever as he pulls it back towards him. 
D 19   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                              19 The chair lurches to a stop. Once again, the comforting 
E white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them in silence. 
The wind blows hard against them. 
DAN Oh, come on. 
Parker instinctively grabs his hand. 
The cold bites through their layers of clothing. 
PARKER Bur! 
LYNCH (yelling to the sky) IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE!   NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU! 
They sit and wait in silence for a few seconds. 
X PARKER It's gonna start again, right? 
DAN (quickly) 
R Yes. (then) Anyone got any jokes? 
LYNCH 
A What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity? 
DAN "Get off me, you're crushing my 
M Marlboros". 
Beat. 
LYNCH I told you that? 
CUT TO: 
D 20   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER                         20 From this distance the mountain looks like a giant night- 
E light of converging white strings. 
Even in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over the trees. 
CUT TO: 
21   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 21 The three sit in the freezing chair.   Lynch is really getting impatient. 
DAN What do you think the worst way to die would be? 
PARKER That's not morbid. 
LYNCH Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan.

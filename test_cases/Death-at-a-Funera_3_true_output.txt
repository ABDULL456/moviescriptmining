JEFF A friend left them at my place. 
AARON What friend, Amy Winehouse? 
RYAN Wait, you're telling us that Elaine's boyfriend, who knocked over our father's coffin, had just one of these things... 
AARON 
(TO NORMAN) And you gave him how many? Norman looks a bit guilty. 
NORMAN Five. 
JEFF Five?! (looking at Frank) Poor bastard. 
NORMAN I thought they were Valium. They all turn and look at Frank who is looking back at them, increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having, and the pitying expressions on their faces. 
AARON Maybe we should call an ambulance. 
JEFF You can't do that. I'll go to jail. 
RYAN He's right. If anyone finds out this guy's been force fed acid, we could all be arrested. 
AARON So what then? What's going to happen? Is he going to die?! 
JEFF No... I don't think so... I doubt it.. Probably not...

CYNTHIA Aaron? 
INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS 
They all back away from the door. 
CYNTHIA (O.S. Are you in there? They look at each other in panic. 
RYAN Damn. 
AARON (as normal as possible) Be out in a minute, Mom. Ryan looks at Norman and Jeff. 
RYAN (to Norman and Jeff) Okay. We have to go out there. You two stay in here and watch him. Ryan closes the curtains. 
NORMAN Watch him?! What do you mean, "watch him"? 
RYAN Just make sure he doesn't escape. Lock the door behind us. We'll deal with him after the funeral. Aaron and Ryan open the study door leaving Norman and Jeff to take care of Frank. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Aaron and Ryan come outside trying to look as normal as possible. They see Cynthia standing with the reverend. 
AARON . How's it going, Mom? 
CYNTHIA Reverend Davis wants to talk with you. 
INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS 
Norman locks the door behind them. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Reverend Davis tries to remain cool, but she's agitated. 
REVEREND DAVIS Lookie here, brother. I've been patient. We all know it's a virtue, but I'm about done with patience. Now if we don't resume service soon, we're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation. 
AARON Sure. So sorry. Um... can you just give us another five minutes? The reverend doesn't look too pleased. 
REVEREND DAVIS Five minutes. 
CYNTHIA Is everything okay, boys? Ryan and Aaron kiss their mother and walk off.

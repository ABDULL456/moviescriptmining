VRONSKY Here's the train. 
EXT. PLATFORM, THE ARRIVING TRAIN, SAME TIME--DAY 
Vronsky moves closer to the slowing train, scanning the windows going by. 
EXT. PLATFORM ENTRANCE GATE, SAME TIME--DAY 
The Guards Officer and the Stationmaster are disconcerted to see the obvious "private coach" stop seriously short (or long) behind luggage wagons, etc. 
STATIONMASTER I'll see to it. 
He hurries away towards the engine. 
Oblonsky hurries through, relieved not to be late. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Vronsky is saluted by his mother's Major Domo, a tall man in livery with a cockade. 
MAJOR DOMO Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house. 
Vronsky nods, and makes his way towards the second coach, against the flow of disembarked passengers. 
EXT. TRAIN (ENGINE), SAME TIME 
The Stationmaster speaks to the Engine Driver. 
EXT. EXIT/ENTRANCE GATE, SAME TIME--DAY 
The Guards Officer with the bouquet stands uncertainly while arriving passengers go past him. 
EXT. "PRIVATE COACH," SAME TIME--DAY 
The Royal Austrian Honeymooners peer anxiously through the window. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Countess Vronsky remains sitting. Annushka packs away Anna's blanket and pillow. Anna looks out of the window. 
ANNA I'll come back. 
Anna moves to the door opening on to the "porch." Vronsky is on the point of entering. He steps back to allow her by. They barely exchange a glance as she passes him, but, simultaneously, each of them looks back. Anna looks away quickly. His look lingers before he turns away to enter the carriage. 
INT./EXT. PORCH--DAY 
Anna, from her vantage point spots Oblonsky, calls to him. Annushka, with her bag, comes onto the porch and descends to follow her mistress. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna steps down to the platform and embraces Oblonsky. They are delighted to see each other. 
ANNA (ACCUSINGLY) You don't look ashamed. 
OBLONSKY (CONTRITE) I am, I really am. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Countess Vronsky remains in her seat. Vronsky bends at the window, look- ing at Oblonsky and Anna. 
VRONSKY Yes, of course. Oblonsky's sister . . . Karenina. 
COUNTESS Charmante, don't you think? (to her Maid) Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca. 
She takes the dog. The Maid leaves with her bag. 
VRONSKY . . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear. 
VRONSKY I can't think what you're referring to, Maman. 
He glances back to the window, where Anna turns back to enter the train. 
EXT. PLATFORM, SAME TIME--DAY 
As Anna turns back, a Railwayman with a hammer for tapping wheels is in her way. He steps back for her with a bow and a "Madame!" Anna glances at him and moves past him. The man taps a wheel, making a ring- ing sound which means the wheel is okay. 
As Anna mounts the steps, a Train Guard looks up and down the plat- form, holding a green flag. 
INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME-- DAY 
Anna enters from the porch. 
ANNA There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him. 
VRONSKY Excuse me for not recognizing you before. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY We passed the time telling each other about our sons. 
ANNA Yes, I've been hearing all about you.

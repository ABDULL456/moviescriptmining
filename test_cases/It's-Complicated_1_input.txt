JANE (explains) Cooking scar.... From a very hot batch of caramel... 
ADAM Ooooo. What about that one? 
JANE That one's from boiling sugar...I wasn't very skilled in the beginning.    And that one is from a large French... 
Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar. 
JANE -- Saute pan. 
Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as Adam moves closer. 
ADAM Would it be okay if I...? 
Jane nods.    He kisses her great. 
ADAM I was going to say, kiss you. 
JANE I figured. 
ADAM If you feel this is in any way wrong because we're working together... 
JANE ... I don't ... 
He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and kiss again.

INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt and boxers. JANE Hey sleepy! What time did you get in? 
LUKE Have no idea. Lauren and Harley drove me home. 
LAUREN (joining) I'm surprised you remember that. 
JANE (turns to see Lauren) Hi. I didn't know you slept here. 
Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top, takes out a box of cereal. 
LAUREN We were playing Scattagories with Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell asleep on the couch. 
Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt. 
LUKE Sweet. 
HARLEY I got cold in the middle of the night. 
Lauren and Jane laugh. 
JANE Okay, who wants what? (noticing Gabby entering) Hi baby... GABBY (looks out the front window) What's Dad doing here? 
Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his Porsche. 
96   EXT. FRONT PORCH                                             96 Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are all open. 
JANE (quietly) Everything okay? 
JAKE I left Agness. 
JANE No, don't say that.

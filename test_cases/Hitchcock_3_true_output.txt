ON LEW, PEGGY AND HITCH 
standing together watching. 
LEW WASSERMAN I've seen happier faces on a school bus going over a cliff. 
PEGGY I told you it would be too much. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK But they can't stop looking, can they? 
He slurps his martini, sharing a smile with Lew. INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM - DAY 
Paramount President BARNEY BALABAN, 70s, ferocious, righteous, sits behind his impressive desk flanked by two CONSERVATIVELY-ATTIRED EXECUTIVES. 
Hitchcock and Wasserman sit across from them. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Audiences want to be shocked, Barney. They want something different. And this is it. 
He gestures to the untouched copy of "Psycho" in front of Balaban. 
BARNEY BALABAN The truth is, Hitch, every time you want to do something "different" like The Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses money. 
Hitchcock stares unblinking, giving nothing away. 
LEW WASSERMAN So we should stop trying to give them something new? 
BARNEY BALABAN You owe Paramount one last picture, Hitch. Can't you do something like North by Northwest but for us this time instead of for MGM? 
Hitch's stare remains inscrutable. 
BARNEY BALABAN (CONT'D) We've offered you dozens of perfectly good properties. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (IMPERIOUSLY) "Psycho." 
Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare. The Paramount executives shift uncomfortably. 
BARNEY BALABAN No one respects the name Hitchcock more than Paramount. But even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Are you telling me "no?" 
Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front. 
BARNEY BALABAN I think you know me better than that, Hitch. I would never say "no" to you. 
Hitch's suppressed rage is building...but Balaban says nothing. 
EXT. PARAMOUNT COURTYARD - DAY 
Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy courtyard past Hitch's office. 
LEW WASSERMAN What a putz. You know what his family did before they built those movie palaces? Ran a grocery store. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK My father ran a grocery store. 
LEW WASSERMAN Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He should show some respect. 
Hitch turns to Lew. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK They think I've lost my touch, Lew. My association with television has cheapened me. 
LEW WASSERMAN Are you referring to that deal I got you where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine grand an episode and you own the negative? That's my kind of cheap. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK They just want the same thing over and over. They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid. 
Lew puts a comforting hand on him... 
LEW WASSERMAN Hitch, I will never let that happen. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Hitch doesn't respond, Lew sensing the true depth of his friend's melancholy. 
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) How much do you think you can make this picture for? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Eight hundred thousand... Give or take. 
Lew digests the figure... 
LEW WASSERMAN I have whisky in the car. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, SWIMMING POOL - A FEW DAYS LATER 
ALMA does afternoon laps in the pool. A contemplative Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black sunglasses and a business suit. He watches Alma a moment. Finally she notices him.

TOYOTA PRIUS-DAY 2 \nIt's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to \"Love Rhino,\" the song heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout gear. She is always wearing all black. \nJESSE I'm a Love Rhino... \nCELESTE JESSE Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please... oh shit, I gotta take this. Turn it down. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) ...I'm a Love... \nCELESTE Jess, turn it down, seriously! \nShe playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down. More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I can do it now. No, it'll be fast, right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to give a quick sound bite for the New York Times, so no noise please? For a second? \nJESSE Maybe. I may have an important call coming in too, so... \nThey both know he has no important call coming in. \nCELESTE (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort. \nCeleste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Jess, just go around him! (To the phone) Sorry. (MORE) \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Consumers will be less likely to go out for entertainment. \nWhile Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts looking through the middle console. He finds something. A melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and signals to him, \"Can I have a drag?\" \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual wear and cookbooks will see a huge spike in the market. \nHe hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the window. \nJESSE What the shit?? \nCELESTE (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone call.(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right? \nJesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He then looks at his teeth. \nJESSE Does this tooth look dark? \nCeleste just glares at him. \nCELESTE Okay. Call me back if they need more. \nJesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror. \nJESSE Like a little darker than the rest? \nCeleste waves her hand to quiet Jesse. \nCELESTE Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking! \nJESSE I wasn't smoking, I just found it. \nJESSE Oh yeah. No. They haven't called yet. But if they don't think I'm the right artist to illustrate the book, then it's not the right job for me. You know what I mean? \nCELESTE I absolutely do, yes. You are a wonderful artist. But at some point, you will show the world that one day...right? \nJESSE Hey, can I drop you at home now? Because I just missed a wave. \nCELESTE Well... \nJESSE Wait! I just missed another one. \nCELESTE Yeah. Take me home, it's fine. \nCUT TO: \n4 INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-30 MINUTES LATER 4 \nJesse is dropping Celeste at home. \nCELESTE Be back by six so you can shower. \nJESSE Why shower? \nCELESTE Dinner with Beth and Tucker. \nJESSE Right, right. \nCELESTE Have fun shredding your glassy peel. \nJESSE Aw, so wrong. \nCELESTE Love you. \nJESSE Love you too. \nHe promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature \"C and J\" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off. \n5 INT. LITTLE DOM'S-NIGHT 5 \nCeleste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite, and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way. These are their best friends from college. They're engaged. \nTUCKER Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week? \nJESSE Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band. (MORE) \nJESSE (CONTD) They're loud but they're affordable. \nCELESTE They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight. \nBETH It's already done. We got the best swing band in New England. Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod. \nTUCKER I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing is so late 90's, honey. \nBeth leans over a gives him a deep kiss. She knows how to work him. \nBETH I love you. We'll talk about this later. \nCeleste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesse's next interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, which is hilarious--only to them. \nCELESTE So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight? \nJESSE Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring. \nCELESTE I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs. \nJESSE Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh we doooooo! \nCELESTE Yawh!!!! \nCeleste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a little too long. Then, there is a deafening lull in the conversation. Beth is buttering a piece of bread. She loudly drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her hands. \nBETH I can't do this. I just can't. \nCeleste is genuinely concerned about her friend. \nCELESTE Are you okay? Oh no... \nBETH It's just not right. I can't hold my tongue. We can't do this anymore. \nCELESTE Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine! \nCELESTE Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way. \nJESSE Got it. \nCELESTE Night. \nJESSE Night. Love you. \nCELESTE Love you too. \n8 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING 8 \nCeleste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4 neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does the \"C and J\" sign to Celeste. She does it back instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine. \n9 INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9 \nCeleste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black. She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line, waiting to order. \nCeleste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of the line. He orders. \nBUSINESS MAN Large coffee, please. \nCELESTE Excuse me, sir? \nThe business man pretends to not hear her. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Sir? You? \nShe taps him on the arm. He turns around. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) You do realize that you just cut in front of a lot of people. \nBUSINESS MAN Oh. Sorry, I didn't know. \nCELESTE Did you not? \nBUSINESS MAN I'm in a rush. \nCELESTE So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so... \nOther people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants to let it go, but she can't. \nBUSINESS MAN Well, she was looking at the pastries, I didn't think she was ready to order. \nCELESTE Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's. \nThe business man gets his coffee. \nBUSINESS MAN Have a nice day. \nCELESTE (sotto) Prick. \n10 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-MORNING 10 \nPop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other. \nCeleste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live satellite interview for MSNBC. \nCELESTE American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap. \nCUT TO: \n11 INT. MSNBC STUDIOS 11 \nRachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio. \nRACHEL MADDOW Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot? \nCELESTE I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics. \nRACHEL MADDOW Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks for being with us today. You're great, come back any time. For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book \"Shitegeist,\" on bookshelves Monday. \nCELESTE Thanks so much, Rachel. \n12 INT. SCOTT'S OFFICE-AFTERNOON 12 \nSCOTT, 40, Celeste's partner, gay but very straight, sharply dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk. Celeste enters. \nCELESTE So I had dinner with the drama club last night. \nJesse looks uncomfortable. \nJESSE That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way. \nSKILLZ Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her. \nJESSE Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up. \nSKILLZ Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle. \nJESSE Huh? \nSKILLZ Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit. \nJESSE It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody. \nThey reach the front of the line. \nYOGURT GIRL Do you know what you want? \nJESSE Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please. \nSKILLZ (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here. \nYOGURT GIRL Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together. \nJESSE Well...we're separated. \nYOGURT GIRL Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go. \n14 INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON 14 \nCeleste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to take in a Cindy Sherman photo. \nBETH It's so...grotesque. \nCELESTE But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way. \nBETH Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings. \nCeleste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien Hirst collage. \nBETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) I need to say this and then I'll never bring it up again. I'm sorry I wigged on you guys the other night but I don't know what you're doing. I think it's stupid that you're not together. You are best friends and that's the hard part. Nothing else matters. \nCeleste and Beth stand in silence. Then: \nCELESTE Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend. \nBETH Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly. \nCELESTE Jesse is fine. \nBETH Can I show you something? \nCELESTE Sure. \nBeth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art. \nBETH Okay. Look. \nShe points to her neck. \nCELESTE What am I looking at? \nBETH It's a hair. On my NECK. \nCELESTE Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck? \nBETH I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it. \nCELESTE Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip. \nBETH Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine. \nCELESTE Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake. \nBETH I should, at least before my wedding, right? \nCELESTE What is wrong with you? \nJESSE What? Oh. I don't know, is it weird? \nCELESTE Not weird, just different from how it looks best. \nShe walks over and starts messing with his hair as he continues. \nJESSE Anyway, this is what we're doing right? We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people? That's what we're doing? \nShe is satisfied with her work. She steps back. \nCELESTE There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice. \nJESSE Okay mom. \nCELESTE Call me after? \n16 INT. HATFIELD'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 16 \nJesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't been doing a lot of talking. \nYOGURT GIRL So I was in school but then I dropped out because I really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship? So I went back to school and now I work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm really looking to make money doing something I love? But I'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know? \nCUT TO: \n17 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 17 \nCeleste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that. Would he? \n18 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING 18 \nAgain, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines. This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks' new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be. Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head, \"yeah, I get it.\" She turns it off. \nCeleste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally, a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He is alone. Phew. \n19 INT. BORDER'S BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY 19 \nCeleste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for books. \nCELESTE Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases... \nCeleste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading \"More New Releases.\" Three copies of her book, \"Shitegeist\" appear in the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's what I call placement. \nShe grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the front of the store. \nBETH Well you probably shouldn't steal it. Even if it is yours. \nCeleste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly replaces the center display book with her own. \nCELESTE There. \nBETH But you don't have the \"O\" on your cover, you can't do that! \nCELESTE Yes I can. \nJesse and Tucker arrive and see the book. \nJESSE There you guys are...you're on Oprah's Book List?? That's so great! \nSomething catches Celeste's eye. \nCELESTE Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ... \nCeleste, Tucker and Beth head off. Then: \nGIRL (V.O.) Jesse? \nJesse turns to see VERONICA, 26, stunning and European. \nJESSE Veronica? \nVERONICA Yeah, hey. How are you? \nJESSE Good, good. You look great. \nVERONICA Thanks, you too. How's your clothes pin collage going? \nJESSE Slowly, but it's going. \nJESSE Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right? \nTIME CUT TO: \n22 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE- 30 MINUTES LATER 22 \nJesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was earlier. Crying, frustrated. He's covered in sawdust and nuts and bolts. \nJESSE Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you??! \nCELESTE Thank you! \nJESSE Wait. I got it. \nTIME CUT TO: \n23 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE- 30 MORE MINUTES LATER 23 \nWe see Jesse and Celeste admire their \"dresser\" as they drink wine. \nCELESTE Perfect. \nJESSE Fucking lay-up. \nWe reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the floor in satisfaction. They look at their \"artwork.\" They laugh; they are pretty drunk. \nCELESTE Ruscha meets Basquiat... \nJESSE ...meets Serra meets Corky from \"Life Goes On.\" \nCELESTE Yeah. He's a vegan, you know. \nJESSE Cherish. That is so cute. \nThey share a laugh. \nCELESTE You're cute. \nCeleste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets hotter. They fall back. \nFADE TO: \n24 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 24 \nCeleste and Jesse are in bed. Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes her up. She is hungover and confused. \nCELESTE Hey. What are you doing? \nJESSE I love you. \nCeleste does not respond. She pops up out of bed. \nCELESTE Okay... \nJESSE We should talk about this. \nCELESTE Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry. \nJESSE Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you. \nCELESTE Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people! \nJESSE Only to...god, I'm so stupid. \nHe realizes how pathetic it sounds. \nCELESTE Oh no, I thought... \nJESSE You thought what? \nCELESTE Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think... \nCeleste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up and leaves. He turns. \nJESSE You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot. \nCELESTE Jess! No, I didn't..Jess! \nCeleste collapses back in the bed. \n29 INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT 29 \nCeleste watches CNN alone. She dials Jesse. It rings. \nCUT TO: \n30 INT. DOWNTOWN L.A. DINER-LATE AFTERNOON 30 \nJesse is mid-laugh and looks at his phone to see Celeste is calling. He presses \"Ignore.\" We see that he is sitting with a women. We reveal that it is: Veronica. \nVERONICA I'm glad you called. \nJesse smiles big. \nCUT TO: \n31 INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT 31 \nCELESTE Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye. \nShe hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself: \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I love you. I'm so sorry. I've always loved you. \nShe chuckles. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Of course. Stupid. \n32 EXT. STREET - WEST HOLLYWOOD-DAY 32 \nJesse is walking. \nJESSE (on the phone) Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you. \n33 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-SUNDOWN 33 \nCeleste is in her home office, working on the Riley account. \nCELESTE Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese? \n34 EXT. STREET-WEST HOLLYWOOD-SUNDOWN 34 \nJESSE Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important. \nCUT TO: \n35 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-NIGHT 35 \nCeleste puts away groceries. \nJESSE Okay. I have to tell you something. \nCELESTE Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay? \nJESSE No, not gay. \nHe takes a really deep breath. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Um, you're not gonna believe this but... \nCELESTE (playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date? \nJESSE I'm having a baby. \nCELESTE I don't understand. \nJESSE I'm having a baby. \nCeleste is still busy, putting away groceries. She is half- listening. \nCELESTE What do you mean? \nJESSE I am having a baby. \nCeleste opens the pantry and puts away cereal. \nCELESTE With another person? \nJESSE Yes. With another person. \nCELESTE Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy. \nSCOTT Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was seeing someone? \nCELESTE It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago. (MORE) \nCELESTE (CONTD) And now he's \"making it work\" with her. Plane crash. \nSCOTT I don't know what to say. I am so sorry, Celeste. \nCELESTE No need, Scott, I'm totally fine. \nSCOTT Are you? \nCELESTE Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him. \nSCOTT Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings. It's very sudden. \nCeleste pauses to consider this. \nCELESTE Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier. \nScott is not convinced. Celeste is still distracted by the computer. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh my god, Diddy's snowboarding for the first time in Mammoth! Amazing. I actually have a date tonight. \nSCOTT Um...that's great. Who's the guy? \nCELESTE The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired. \nSCOTT I agree, go be admired. Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion. \n38 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-EARLY EVENING 38 \nCeleste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. She keeps walking. \n39 INT. MADEO'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 39 \nCeleste and MAX, 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at dinner. They have just ordered. \nCELESTE Thank you. \nShe hands the menu back to the waiter. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) My foot actually pronates. And my I.T. band is strained when I run, which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar recommended a foot specialist who made these customized orthotics for me and it's amazing how much better I feel. \nMAX Well, actually I... \nSuddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this. \nCELESTE OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward.(to Max) You should probably leave. \nMAX Wait, what? I don't think...really? \nCELESTE Yeah, just go. \nJesse is at the table. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Too late. Here he is, heyyyy. \nJESSE I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse. \nCELESTE Oh, this is Matt. \nMAX Max. \nCELESTE Mack. \nMAX Max. \nJESSE Nice to meet you, Max. \nCELESTE We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating. \nJESSE Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get. \nMAX Good to know. I ordered that. \nA moment of awkward silences passes. \nCELESTE Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice. \nCeleste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman approaches. \nSALESWOMAN I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women. So if you could maybe just sit over there? \nThe saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable looking chair. \nCELESTE Right. Sorry. Totally. \nBETH Wow, you are a sweat tsunami. \nCELESTE You should get it. It's really pretty. \nCeleste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage. \nBETH Uh boy. \nCELESTE Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily. \nBETH Okay. I guess I'm getting it. \n43 INT. H.D. BUTTERCUP-SALES COUNTER-DAY 43 \nThe saleswoman is ringing Beth up for the couch. It is basically ruined. \nCELESTE The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped. \nBETH It's great you're staying busy... \nCELESTE (about the couch) If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered. \nBETH Thanks. How's dating? \nSALESWOMAN Sorry, can I get your card? \nBETH Here you go. \nCELESTE Great. Dating's really great. \nBETH Have you talked to Jesse? \nCELESTE No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat. \nBETH I think he's been looking pretty fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can I get a rush delivery on that? \nCELESTE So you've seen Jesse? \nBETH ...Yeah, I have. \nCELESTE Huh. Have you hung out with... \nBETH Veronica? \nCELESTE Yeah. \nBETH Yes. I have. \nSilence. \nSALESWOMAN So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon. Does that work for you? \nBETH Yeah, that's fine. If you can you just call my cell... \nCELESTE She's dumb, right? \nBETH Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple. \nCELESTE Simple means dumb. \nBETH No, actually, simple in a really elegant way. \nCELESTE Elegant?? \nThe saleswoman senses awkwardness. \nSALESWOMAN Okay, so you're all set then. \nCELESTE Elegant?? \nRiley looks closer at her skin and picks at it. \nRILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) Why am I breaking out? \nSAVANNAH Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol? \nRILEY Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime. \nCELESTE Um...it's actually regimen? \nRILEY Sorry? \nCELESTE Regime is a system of government. It's a \"skin regimen.\" \nRiley and Savannah glare at Celeste. \nRILEY Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you. \nThey leave. \nCELESTE Charming. \nCUT TO: \n47 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-AN HOUR LATER 47 \nThe Riley Banks branding strategy meeting is under way. Slides are being shown, Scott is giving a presentation on design ideas. Celeste is distracted and on her Blackberry. We see an INSERT of Celeste's Blackberry on Dictionary.com, looking up \"regime: a mode or system of rule or government.\" \nSCOTT Celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great. \nHe looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) (CONTD) Celeste? Do you wanna... \nCELESTE Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork... \n48 INT. CELESTE'S OFFICE-AN HOUR LATER 48 \nScott enters. \nSCOTT Hello, Special One. \nCELESTE Uh, you got my IM. \nSCOTT Sounds so awful. \nCELESTE Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody. \nScott has an idea. \nSCOTT Wait, wait. You've never met Nick, right? Nick Moran? \nCELESTE The photographer? You know him? \nSCOTT Yeah, we went to school together. This could be perfect. \nCELESTE (she sings, like she's in a musical) I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating. I don't like any of iiiiiit. \nSCOTT (he sings back) Trust meeeee. You will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love cooo-ooock. \nCELESTE You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott. \n49 EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT BALCONY- NIGHT 49 \nCeleste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. He's hip and smart in an effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and laugh. \nCELESTE So you pissed in your pants? \nNICK I waited seven hours. Three of them soaking in my own pee. But I finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad. \nHe hands her a photograph. \nCELESTE Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe. \nNICK He is. I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh. \nCELESTE Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me. \nNICK I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I didn't win. \nWAITRESS We have decaf green tea. \nCELESTE Water's fine. \nWAITRESS K. Anything for you? \nJESSE I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu? \nShe hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh. Awesome. You do have the Baltic kelp today. I'll get that. Thanks. \nCELESTE Wow. \nJESSE How are you? You look great. \nCELESTE Thanks. \nShe notices his feet. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Are you wearing...dress shoes? \nJESSE Oh yeah, they're vegan. \nCeleste could throw up. \nCELESTE You look good too. \nJESSE A lot of pilates. \nCELESTE Huh, I didn't know you did pilates. \nJESSE Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so... \nThere is an uncomfortable beat. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) How's work? \nCELESTE Um...work is great. \nJESSE Good. \nCELESTE My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well. \nJESSE Great. \nLong silence. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Listen, I know this has all been pretty weird. \nCELESTE It's only weird if you think it's weird. \nJESSE Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you. \nCELESTE Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up. \nJESSE Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so.. \nCELESTE What? Where's she from? \nJESSE Uh, Belgium. \nCELESTE (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant. \nJESSE What? \nCELESTE Nothing. \nJESSE Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers. \nCELESTE Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life. \nJESSE I'm sorry. I know. \nCELESTE What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through? \nJESSE I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work. \nCELESTE Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is. \nCELESTE Hey! \nJESSE What...are you doing? \nCELESTE I just... \nShe looks around to make an excuse. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Um...came over to drop off some of your stuff. \nJESSE But why were you in the trash can? \nCELESTE I lost something. \nJESSE In the trash can? \nCELESTE My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now. \nJesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat. \nJESSE You've met Veronica, right? \nCELESTE Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater. \nVERONICA Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you bleeding? \nCELESTE What? Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah, I guess I am. \nVERONICA Let me get you something for that. \nCELESTE NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut. \nVERONICA Are you sure? I'm so sorry about this. \nCELESTE No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight. \nVERONICA You sure you don't want to come in for a drink? \nCELESTE Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay. \nShe starts to walk away with the journal. \nJESSE Is that mine? \nCELESTE Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go. \nShe laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste walks to her car. \n65 INT. POP FORM-CELESTE'S OFFICE- NEXT DAY 65 \nCeleste listen to her work messages on speakerphone as she Instant Messenger's with Beth. Celeste writes \"I went through Jesse's trash last night. Oh no.\" Beth writes back, \"I'm coming to your office right now.\" \nPAUL (V.O.) Hey. Celeste. It's Paul. The cereal killer? There's this yoga retreat in Tulum that I just got an e-mail about...uh, that's not why I'm really calling. I just like you. Call me back if you want to drink some cold beer with me. 310 864- \n66 EXT. POP FORM COURTYARD- 30 MINUTES LATER 66 \nCeleste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich, recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her face is neatly bandaged. \nBETH You told her you liked her sweater? What are you, twelve? \nCELESTE It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind? \nBETH Maybe. No. Please no more trash- diving. Let's focus on you now. \nCELESTE This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know... \nBETH C, you never know. Just go out with him. It doesn't have to be perfect... \nCELESTE I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym. \nBETH Just go. Nothing to lose. \nCUT TO: \n67 INT. PHO SIAM THAI MASSAGE-NIGHT 67 \nCeleste is lying in a quiet, dark room in thai fisherman pants and a large t-shirt. She takes a deep breath. \nCELESTE So where do you live? \nThey smile at each other. \nCUT TO: \nECU OF \nJesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly. \n70 EXT. FAIRFAX HIGH- CHEERLEADING PRACTICE-DUSK 70 \nJesse, Skillz and Tucker are taking in a high school cheerleading practice, drinking tall boys and smoking cigs. Despite their ragtag appearance, do not be fooled...They are very loyal and knowledgable supporters. \nSKILLZ Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming up...degree of difficulty 9. Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, Becky!!! \nJesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at \"Veronica and Jesse Baby Registry\" \nJESSE What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn? \nSKILLZ It's a very, very tiny Swedish man. \nTUCKER It's a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller. Duh. \nJESSE Why do you know that. \nTUCKER Beth. We go to a lot of baby showers. \nSKILLZ I put a lot of babies in the ladies. \nA parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse is still going through the registry list. \nJESSE Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby. (beat) How's Celeste? \nSKILLZ She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her cannibus levels right now, just trying to find the right balance. \nJESSE Celeste doesn't smoke pot. \nSKILLZ She does now. She loves it. \nJesse takes this in. Tucker changes the subject. \nTUCKER How's Veronica? She's so sweet. \nJESSE Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones. \nTUCKER But are you into it? \nJESSE Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby. \n\"California Love\" by Tupac (or whatever song we clear) comes on and the cheerleaders start a routine. \nSKILLZ MY JAM! \nSkillz stands up and starts breaking it down. He's not that good. Committed though. Jesse and Tucker continue to talk. \nTUCKER Are you scared? \nJESSE A little. Yes. \nTUCKER That's great. You should be. Just keep saying \"yes.\" I'm really proud of you. \nSkillz looks at his cell phone. He shows Jesse a text from Celeste that reads, \"I need green. Now.\" \nSKILLZ She's like my top client now. \n71 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-LATE NIGHT 71 \nCeleste is home from her date with Paul and is now obsessing on Jesse's Facebook page. His status reads \"in a relationship.\" She's drunk and this makes her sad. Oh, there's a video. It's of Jesse and Veronica. Jesse presents Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles. They kiss. Crushing. Confusing. Her doorbell rings. \nCUT TO: \n72 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-A COUPLE MINUTES LATER 72 \nThe door opens to reveal Skillz. He holds up a bag of weed. \nSKILLZ Step out of the shadows and into the light. Are you crying? \nCELESTE I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free. \nSKILLZ What? \nCeleste bursts in with all types of nervous energy. \nCELESTE The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and... \nRILEY Just, shut up for a minute. \nRiley is in tears. \nRILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) I just found out my boyfriend cheated on me. \nCELESTE Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. \nRILEY Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that. \nRiley is clearly destroyed. \nRILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) I didn't know who to call. \nCeleste gives Riley a big hug. \nCELESTE So you called the smartest person you know. \nRiley smiles through her tears. \nCUT TO: \n87 INT. RILEY'S HOUSE- HOLLYWOOD HILLS-LATER THAT NIGHT 87 \nRiley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her. Celeste is up, watching \"Great Sports Moments of 2008\" on ESPN Classic. \nIt is a recap of Matthias Steiner's Olympic weight lifting triumph after his wife died. Jesse's favorite. Celeste is crying. This wakes Riley up. \nRILEY Are you crying? \nCeleste turns off the television. \nCELESTE Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone. \nRILEY A guy? \nCELESTE Yeah. A guy. \nRILEY You miss him? \nCELESTE Yeah, I do. \nRILEY They all fucking suck. \nCELESTE Kind of. \nRILEY So it never gets better? \nCELESTE No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine. \n88 INT. DRY CLEANER'S-MORNING 88 \nCeleste is runs into a dry cleaners. She is out of breathe. The long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather who has broke the silence. She looks at her watch. She stands diligently in line. \nCeleste's phone rings loudly. She picks it up. \nCELESTE Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too. \nShe hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something. Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic woman in front of her. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I'm so sorry but I am the maid of honor and I am supposed to be at the wedding real far away, would you mind if I just got in front of you?... \nThe woman reluctantly waves her to pass. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Thank you so much, I really do appreciate...sir? \nA disinterested man barely acknowledges Celeste. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I'm incredibly late for this wedding and my dress is here, is there any way... \nHe moves aside. The next man just stares at her. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hi. I'm sure you heard me ask the last guy but... \nThe camera pulls out. A wide shot of Celeste, imprisoned by her own rules, asking every person to cut. It looks tedious and ridiculous. \nCELESTE You know what else is beautiful? \nCeleste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have done many times. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh god, tug it. \nJesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the creme fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin. \nJESSE Aw yeah! Fuck! \nJesse and Celeste are in hysterics. Just then, Veronica arrives. \nVERONICA Jesse? \nJESSE Hey. \nCeleste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught. \nVERONICA What are you doing? \nJESSE What? Nothing. We're just... \nHe looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy to explain. \nCELESTE Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know... \nCeleste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up and realizes how dumb this must seem. \nVERONICA I don't get it. \nCeleste and Jesse stop. \nCELESTE It's stupid. \nVeronica is looking at Celete's food. \nVERONICA Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See you on the dance floor? Watch out for Tucker though. \nThey leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into the carrot. \n94 INT. WEDDING TENT-LATER 94 \nWe see a raucous wedding dance floor. Everyone's dancing: Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica, Scott, etc. They are doing wedding dances. Celeste sits at her table, watching with a smile. It is bittersweet for her. She drinks a martini. Alone. \n95 INT. PAUL'S CONDO-NIGHT 95 \nCeleste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine. \nPAUL (keeping score on a notepad) So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so... \nCELESTE Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name! \nPAUL Are you challenging or not? \nCELESTE Yes, I definitely am. \nPAUL Well, I will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go. (he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself. \nCeleste finds the word, reads the definition and silently accepts defeat. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD) Ha ha! I go again. \nCELESTE I've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life. \nPAUL Well, nothing lasts forever. \n96 INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM- LATER 96 \nCeleste and Paul are making out on the couch. \nPAUL I'm so sorry I beat you in Scrabble. \nCELESTE No you're not. \nPAUL You're right, I'm not. \nThe making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive. \nCELESTE Will you get a condom? \n98 EXT. RUNYON CANYON-MORNING 98 \nCeleste is hiking alone on the phone, energized. \nCELESTE Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market. \nSCOTT Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around. \nCELESTE We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge! \nJust then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self- consciously. \nMONTAGE OVER SHUGGIE OTIS' \"INSPIRATION INFORMATION\": \nA98 SHOT OF CELESTE, PAUL, BETH AND TUCKER EATING DINNER AT A98 LOTERIA MEXICAN RESTAURANT. PAUL IS TELLING A STORY-HE IS ANIMATED AND CONFIDENT. CELESTE LOOKS AT HIM, SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED. A MOMENT LATER, BETH AND TUCKER ERUPT IN LAUGHTER.

TARGET-AFTERNOON 99 \nCeleste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a salesperson. \nSALESMAN So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble. \nCELESTE Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up. \nSALESMAN Lemme go ask my manager. \nCELESTE Thanks, dude. \nCeleste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff. She approaches her. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Veronica? Hey, Celeste. \nVERONICA Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing? \nCELESTE Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You? \nVERONICA Oh, you know getting... \nVERONICA (CONT'D) CELESTE Baby stuff. Baby stuff. \nVERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD) Beth is uh...throwing me a baby shower? So I have to register. \nCELESTE She is? \nCeleste swallows this. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's uh...really nice. \nVERONICA Very. And so helpful right now. \nCELESTE Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized. \nVERONICA Organized, terrified. \nCELESTE You'll do great. \nVERONICA Thanks. I hope so. \nThey share an awkward moment. \nVERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD) Listen, I never got a chance to just tell you I'm so sorry about all this. Trust me, I didn't expect... \nCELESTE No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash. \nCeleste laughs. \nVERONICA Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast. \nCELESTE Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out... \nVERONICA He's so talented. \nA beat. \nCELESTE Yeah, he is. \nCELESTE What? \nPAUL You're only ready when you're ready, you know? Don't force it. It's just some yoga shit. \nCELESTE Thanks. \nPAUL But I do like you. I like you a lot. And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me. \n101 INT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 101 AFTERNOON \nCeleste and Jesse sit across from each other with their respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks: \nCELESTE'S LAWYER Sign here. And here. And here. \nCeleste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles uncomfortably. \nCELESTE'S LAWYER (CONT'D) (CONTD) And here. Here. Yup. Aaaaaand here. Here. Couple more. Here... \nCeleste is still signing. She looks at Jesse again, who is straightening his tie. \nCELESTE I like that tie. \nJESSE Oh, thank you. \nCELESTE'S LAWYER One more here. \nCELESTE Is it made out of organic mung beans? \nJesse nods and chuckles. \nJESSE No, I actually found it digging through your trash. \nCELESTE Ohhh, I see. All right. \nThey've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste laugh. \nNow, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed. \n102 EXT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 102 A LITTLE LATER \nCeleste and Jesse walk out of the building. \nJESSE So...we're divorced! \nThey high five. What are you supposed to do when you get divorced. \nCELESTE We did it. \nJESSE You wanna walk for a couple minutes? \nCELESTE Sure. \nCUT TO: \n103 EXT. LACMA- SUNDOWN 103 \nCeleste and Jesse are now approaching the front of \"Urban Light,\" the installation from the beginning of the movie. The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps: \nCELESTE These are beautiful. \nJESSE I thought you hated them. \nCELESTE Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night. \nJesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty sad. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) What's up with you? I know we just got divorced but no one died, right? \nJESSE I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left. \nThere is a long pause. \nCELESTE What? Veronica? Left where? \nJESSE Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels. \nAnother monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Okay, you can say it now. You were right, I blew it. Just say it. \n", "test1_input": "CELESTE What? Oh, White trash. \nSnow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) White trash? \nSNOW WHITE (doesn't get it) Huh. \nPaul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and wasted. \nPAUL Celeste? \nCELESTE Yoga? \nPAUL Yeah, I haven't seen you there for a while. \nCELESTE I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape. \nPAUL I can see that's important to you. (referring to the Car Bomb in her FACE) \nCeleste is now drunk. \nCELESTE How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing) \nPAUL White trash? \nCELESTE Uh huh. What are you? \nPAUL Um, a cereal killer, obviously. \nCELESTE You're \"punny.\" \nPAUL By the way, you were right. \nCELESTE About what? \nPAUL About me. All of it, the car, the phone, the yoga. Except that I did go to an Ivy League school. Cornell. \nCELESTE Barely an Ivy. \nPAUL I know. \nCELESTE Do you smoke? \nPAUL At parties. \nCELESTE Me too. Let's go. \n58 EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME BACKYARD-NIGHT 58 \nCeleste and Paul sit away from the party, smoking cigarettes. \nPAUL (Playful) Sorry about that day at the gym. I feel really open after yoga... \nCELESTE Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it. \nPAUL I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to meet girls. Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? Is this happening? Or... \nCELESTE My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me. \nPAUL I'm sorry, that sounds tough. \nCELESTE He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong. \nPAUL And you're right. Now what? \nCELESTE What do you mean? \nPAUL Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? \nCELESTE Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real. \nPAUL No one has ever given a more self- righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag. Except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners. \nBeth and Tucker approach Celeste and Paul. \nBETH Time to go, drunky. \nThey head off. \n", "test1_true": "59 INT. CELESTE'S HOME OFFICE-DAY (SUNDAY) 59 \nCeleste is going through papers on her desk. She's cleaning house. She sees the envelope from the divorce lawyer. She quickly tosses it aside. Then she comes across one of Jesse's old notebooks. She flips through it. She reads a couple of sweet passages about her, it makes her smile. She grabs the phone. \nCELESTE Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I still have a bunch of your stuff in the office. You should probably grab it at some point. Okay. \nShe hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to Jesse. \n60 EXT. JESSE AND VERONICA'S HOUSE-ECHO PARK-DUSK 60 \nCeleste carries a box of Jesse's stuff to his front door. She doesn't knock. She leaves the box by the door. But she decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for herself; she deserves it and he'll never know. She starts to walk away when she notices, it's trash day. \nCUT TO: \n61 INT. VERONICA'S VOLKSWAGON BEETLE-DUSK 61 \nJesse drives and Veronica is in the passenger seat. They are quiet and content. They look at each other and smile. After a BEAT: \nVERONICA You're going to be a really good dad. \nJESSE What? Why did you say that? \nVeronica studies Jesse's face. \nVERONICA I don't know, I just know it. \nJESSE No one's ever said that to me. \nCUT TO: \n62 EXT. JESSE AND VERONICA'S DRIVEWAY-A MOMENT LATER 62 \nThree trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the driveway. A huge box is protruding from the blue can. Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing. \nCELESTE At least they recycle. \n63 INT. VERONICA'S VOLKSWAGON BEETLE-A MOMENT LATER 63 \nVeronica looks out the window. \nJESSE This is...so weird but I just realized...what's your middle name? I don't even know it. \nThey laugh a little. \nVERONICA It's um...Godelieve. \nJESSE Goldleaf? \nVERONICA No, Goldelieve. It means loved by the Gods. It's Dutch. \nJESSE Sweet. Mine's Mordechai. \nVERONICA What does it mean? \nJESSE Means I'm really Jewish. \nVeronica giggles. They're getting to know each other. It's awkward...but sweet. \nCUT TO: \n64 EXT. JESSE AND VERONICA'S SIDEWALK-ANOTHER MOMENT LATER 64 \nCeleste is still digging in the trash. She looks further down. \nCELESTE Guitar Hero?? That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his \"elegant\" Belgian bride. \nAll of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and plunks to the bottom. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Shit. Shit shit shit. \nShe drops Jesse's journal to the concrete and crawls into the trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then, Jesse's car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way in the trash can. She fumbles and then: \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Ow!!! Shit! \nA piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up again. She looks for a place to run. It's too late. She picks up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car. Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste. \nJESSE Celeste? \nCeleste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also holding Jesse's journal close to her chest. \n", "test1_id": 510, "test2_input": "JESSE Yeah, yeah. It's great. \nWhy doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the drink. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I should probably get home. \nCELESTE Yeah. It's really nice to see you. \nHe hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one second, very tenderly. She pulls away. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) You should go. \nJESSE Can we just...lay here for a bit? \nCeleste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch. They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I can't believe I'm having a baby...and it's not with you. \nWe see Celeste's face but Jesse doesn't. She's crying. \n77 INT. CELESTE'S LIVING ROOM- THE NEXT MORNING 77 \nThe phone rings. It's early. Celeste, still in her clothes from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone. She fumbles for the phone. \nCELESTE Yeah. \nSCOTT We have a massive problem on our hands. I need you in the office. Now. \n78 INT. POP FORM OFFICES-LATE AFTERNOON 78 \nINSERT of a large, magnified version of Riley's \"RB\" logo. It is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at Celeste, waiting for her to freak out. \nCELESTE I don't see anything. \nSCOTT (referring to the logo) It's a penis. And a butt. \nCELESTE What? Really? I don't see it. \nSCOTT You can't be serious. (points to the logo) There's the penis. And there's the penis going into the butt. \nCELESTE I think it's a stretch. \nSCOTT Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste. \nScott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips comes on. \nNEWSCASTER ...teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen star's fashion magic but instead, they have been suprised by what they saw. \nPARENT There's homosexual butt sex in the logo. Does Riley think we're that stupid?? I will never support gay marriage. \nNEWSCASTER Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form-the marketing company responsible-could be reached for comment. \nScott turns it off. \nSCOTT Celeste, what did you do. How could be so careless? \nCeleste picks up the magnified logo again. \nCELESTE Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaaha. \nCeleste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest thing she's ever seen. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) It's a cock in a butt!!! Hahahaahaaa!! \nSCOTT (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing. \nCELESTE Scott, come on... \nSCOTT No, this is not a joke. Our company's in serious danger. \nCELESTE You're being dramatic. \nSCOTT Get out. I can't, with you, right now. I have to deal with this. I'll call you soon. \nHer laughter fades and she exits the conference room. \n79 EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.-LATER THAT DAY-DUSK 79 \nBon Iver's \"Skinny Love\" plays as Celeste walks slowly amongst the celebrity impersonators, tourists and drunks on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \n", "test2_true": "CELESTE No...okay. \n80 INT. THE WELL BAR-EARLY EVENING 80 \nWe see Jesse sitting at the dive bar. Celeste enters and sits next to Jesse. She is happy to see him. \nJESSE Hey. \nCELESTE Hey. \nJESSE We gotta talk. \nCELESTE I know. That's why I called. \nJESSE Celeste... \nCELESTE Wait, let me say something. I don't know what happened last night. I don't know what's happening with your other situation. But I need to say this. For the record, I fucked up. I was cavalier about you. I took us for granted. And I know this may sound crazy but I'd be remiss if I didn't...if you were open to it...I think that I could do better. With you. With us. If there's a chance still...I'd like to know. \nJesse can't even look at her. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Jesse? \nJESSE I'm sorry. I can't. \nJesse gets up and leaves. \n81 EXT. THE WELL BAR-EVENING 81 \nJesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking quickly after Jesse. \nCELESTE Hey! \nJesse pauses for a moment. He turns. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Why did you come to my house last night? \nJESSE I don't know. \nCELESTE Oh no, I think you do. \nJESSE I made a mistake. \nCELESTE And? \nJESSE I shouldn't have come. \nCELESTE You're a fucking coward. \nJESSE I'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica. I'm trying to change. \nCELESTE Well, you never changed for me. \nJesse pauses. \nJESSE To be honest, you didn't really let me. \nCELESTE Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up! I rooted for you, I fucking paid for everything, I did everything for you! \nJESSE Yeah, and I was never your equal. And you know what? I think you preferred it that way. \nCELESTE Right. Well, I know my success was never easy for you. \nJESSE And how do you define success, Celeste? Because you don't look very successful right now. \nCELESTE And you are? Pretending to be a father? Pretending to be an adult? \nJESSE What do you want? \nCELESTE I just want you to admit that you're wrong! \nJESSE Wrong? Wrong about what? What did you want me to do? Wait for you to meet someone first? Is that how you saw it happening? \nCeleste doesn't respond. \nJESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I didn't expect to meet someone so fast, but I did. And I think we have a chance to be happy together. I don't want to blow that. \nCELESTE You know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it. \nJesse takes a beat. It stings. \n", "test2_id": 511, "test3_input": "JESSE I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever. \nHe starts to walk away. Celeste call after him. \nCELESTE Don't ever call me. \nJESSE Don't worry about it. \nJesse walks away. \n82 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN-NIGHT 82 \nSkillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last scene from \"Dirty Dancing.\" The image is being projected onto her garden wall. There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley's \"Kaya\" plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees, bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste watches the movie. \nCELESTE She's so sad. \nSKILLZ Is she? I don't think so. \nCELESTE No, she's sad. I can tell. I went to dance camp. \nWe see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's the first good thing that's happened to me in months. \nSKILLZ Shit'll get better. \nCELESTE Will it? You don't know that. \nCeleste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) How could he do this to me? \nSKILLZ J-Thunder? He's not doing anything to you. You wanted a divorce. \nCELESTE But I didn't want it like this. \nSKILLZ When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. \nCELESTE Huh? \nSKILLZ Oh. It's Victor Frankl. \nCELESTE Huh. \nSkillz gets up. \nSKILLZ I gotta go before Petco closes. \nCELESTE You have a pet? \nSKILLZ No, but I gotta get a toy for this girl's cat, you know, so she'll give up the kitty. \nCELESTE Can I come? \nSKILLZ No. \nCELESTE Will you bring me some Panda Express? \nSKILLZ No. \nCELESTE Do you think the Obamas are really in love? \nSKILLZ Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick you up at noon. \nCELESTE Noon? \nSKILLZ Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ? \nCELESTE Right, right. \nSKILLZ Hey, easy on the herb until then. That shit is powerful. \nCUT TO: \n83 EXT. BETH AND TUCKER'S BACKYARD-DAY 83 \nCeleste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and uncharacteristically colorful clothes that don't match. Like a crazy lady jumpsuit. She is going to town on a HUGE plate of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg salad and a beer. She attacks it like it's her last meal ever. She's also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a group of people talking including, Beth's mom, Beth and a couple of her girlfriends. \nBETH Hi honey, you remember Eileen from... \n", "test3_true": "Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60, very large, a big sloppy hug. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hi Carol! Beth's getting married! I was married, remember? These guys are in for a fucking dogfight, right? \nBeth pulls Celeste away. \nBETH Let's get you a soda. \nThey get to the bar. \nCELESTE Do you guys have any tequila? \nBARTENDER We only have Mimosas and Shandys. \nCELESTE I'll have both please. \nBeth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the house and plops her down on the couch. \nBETH I'm going to recommend some quiet time for you right now. \nCELESTE Can I smoke? \nBETH No. \nCeleste starts weeping. \nCELESTE I don't want to be alone forever. \nBETH Not forever, honey. Just until you sober up. You'll be fine. \nCELESTE Okay then, I'll just go to the other side of the pool. I promise I won't make you look bad. \nCUT TO: \n84 EXT. BETH AND TUCKER'S POOL-LATER 84 \nJesse and Veronica are talking to Beth. In the foreground, Celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the pool, passed out, face down, sunglasses half off, fully clothed. Skillz approaches Beth. \nBETH At least she's quiet now. \nSKILLZ I'm gonna get her out of here. \n85 INT. BETH'S DUPLEX- HANCOCK PARK- NEXT DAY 85 \nBeth has tons of Barneys New York bags and is trying on clothes for her rehearsal dinner. Celeste is in the fetal position, hungover on Beth's bed. \nCELESTE (on the phone) Hey Riley, it's Celeste. I just want to talk to you about this \"error\" in your logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix this...call me. \nBETH I just think it's corny to wear white two nights in a row. I want to rock a pattern, or maybe something in pastel... \nShe turns to Celeste in a dress. \nBETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) How's this? C! Wake up! I'm leaving in an hour and I have to make a decision now. You owe me. You humped my grandmother yesterday. \nCeleste is comatose. \nBETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh no, are you okay? \nCELESTE What the fuck does Riley Banks know. \nBETH Um...nothing. She's a tart. \nCELESTE Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately talented, blessed with a good face and has maybe 5 more years left of stardom. Who is she to tell ME what... \nCeleste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung up on Riley. Oh shit. She hangs up quick and throws the blackberry across the bed. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I never hung up, I never hung up! Fuck! Do you think she... \nHer blackberry rings. It's Riley. She takes a deep breath. She picks, all casual. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hey Riley, what's up? \nRILEY I need to talk to you. Come to my house. Now. \nCELESTE Oh boy. \nCUT TO: \n86 INT.

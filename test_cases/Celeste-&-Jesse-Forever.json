Alcohol? \nRILEY Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime. \nCELESTE Um...it's actually regimen? \nRILEY Sorry? \nCELESTE Regime is a system of government. It's a \"skin regimen.\" \nRiley and Savannah glare at Celeste. \nRILEY Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you. \nThey leave. \nCELESTE Charming. \nCUT TO: \n47 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-AN HOUR LATER 47 \nThe Riley Banks branding strategy meeting is under way. Slides are being shown, Scott is giving a presentation on design ideas. Celeste is distracted and on her Blackberry. We see an INSERT of Celeste's Blackberry on Dictionary.com, looking up \"regime: a mode or system of rule or government.\" \nSCOTT Celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great. \nHe looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) (CONTD) Celeste? Do you wanna... \nCELESTE Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork... \n48 INT. CELESTE'S OFFICE-AN HOUR LATER 48 \nScott enters. \nSCOTT Hello, Special One. \nCELESTE Uh, you got my IM. \nSCOTT Sounds so awful. \nCELESTE Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody. \nScott has an idea. \nSCOTT Wait, wait. You've never met Nick, right? Nick Moran? \nCELESTE The photographer? You know him? \nSCOTT Yeah, we went to school together. This could be perfect. \nCELESTE (she sings, like she's in a musical) I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating.

Also, I love cooo-ooock. \nCELESTE You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott. \n49 EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT BALCONY- NIGHT 49 \nCeleste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. He's hip and smart in an effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and laugh. \nCELESTE So you pissed in your pants? \nNICK I waited seven hours. Three of them soaking in my own pee. But I finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad. \nHe hands her a photograph. \nCELESTE Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe. \nNICK He is. I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh. \nCELESTE Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me. \nNICK I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I didn't win. \n", "test1_true": "They laugh. They are connecting. \nNICK (looking at his watch) Oh my god, we missed our reservation. It was at 8:30. Should I call down and see if they can still take us? \nCELESTE How about room service? \nNICK Perfect. \n50 INT. CHATEAU MARMONT-LIVING ROOM- LATER 50 \nNick and Celeste are kissing. It's passionate but tender. They stop and their foreheads rest against each other's and they take a deep breath. They speak in hushed tones. \nCELESTE That was really, really nice. \nNICK Um, yeah. So, what are you doing for the rest of your life? \nCELESTE Making out with you. \nThey start to kiss again. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I don't remember it ever feeling like this. \nThey continue to kiss. Celeste notices that she and the couch are vibrating. She looks down. Oh no. Nick is masturbating. Can he really be masturbating? \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) (whisper)What are you doing? \nNICK (whisper)What do you think I'm doing? \nCELESTE (whisper) Why are you doing that? Don't do that..It was going so well. \nNICK Shhhhh. \nCeleste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, \"no.\" Nick keeps going. Eyes closed. \nNICK (CONT'D) (CONTD) Watch me. I'm almost there. \nCeleste cannot believe what she is watching. \nCELESTE Almost where?? No! \nCeleste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of dodge. \nNICK Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh! \nNick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize she's gone. \nNICK (CONT'D) (CONTD) Celeste? \n51 EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH-NEXT MORNING 51 \nCeleste runs really hard, listening to her Sunny Levine's \"Glass Jaw\" on her iPhone. She stops suddenly. She sees Jesse's number, she hits \"Ignore.\" She starts running again with purpose. \n52 EXT. ELYSIAN WAY ECHO PARK- NEXT DAY 52 \nCeleste drives and listen to her phone on bluetooth. \nJESSE V.O. Hey, so, I'm glad you can meet up. 4pm is good. There's this little place by me, Vegan Vittles on Elysian Way, kinda hard to find, call me if you get lost. \nCELESTE Vegan Vittles. \nCUT TO: \n53 INT. VEGAN VITTLES-MINUTES LATER 53 \nCeleste enters and sees Jesse sitting at a table in a small, folksy restaurant. Celeste is on the phone. She waves at Jesse and gestures \"one second.\" \nCELESTE No, I don't want to do a video chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she hangs up, now on the Blackberry) Sorry, one second, I just have to send this e-mail. \nJesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to finish her e-mail. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) There. Hi. \nJESSE Hi. What's up? \nCELESTE A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some coffee? \nWAITRESS We have yerba matte? \nCELESTE Um, green tea? \n", "test1_id": 510, "test2_input": "JESSE I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever. \nHe starts to walk away. Celeste call after him. \nCELESTE Don't ever call me. \nJESSE Don't worry about it. \nJesse walks away. \n82 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN-NIGHT 82 \nSkillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last scene from \"Dirty Dancing.\" The image is being projected onto her garden wall. There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley's \"Kaya\" plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees, bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste watches the movie. \nCELESTE She's so sad. \nSKILLZ Is she? I don't think so. \nCELESTE No, she's sad. I can tell. I went to dance camp. \nWe see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's the first good thing that's happened to me in months. \nSKILLZ Shit'll get better. \nCELESTE Will it? You don't know that. \nCeleste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) How could he do this to me? \nSKILLZ J-Thunder? He's not doing anything to you. You wanted a divorce. \nCELESTE But I didn't want it like this. \nSKILLZ When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. \nCELESTE Huh? \nSKILLZ Oh. It's Victor Frankl. \nCELESTE Huh. \nSkillz gets up. \nSKILLZ I gotta go before Petco closes. \nCELESTE You have a pet? \nSKILLZ No, but I gotta get a toy for this girl's cat, you know, so she'll give up the kitty. \nCELESTE Can I come? \nSKILLZ No. \nCELESTE Will you bring me some Panda Express? \nSKILLZ No. \nCELESTE Do you think the Obamas are really in love? \nSKILLZ Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick you up at noon. \nCELESTE Noon? \nSKILLZ Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ? \nCELESTE Right, right. \nSKILLZ Hey, easy on the herb until then. That shit is powerful. \nCUT TO: \n83 EXT. BETH AND TUCKER'S BACKYARD-DAY 83 \nCeleste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and uncharacteristically colorful clothes that don't match. Like a crazy lady jumpsuit. She is going to town on a HUGE plate of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg salad and a beer. She attacks it like it's her last meal ever. She's also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a group of people talking including, Beth's mom, Beth and a couple of her girlfriends. \nBETH Hi honey, you remember Eileen from... \n", "test2_true": "Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60, very large, a big sloppy hug. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hi Carol! Beth's getting married! I was married, remember? These guys are in for a fucking dogfight, right? \nBeth pulls Celeste away. \nBETH Let's get you a soda. \nThey get to the bar. \nCELESTE Do you guys have any tequila? \nBARTENDER We only have Mimosas and Shandys. \nCELESTE I'll have both please. \nBeth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the house and plops her down on the couch. \nBETH I'm going to recommend some quiet time for you right now. \nCELESTE Can I smoke? \nBETH No. \nCeleste starts weeping. \nCELESTE I don't want to be alone forever. \nBETH Not forever, honey. Just until you sober up. You'll be fine. \nCELESTE Okay then, I'll just go to the other side of the pool. I promise I won't make you look bad. \nCUT TO: \n84 EXT. BETH AND TUCKER'S POOL-LATER 84 \nJesse and Veronica are talking to Beth. In the foreground, Celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the pool, passed out, face down, sunglasses half off, fully clothed. Skillz approaches Beth. \nBETH At least she's quiet now. \nSKILLZ I'm gonna get her out of here. \n85 INT. BETH'S DUPLEX- HANCOCK PARK- NEXT DAY 85 \nBeth has tons of Barneys New York bags and is trying on clothes for her rehearsal dinner. Celeste is in the fetal position, hungover on Beth's bed. \nCELESTE (on the phone) Hey Riley, it's Celeste. I just want to talk to you about this \"error\" in your logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix this...call me. \nBETH I just think it's corny to wear white two nights in a row. I want to rock a pattern, or maybe something in pastel... \nShe turns to Celeste in a dress. \nBETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) How's this? C! Wake up! I'm leaving in an hour and I have to make a decision now. You owe me. You humped my grandmother yesterday. \nCeleste is comatose. \nBETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh no, are you okay? \nCELESTE What the fuck does Riley Banks know. \nBETH Um...nothing. She's a tart. \nCELESTE Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately talented, blessed with a good face and has maybe 5 more years left of stardom. Who is she to tell ME what... \nCeleste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung up on Riley. Oh shit. She hangs up quick and throws the blackberry across the bed. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I never hung up, I never hung up! Fuck! Do you think she... \nHer blackberry rings. It's Riley. She takes a deep breath. She picks, all casual. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hey Riley, what's up? \nRILEY I need to talk to you. Come to my house. Now. \nCELESTE Oh boy. \nCUT TO: \n86 INT. RILEY'S HOUSE- HOLLYWOOD HILLS-AFTERNOON 86 \n", "test2_id": 511, "test3_input": "CELESTE You know what else is beautiful? \nCeleste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have done many times. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh god, tug it. \nJesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the creme fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin. \nJESSE Aw yeah! Fuck! \nJesse and Celeste are in hysterics. Just then, Veronica arrives. \nVERONICA Jesse? \nJESSE Hey. \nCeleste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught. \nVERONICA What are you doing? \nJESSE What? Nothing. We're just... \nHe looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy to explain. \nCELESTE Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know... \nCeleste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up and realizes how dumb this must seem. \nVERONICA I don't get it. \nCeleste and Jesse stop. \nCELESTE It's stupid. \nVeronica is looking at Celete's food. \nVERONICA Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See you on the dance floor? Watch out for Tucker though. \nThey leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into the carrot. \n94 INT. WEDDING TENT-LATER 94 \nWe see a raucous wedding dance floor. Everyone's dancing: Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica, Scott, etc. They are doing wedding dances. Celeste sits at her table, watching with a smile. It is bittersweet for her. She drinks a martini. Alone. \n95 INT. PAUL'S CONDO-NIGHT 95 \nCeleste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine. \nPAUL (keeping score on a notepad) So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so... \nCELESTE Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name! \nPAUL Are you challenging or not? \nCELESTE Yes, I definitely am. \nPAUL Well, I will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go. (he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself. \nCeleste finds the word, reads the definition and silently accepts defeat. \nPAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD) Ha ha! I go again. \nCELESTE I've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life. \nPAUL Well, nothing lasts forever. \n96 INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM- LATER 96 \nCeleste and Paul are making out on the couch. \nPAUL I'm so sorry I beat you in Scrabble. \nCELESTE No you're not. \nPAUL You're right, I'm not. \nThe making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive. \nCELESTE Will you get a condom? \n", "test3_true": "CELESTE No, you're using a condom. \nPAUL No, I don't think we should sleep together. \nCeleste pulls away from him. \nCELESTE What? \nPAUL I just...I don't know. \nCELESTE Are you not into it? \nPAUL No, no believe me, I'm into it. \nCELESTE Then, what's the deal? \nPAUL I really like you. \nCELESTE Right, I'm confused...why not sleep with me then? \nPAUL Because I think I might really like you. \nCELESTE Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay. Well, I like you too. \nCeleste looks distant. \n97 INT. L.A. NIGHTCLUB-NIGHT 97 \nCeleste is at a loud, trendy club. She sits next to Riley. They have to shout to be heard. \nRILEY THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST EMBARRASSING SPEECH EVER! HOW WILL SHOW YOUR FACE TO YOUR FRIENDS EVER AGAIN? \nCELESTE ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY I DID IT. I FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW. \nRILEY WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN. \nCeleste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands. \nCELESTE THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY, HUH? \nRILEY WHAT DO YOU MEAN? \nCeleste just looks at her like, \"Oh you poor, sheltered Disney princess. Are you serious?\" \nCELESTE THIS IS A GAY CLUB. \nRILEY IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET. \nStill nothing from Riley. \nCELESTE RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW. \nRiley looks around and takes it in. Aha, right. Celeste looks out amongst the crowd. Just then, two beefy, waxed, tanned, well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste. \nGAY MAN Excuse me, can you please tell your friend Riley that we worship her?? \nGAY MAN #2 OMG, she's so pretty! \nCELESTE Sure... \nCeleste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t- shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake in the logo. She points at it. \nCELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Wait, are you aware that the logo is... \nGAY MAN #2 A dick in a butt? Yeahhh! \nGAY MAN It's amazing. All of our friends are rocking it. It's like the gay Izod. \nThe gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance floor, ALL wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo magnified. \nCELESTE Wow, so, what, you just buy the biggest size they make? \nGAY MAN How dare you, I'm a size 10 in tween. I have a slight frame. \nThey walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is being adored by gay men. \nRILEY I LOVE IT HERE!! \nCeleste has a big idea. \n", "test3_id": 512}

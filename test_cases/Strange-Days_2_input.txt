INT.  BONAVENTURE ELEVATOR 
It is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside of the building.  10th floor.  The last passengers step out.  When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols.  The elevator rises, the lights of LA spread out below.  He is hyperventilating.

INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM 
Mace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air- kissing each other. 
But as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and excuses himself.  He starts toward the men's room.  And Mace follows him.

INT.  MEN'S ROOM/HOTEL 
A few guys in tuxes tending to themselves.  Strickland enters, crossing to a urinal.  He unzips. 
Mace steps up beside him.  Guys behind her looking on, slack-jawed.  Mace pays no attention to them.  Strickland, stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow. 
STRICKLAND Yes? 
She puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal. He scowls. 
MACE There's a tape in there you need to see.  I mean right now. 
While see is looking at Strickland, a young LAPD OFFICER comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink.  He glances in the mirror at Mace. 
STRICKLAND If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd arrest you for possession of illegal equipment-- 
MACE (interrupting) Just look at the tape!  You want to know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in the stall right now and hit Play. 
The young cop steps up behind her. 
YOUNG COP Sir, is there a problem here? 
Mace turns.  Oh shit.  She backs away from them. 
MACE Damn!  I knew it-- 
Strickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for her.  Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him down and vanishes out the door. 
STRICKLAND hefts the recorder, pondering it.  His expression is opaque.

INT.  HALLWAY/BONAVENTURE HOTEL 
Lenny comes out of the elevator.  Standing at the corner, where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade Beemer.  Lenny doesn't break stride.  Just walks toward Beemer.  He's not afraid anymore.  He's pissed off. Beemer moves toward him. 
LENNY Now, Wade, can we talk here, like two human beings-- 
We think he's starting the usual negotiation.  But when he gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right, straight into Beemer's face.  We're talking a John Wayne haymaker punch.  He staggers back, surprised and dazed, and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can. 
He drops to his knees, sucking wind.  Lenny draws his Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of handcuffs off his belt.  Okay, we're starting to believe he might have been a cop once. 
LENNY It's not personal.

INT.  BALLROOM 
Mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past the tables when... 
... she's grabbed by DUNCAN.  He gets her in a good tight come-along.  Like any good security person, the hold is not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted. VITA MINH steps up next to her, closing ranks. 
MACE IS WALKED around behind the bandstand.  Joey Corto walks up to her, looking mean and smug. 
Mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur.  Her open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch. Corto screams and grabs his face. 
CORTO Aw, not the fucking nose!! 
She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt.  He keeps the hold.  Mace drives her free hand back into the approximate position of his nuts.  Even though Duncan looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired effect. 
Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a buffet table.  Vita draws a knife in a lightning move but... 
Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in her face.  Vita says the smartest line of the night. 
VITA Hey, enjoy the party. 
Mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her gun innocuously tight to her side.  She spots a red "Exit" sign above a fire door and goes through. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STAIRWELL AND PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE 
Lenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing.  Lenny moves down the empty corridor. 
He approaches suite 2203.  The door is ajar.  Always a bad sign.

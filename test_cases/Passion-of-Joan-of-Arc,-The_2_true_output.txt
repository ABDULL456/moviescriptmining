132   Loiseleur goes back to the larger platform where he takes his place near Cauchon, who now gets up and declares the session opened. 
Joan, for the last time I order you to abjure. Are you willing to sign? 
Joan sits motionless and expressionless. She hears nothing, and smiles distantly. 
133   One of the prelates takes his place at Joan's side. He begins an admonitory sermon, taking as text the words from Saint John's Gospel: 'The branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine.' Inspiring terror at one moment, speaking sanctimoniously the next, he warns, he threatens, he implores, he mocks, he calls her a cunning traitor, cruel, greedy, a liar, a heretic, a witch. His anger rises in measure with his words and finally reaches a point where it overflows in a torrent. He is unquestionably a powerful speaker. 
134   But the stream of words appears to flow over Joan's head without touching her. The past and the present mingle in   her thoughts; yet nothing of what goes on around her escapes   her notice. She looks towards the open grave. She cannot see   the actual gravedigger, only the earth which he is shoveling   up from deep down. Then she hears a shout of command. 
135   In the densest part of the crowd the soldiers are clearing a passage to allow a carriage into the churchyard. The new arrivals are the executioner and his two assistants. 
136   Erard is enraged at Joan's apparent lack of interest in what he is saying. He raises his voice and shouts furiously: 
... This woman's arrogance fills one with disgust ... 
Joan's attitude remains unchanged. She does not move. Erard's voice trembles as he continues: 
There has never been a monster in France like the one which has appeared in the form of Joan. 
He pauses, leans towards her, and with a threatening gesture shouts at Joan: 
It is to you, Joan, I am talking... it is to you I say that your king is a heretic! 
137   Now Joan turns towards him. She can withstand all his invective, when it is her own person and her own honor that are at stake; but this accusation directed at her king deeply outrages Joan's love of France and of Charles, the king. Her expression is one of anger and indignation as she says: 
Indeed, my lord, I am ready to maintain, even at the risk of my life, that my king is the noblest man in all Christendom... 
138   A ripple of applause can be heard among the spectators. The soldiers, who are standing side by side in closed ranks, turn threateningly.

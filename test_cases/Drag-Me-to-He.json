{"test1_input": "MR. JACKS That was one nutty old lady. You okay? Stephanie nods. \nMR. JACKS You handled that just right. And by the way, as far as the Assistant Manager's position... You're at the top of the list. \nSTEPHANIE Thanks. Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home. Stephanie loads a pile of contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box and exits the bank. The Security guard locks up behind her. \nEXT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY \nStephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off. It's then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler. It's parked in the structure. Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel. She nervously glances about. No sign of Mrs. Ganush. Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car. Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly than she would like. She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the lot. It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief. It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer. Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is carried off by the wind. Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled hands come up around her face! Mrs Ganush sits up in the back seat of her car! SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie! \nMRS. GANUSH (In Hungarian) You bitch! I pluck out your fucking eyes! Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards Stephanie's eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists, halting her. The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back of the front seat to pull even harder... Stephanie's neck is now bent so far back it's about to snap! Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It springs open. She swings it back over her shoulder! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's forehead. Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled shut. The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only tightens. Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and hits the gas. As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her shoulder harness with the last of her strength. The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her to see... an oncoming concrete column. Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her shoulder harness. But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat, impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force. Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash. In a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth. \nBoth women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her wits first. She reaches across Mrs. Ganush and opens the passenger door. Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's foot shoves her out. The old woman hits the ground hard but she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back in. Stephanie shifts the car into reverse. The opened passenger door knocks Mrs. Ganush back down to the pavement. The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column. Stephanie is dazed. Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the car. Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view mirror: Mrs. Ganush running closer,'SHRIEKING with old world rage! The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time! Mrs. Ganush furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail. \nSTEPHANIE I beat you, you old bitch! Next time take your Geretol! The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie looks about. Where'd she go? The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete and... CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters. The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her toothless maw down upon Stephanie.'s chin. Suckling it, gumming. The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy. Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away. Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth to Ste phanie's jaw. The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat. She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight. She GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING! Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and shoves it down the old lady's throat. Mrs. Ganush gags, trying to retch up the ruler. \nThen Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old 1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car. Stephanie hits the pavement. She shields her face with her hands, waiting, but the blow never comes. The old woman standing above her, WHEEZING. \nMRS. GANUSH You shamed me. The Old Woman reaches down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.'Ganush's gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of Stephanie's coat. She waves the button through the air, and breathes out a single word: \nMRS. GANUSH Lamia... Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over Stephanie. A cold wind makes her shiver. \nSTEPHANIE What--? What are you doing? Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman 1 moves it out of reach. \nMRS. GANUSH You want it? Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat pocket. \nMRS. GANUSH Soon it will be you, who comes begging to me. It begins tonight when you hear the cry. \nSTEPHANIE What cry? \nMRS. GANUSH The Lamia. It's coming for you. A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She swats it away. Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She leans against the car for support. When she finally looks up, Mrs. Ganush is gone. \nINT. POLICE STATION - SARGENT'S DESK - NIGHT \nStephanie and Ray have just finished filing a report with \nOFFICER NAIMARK. \nRAY What about a restraining order? \nOFFICER NAIMARK Well that's usually only something we do if there's a pattern of harassment. But like I said, we'll file a report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem. But once we send an officer around to have a word with, her, I don't think she'll be bothering you again. \nSTEPHANIE Thank you, you've been very helpful. \n", "test1_true": "Stephanie and Ray eat ice cream cones as they walk past the shops. \nRAY I just thank God you're okay. You are okay, right? \nSTEPHANIE I'm fine. Ray waits, sensing that there's more to it. \nRAY Your fine, but... \nSTEPHANIE I-- It's just that I could have gotten her another extension. But I didn't. \nRAY Loo]. You said the bank had already granted her two extensions. \n(MORE) \nRAY (cont'd) When you don't pay your mortgage you lose your house, what did she t expect? \nSTEPHANIE I guess. A breeze. She shivers. He wraps his arms around her protectively and after a moment, they walk on. Stephanie watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY. Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a storefront window. It reads: PSYCHIC. \nSTEPHANIE Let's get our fortune's read! \nRAY You're kidding right? She cajoles a protesting Ray through the front door of the establishment. \nINT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT \nA tiny waiting room. A poster on the wall indicating the energy meridians of the human body. \nRAY I just hope to God none of my students see me here. Five bucks says he's wearing a turban. A beaded curtain parts, revealing... Rham Jas, a small, dark skinned, fifty year old Indian man. He wears a plain black suit and a white turban. His inquisitive eyes evaluate the couple. \nRHAM JAS I am Rham Jas. Seer. \nSTEPHANIE How do you do? I'm Stephanie Brown and this is Ray... \nRAY But you probably already knew that. Just kidding. Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile. \nRHAM JAS How can I help you? \nSTEPHANIE We'd like to have our fortunes read. Can you do that? Read the future? \nRHAM JAS I have the ability to see certain energies... Sometimes these ' energies are a foretoken of things to come. Sometimes not. Sixty dollars, please. \nRAY Sixty dollars? Isn't that a little steep for this kind of thing? \n", "test1_id": 1659, "test2_input": "STEPHANIE \nYou don't want to know. Ray pulls her close. \nRAY Tell me! \nSTEPHANIE The thing that's coming for me. What the old woman sent. \nRAY Listen to me. What you're going through right now-- It's like the doctor said, it's a stress reaction and -- \nSTEPHANIE No. I wanted to believe that-- but it's real, Ray. You just don't want to open your eyes to it because it threatens you. Because if I'm right and there is something out there, then you'd have to throw out everything you teach. And where'd that leave you? Like a plow without a mule. Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if maybe she isn't right. \nSTEPHANIE Unless you're willing to take a chance and believe in me, I can't be with you any more. She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail lights, as they vanish into the night. \nEXT. ECHO PARK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nAn older home with bars on the front windows. Stephanie knocks at the front door. She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched SQUEAL. Was it just a bus's air brakes... or something more? When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack. An EYE peers out at her. \nVOICE OF THE EYE What is it? \nSTEPHANIE Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia Ganush. Is she here? The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck. She wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts. EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from within the house. \nILENKA I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter. Who are you? \nSTEPHANIE Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of... a friend of hers. Actually, I've been trying to help her with a loan \nTHAT- \nILENKA Wait. I know who you are. Grandma told me you'd come. You're the woman from the bank. The one who took her house. \nSTEPHANIE It was really the bank that took the house. I just work there. In fact, I tried to help your grandma get-the house back, but my boss wouldn't let me. Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows. \nILENKA That's not what happened, is it? Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face? \nSTEPHANIE . no. \nILENKA You used to be a real fat girl, to didn't you? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nILENKA I can tell. You know, you caused my grandma a lot of pain. That house was her pride. When you took that from her, she had nothing left. You're not welcome here. She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate now, no where else to turn. \nSTEPHANIE Okay! I did it. It was me who denied her the loan. I was trying, to get ahead at work and I shouldn't have done it. It was wrong. \n", "test2_true": "STEPHANIE And I'm ashamed about it. And I'm going to get down on my hands and knees and beg her to forgive me. She said-that I hadn't suffered enough. But now I think she'll see that I have and then maybe she'll let me... \nILENKA .make everything all right for her, is that it? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile. She motions for Stephanie to follow. They enter a room filled with young Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic tongue. A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad luck as he pays cash to the woman. \n' STEPHANIE Where is she? \nIlenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers. Stephanie t pushes her way through the crowd. She stumbles and falls atop the Corpse of Mrs. Ganush! As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just her dead body that rests atop a coffee table. Stephanie has landed atop the corpse! The leg of the coffee table breaks under the weight of the two women. Stephanie tumbles to the ground, the corpse landing atop her. The crowd of mourners GASP. The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon Stephanie's chin, as through it were once again suckling it. Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in revulsion. \nILENKA Still going to make everything all right? The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table. Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian. She tells them that it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia. A mother shields her daughter's eyes from the sight of Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her .crucifix. A man spits at her feet then walks off. \nSTEPHANIE No, please-- I needed her to take this thing off me. \nILENKA It will never come off. \nSTEPHANIE You know about it? Then, please help me. I'm begging you. \nILENKA She said you'd come begging. I only wish she could have lived to see it. The blood drains from Stephanie's face. \nILENKA .maybe she can... Stephanie glances down to the corpse. It's head is now facing her. It's dead eyes, OPEN! \nINT. RHAM JAS' HOUSE -- NIGHT \nStephanie puts her foot through RHAM Jas' TV set. Shattering the tube, commanding his. attention. \nSTEPHANIE Fuck that! I paid you a hundred and seventy nine dollars for that book! \nRHAM JAS It was a limited printing! Please control yourself! \nSTEPHANIE I did what you said- that blood offering... I killed that little kitty deader than Hogan's goat. Lotta good that did me. \nRHAM JAS We are dealing with elusive and powerful forces. There are no guarantees. She wants to shout, but instead, closes her eyes and sits. \nSTEPHANIE Just tell me what to do. Rham Jas considers. A dark look crosses his face. Stephanie tries to read his expression. \nCLOSE ON STEPHANIE'S MASTERCARD It's run through the carbon paper. Rham Jas hand her a receipt. She signs it. He sits. \nRHAM JAS We must somehow dissuade the spirit from taking your soul. \nSTEPHANIE How? \n", "test2_id": 1660, "test3_input": "RHAM JAS 1 A seance. And it should be soon. For tomorrow will be the third night... \nSTEPHANIE Have you done this before? \nRHAM JAS No. But I know someone. I can arrange what is necessary, but you must understand that everyone involved in this would be taking a great risk with their lives. \nSTEPHANIE What would you need from me? Rham Jas thinks for a moment, weighing the dangers. He pulls out a pipe and packs it with tobacco. He tamps it down and lights up. \nRHAM JAS Twenty thousand dollars. Cash. By tomorrow. 5 \nVA \nINT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nStephanie is hastily piling all her valuables atop her bed: sporting equipment, TV, VCR/DVD COMBO, CD player, IPOD, Etc. Ellen enters, rattled. \nELLEN I need to talk to you. \nSTEPHANIE Ellen. I'm sorry. This a bad time right now. I got a little emergency and... say you got any cash I can borrow? She starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag. \nELLEN No, I don't. But Steph I-- \nSTEPHANIE --what about your credit cards? What's your cash advance limit? \n(MORE) \nSTEPHANIE (cont'd) I'll pay you back. You know I'm good for it. \nELLEN Steph, we need to talk about the cat. \nSTEPHANIE Where has that little rascal been? He's always running off, have you noticed that? \nELLEN Stephanie. I was in the back yard and I saw where the ground was dug up. I started digging and... You buried that little kitty in our backyard. What happened? \nSTEPHANIE I didn't want to tell you. It fell out the window and died. It's sad, \nBUT-- \nELLEN I found the bloody knife in the bushes. \nSTEPHANIE What are you, a cat detective? \nELLEN Steph? I'm going to tell you this as your friend. There is something seriously wrong with you. Stephanie looks up from,her frantic panting. \n", "test3_true": "ELLEN I'm moving out. I can't live like this. \nSTEPHANIE. Fine. Ellen exits. Stephanie angrily calls after her: \nSTEPHANIE An' don't let the barn door hit you on your ass on yer way out! \nINT. STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nStephanie is speaking into a pay phone. \nSTEPHANIE I can't get the twenty thousand. You're gonna have to help me with what I've got. \nRHAM JAS' VOICE What do you have? She covers the mouthpiece, speaking to someone off camera. \nSTEPHANIE How much?! CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that we are'in a PAWN SHOP. Men haggle loudly in Arabic over the price of a gold chain. The PAWN BROKER stands before-all of Stephanie's worldly belongings: A toaster oven, computer, racing bike, stereo, microwave oven, necklaces, jewelry... \nPAWN BROKER Thirty-eight hundred for everything. \nSTEPHANIE Including my jewlery? \nPAWN BROKER Including. Stephanie curses under her breath, checks the balance on her checkbook, does the math, speaks into the phone; \nSTEPHANIE Six thousand. \nRHAM JAS I'm sorry. Not possible. \nSTEPHANIE Look, I'll give you six now and-- \nRHAM JAS No. There will be others involved and I cannot-ask them to accept such a risk for less. Good night. He hangs up. The line goes dead. She tries to throw the phone but it's attached with a short metal cord. She turns to the Pawn Broker. \nSTEPHANIE I'll take it! Stephanie thinks about how she'll get the extra cash. She hesitantly dials a number on the pay phone. It rings and rings as she glances to a picture buried deep in her wallet: A. photo of... The younger, obese Stephanie and her stern looking Mother. Both stand before a bleak snow covered, mid-western farm. \nSTEPHANIE Mom? Hi, it's me. Did you get,the Christmas card? Yeah, I guess it has been a while. Listen, I'm in kind of a fix, here. I've been pretty sick and I need to borrow some money for an operation. I need fourteen thousand dollars right away. Now I know you still have that pension fund at the credit Union so-- yeah, but... okay. Okay, it's just that--- I understand. Okay, mom. Bye. The line goes dead. She slumps down against the pay phone. \nCLOSE SHOT - STEPHANIE She pouts her lips in the mirror, carefully applying lipstick. Looking good. \nPULL BACK To reveal we are in the employee bathroom at the bank. She fixes her hair so it's just right.

{"train": "STEPHANIE I told you. No. Now beat it. \nMr. Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose. He looks suspiciously about the bank for the source of his allergy. 0 \nSTEPHANIE Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty home for me. \nELLEN Sure. If I can take the shoes. \nSTEPHANIE I told you, no. Mr. Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water. He turns to his \nSECRETARY. \nMR. JACKS Has someone brought a damned animal into my bank?! Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading him toward Stephanie's desk. \nSTEPHANIE Okay, fine! Take the shoes! \nHidden from Mr. Jack's view, Ellen quickly scoops up the Kitten and places it into her purse. As Mr. Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears: \nELLEN Just don't expect me to take care of it. This catches Mr. Jack's Attention. He turns to the ladies, wondering what they're talking about. Stephanie takes Ellen's hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye. \nSTEPHANIE Of course not. I'll take care of everything. And thanks for choosing Bank of California. Ellen plays along. \nT \nELLEN Okay. Then I'll see you later. I mean--- whenever the next time I'm in the bank. You know-- for a loan. \nOR-- \nSTEPHANIE Goodbye. As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks sneezes again, harder. \nMR. JACKS Someone has definitely brought an animal in here. He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits. \nSTEPHANIE I don't see any cats. Or any animals. \nMR. JACKS Hope to hell, not. \nSTEPHANIE By the way, I put the paperwork for the Mcpherson loan on your desk. \nMR. JACKS Mcpherson? \nSTEPHANIE That big corporate loan I've been trying to set up? It's just preliminary but-- \nMR. JACKS Oh, right. I'll look it over when I get the chance. \nINT. RAY'S UNIVERSITY OFFICE - LATER \nStephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement of the Mcpherson Corporation. Ray grades papers. \nRAY How're things at the bank? How's that new position looking? \nSTEPHANIE I don't know. \nRAY Really? You sounded so sure. \nSTEPHANIE Well, now there's this new guy... they're considering him too. Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close, taking her in his arms. \nRAY That job needs somebody with your experience. They know that. Stephanie nods. \nSTEPHANIE Oh, I've got something for you. She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He removes a coin. An old nickle. \nRAY A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find. Where'd you get it? \nSTEPHANIE One of the tellers found it for me. Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into his pocket. \nRAY Thanks. \nSTEPHANIE I'd better get back to work. She quickly gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his student's exams. The telephone RINGS. Ray hits the speakerphone. \nRAY. Doctor Dalton. It's the voice of an older woman, TRUDY. \nTRUDY ON SPEAKERPHONE Hello dear. \nRAY Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec? He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie: \nRAY I'll call you tonight. She kisses Ray and exits. \nINT. HALL OUTSIDE RAY'S OFFICE - DAY \nStephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink. \nRAY'S VOICE Nothing much. Just had lunch with Stephanie. And trying to get these midterms graded-- She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's speakerphone. She moves closer to Ray's office to eavesdrop: \nTRUDY'S VOICE --Stephanie? The one from the farm? \nRAY'S VOICE You know who she is. She's coming over for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad. \nTRUDY'S VOICE \nMR. JACKS That was one nutty old lady. You okay? Stephanie nods. \nMR. JACKS You handled that just right. And by the way, as far as the Assistant Manager's position... You're at the top of the list. \nSTEPHANIE Thanks. Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home. Stephanie loads a pile of contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box and exits the bank. The Security guard locks up behind her. \nEXT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY \nStephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off. It's then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler. It's parked in the structure. Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel. She nervously glances about. No sign of Mrs. Ganush. Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car. Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly than she would like. She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the lot. It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief. It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer. Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is carried off by the wind. Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled hands come up around her face! Mrs Ganush sits up in the back seat of her car! SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie! \nMRS. GANUSH (In Hungarian) You bitch! I pluck out your fucking eyes! Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards Stephanie's eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists, halting her. The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back of the front seat to pull even harder... Stephanie's neck is now bent so far back it's about to snap! Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It springs open. She swings it back over her shoulder! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's forehead. Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled shut. The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only tightens. Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and hits the gas. As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her shoulder harness with the last of her strength. The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her to see... an oncoming concrete column. Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her shoulder harness. But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat, impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force. Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash. In a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth. \nBoth women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her wits first. She reaches across Mrs. Ganush and opens the passenger door. Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's foot shoves her out. The old woman hits the ground hard but she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back in. Stephanie shifts the car into reverse. The opened passenger door knocks Mrs. Ganush back down to the pavement. The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column. Stephanie is dazed. Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the car. Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view mirror: Mrs. Ganush running closer,'SHRIEKING with old world rage! The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time! Mrs. Ganush furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail. \nSTEPHANIE I beat you, you old bitch! Next time take your Geretol! The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie looks about. Where'd she go? The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete and... CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters. The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her toothless maw down upon Stephanie.'s chin. Suckling it, gumming. The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy. Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away. Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth to Ste phanie's jaw. The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat. She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight. She GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING! Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and shoves it down the old lady's throat. Mrs. Ganush gags, trying to retch up the ruler. \nThen Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old 1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car. Stephanie hits the pavement. She shields her face with her hands, waiting, but the blow never comes. The old woman standing above her, WHEEZING. \nMRS. GANUSH You shamed me. The Old Woman reaches down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.'Ganush's gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of Stephanie's coat. She waves the button through the air, and breathes out a single word: \nMRS. GANUSH Lamia... Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over Stephanie. A cold wind makes her shiver. \nSTEPHANIE What--? What are you doing? Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman 1 moves it out of reach. \nMRS. GANUSH You want it? Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat pocket. \nMRS. GANUSH Soon it will be you, who comes begging to me. It begins tonight when you hear the cry. \nSTEPHANIE What cry? \nMRS. GANUSH The Lamia. It's coming for you. A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She swats it away. Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She leans against the car for support. When she finally looks up, Mrs. Ganush is gone. \nINT. POLICE STATION - SARGENT'S DESK - NIGHT \nStephanie and Ray have just finished filing a report with \nOFFICER NAIMARK. \nRAY What about a restraining order? \nOFFICER NAIMARK Well that's usually only something we do if there's a pattern of harassment. But like I said, we'll file a report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem. But once we send an officer around to have a word with, her, I don't think she'll be bothering you again. \nSTEPHANIE Thank you, you've been very helpful. \nRHAM JAS Then go. There are many who would claim to be seers. But they are not. Although you would pay them little... you would receive nothing. If you.are not serious, go. Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain. \nSTEPHANIE Wait. She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off, handing Rham Jas a credit card. \nRHAM JAS Platinum card. Very good. He swipes Ray's card through the credit card machine. INT Rham Jas'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT A sparsely furnished, dimly lit room. The walls are lined with old books. Rham Jas stands before Stephanie and Ray, who sit at a card table. Stephanie giggles with excitement. \nSTEPHANIE Sorry. Rham Jas smiles back. \nRHAM JAS That's quite all right. So, you wish to know something of your destiny. Very good. We shall see what the fates have in store. Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains. \nRAY Freud said destiny was not an act of fate but rather something created by our subconscious to control our conscious choices. \nRHAM JAS That is true. But... \"We should not pretend to understand the world only by intellect.\" \nRAY Carl Jung... \nRHAM JAS Yes. From his treatise \"Psychological types\". \nRay studies this strange man as he strikes a match and lights a candle. There's more to him than meets the eye. Ray brushes it off. \nRAY Jung-- the New Agers' favorite psychologist. \nRHAM JAS Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation. Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from Stephanie. \nRHAM JAS Your hand, please. Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas. He closes his eyes and concentrates. Stephanie smiles excitedly to Ray, who raises a skeptical eyebrow. \nRHAM JAS You,work with money. \nTO \nSTEPHANIE That's right! 4 \nRHAM JAS But... you've lost something. \nSTEPHANIE No. I don't think so. \nRHAM JAS No. No, you're right. Something's been taken from you. \nSTEPHANIE No, I- Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns it, revealing the threads. that once held the button on her coat sleeve. \nRHAM JAS A button. \nSTEPHANIE Well, yes! Some Old Woman... \nSTEPHANIE How did he know all that? \nRAY Know what? That you lost,a button?1 He makes some good guesses, stirs you up, leaving you with a lot of questions. And conveniently, his business card. C'mon, he's a scam artist. \nSTEPHANIE He didn't want the money. He tried to give the money back. \nRAY In the end, he took it, didn't he? \nSTEPHANIE I guess so. \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nRay and Stephanie step from the car. They open a rusting iron gate, and walk up the hilly path to Stephanie's slightly funky Silver Lake rental house. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT \nRay and Stephanie step inside. The kitten PURRS around Stephanie's feet. Ray picks it up. \nRAY So this is him. Got a name? \nSTEPHANIE Uh... just \"Kitty\" so far. \nShe takes the cat from Ray, cuddles it. \nRAY Sure you don't want me to spend the night? \nSTEPHANIE Don't tempt me. I've got to prep a presentation for the morning. \nRAY okay. Ray kisses her, opens the front door and exits. He calls back to her from his car: \nRAY Remember, dinner at my folk's house, tomorrow night. We're supposed to bring desert. I could pick something up? \nSTEPHANIE No. I'm planning on baking my special cake. \nRAY Sounds good. Try not to stay up too late. Ray waves and steps into his car. Stephanie watches him drive off. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nStephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas, entering financial data into her laptop. An episode of \"Desperate Housewives\" plays in the background on TV. A baking timer CHIMES. Stephanie removes a beautifully browned cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool. Her roommate, ELLEN, comes down the stairs, snuggling the kitten. \nSTEPHANIE Isn't he adorable? \nELLEN Let's hope the landlord thinks so. She sets down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag. 0 \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE - LATER \nDOCTOR RANGIVERTZ, wearing jeans and a UCLA basketball sweatshirt, concludes his interview with Stephanie. He carries a small black medical bag as he steps from the living room to speak with Ray. \nDOCTOR RANGAVERTZ Ray, you were right to call me. Never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient. \nRAY What do you think? \nDOCTOR RANGAVERTZ 1b Medically, she's fine. She's just very distraught. She's displaying some paranoia and a sense of panic. Classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder. Probably a result of being assaulted by that old woman. Doctor Rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it to Ray. \nRAY How worried should I be? \nDOCTOR RANGAVERTZ We'll have to wait and see. \nINT. RAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n'Stephanie lays peacefully in bed, almost asleep. A bottle of sedatives on the bedside table. Ray pulls up the blanket around her exposed shoulder. Stephanie sighs, turns to him. \nRAY How you doing? \nSTEPHANIE Better now. At the time it just seemed so real. I'm so embarrassed. \nRAY Don't be, you had a terrible day and you.got a little wigged out. It happens. \nSTEPHANIE po, what now, Doc? \nRAY I was gonna surprise you, but what the hell. I've been planning a little trip for us this week end. Saturday morning we're taking a train to Santa Barbara. \nSTEPHANIE Really? \nRAY My family owns a cabin up there. In, the hills. Overlooking this little river. We'll light a fire, drink some champagne and screw our brains out. \nSTEPHANIE You sure know how to talk to a girl. \nRAY It's a chance to just be together. Undisturbed. There's a lot of stuff I want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to be the right time. \nSTEPHANIE Sounds nice. She draws in a deep breath and for the first time that evening, she looks at peace. Ray watches, her as she closes her eyes and drifts off to sleep. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. RAY'S BEDROOM - MORNING \n.Tweeting birds and filtered sunlight streaming in through the window, awaken Stephanie. She stretches and looks to the empty pillow next to her. Ray is gone. She tries to fall back asleep, but the sound of a dripping faucet keeps her awake. Frustrated, she gets out of bed and steps into the bathroom. WITHERED HANDS clamp around Stephanie's throat, violently SHAKING her! \nSTU RUBIN Hi Steph. Just getting here? \nSTEPHANIE What are you, the hall monitor? \nSTU RUBIN Ha ha! You're funny, Steph. \nSTEPHANIE What do you want? \nSTU RUBIN I need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures. \nT \nSTEPHANIE I've got a lot on my mind. Let's do it tomorrow. \nSTU RUBIN Sure. I'll just tell Mr. Jacks that you don't have the time right now. Maybe he can show me. She glances up. Mr. Jacks'is still watching her. \nSTEPHANIE No, no, that's all right. I'll do it. Where were we? \nSTU RUBIN We were going over the asset-based lending guidelines. \nSTEPHANIE Right. Okay. Let's say your client is a company that can't get traditional bank financing but 10 needs a secured loan. We offer-- \nSCRATCH... SCRATCH... Stephanie looks around for the source of the sound, but can't find it. \nSTU Yeah? \nSTEPHANIE .uh, we offer several types of asset-based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivables, their inventory, machinery-- , \nSCRATCH... SCRATCH... Stephanie sees... That Stu's hand has been replaced by MRS. GANUSH'S... it's yellowed fingernails SCRATCH across her desk. She looks again, and Stu's hand has returned to normal. \nSTU ---and? \nSTEPHANIE (in her full Missouri twang) --And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk! Stu is taken aback by Stephanie's outburst. He retreats to his desk in confusion. Stephanie sits, rattled. A drop of blood falls onto a piece of paper on her desk. The blood is trickling from her nose. Stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding. She looks down to see a large black fly land upon the drop of blood. She gasps and stands, her mind racing. She knows what she must do. She finds Mrs. Ganush's loan documents. She stuffs them into a folder, grabs her purse and bolts for the exit. Mr. Jacks engaged with a customer, calls after her: \nMR. JACKS Stephanie? Where are you going? She moves quickly out the door, pretending not to hear him. \nStu watches Stephanie go and gets up from his desk. She's left some files behind. He snoops around his desk. He notices a folder marked CONFIDENTIAL. It's the McPherson loan file. Interesting. He picks it up. \nEXT. MRS. GANUSH'S HOUSE - DAY \nAn old, wood bungalow that has seen better days. A MOVING TRUCK in the driveway. Stephanie's car pulls up. she steps out, carrying Mrs. Ganush's loan documents. She passes the MOVING MEN who load the last of Mrs. Ganush's things. She arrives at the opened front door, gathers her courage and KNOCKS. No answer. She calls out: \nSTEPHANIE Mrs. Ganush? No answer. She steps inside. \nThe Old Woman's CACKLING can still be heard as Stephanie hurries to her car and drives off. \nEXT. SEVEN ELEVEN PARKING LOT - LATER \nStephanie site in her parked car. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S CAR \nStephanie is eating from a package of DOUBLE STUFF OREOS, joylessly jamming one after another into her mouth. Her eyes dart about: Who could help her? Then she remembers something. She sets down the cookies and rummages through her purse. She finds the business card of Rham Jas. She starts the car and drives off. \nEXT. INTERSECTION - DAY \nTO \nStephanie halts at a red light. out of the corner of her eye she sees something odd. \nSTEPHANIE'S POV - ON THE STREET Stu Rubin walking with two well dressed executives. \nSTEPHANIE Stu? The men warmly escort into the First National Bank. \nSTEPHANIE What's he doing at First National? The car behind her HONKS! She drives on. \nEXT. RHAM JAS' STOREFRONT - DAY \nStephanie's car is parked in the street. \nINT. STOREFRONT - DAY \nStephanie stands before a counter facing Rham Jas. He swipes her credit card through the machine. She signs the receipt. He motions for her to follow him through the beaded curtain. INT. BACK ROOM OF RHAM Jas'S STOREFRONT - DAY on a plain wooden table.a samovar brews a musty tea. Rham Jas is reading from an ancient text. He looks up from the book,- solemn. \nRHAM JAS What did it sound like. \nSTEPHANIE Like... shrieking. It was awful. He nods. Closes the book. \nRHAM JAS That would be the Lamia. The \"Black Goat\". \nSTEPHANIE Lamia. Right. That's the word the old woman used. \nRHAM JAS It is a nasty spirit. A taker of souls. A creature of misfortune for you and those around you. It is often summoned by the Gypsies for their dour deeds. On the third day the Lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object. \nSTEPHANIE Accursed object? What object? \nRHAM JAS Something that the old woman took from you, cursed, then gave back. Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the threads on her coat. \nSTEPHANIE Here kitty-kitty... Here, kitty- kitty-kitty... She moves closer until her face fills the screen. \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nThe distant SCREAM of the kitten is heard. We hear it again and again until it is finally silenced. 4 \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nStephanie having been sick, emerges from the bathroom, wiping her mouth. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN -DAY \nStephanie throws something small and bloody inside the microwave oven and turns it on. \nSTEPHANIE'S BACKYARD GARDEN AFTERNOON She buries the heart in a corner of her garden. She turns on the garden hose, washing the cat's blood from the knife. \nELLEN'S VOICE Steph? Stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes. Ellen appears. \nELLEN t Didn't you hear me calling? I was looking all over for you. Are you power eating Clark bars again? 'Cause there's about ten thousand wrappers all over the-- Oh my God, is that blood?1 Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden. But no blood shows. \nSTEPHANIE No. Why would there be blood? \nELLEN Right there, on your sleeve. Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve. \nSTEPHANIE That's just tomato juice. I was inside making a salad and... I cut a tomato and I must have gotten it on my sleeve. Ellen gives her roommate a worried look. \nELLEN Look, Steph, we're friends so if something's wrong... \nSTEPHANIE I had some problems. A situation. But I think everything is going to be good now. Ellen isn't so sure. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nStephanie closes her bedroom door so Ellen can't see the damage. Stephanie cleans up the place. As she picks up some of her things, she comes across an old photograph. CLOSER: It's a photo of 16 year old Stephanie. She was obese. Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a \"4- H\" tee shirt. She stands before some barnyard animals, a bucket of feed in her hand. \nStephanie looks distastefully down at her former self. She tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket. \nINT. KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON \nThe music grows lighter as Stephanie models a couple of dresses in front of Ellen, who's helping decide on the evening's wardrobe. \nELLEN Go with the short skirt. \nSTEPHANIE What about this one? She hold up a longer, more formal dress. \nRAY Maybe. But in the end, it's about what you and I want. \nSTEPHANIE Is that so? Ray gives her a reassuring nod. The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, GEORGE AND TRUDY DALTON. Behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished foyer. \nTRUDY \nRAYMONDL She kisses her son. \nRAY Stephanie, this is my mother, Trudy, and my Father, George. Trudy glances at Stephanie's revealing cocktail dress with thinly veiled disapproval. Stephanie self-consciously tugs it lower. \nTRUDY How do you do? \nGEORGE Nice tp meet you, Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE It's very nice to meet you, too. \nGEORGE Please, come in. \nSTEPHANIE Thank you. \nA \nShe steps inside. \nINT. DALTON'S HOUSE \nSTEPHANIE You have a lovely home. \nGEORGE Thanks. I'll get us something to drink. As George exits, Stephanie presents her home made cake to Trudy. \nSTEPHANIE I hope you don't mind. I baked something for you. Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie. \nTRUDY It's lovely. Homemade. \nSTEPHANIE It's a harvest cake. \nTRUDY Harvest cake? Is'that some kind of cake you make on a... farm? \nSTEPHANIE We used to, yeah, when you have a lot of extra duck eggs. Especially right before spring; that's when you get a real dense yolk. Makes for, rich cake. The mother forces a smile. \nTRUDY You must give me the recipe sometime. \nSTEPHANIE Sure. It's easy. The real secret's in the milk. You want it unpasteurized. \nSTEPHANIE Well, I was reading the Wall Street Journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but didn't have the liquidity. I met with their CFO and presented a formula for restructuring-some of their long term debt. It created an environment where I was able to offer them a rather attractive loan \nPACKAGE \nGEORGE You sure sound like you've got a lot going for you, Stephanie. \nTRUDY Your mother must be very proud. \nSTEPHANIE I suppose. I don't see her much. \nTRUDY Why is that? \nSTEPHANIE Well, ever since my dad died she doesn't talk much. She mostly stays on the farm and... keeps to herself. Because... There is an awkward silence. \nTRUDY Does your mother have a drinking problem? \nRAY Cut her some slack, mom, she-- \nSTEPHANIE Yes. I'm afraid she does. \nTRUDY I'm sorry. It's nothing to be ashamed of. And I find your honesty refreshing. \nSTEPHANIE Thank you. \nTRUDY t You've got back bone. Not like that other girl Ray brought by... What was her name? Alicia? She was dreadful. So ill-mannered. And no ambition. \nRAY \nMOM- \nTRUDY (stage whisper to \nSTEPHANIE) He found her through the,internet. \nRAY Mors, please. \nTRUDY Stephanie, am I being too tough on Ray? Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at Ray. \nSTEPHANIE No. Not at all. That's what mom's are for. \nTRUDY Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will try that Harvest cake of yours, after all. Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and emits a tiny cough. \nSTEPHANIE Excuse me. She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger. \nSTEPHANIE \nYou don't want to know. Ray pulls her close. \nRAY Tell me! \nSTEPHANIE The thing that's coming for me. What the old woman sent. \nRAY Listen to me. What you're going through right now-- It's like the doctor said, it's a stress reaction and -- \nSTEPHANIE No. I wanted to believe that-- but it's real, Ray. You just don't want to open your eyes to it because it threatens you. Because if I'm right and there is something out there, then you'd have to throw out everything you teach. And where'd that leave you? Like a plow without a mule. Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if maybe she isn't right. \nSTEPHANIE Unless you're willing to take a chance and believe in me, I can't be with you any more. She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail lights, as they vanish into the night. \nEXT. ECHO PARK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nAn older home with bars on the front windows. Stephanie knocks at the front door. She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched SQUEAL. Was it just a bus's air brakes... or something more? When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack. An EYE peers out at her. \nVOICE OF THE EYE What is it? \nSTEPHANIE Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia Ganush. Is she here? The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck. She wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts. EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from within the house. \nILENKA I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter. Who are you? \nSTEPHANIE Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of... a friend of hers. Actually, I've been trying to help her with a loan \nTHAT- \nILENKA Wait. I know who you are. Grandma told me you'd come. You're the woman from the bank. The one who took her house. \nSTEPHANIE It was really the bank that took the house. I just work there. In fact, I tried to help your grandma get-the house back, but my boss wouldn't let me. Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows. \nILENKA That's not what happened, is it? Are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face? \nSTEPHANIE . no. \nILENKA You used to be a real fat girl, to didn't you? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nILENKA I can tell. You know, you caused my grandma a lot of pain. That house was her pride. When you took that from her, she had nothing left. You're not welcome here. She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate now, no where else to turn. \nSTEPHANIE Okay! I did it. It was me who denied her the loan. I was trying, to get ahead at work and I shouldn't have done it. It was wrong. \nRHAM JAS 1 A seance. And it should be soon. For tomorrow will be the third night... \nSTEPHANIE Have you done this before? \nRHAM JAS No. But I know someone. I can arrange what is necessary, but you must understand that everyone involved in this would be taking a great risk with their lives. \nSTEPHANIE What would you need from me? Rham Jas thinks for a moment, weighing the dangers. He pulls out a pipe and packs it with tobacco. He tamps it down and lights up. \nRHAM JAS Twenty thousand dollars. Cash. By tomorrow. 5 \nVA \nINT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nStephanie is hastily piling all her valuables atop her bed: sporting equipment, TV, VCR/DVD COMBO, CD player, IPOD, Etc. Ellen enters, rattled. \nELLEN I need to talk to you. \nSTEPHANIE Ellen. I'm sorry. This a bad time right now. I got a little emergency and... say you got any cash I can borrow? She starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag. \nELLEN No, I don't. But Steph I-- \nSTEPHANIE --what about your credit cards? What's your cash advance limit? \n(MORE) \nSTEPHANIE (cont'd) I'll pay you back. You know I'm good for it. \nELLEN Steph, we need to talk about the cat. \nSTEPHANIE Where has that little rascal been? He's always running off, have you noticed that? \nELLEN Stephanie. I was in the back yard and I saw where the ground was dug up. I started digging and... You buried that little kitty in our backyard. What happened? \nSTEPHANIE I didn't want to tell you. It fell out the window and died. It's sad, \nBUT-- \nELLEN I found the bloody knife in the bushes. \nSTEPHANIE What are you, a cat detective? \nELLEN Steph? I'm going to tell you this as your friend. There is something seriously wrong with you. Stephanie looks up from,her frantic panting. \nSTEPHANIE Mr. Jacks, this is kind of awkward for me... I know it's not official yet, but I was wondering if I could get a copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me? \nMR. JACKS The assistant manager's position? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. See, one of my family members is having a little emergency which requires me to get them an immediate loan-- \nMR. JACKS --Stephanie... There's a problem. The McPherson deal was cancelled last night. \nSTEPHANIE What? 1 \nMR. JACKS Yeah, right after I informed the main branch that we had this big loan pending,,I find out that they just made their deal over at First National. I got a call in to see, what exactly happened but right now this doesn't look too good for you or me. So this assistant manager promotion has been delayed. In fact, I think that with everything that's been happening, I'm gonna have to give that job to Stu. Stephanie is devastated. \nSTEPHANIE Stu. I see. Mr. Jacks sees tears begin to well up in her eyes. \nMR. JACKS I'm sorry. Look. If you've got family problems. Maybe you should take the day off and sort them out. Stephanie node and exits the bank. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT - THE WALL CLOCK As it TICKS away the seconds. CLOSE SHOT - THE Inadequate PILE OF CASH That site atop Stephanie's Kitchen table. \nCLOSE SHOT - A DESPONDENT STEPHANIE stares down at the cash. Her mouth mechanically opens to accept a large serving spoon of Rocky Road ice cream which she eats directly from the one gallon tub. The door bell rings. A moment later Ray walks in.. Stephanie stands, surprised. \nRAY. I paid Rham Jas \nSTEPHAINE But I thought you didn't believe... \nRAY' I don't. But you do. I know this is important for, you . she embraces him. \nEXT. PASADENA HOUSE - DUSK \nAn old Pasadena home site alone atop a hill. Ray's car drives up, parks. \nSTEPHANIE Are you coming in? \nRAY \nT I wanted to but Rham Jas said non believers weren't welcome. I still don't like this. \nSTEPHANIE I know how crazy this must seem. But it will all be over after this I swear to you. He nods. She kisses him. \nSTEPHANIE I'll call you when it's done. \nRAY I'll be waiting. \nSHAUN SAN DENA Once the spirit has entered me, place my hand upon the animal. Do you understand? \nSTEPHANIE Yes. \nSHAUN SAN DENA I will force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat. Milos, that's when you strike. Stephanie blanches but remains silent. \nSHAUN SAN DENA We must all.be receptive. Shaun San Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant. Stephanie leans close to speak quietly with Rham Jae. \nSTEPHANIE What do I have to do? \nRHAM JAS You must allow the darkness in. You must invite the dead to co-mingle with your spirit.. \nSTEPHANIE I'm scared. \nRHAM JAS Yes. Now repeat these words... I welcome the dead into my soul... Rham Jae waits for Stephanie's response. She's shifts in her seat uncomfortably. \nSTEPHANIE I welcome the dead into my soul... \nRHAM JAS You must believe it! Stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant again. This time,, together. \nRAM JAAS STEPHANIE I welcome the dead into my I welcome the dead into my soul... soul... Stephanie looks around the darkened room. Shadows from the candles dance upon the walls. \nSHAUN SAN DENA I sense something here with us. \nRHAM JAS Yes. The parlor's crystal chandeleir tinkles. A tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment. Stephanie's eyes search the room. \nSOMETHING UNSEEN emits a wheezing breath... We hear FOOTSTEPS as something walks on the ceiling above them. \nA MAN'S LOUD LAUGHTER echoes about the room. \nSHAUN SAN DENA It is not the Lamia. It is the spirit of some unsettled soul from \nyears ago... The unsettled ones wait near the door. \nTHE PITCHER OF WATER upon the table is drained. Then the water is spat out in a stream at Milos' face. The MAN'S LAUGHTER again. \nSHAUN SAN DENA Be gone, foolish spirit! There is a HOWLING OF WIND and the room is again quiet. \nSHAUN SAN DENA Show yourself Lamia. We invite you into our circle. Quiet. Stephanie looks about. Nothing seems to be happening. \nSHAUN SAN DENA He's coming... \nA faint sound. \nSHAUN SAN DENA My heart. Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms. Rham Jas moves to assist her. They lower Shaun San Dana to the floor. \nRHAM JAS Milos, call an ambulance! \nMilos rushes from the room to call for help... Rham Jas checks for a pulse. \nRHAM JAS She's not breathing. Rham Jas attempts to administer CPR to no avail. \nSTEPHANIE My God. My God... He checks her pulse one last time. The CPR is finally halted. Rham Jas closes her eyes, then touches her forehead, praying: \nRHAM JAS Gata, gata, para gata... bodhi suaha. Gone, gone, gone beyond. Gone beyond the beyond. Hail the goer. \nEXT. PASADENA HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER \nStephanie and Rham Jas watch as PARAMEDICS load the covered body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance. They close the doors and drive away. \nSTEPHANIE It's sad: \nRHAM JAS Yes. \nSTEPHANIE Strange how things work out. She waited years for another chance to overcome the lamia ..and finally she did. \nRHAM JAS No. I'm afraid you misunderstand. Rham Jas looks at her with pity. \nSTEPHANIE What? \nRHAM JAS The,Lamia can not'be banished by a medium. This was our lesson tonight. I'm sorry. \nSTEPHANIE \nBut I saw her get rid of the thing... \nRHAM JAS No. You saw her drive the Lamia from the seance. That is all. It will be back. \nSTEPHANIE But then, what am I supposed to do? Rham Jas shrugs. He fishes in his pocket for his car keys. \nRHAM JAS Perhaps on this final evening, you should finish up the business of this world. For before the night is through, the Lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object. \nSTEPHANIE'S HAND Slowly emerges from her coat pocket. She studies the thin brass button in her palm. 0 \nRHAM JAS Unless, of course... you were no longer the owner. \nSTEPHANIE No longer the owner? I don't understand. Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank envelope. He places the button within and seals it. \nLONG SHOT - THE GRAVE Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction. It has become the drain hole of the cemetery. \nTHE INFLUX OF MUD pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the mud. The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO PULL AWAY when... \nSTEPHANIE'S HAND rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root. \nSTEPHANIE'S HEAD Breaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air. She claws her way out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN \nSTEPHANIE steps from the shower, quickly towels her hair. She stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror. She has survived. The phone RINGS in the bedroom; the machine picks up. \nMR. JACKS' VOICE Stephanie. It's Jim. Jim Jacks. Sorry I'm calling so early-- but Last night I found some troubling information about our friend Stu Rubin... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN \nA cleaned up Stephanie, her hair still wet from the shower, drives the empty morning streets. A smile slowly comes to her face as we hear the rest of Mr. Jack's message: \nMR. JACKS' VOICE Apparently he stole your file on 4 the Mcpherson loan and then tried to broker his own deal at First Federal. I guess he thought we wouldn't find out. When I confronted him he broke down crying and well, we won't be seeing him around anymore. \nEXT. TRAIN STATION - PARKING LOT - PRE DAWN \nThe Eastern sky is growing brighter. Stephanie's car pulls into the lot. She removes a week end bag from her trunk and walks briskly toward the station. \nMR JACKS \n(V.O.) It looks like the loan's coming back to us. And I just wanted you to know that come Monday morning, that assistant manager's position will be waiting for you. \nINT. TRAIN STATION - GRAND ENTRANCE - PRE DAWN \nStephanie is smiling as she enters the station. \nA MRS. FIELDS REPRESENTATIVE holds a platter of freshly baked cookies and offers free samples to passersby. One is offered to Stephanie. She politely declines as she walks past with a bounce in her step. \nINT. TRAIN STATION - CLOTHING BOUTIQUE \nShe stops at the window, admiring a coat on display. She glances down at her own coat. Notes the missing button. with distaste. Inside, a SALESWOMAN is preparing to open the shop. Stephanie taps on the window, shouts through the glass: \nSTEPHANIE Hey! Good morning. \n", "test1_input": "DRAG ME TO HELL \nWritten by \nIvan Raimi & Sam Raimi \nSeptember, 2007 \nINT. BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN \n22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep as the alarm clock BUZZES. She hits the snooze button and plops back down onto the pillow. After a few seconds of pure sleeping bliss, she wills herself up. She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a \"Hang in there, baby\" poster and into the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nStephanie turns on the shower. While waiting for the water to heat up, she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated pronunciation, recites: \nSTEPHANIE There is no friction, with proper diction. Good sounds abound, when the mouth is round. She catches herself on the last word, a hint of \"Missouri twang\" slipping through. \nSTEPHANIE Round. Yawn. She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the steaming shower. \nINT. KITCHEN -- MORNING \nShe opens the refrigerator: A half grapefruit sits next to an inviting slice of chocolate cake. She's tempted, but chooses the grapefruit. \nEXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING \nA sunny Southern California day. Commuters speed by. Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE, across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward the intersection. The traffic signal changes to \"Don't Walk\". A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street. Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign. She looks down to see a little KITTEN. It rubs against her ankles and PURRS. \nSTEPHANIE Well, you're a little cutie. \nA car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming VAN. Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten and places it safely down on the other side of the street. \nSTEPHANIE Hey! Slow down! The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks Stephanie's face. She sets it down. \nSTEPHANIE Go on home. Shoo now! She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back, frowning. \nSTEPHANIE Shoo! \nINT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA -- DAY \nStephanie site at her desk, across from a young MEXICAN COUPLE. She studies their mortgage. application. \nMEXICAN MAN We keep getting the same thing. Because I'm not employed by an American company, they won't take my application until they get my solvency statement. And the Mexican Treasury Department says that's going to take at least four more weeks. \n", "test1_true": "STEPHANIE It says, here your employed by Pemex? \nMEXICAN That's right. \nSTEPHANIE Isn't Pemex a subsidiary of Union Oil? \na MEXICAN MAN Yes. So? 0 \nSTEPHANIE So technically, your employer is an American company. I think we can make this work. I'll call you this afternoon and let you know. The happy couple shake Stephanie's hand and exit. ELLEN, Stephanie's pretty, twenty two year old, roommate, flops down into the seat across from her. \nELLEN I need clarification on the shoe issue. \nSTEPHANIE Okay... \nELLEN First of all-- you know you've got the only perfect pair of black dress shoes in L.A. So was that a definite, irrevocable, \"no way\" or t just a rather not at this time, \"no way\"? \nSTEPHANIE It's an absolutely, positively, forget about the shoes already, \"no way\". They're my only good pair and I need them in good shape for tomorrow. \nELLEN What's Up? \nSTEPHANIE Dinner with Ray's parents. Ellen picks up a desktop photo: A shot of Stephanie and her handsome boyfriend, Ray, locked in an embrace, standing in the spray of a waterfall. \nELLEN Ray's got a nice butt. Really tight \nAND--- Stephanie takes back her photo. \nSTEPHANIE 1 --I know. Thanks. \nELLEN He's a keeper. But I told you about his mom, she's another story. I used to waitress at her country club, and with her, it's all about what private school you went to and who you know. You still up for that promotion? That would help. Stephanie looks longingly to... \nTHE VACANT OFFICE of the former Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The executive chair. Waiting to be filled. Stephanie turns back, pushing the thought away. \nSTEPHANIE I'm not putting on a show. She'll either accept me for who I am or not. \nELLEN Are you reading self help books again? The Kitten peers out through Stephanie's partially opened desk drawer. \nELLEN Hello there! Ellen reaches for the Kitty but Stephanie waves her off. \nSTEPHANIE --Shhhl I can't let my boss see him. Stephanie glances to her manager, MR. JACKS, a heavyset man sitting behind a large desk. \nELLEN What about the shoes? \n", "test1_id": 1659, "test2_input": "MRS. GANUSH The trucks are there now. The men are packing all my things. Private things. Please, make them stop. This is my home for twenty years. And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye. Mrs. Ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye. Stephanie hides her revulsion. \nSTEPHANIE Well... do you have the payment with you now? \nMRS. GANUSH I hope to get it soon. I just need a little more time. \nSTEPHANIE I don't think my manager is going to extend you anymore credit. I'd like to help but... \nMRS. GANUSH Please. Won't you try? \nSTEPHANIE Okay. Wait here. Stephanie stands and moves off. The Old Woman picks through a bowl of hard candies on Stephanie's desk. Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her without looking up from his work. \n1B \nMR. JACKS What's up? \nSTEPHANIE I've got an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment.. They're in the process of repossessing her home. She's on a fixed income and she's had some medical problems. I was wondering if we could give her a break. Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his bifocals, studies it. Stephanie glances over her shoulder. \nSTEPHANIE'S P.O.V. - HER DESK Mrs. Ganush looks around to. make sure no one's watching, then tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse. She reaches. into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she wraps in her linen handkerchief. She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it with a wet SUCKING sound. The Old Woman's one good eye, wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat. \nMR. JACKS Apparently, we've already granted her two extensions. And you know on this type of foreclosure, the bank makes a sizable amount in fees. He hands her back the file. \nSTEPHANIE It would mean I'd have to throw her out of her house. \nMR. JACKS Tough decision. Your call. He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies her. Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The thick carpet. She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his workstation. \nSTEPHANIE I'll take care of it. Stephanie returns to her desk. \nSTEPHANIE Mrs. Ganush, another extension on the loan is out of the question. \nMRS. GANUSH What? \nSTEPHANIE I'm sorry. \nMRS. GANUSH No. Please, it's my home... I'm begging you. \nSTEPHANIE I tried to talk my boss into it but he just wouldn't approve. \nMRS. GANUSH But where will I live? \nStephanie leafs through the loan documents. She finds a name. \nSTEPHANIE Mrs. Ganush, you've given your granddaughter as a reference... It says here, she lives nearby... Wouldn't you be better off living with her? \n", "test2_true": "STEPHANIE Okay well, there's several fine \"assisted living\" facilities for the elderly. \nMRS GANUSH A nursing home? No. I will never live in one of those places1 \nSTEPHANIE Well, of course, that's your choice. \nMRS. GANUSH It's yours. \nSTEPHANIE I'm sorry there's nothing I can do. Mrs. Ganush begins to sob. \nMRS. GANUSH I am proud woman, Miss Brown, and never have I begged for anything. But I will beg for you now. This one time. I humble myself before you. \nSTEPHANIE That isn't necessary, please. Let's not make this personal. It's just the bank's policy. I'm really sorry Mrs. Ganush. Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly into a manila folder. she glances up but Mrs. Ganush is gone.. Stephanie turns in her chair and is startled to see the old woman, kneeling before her. She clutches Stephanie's leg with her gnarled hands. \nMRS. GANUSH Have mercy on me. Stephanie stands, tries to pull free, but the old woman will not release her leg. \nSTEPHANIE Please, let go. Customers turn to look. Mr. Jacks glances up from his desk. \nMR. JACKS What the hell? \nMRS. GANUSH I, Sylvia Ganush, beg. On my mother's grave, I beg you. \nSTEPHANIE Please, take your hands off me. But the old woman only clutches tighter. \nSTEPHANIE t I'm calling security. She picks up the phone and presses a button. \nSTEPHANIE (into the phone) Could you please come over? Mrs. Ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in humiliation. \nMRS. GANUSH You shame me. She composes herself. Then, slowly stands, puffing up her chest. Mu3tering her damaged pride. \nMRS. GANUSH I begged you... Her one. good eye fixes it's hardened gaze upon Stephanie. \nMRS. GANUSH .and you shame me. Mrs. Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanie's arm. Stephanie tries to pull away but the old lady's grip is strong. Mrs. Ganush reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from Stephanie's wrist-- but the Security Guard intervenes. \nSECURITY GUARD I think your business here is finished, ma'am. The Guard escorts Mrs. Ganush from the bank. Through the banks's window, Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs. Ganush to a old, Chevy Cavalier on the street. Stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up, the old woman's car is gone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BANK - LATER \n16 The bank is closing.

Stephanie nods absently. The waitress exits. \nTHE WALL CLOCK The time is now 2:15 A.M. \nA WITHERED OLD MAN site alone at a table in a wheelchair. A portable oxygen cylinder, supplying him with air. \nSTEPHANIE takes a deep breath, stands and walks to his table. \nSTEPHANIE I wonder if you could help me out? The Old Man looks up, sees her desperation. \nOLD MAN 0 Yeah? \nSTEPHANIE I just need you to hang on to this envelope for me. Just until tomorrow. She extends the envelope to him. He hesitates. \nOLD MAN What's this all about? \nSTEPHANIE Just take the envelope and I'll explain. Please. The Old Man considers. He reaches for the envelope when an OLD WOMAN, his wife, hobbles toward the table. The Old Man helps her sit and puts away her cane. They turn to Stephanie who withdraws the envelope. \nSTEPHANIE Never mind. Stephanie returns to her seat, ashamed at what she almost did. She returns the envelope to the purse pocket, racking her brains, trying to think of some way out of this. Her gaze lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table. She grabs the paper and finds the OBITUARIES. \nCLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER: MRS. GANUSH'S OBITUARY: A photo of the old woman. The location of the burial is listed: Oakwood Cemetary.

Put it in their hand... their' pocket... \nSTEPHANIE (V.0.) Oh, I'll do better than that... CAMERA moves in tight. \nSTEPHANIE .I'll shove it down her goddamn throat. She zips up her raincoat. SOMETHING flits past the window. Too.quick to.see. Then it reappears. It's Mrs. Ganush's hankie. It.flies against Stephanie's windshield and gets caught on the wiper blade. Stephanie GASPS. It flaps in the wind, blocking her view. Stephanie hits the wiper button. The hankie is yanked-back and forth across the windshield. \nT \nShe turns up the wiper speed. No sooner is it knocked loose than it's whisked into the driver's side window. It slaps over Stephanie's eyes, plastered there by the'wind! The car swerves.

She carries the shovel defensively, ready to swat at anything that might leap out at her. She stops before a freshly dug grave. A temporary marker reads the name. \"Sylvia Ganush\". She's scared now, not sure if she can really go through with it. A church bell TOLLS five times. There's no time to think about it. Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is watching, then starts to dig. \nDISSOLVE TO: LATER - It's raining harder. The hole Stephanie digs is now several feet deep. CLUNK: The shovel has hit the buried coffin. The rain intensifies. \nDISSOLVE TO: LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave.

She grabs Mrs. Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched fist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut. Stephanie pulls with all her might, causing... \nMRS. GANUSH'S CORPSE to lurch up and out of the coffin. Her dead arms, thrown forward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie. Stephanie SCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes the corpse away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud. \nSTEPHANIE You'll take it, all right... She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old woman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth. She pries the jaw open.

Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs.. Ganush's face. It covers everything, except the jutting envelope and a single, staring white eye. Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick. She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up to her armpits. \nTHE HEAD OF MRS. GANUSH Bobs up, through the mud.

{"train": "JENNIFER EIGHT \nWritten by \nBruce Robinson \nJune 1991 \n1:  INT.  COMMUNITY HALL.   DAY. \nThe Church of St. Peter Los Angeles. \"WHOEVER YOU SEE HERE - WHATEVER YOU HEAR HERE - STAYS HERE.\" That's a notice on a wall. Here's another notice \"NO SMOKING.\" Everyone is smok- ing. This is an AA meeting. There's a lot of Faces to look at. I don't know when we'll get to the one that's talking, but when we do it's like this. Eyes like glue. 50 years old with a face the color of a snuff-users hanky. He says this: \nBENNY .. after my third recovery my wife made me swear I'd never bring another bottle into the house.  And I never did. I bur- ied it under the lawn.  Cut out a turf & stood it upright with a piece of tin- foil instead of a cork. So here we are out in the yard, and she's happy because I'm getting healthy in a pair of swim- ing shorts & no way near no booze. She decides to prune the roses. Meanwhile, I'm laying there with a straw stuck in- to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red .. \nCurious thing about drunks. Their disease often amuses them. \nThat's how crazy I was - I was sick for half a life till I finally found my san- ity again in these rooms. Don't take that drink - And for the one or two new faces I see here, I say this: just do it by the day. You gotta do it by the day - Don't take that drink. And keep coming to these meetings. Because here is where it works .. \nCHAIR Thank you, Benny .. We have a few more minutes .. Anyone else like to share? .. \nAsh into an ashtray and now a face. He's around 40 years old. Intense eyes & dark hair. Probably good looking when the ang- le's right. But this is a bad angle. His name is JOHN BERLIN. \nBERLIN My name's John .. and I'm an alcoholic .. \nALL Hi, John. \nBERLIN I didn't intend to speak today.  Matter of fact, I wasn't gonna come to the meeting .. But I wanna say a couple of things I hope may be of use, particularly as Benny says, to the new faces here. I first came into this fellowship ten months ago. I came to a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my last - how could a buncha drunks help me? - Then someone got up, I think it was Micky, and described himself as \"the shit around which the universe revolved.\" I don't know if that was original to him - it doesn't matter, it was the first time I'd heard it, and I still can't think of a better way to describe how I felt - We all have our own place in the darkness, and I was in such a mess I could hardly fucken see - I'd lost someone very dear to me - she hadn't died - I had - I don't know whether she left coza the drinking, or whether I drank coz I knew she was gonna leave - either way, the booze won - I replaced her with alcohol & anger - I was angry with her, myself, everyone and everything - Where I was I wanted to be someplace else - any place but here - any moment but now - But here I am, and it is now, and there's a big change about to hap- pen in my life - and I'm going for it coz this time I know I'm not running away - I'm actually two miles into a 600 mile journey, and I feel good about myself going there - So I stopped off to share that with you - and to thank everyone of you, and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here, free .. \n2:  EXT.  OAKLAND BRIDGE.  SAN FRANCISCO BAY.  DUSK. \nHigh above the Golden Gate. Too high for specifics. But there is something down there of interest to the Camera. Descending with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car. Too many and too distant to know which it is. But the Camera is follow- ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north. \nMaybe via a dissolve. And maybe not. But red and white either way as the headlights are coming on. The Camera is closing on the highway. And a car has definitely been selected. There is nothing much of interest about it. It's a blue Mercedes sedan. \nMussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts. The first puts the frame directly in front of the car. In a few moments its brights snap up. And Titles continue in a dazzle of light. \n3:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  101.  DUSK. \nNobody in the car except BERLIN. And a lot of cigarette smoke. Just time to wedge in a P.O.V. There's an intersection coming up. He hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind- ow down. Takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt. \n4:  EXT.  FREEWAY INTERSECTION.  DUSK. \nAn instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway. A heavy sky of red and black cloud. The Mercedes turns off head- ing east. This time the Camera doesn't follow. Remains static over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear. \n5:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  DAWN. \nBare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds. This house hasn't been lived in for years. No furniture other than a new mattress in the middle of the floor. Still in polythene wraps. \nBERLIN just about awake on top of it. Ten seconds of disorien- tation while he puts this together. A stone fireplace. Stairs leading to what's got to be a tiny room above. With enough ef- fort this place could be charming. But right now it's a wreck. \n6:  INT.  KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN. \nThis kitchen was out of date by 1963. A huge china sink and a fat fridge. But the cooker works and a battered old kettle is already on the gas. T-shirt and instant coffee. BERLIN checks cupboards out. Crockery includes a cup and that'll do for now. \nHis lips articulate a silent expletive. The gas has just gone out. Tries to relight it without success. On hands & knees he explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door. \n7:  EXT.  OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD.  HOUSE.  DAWN. \nIn the garage he finds the gas cylinder.  Empty and so is the bastard with it. He drags fingers through hair in frustration. Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out. The view beyond he hardly cares to look at.  But if he does it is as follows.  Clouds massing on the horizon. Fields getting re- ady for rain.  His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away. His nearest Cow about 50. This house is remote and rural look- ing with a veranda out back. But BERLIN has no inclination for sight-seeing. As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in. \n8:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN. \nThe Voice comes via a police scanner. Most of this dialogue's bullshit. Illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about. BERLIN sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum and milk. He unwraps another Juicy Fruit and regrets it. Goes round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine. A reluctant decision is taken. Spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the kitchen. Starts unloading his leather bag. A flotsam of stuff is excavated including a 9mm Beretta and a pack of cigarettes. \nHe lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt. Wouldn't need a clairvoyant to realize he's trying to give up. Something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to the living room. There's a call going out for \"David 72 Sam 3.\" David 72 acknowledges and BERLIN clearly recognizes the voice. \n\"We have a 927D/ Springfield Street/ City Dump.\" But David 72 is already hired. \"I'm outside Emersons/ I wanna be the first horrible face of her day.\" BERLIN exhales through a smile. The Controller needs an E.T.A. for the 927? David 72 doesn't know. Advises her to roll a couple of cars and \"Secure the location.\" \n9:  EXT.  HILLSIDE.  SPRINGFIELD STREET.  EUREKA.  DAY. \nA Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon. It's the road to the city dump. Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage trucks. Everything is backed up. Nothing moves except the car. The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top. A Sheriff's car blocks the road. A Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in. \n10:  EXT.  ENTRANCE/TRACK/INFILL.  CITY DUMP.  EUREKA.  DAY. \nThe car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50's gets out. Looks like he hasn't slept in a while. And got the mood to go with it. Sports jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of laugh lines around the eyes. But you wouldn't want to get arrested by him. And especially not this morning. His name is FREDERICK T ROSS. \nTRAVIS You can drive down there, Sir .. \nROSS I'm already walking. Where is it? \nOne of those walking with him is a 10-year-old Kid with a Dog. TRAVIS looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache. \nTRAVIS On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there .. \nROSS He has? .. What's he doing here? \nTRAVIS He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K. \nThe track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires. \nROSS Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got? \nROSS I don't think Popeye would be here. \nVENABLES (V.O.) Dead dog over here, Sir ... \nROSS Find the knife. And Venab- les, is the coroner called? \nVENABLES Yes, Sir .. He's delayed .. \nBLATTIS Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you? \nBERLIN My pleasure .. Who's Popeye? \nBLATTIS Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T .. \nOff he fucks under an ailing sky. BERLIN lands a friendly grin. \nBERLIN So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing? \nROSS Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months. \nHe finds keys and change and a sandwich in the Wino's raincoat. \nHow does anyone dead as this lose a knife? \nBERLIN What about that kid, Ross? \nROSS Oh, shit. Of course. The kid. (Stands to shout) Travis. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so get it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at? \nTRAVIS stares up like he just stuck his dick in a light socket. \nTRAVIS I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir \nROSS Whatta you mean, \"horrible?\" \nTRAVIS I think I've found a hand. \n12:  EXT.  INFILL.  GARBAGE DUMP.  DAY. \nROSS crouches in garbage. Peers into a trash sack with assist- ance of a flashlight. \"You're right. It's a fucken hand.\" Pas- ses the light to BERLIN. His turn to examine the ruptured bag. \nBERLIN Looks like a woman's hand? \nBERLIN finally stands. Offs the flashlight. And hands it back. \nROSS What do you think? \nBERLIN I think you're here all day. \n13:  EXT.  INFILL.  GARBAGE DUMP.  DAY. \nPissing with rain and unspeakably miserable.  The 'grid-search' is in progress and 50 square yards of the dump have been ripp- ed to pieces. Intermittent voices from police radios. More veh- icles down below including an ambulance with hazards revolving. Up here half a dozen arc-lights scald off vapor. BERLIN search- es under a busted umbrella. Looks up and runs into ROSS's eyes. \nROSS How much longer we here? We're not gonna find nothing else .. ? \nHe wears a rubber cape & looks like a huge pissed-off Napoleon. \nBERLIN We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs? \nROSS The dogs? \nBERLIN Two dogs. He should do the dogs. \nAnd both turn towards a Voice shouting from deep in the gloom. \nVENABLES Sergeant - we got a brassiere over here. Looks like it could be blood. \nROSS Oh, shit. \nBERLIN Alright, I'm coming .. \nAnother intrusion from the radio. TRAVIS repeats the question. \nTRAVIS The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict? \nROSS Ask him. \nBERLIN Yeah, he can go ... \nROSS Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here. \nDid someone say something funny? Does BERLIN just about smile. \nBERLIN It's good to be with you, Ross. \nAnd this is probably the only time ROSS will look happy today. \nROSS Glad you finally made it, Bro ... \n14:  EXT.  CAR PARK.  POLICE STATION.  CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY. \nThe Mercedes descends an incline and parks. Brown Chevys and black & white patrol cars. Dismal lights and raining like it doesn't end. BERLIN gets out and unloads the trunk (aquarium & insulated picnic box). Slams the trunk and reveals BLATTIS. \nHe picks up a nicotine-stained left hand. Simultaneously a LAB TECHNICIAN wants BERLIN to sign in exchange for the picnic box. \nPATHOLOGIST I guess he was so drunk, he did- n't know which hand he was using. (Re box) What are you gonna do with it? \nBERLIN Depends how healthy it is. If it's any good, I'll try and get a print .. \nHe hands the clip-board back and remembers a question for ROSS. \nOh, Ross, that newspaper guy at the station, asked me if the hand was \"frozen?\" Why would he ask me that? \nROSS Frozen? .. I've no idea .. \nAnother fast fix on the Vic and BERLIN chews fresh gum. A need- le on a weighing machine quivers. \"The liver weighs 1420 grams.\" \nA few beers wouldn't do that to you, would they? \nPATHOLOGIST No, Freddy .. Not a few .. \n17:  INT.  KITCHEN.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  EUREKA.  DUSK. \nAn explosion of hugs in the kitchen. Everything happens at once. MARGIE ROSS is slim and dark and still looking \"twice as pretty.\" She's got compliments for BERLIN too if they can get out of each- other's arms \"You're looking wonderful, John.\" But greetings are better performed than described, so I'm leaving it to the actors. \nROSS You do a rush on three pizzas? \nHe emerges from the refrigerator wielding a bottle of champagne. \nMARGIE I'm not giving him Pizza. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner. \nROSS Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour .. \nHe detours via the kitchen door to shout upstairs. \"Hey. Bobby.?\" \nMARGIE Bobby's out .. What's the hurry? \nROSS Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat. \nMARGIE Freddy's new obsession .. \nBERLIN Who is who? \nROSS A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa .. \nROSS fights a difficult cork \"You wanna get some glasses, Honey?\" \nShe's an accounts-manager, very pal- ly with our mayor, up to her elbows in fraud, and I just can't prove it .. \nMARGIE So tonight she confesses? \nROSS Tonight I'm feeling lucky .. \nThe cork explodes and he goes for glasses but one isn't willing. \nBERLIN Not for me .. \nROSS What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is French champagne. \nMARGIE No it isn't .. It's Californian .. \nROSS Even better. \nBERLIN Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda .. \nROSS Since when did you drink diet soda? \nMARGIE Stop nagging him.  If he doesn't want it, he doesn't want it. You- 're quacking like an old duck .. \nAnd she's already at the fridge and popping a can of diet cola. \nHere you go, Honey .. You're looking wonderful, John .. I can't believe we got you here .. \nROSS How's the new residence? \nBERLIN O.K. \nROSS What does that mean? \nBERLIN Not too good in daylight .. \nROSS C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is \"God's Country,\" John. \n18:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThis in huge close-up. Focus hardens on a finger tip. A shock of light. The focus adjusts and a flash bulb fires again. BER- LIN moves away from the view-finder. Chewing gum stuck to the side of the camera returns to his mouth. He activates an auto- matic rewind. It fills the silence while he heads for a phone. \nA lot of paraphernalia and technical type of shit. The bullet- in board is filling up. Photographs chronicle the hours spent on the dump. He dials with eyes on the pictures. A dozen cata- logue discovery of the bra. \"This is Mike Blattis/I can't take your call right now/ If you have a message/You know the sound.\" \n19:  INT.  DUTY ROOM/CORRIDOR/ADMIN.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nA reel to reel tape recorder the size of a refrigerator domin- ates the room. A black board details day/night/weekend shifts. T.V. security monitors. A rack of night-sticks. And of course paperwork. VENABLES crouches over a desk filling something in. \nBERLIN Would you drop these off for me? \nBERLIN Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10. \nDaftest thing Ross ever heard. BERLIN is poised to make a print. \nROSS You want my advice? \nBERLIN Maybe? \nROSS Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that \"bye-bye.\" Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief .. \n22:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY. \nBERLIN & ROSS are opposite ends of a bed jammed on the stairs. \"Bastards. I gave em a 20 buck tip.\" Various navigational sug- gestions from ROSS win them another stair. Plus advice from a 12 year old called BOBBY. \"You gotta go left, Dad.\" ROSS knows he's gotta go left! Both heave as MARGIE walks out the kitchen. \nMARGIE You're all done except the floor. \nThe house is a zoo of furniture. Bullshit piled up everywhere. \nBERLIN You're a saint, Margie, thanks .. \nBy now she's got the apron off and her coat on. \"C'mon, Bobby.\" \nMARGIE Don't forget the wagon, Darlin? \nAnd off they go via a slammed door as the phone starts to ring. \n23:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  DAY. \nIn they stagger. The bed goes down. And BERLIN sprawls on top of it. Devastated for oxygen. \"Alright. That's it. I'm fucked.\" \nROSS You gotta stop smoking .. \nBERLIN I am stopping smoking ... \nROSS I don't mean this \"system\" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean stop .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, you can .. \nBERLIN How'd you do it, old man? \nROSS Someone bet me a dollar .. \nBERLIN A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar .. \nBERLIN manages to find air to sit. Reaches for the Ansa Phone. \nROSS Alright. I'll bet you fifty? \nFirst call comes from Delaware Roofing vis-a-vis the estimate. \nBERLIN Fifty dollars?  You got a bet. \nDuring these proceedings the machine has moved to another call. \n[MACHINE] [J.B./Ronzo/Got some results for you/ First/ the blood on the bra is human/ and it's not a popular brand/A.B. Neg and that's a rare one/Two/the blood on the brassie- re is compatible with the blood from the hand/Three/If you need anything else the official answer from all us Christians down here, is fuck off/Shoot me a duck/Bye] \nROSS What are you gonna do, Soldier? \nBERLIN I'm gonna dig up \"Jennifer.\" \n24:  INT.  (TELETYPE)/ADMIN.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nAnd here's part of the \"exhumation.\" CITRINE stares at a tele- type machine waiting for transmission on Jennifer to complete. Approximate date of birth/Approximate date of death/ Identity Unknown. Visible misgivings as he hauls it out and reads. One or two chairs already on desks. ROSS still at his pawing over documents with a detective called SERATO. Cigarette smoke and shirt sleeves. ROSS looks up and catches CITRINE as he passes. \nROSS Chief, I gotta talk to ya about this fat lady? \nCITRINE What about her? \nROSS She's making my life a misery .. I wanna give her a lie-detector test? \nCITRINE continues up the carpet. \"Alright, we'll talk about it.\" \n25:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nA florescent glow from a T.V. monitor supplies the only light. BERLIN vacillates interest between the scanner and the screen. \nCITRINE (O.S.) What is that? \nBERLIN Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here? (Green on the screen) It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something? \nBut CITRINE isn't interested in finger nails. He's staring at a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl. She wears a brassiere stuffed with newspaper and a black wig. (Welcome Jennifer Two) \nShe's almost identical to Jennifer. Slim - White - same age - bra size is even the same. Nicely made lady. \nCITRINE stares at the Dummy like he's gonna ask it a question. \nCITRINE How do you know her hair's black? \nBERLIN Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair. \nCITRINE What is all this Jennifer stuff? \nHe waves a handful of teletype before dumping it on a bench. \nBERLIN Lotta scratch-marks on your door? \nHELENA Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something? \nROSS Could I just refer you to this memo here, Sergeant? \nHe tries to get his notebook under BERLIN's nose.  But BERLIN isn't looking or listening but following HELENA into her hall. \nBERLIN Did Amber have a dog? \nHELENA Yes. \nBERLIN What color was it? \nHELENA I don't know. \nShe opens the door and ROSS is barely through before it slams. \n34:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nROSS baits BERLIN up the corridor. Ridicules in silence while counting imaginary winnings. Watch my lips! F.I.F.T.Y. HELENA walks innocent of the pantomime and BERLIN tries to ignore it. \nBERLIN .. if she writes, or calls, or any- thing at all, you let me know, O.K. \nHe bells the elevator refusing to acknowledge ROSS's bullshit. \nI'll leave a number with the office .. \nLips drill a whisper into his ear. \"Fifty fucken dollars, O.K.\" \nWhat exactly do you teach, Helena? \nHELENA Music composition .. and cello .. \nROSS Fifty of em. And I want em now. \nMeanwhile the elevator arrives triggering a Voice. \"YOU ARE NOW ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.\" Doors slide open and Christ look at this? What kind of eye-defect needs glasses like this? Lenses like ei- ther half of a glass ball.  He's early 30's and decidedly \"iffy.\" Is he student/staff or what? As he exits they enter staring aft- er him. As the doors close the MYOPIC turns to stare after them. \n35:  INT.  CHEVROLET.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DUSK. \nROSS drives and BERLIN studies Amber's file. \"Wanna beer?\" No answer but cans appear anyway from a pack between Ross's legs. \nBERLIN Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something .. \nROSS No, you didn't. \nBERLIN Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .. \nROSS No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll. \nBERLIN We're going. \nROSS Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime. \nROSS pops cans and hands one over. But BERLIN doesn't want it. \nBERLIN Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky .. \nROSS So am I. But where's my money? \nBERLIN Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it .. \nROSS Pay me, and I shut up. \nBERLIN I haven't got it. \nROSS Then give me that Zippo. \nBERLIN Why? \nROSS I need some security. I don't trust you anymore. \nBERLIN I had one puff on a pipe. \nROSS I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called \"cash.\" \nSnaps fingers \"Gimme the lighter.\" And he does to shut him up. \nI'll tell you what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna do you a big favor .. Forget the 50 and I'll keep this. \nBERLIN What do you want it for? \nROSS To throw out of the window. \nDoes it as he says it. Bye-bye Zippo! BERLIN can't believe it. \nBERLIN What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! .. \nROSS It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs? \nBERLIN I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that. \n51:  INT.  \"STUDIO\"/CONSERVATORY.  HOUSE.  DAY. \nDozens of repulsive paintings.  A truly repulsive painting \"By Numbers\" of the Mona Lisa in progress. The color codes are com- pletely fucked up. CITRINE wears a wooly hat and hates walking on crutches. BERLIN picked a bad day to come in here with this. \nCITRINE You're pushing this too hard. It's like you want me to say stop? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little? \nBERLIN Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been. \nCITRINE Then where's the body? .. Where's the body, and why's he hidden it? \nBERLIN He hasn't hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow. \nCITRINE Have you got a match on the bullet? \nBERLIN No. \nCITRINE Have you got a print from the hand? \nBERLIN No, Sir. \nCITRINE It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris .. \nBERLIN It's her hand. Her scars. Her dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing. \nCITRINE She's not \"missing.\" Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? No. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John. \nBERLIN If you're not gonna hear me, Chief .. \nCITRINE I have heard you. You just don't like hearing me. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, in this country, would put a task force together for a body part .. \nBERLIN We have a multiple homicide, Sir .. \nCITRINE We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig! \n52:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN arrives at the station in the same mood he left Citrine. Heads for his room and runs into ROSS's stare. Problems on his plate too. He sits at his desk looking uncharacteristically an- xious. What ever he's drinking isn't tea. He finds a bottle of J&B in a drawer and walks toward Berlin's freshly slammed door. \n52:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThe lab is stuffed with junk waiting his attention. (Dozens of common things made sinister by their labels and plastic sacks). ROSS delivers a dose of Scotch in a plastic cup. Pours himself another. Leans on a bench and gets into the pissed-off silence. \nROSS Did he shut you down? \nBERLIN All but .. How you doing? \nROSS I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators .. \nBERLIN I wish he'd tell that to Citrine. \nHe almost does the whiskey but reaches for chewing gum instead. \nHe thinks the kid shot the dog .. \nHe looks at ROSS like what-are-you-looking-at-me-like-that-for? \nHe didn't. \nROSS Did I say he did? \nBERLIN You looked like you did? \nROSS No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day. \nBERLIN He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank. \nSERATO walks in with a cigarette plugged into his ashen kisser. \nSERATO Flying colors ... \nROSS Say you didn't say that, Angelo? \nSERATO I said it. \nROSS Oh my God Mother's shit. Are we in it? \n54:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThis room and the interrogation room are linked with a one-way mirror. BERLIN looks through munching gum. EMERSON is 25 years old and many pounds of vexed flesh. But something about her ex- pression expects apology. SERATO paces the place chain-smoking. ROSS listens devastated as the EXPERT explains his lousy chart. \nEXPERT This is the important one. She gets a dead straight line, and that's an exceptional reading .. \nSERATO .. this is the stupidest thing we ever done. Fucking Citrine's gonna fire one of us for this .. \nROSS I can't believe it. I just know she someway busted it. \nEXPERT This is an honest girl. She couldn't lie if she tried .. \nBERLIN Is she lying, Ross? \nFor a moment there is an intense trust between ROSS and BERLIN. \nThe joke doesn't reach BERLIN. MARGIE's hand is on his shoulder. \nMARGIE Her loss, darlin .. \nAnd she heads for the lower deck. A sweet smile as she descends. \nAnyway, you're doing O. K. She's a sweet heart. \nAnd also playing the guitar \"In My Life.\" And she does it well. \nROSS Why's she blind, Bro? \nBERLIN Car accident. \nSlow banging of something swaying. And this exchange goes slow. \nWhole family wiped out. \nROSS No shit. \nA bleeper goes on one of the lines and ROSS twists in his seat. \nStrap me in. Here comes another. \nAnd he winds in yet another three quarters of a pound Mackerel. \nWorst day's fishing I ever had .. \nBERLIN It's been a great day. \nROSS dexterously extracts the hook with serious eyes on BERLIN. \nROSS You just go easy, Brother ... (Looks at fish) Alright, we're all goin home. \n59:  EXT.  CAR PARK AT BEACH.  DUSK. \nDarkness in about an hour. Wide over the car park. Sand dunes surround it. Practically deserted of cars. Headlights snap on focusing attention on a station wagon exchange of good-byes. \nHELENA (V.O.) I really liked Margie .. \nSilhouettes with exaggerated shadows walk across the car park. \nWhat does she do? \nBERLIN (V.O.) She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon .. \nHELENA (V.O.) Have you known her long? \nBERLIN (V.O.) I was married to her sister .. \nThe angle changes and is closer now. HELENA has taken his arm. \nYou don't ask what I'm like? \nHELENA I know what you're like .. \nBERLIN How d'you know what I'm like? \nHELENA Ross told me. \nBERLIN Really? What did he say? \nHELENA He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick. \nBERLIN He said that? What else did he say? \nHELENA Just your age. \nBERLIN Which is what? \nHELENA Fifty-seven .. I don't mind .. \nBERLIN is more amused than annoyed. They arrive at the car and his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from HELENA. \nBERLIN You wanna drive? C'mon we're in a car park, miles from any- where .. There's nothing arou- nd but nothing and sand dunes .. \n\"I can't drive a car.\" Doesn't like cars. But he's not hearing. \nC'mon it'll be fun. You can drive me around in circles .. \nNo lady ever had a driving lesson like this before. BERLIN all but sits in her seat. Arm on the back of it. Hand on the wheel. For a split second they're doing 60. Now they're doing about 4. \nThe Mercedes spirals in widening circles. Instructions and enc- ouragement from BERLIN .. O.K. .. Straight now .. The Mercedes straightens and heads through the dunes. \"It's a big car park?\" \nWe're going along a little track. \nHELENA may like driving but she doesn't like the sound of that. \nIt's O.K. It's not a public road. \nHeadlights behind them approach quickly. Disappear and reappear as they follow the geography of the dunes. BERLIN only now bec- omes aware of them. one more dip and they slam in. Her anxiety is misinterpreted. He takes the wheel. No problem. Let him pass. The vehicle is right up behind them. As it overtakes HELENA is scared. And still scared even though BERLIN has stopped the car. \nROSS Hey, we're not talking \"talk\" tonight. \nTAYLOR No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor. \nBERLIN A sailor? \nBy now TAYLOR is moving through the crush of faces behind them. \nTAYLOR Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John .. \nBERLIN How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere .. \nROSS Stop it. \nBERLIN I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files? \nROSS John, stop it. The case is on its ass, you're closed. (Reaches for a menu.) C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer .. \nAnd just that one moment of insanity as BERLIN downs it in one. \nAlright .. Let's have some wine .. \n64:  INT.  BOOTH.  \"ANGELA'S BAR.\"  NIGHT. \nA shabby booth with black and whites of the two unrecognizable Celebrities who ate here. Hamburgers are almost over and a bot- tle of wine almost drunk. Both look tanked and especially ROSS. \nROSS You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For nothing, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, fuck it. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this .. \nBERLIN Just makes to so God damned mad .. \nROSS You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril .. \nWaving his empty at the bar ROSS communicates need for another. \nHow d'you know this girl isn't lying to you .. Not lying as such, but mak- ing up stuff to keep you coming back? \nBERLIN She wasn't lying about the van. \nROSS Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been any van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's blind, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother .. \nBERLIN Sure. \nROSS You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved? \nBERLIN Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my \"Nervous Tick\" ... \n65:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nVery late and the only light comes from coloured bulbs pulsing on a Christmas tree. Apparent BERLIN has had too much to drink. Makes it to his desk and shuffles at the messages. One is just about important enough to get a close-up. \"TIME 18:52: SUBJECT: A MAN CALLED DAN STANLEY TELEPHONED:  SAYS THERE ARE 109 JOHNS WITH VOLKSWAGEN VANS IN BAY AREA: WILL TELETYPE INFO THIS P.M.\" \n66:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nBERLIN finishes typing something. Tears it out and seals it in an envelope. Shirt sleeves and yawns. He slumps in the chair & stares at \"Jennifer 8.\" Fuck this for a Friday night. He's had enough of it. Grabs several envelopes and turns out the lights. \n67:  INT.  ADMIN/OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nBERLIN emerges from one office and heads for another. J.K. Tay- lor on the door. Delivers the envelope and an his way out when something detains him. Lights on the tree strobe through venit- ian blinds. Illuminate bits and pieces of rattan. Plus a board covered in Christmas cards and a pair of steel filing cabinets. \nMaybe motivated by the booze? But a desk drawer is open almost before he realizes it and he searches for a key. Nothing but a bunch of business cards and family snaps. Taylor with his Moth- er Taylor with his Sister (red hair like him) and Taylor with his Dog. The drawer slams and one underneath opens.  Same flot- sam of personal junk. Scotch Tape and paper clips and more bus- iness cards. A bottle of tablets and salad of loose ammo. Fuck all else and he closes the drawer. But what's this? A cane let- ter rack at the rear of the desk where he finds a pair of keys. \nExcitement lasts as long as it takes to try them. Don't fit ei- ther lock. Now he's staring at the shadows with nothing moving but thoughts. A few moments more and he's heading for the door. \n68:  INT.  OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nMassive close-up of the lock. A weird looking tool goes in and another follows it. This bastard ain't easy even for an expert. The frame widens to reveal BERLIN. He shuffles picks in a wall- et on top of the cabinet. Was that a noise somewhere? He stops to listen. wipes cold sweat away. Only thieves and foxes about. \nA final twist and the lock delivers. Several dozen manilla col- ored files from which to choose. A pair of folders titled Jenn- ifer travel to the desk. The first is full of press-cuttings & some gruesome looking snaps. Next file and this one looks more interesting? A notebook full of random questions/answers/comm- ents. A list of ships and sailing times. \"MUST FOLLOW THIS UP\" \nUnderlined twice. \"CAN'T OVER ESTIMATE IMPORTANCE.\" Also under- lined. Lists of numbers. Street numbers? Vehicle numbers? What- ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on. TAYLOR stands in the doorway. The surprise is mutual. The play one-sided. This is already TAYLOR's game. Smokes his cigarette. BERLIN is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain. \nBERLIN .. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J .. \nTAYLOR What are you looking for? \nBERLIN Vehicle references. \nTAYLOR Wrong cabinet. \nHe gestures to the right one. BERLIN feels about 2 inches tall. \nI'm gonna get some coffee. When you finish in here, maybe you'll let me know? .. I got a report to type up .. \nAs he exits he tosses a bunch of keys. They crash uselessly on- to the desk. BERLIN looks like he couldn't get a fuck with mud. \n69:  EXT.  ROAD.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY. \nThe mood is low as it goes. And so is the angle. Ultra low beh- ind the car. Just road and a blur of tires. The frame widens & the Mercedes fills it. Brake lights on as it descends the hill. \n70:  INT.  TRINITY VALLEY/ROAD.  DAY. \nBERLIN in big close-up. His face like the Music. Here come the gates of the Institute. As he turns in he stamps the brakes. A van veers past him. Nothing special about it except it's a V.W. He watches it vanish up the hill with other things on his mind. \nHELENA unzips her skirt. Slides it down her lags. Drapes it on a chair. Removes her shirt and hangs it on the back. She wears a white brassiere and panties. And no apologies for repetition. This is a fantastic body. She checks water temperature. Either too hot or too cold. Either way a tap goes on. Now she reaches behind her back. Unclips her bra. Gets hit with dazzling light. \nThe Intruder is taking photographs. And if this is his turn-on he's in paradise. She stands in front of him in total oblivion. Her panties join clothes on the chair. Nov she's naked and now another picture. Again the bathroom detonates with white light. \nHis face is concealed by the camera. But this bastard is about to run out of luck. Moves in as she silences the tap. Suddenly a lot of silence about. HELENA twists in panic. She just heard something? Didn't she just hear something? Is somebody in here? Fear kills her scream. She hits at the darkness. But he's gone. \n83:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY. \nBig close on telephone ringing. No one home except the machine and Camera. The former answers on behalf of Berlin [John, it's me .. please call me .. I left two messages at the police stat- ion .. they said you weren't there .. please, please, call me]. The camera moves on. Breakfast remains on the table. Newspaper still in its wraps. Out the window a bonfire rages in the yard. \n84:  EXT.  YARD.  HOUSE.  DAY. \nBERLIN clears rubbish from the garage. Grime and sweat and the effort's got him breathless. Heaves another armful on the fire. The phone starts ringing again. This time he decides to answer. \n85:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMIN.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN in a hurry to get there. Footsteps tell the story. Fast up a corridor and through a door. Faces look as he crosses the department. SECRETARIES and BISLEY and ROSS. But only one face of interest. TAYLOR turns halfway through lighting a cigarette. \"Are you outta your fucken mind?\" TAYLOR says nothing. \"If any- thing happens to that girl, I'm gonna break your fucking back.\" \nTAYLOR Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant .. \nROSS Whass going on here? \nA question practically every expression in the place is asking. \nTAYLOR His blind friend got \"attacked.\" Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper. \nBERLIN You put it in there. \nTAYLOR I may have said some- thing. I don't recall. \nBERLIN Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case! \nTAYLOR Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what? \nHis indifference inflames BERLIN. Smashes the newspaper at him. \nBERLIN So read it! You just hung a target around her neck! \nTAYLOR Bullshit. \nBERLIN Don't you know nothing about this guy? He reads the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried .. \nTAYLOR Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert. \nBERLIN Just walk away from me, Taylor .. \nNow the volume is going up. Now the whole department is silent. \nTAYLOR You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera .. \nROSS Alright, guys. We stop this now. \nTAYLOR He tells her, \"bye-bye,\" and she gets \"attacked.\" Well, give me a fucking break! There is no \"Ser- ial Killer.\" Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean everyone. \n\"Everyone\" means ROSS. BERLIN looks at him. And his gaze hurts. \nROSS Shut up, King Jay .. \nTAYLOR No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to stop this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing me, & everyone off. \nBERLIN You don't know what you done, Taylor. \nTAYLOR If, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for one out of two fucken seconds, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago .. \nHis cigarette is already stubbed and he's already walking away. \nWhy don't you get yourself a dict- ionary? Look up the word \"witness?\" \nBERLIN I know what a \"witness\" is. \nTAYLOR Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat. \nA big mistake Mister Taylor. Mister Berlin suddenly turns into Harrison Ford. TAYLOR slams into filing cabinets right next to the Christmas tree. Gets BERLIN's forearm under his throat and fucking lucky not to get the knuckles in his gut. Both men are heaving. No volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence. \nBERLIN I'm gonna do something you never did, Taylor. I'm gonna catch this bastard. And when I do, he's gon- na find out just how good a \"wit- ness\" she is .. Meanwhile, you be aware of me - coz I wish you ill .. \nBERLIN moves away and the silence is brutal. Nothing happening but bad vibes. ROSS and BERLIN exchange glances, And this shit is really bad. BERLIN vanishes into his lab and the door slams. \n86:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN and his Dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his rage are all alone. And that's how they wanna be. But the door opens and here is ROSS. Have to be a friend to survive in here. \nBERLIN Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it. \nROSS I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? \"Good-bye, Princess,\" & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro? \nBERLIN I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion. \nROSS You don't really believe this? \nBERLIN One hundred fucking per cent! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the \"committee?\" \nThe Music is Puccini. Part one/Act two/The Humming Chorus from Madam Butterfly. Giant close of the spinning cassette. The Cam- era remains close as it explores the room. Candle light & fire- light. Along a mantlepiece. Eleven thirty-five on a clock. Two Christmas cards. Several photographs from the happy years. One a picture of Ross & Berlin in uniform. Another features Berlin with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair. For a moment it could be Helena? But the Camera's already gone. \nHELENA cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa. Looks considerab- ly more relaxed. But there's a tension here and both are aware of it. Stifled yawns. She stares at him and BERLIN stares back. A billion people in love have been through this. It's bed-time. [A suggestion of Berlin's bed to be is heaped in pillows/blank- ets at the end of the couch.] \"Come on, I'll take you up there.\" She finds his hand and stands. The Music follows them upstairs. \n91:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nMoonlight through the windows. They are silhouettes. They want to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst place to be. No sound except the Music. And what's anyone supp- osed to say? This atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more. \nChrist hear this Music. A sweet pulse of Puccini. Big close of lips meeting in moonlight. Now in each other's arms. They kiss. And then they're kissing. And nothing else is happening in the whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring. \nStill ringing. Still kissing. Somebody has got to give in. The phone finally gets answered. The voice at the end isn't expect- ed. But BERLIN sounds pleased to hear it. It seems one problem got solved. \"I gotta tell you, Margie. You are Mrs Santa Claus.\" \n92:  INT/EXT.  KITCHEN/REAR ENTRANCE.  ROSS'S HOUSE.  DAY. \nIs Ross throwing a party or opening a bar? Crates of booze and stack upon stack of beer. A bit of \"where do you want it?\" act- ing from BERLIN as he staggers in with a delivery of Bud. ROSS makes room on a table. Rips a beer out the plastic and pops it. \nBERLIN Can't thank you enough, Ross .. \nROSS Don't thank me. Thank Margie. \nSwallowing beer ROSS exits the back door with BERLIN following. \nIt's her invitation. And as far as Citrine in concerned, better we keep it like that. \nThe wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload, BER- LIN heads for his Mercedes with ROSS calling after him. \"John. Here.\" Pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across. \nThere's an old desperado in one of the cells. Why don't you give him this, and tell him happy Christmas from me? \n93:  INT.  BEDROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY. \nThe Girls prepare for festivity. They got a full length mirror. A wardrobe of dresses. A menu of shoes, What they do with them in this scene is their affair. Right now MARGIE's holding some blue number in front of HELENA.\"It's blue silk. You like blue?\" \nMARGIE Not \"you\" blue. This isn't you. \nShe slings the dress on the bed. It joins a pile of rehearsals. Moves deeper into her dresses and HELENA appears in the mirror. \nHELENA When did John divorce? \nMARGIE Two or three years ago. \nHELENA What was she like? \nMARGIE Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet. \nHELENA What does that mean? \nMARGIE You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank .. \nShe pirouettes with black sequins. \"What do you think of black?\" Evidently not much and MARGIE is getting short of alternatives. \nWait a minute, I just had the most brilliant idea .. \nHELENA You think he still loves her? \nMARGIE Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession. \nShe emerges from the wardrobe with red satin high heeled shoes. \nHere .. try these .. if these fit, we got the perfect dress .. \nHELENA I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these? \nMARGIE Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still .. \nHELENA is excited to try them out. The experiment is a success. \nI'll go get the dress .. It's kinda sultry .. I only wore it once, coz in reality, I can't get away with it .. \nHELENA You think John would like it? \nMARGIE I think John, would love it ... \n94:  EXT.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nThe Ross residence looks like an ad for J&B. Warm yellow light from the windows. Holly wreath on the front door. The Mercedes pulls up and BERLIN gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger. A hard wind around the house. He walks inside without knocking. \n95:  INT.  DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nThe den looks like a little museum. Walls decorated with Civil War memorabilia. One wall occupied by a cabinet of modern guns. ROSS looks like Roy Rogers trying to look like Fred Astaire. A powder blue evening suit. Ho dumps ice in a barrel full of Bud- wieser and BERLIN produces a couple of presents. \"This is from Helena. And this is from me.\" The first obviously a music tape. ROSS holds it to his ear. \"Sounds like Frank Sinatra?\" And the second a bottle of (Ross tears the wrappings off) Chivas Regal! \nROSS Let's do one of these right now, then we'll hide the sonovabitch. \nBut he's already lost BERLIN's attention. MARGIE walks in with HELENA. Jesus what have you done to her? Bright red lipstick & jet black mascara and dress made of blood red sequins. Sexy it is but her it isn't. She looks like one of those big tit dopes from Tennessee. She also looks like 37 million dollars. Christ that smile works with paint. An appraisal comes from ROSS \"Wow.\" \n96:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nThe whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored lights and laughter. Buddy Holly supplies the music \"True Love Ways\" and ROSS is a victim of the nostalgia. Dances close with MARGIE. Among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are HELENA & BERLIN. Eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other. \nBut someone is staring at them. About forty years old with big hands. Too old for acne but the skin is bad. Got a scar on his cheek like a ladder in a stocking. He continues to stare until the dancers separate. Music ends and he's already in the crowd. \nBERLIN arrives with a whisper for MARGIE and next thing HELENA is on her arm heading for the stairs. Obviously a \"ladies room\" run. Everly Brothers next record up and SERATO appears through the crush. Spots ROSS who wants to know \"What happened to you?\" \nROSS already arrived. BERLIN looks desolate. She can't go back. \nYou better go talk to her .. \nROSS watches him walk upstairs. His eyes an assessment of this absurd relationship. \"All sorts of people fall in love, Darlin.\" \nROSS I know .. ain't it a shame .. \n100:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nA wedge of light as BERLIN walks in. Then moonlight again. HEL- ENA sits at the edge of a single bed. Hair a wreck and mascara streaks down her face. He sits identifying himself with an emb- race. Clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears were. \"It was an accident .. everyone has accidents.\" Whatever he said would be the wrong thing to say. Because he doesn't un- derstand. And her only explanation of this misery is new tears. \nHELENA I can't walk in these shoes .. \nGently he reaches down and takes off her shoos \"You don't have to dress like this for me.\" And suddenly the mood is different. He is amongst her tears. Kissing her mouth. Already undressing her. Her dress glides up. Silk stockings. He unclips them. She feels his hands drift down her legs. Hears the zip opening her dress. She returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere. He kisses her breasts and by now the Camera's too close to see. \n101:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nHELENA asleep in BERLIN's arms. Just the worry of the wind. He kisses her and slips out of bed and everything slams into MASS- IVE CLOSE-UP. PLUS A MASSIVE AMPLIFICATION OF SOUND. THE SLIDE SNAPS BACK ON A 9 MILL BERETTA. THE MAGAZINE SHUNTS OUT. SLUGS LOADED AND MAG BACK IN. THE SLIDE TRAVELS FORWARD BIG AS A CAR. \nBERLIN is fully dressed. Geared up for work. Black leather glo- ves and black leather jacket. Shoves the Beretta into his belt. From somewhere a very soft sound of Christmas carols drifts in. \n102:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM/DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nThis is deep past midnight, The house is quiet and gone to bed. Fallout from the party everywhere. Still that distant sound of carols. BERLIN dumps his bag and walks into the den. Just dark- ness and the forgotten tape machine. Flips on a lamp and tries to open the gun cabinet. Still trying when startled by a voice. \nROSS (O.S.) You can't get in there .. That's \"Comanche Proof.\" \nBERLIN swings round in surprise. ROSS is half asleep on a sofa. \nBERLIN Jesus. What are you doin? \nROSS I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty .. \n\"Silent Night. Holy Night\" and about two inches of Chivas left. \nBERLIN Have you got any Glasers? (Ross does) Twenty fives? \nBERLIN sticks a foot on a table. Pulls a .25 Walther automatic from an ankle holster. Ejects the mag and clicks out the slugs. \nROSS What exactly you doing, John? \nBERLIN I'm going up to the institute. \nROSS Now? \nBERLIN This \"cop\" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas. \nROSS unlocks a cabinet and BERLIN is about to load the Glasers. \nI checked with the locals and our station, no one's called. Whoever it is, isn't the police.  I think this bastard's getting worried ab- out something? .. and I think the- re's just a chance he'll turn up. \nROSS Well, let's hope he does .. \nROSS selects a 12 gauge Winchester and rams the mechanism open. \nAnd if he does, I'm gonna drop a bomb on the fukker. \nBERLIN Listen, you don't havta come? \nROSS Hey .. \nROSS is stuffing solid lead \"car killers\" into the pump action. \nWatch my lips. I'm your partner. \n103:  EXT.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  NIGHT. \nThis is probably a crane shot. A gale works up the valley. The institute is in total darkness. Not a vehicle out front. Not a sound except the marauding wind. Ross's Chevrolet is concealed amongst trees. Been here long enough to allow slow flurries to accumulate. It stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away. \n104:  INT.  CHEVROLET SEDAN.  NIGHT. \nBERLIN wears a black wool hat. ROSS a big black overcoat. Both got shit frozen out of them. A bottle available and anyone who wants a slug better help himself. Plus sleet on the windshield and a lot of stale time. BERLIN asks what time it is? And ROSS takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by. \nROSS Where's your watch? \nBERLIN I guess by the bed. \nROSS It's twenty of three. \nYawns do a circuit. ROSS flops in his seat and the angle chang- es. The view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads. \nA little young for you, Bro? (Gets his eyes) You think if she could see, she'd be hanging around with an old dog like you? You got a stomach growing around to meet itself behind your back. \nBERLIN Bull shit .. I'm in my prime .. \nROSS Bits. \nBERLIN What d'you mean, \"bits.\" \nA star-light on the windshield. Distant and nobody seen it yet. \nThe MYOPIC JANITOR looks down. Five floors below a man lays on his back. His shotgun discharges uselessly into trees. Another man leans over him. Illuminates his agonized face with a flash- light. Shoots him again point-blank in the upper body. The MYO- PIC isn't staying for more. Hurries back along the fire escape. \n114:  INT.  ATTIC APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT. \nWind breaks on the roof like waves. An utterly dismal room lit by a starving light bulb. The MYOPIC arrives from the fire esc- ape. Huge eyes behind those orb-like glasses. Picks up a phone and dials. Piles and piles of old newspapers. Hundreds of fuck magazines. In the kitchen section a mass of photographic equip- ment includes an enlarger on the table a flash camera.  On the wall behind him a collage of snaps of half dressed girls. Plus a special enlargement of Helena standing naked in her bathroom. \nMYOPIC Gimme the police. Quickly. \n115:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE.  FIRE ESCAPE.  NIGHT. \nClose on a bulb in a flashlight. The merest glimmer of energy. Barely the light to see the blood. It seeps into a long-frozen footprint in the ice. Fills it fast and expands over the sides. \nSomebody say this can't be happening? BERLIN crumples to knees in the snow. Dumps his light gasping for breath. Oblique light creating desperate silhouettes. BERLIN howls like a dog. Howls into his radio. \"Nine - Nine - Nine.\" Blood all over his hands. \n\"This is a Nine - Nine - Nine - officer down.\" ROSS is heaving like an old bull elephant. On the verge of unconsciousness. He tries to speak. Got hit in the throat. BERLIN fights off tears. \n\"Don't talk old man.\" Repeats the emergency code but this time he can't be heard. Almost imperceptibly a Carol filters in (In The Bleak Mid Winter) and the Camera moves slowly away. BERLIN cradles ROSS's tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind. \nThis beautiful Christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these cuts. And there will be no other sound until the sequence ends. \n116:  EXT.  CITY STREET.  CITY HOSPITAL.  NIGHT. \nA blue emergency light. Revolving in slow motion. Like a dream. The city streets are a blur. The light accelerates into sudden reality. Ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital. \n117:  INT.  EMERGENCY ROOM.  HOSPITAL.  NIGHT. \nClose-up of MARGIE kissing her husband's lips for the last time. Tears spill down his cheeks from her eyes. FREDDY ROSS is dead. \n118:  INT.  WAITING AREA.  HOSPITAL.  NIGHT. \nOutside in the corridor. Looking in at BERLIN. He sits head in hands on a bench. This is somebody's point of view. The camera travels up the windows. Waits at a distance as CITRINE arrives. Pajamas under his clothes. He walks with assistance of a stick. \nNeither say anything because both know what this is about. BER- LIN stands and hands over his badge. Exits the mag and now his Beretta. A brief word from CITRINE and he turns and walks away. \n119:  EXT.  LANDSCAPE.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAWN. \nA little house in winter meadows. Kind of pretty now it's pain- ted. Just the first tint of pink on its roof. The Carol dissol- ves into birdsong. Here comes the sun for a fine Christmas day. \n120:  EXT.  VERANDA.  HOUSE.  DAWN. \nAll new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times. A barbecue still in polythene wraps. Price tag and unconnected gas pipe shift gently in the breeze. A brand now swinging seat. \nBERLIN sits in it with shock wearing on. Expressionless of sor- row. Though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there is. Sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red. silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life. \n121:  EXT/INT.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY. \nLights glow on the Christmas tree. Unopened presents still und- erneath. SERATO sits smoking in silence. Listens to a sound of plates getting stacked in another room. He looks up but not in surprise. He just wasn't aware BERLIN had arrived in the house. \nBERLIN Where's Margie? \nStunned and stubbled and full of grief. And that's just SERATO. \nSERATO Taken Bobby to her sister's .. \nThis atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud. \nThey were going there anyway. \nBERLIN Does he know? \nSERATO shakes his head. Loses his cigarette. And SAMMY appears. \nSERATO Thinks his dad's in hospital. \nSAMMY SERATO is 30 and pretty. She continues collecting plates. \nWhy'd you go up there, John? \nKnows he's not going to get a reply and doesn't bother to wait for it. HELENA materializes from the den like a shadow. Sallow for want of sleep and glad to have BERLIN's hand to hang on to. \nBERLIN I want you to go to your Aunt's. \nA suggestion that surprises HELENA. And clearly doesn't appeal. \nHELENA Why can't I stay with you? \nBERLIN It's not possible right now. \nHELENA Why? \nBERLIN Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now .. \nIf silence can intensify it's now. Sound of the front door and then footsteps. BERLIN freezes as MARGIE appears. Wracked with grief. Dead sickness of tears. Like she cried bones out of her face. But no weeping now. Maybe shock. Maybe brave. Maybe both. \nHELENA Is that Margie? \nMARGIE I'm here, honey. I'm right here. \nThe strongest face in the house. And now HELENA is in her arms. \nDon't cry darlin .. he was a big old cop and he didn't like tears .. \nSt ANNE Games? \nBERLIN I told you, I'd lost the Walther .. \nSt ANNE You told me you didn't know you'd lost it until you were in the hos- pital? So, if you didn't know till then, it coulda been either weapon? \nBERLIN The gun in my hand was a Beretta. And for the record, I want that note corrected. Now, please, Sir. \nThe dead smile and rubber in action. St ANNE changes his notes. \nSt ANNE O.K. I'm corrected. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. \nBERLIN With respect, Sir, you didn't make a mistake. I know who you are, and you're far too experienced for mis- takes. Now if you have doubts over the content, or veracity of my rep- ort, I wanna be made aware of them? \nSt ANNE Sure. \nBERLIN I wanna be made aware of them now. \nSt ANNE Do you want a lawyer, Sergeant? \nBERLIN There you go again? \"Do I want a lawyer, Sergeant?\" It's a game question. What do I want a law- yer for? I got nothing to hide .. \nSt ANNE You don't? \nBERLIN You know I don't. So let's quit the bullshit and get down to it. What's your \"angle,\" Mr St Anne? \nFor the first time St ANNE moves his chair into BERLIN's space. \nSt ANNE Where's the little gun, Sergeant? \nBERLIN I've no idea. \nSt ANNE You don't? \nBERLIN If it isn't in the institute, the man who shot Ross took it. \nSt ANNE The man who shot Ross, used it .. \nImplications are ganging up quicker than BERLIN can focus them. \nAnd you don't know where that little twenty-five calibre Walther's gone? \nBERLIN confirms it. Looking very concerned. The wheels retreat. St ANNE shakes out a cigarette and takes his time with matches. \nO.K. Sergeant, here it is. I intend to produce evidence, that will prove you shot Frederick Ross with malice afore- thought. My angle therefore, is to pre- pare a case on behalf of your Chief, to prosecute you for first degree murder. \n129:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThe lights on the Christmas tree are off. That just about sums it up. The word's out and it talks in barren silence as BERLIN appears. TAYLOR and SERATO in conference at a desk. The former looks. The latter turns away. BERLIN walks the room into close- up. \"Like some coffee, John?\" Seems like ANN is the only benev- olent face around. She gets a lost smile & bewildered shake of his head. Disappears into his room And quietly closes the door. \n130:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nA picture of Ross fills the frame. Snapped the day they search- ed the dump. Blasted with rain. A waterproof cape and a finger raised in defiance. BERLIN shifts eyes from the bulletin board. Pours a last inch of whisky and drinks. Eyes back to the board for a last photographic/panoramic record of his time in Eureka. \nThe photo of Ross again before his eyes sweep quickly on. Pict- ure of Amber Stone. Thumb tacks and maps and tape. Information relating to specific areas in San Diego. Carlsbad/Ocean Beach/ Point Loma. \"Jennifer Seven\" \"Jennifer Eight.\" But who gives a fuck anymore? Two dead dogs on a refuse dump. And now the dead face of a Dummy. BERLIN stares till someone knocks on the door. St ANNE comes in smoking a cigarette and eating a ham sandwich. \nSt ANNE You go home, John, get some sleep. I don't wanna talk any more today. \nBERLIN Aren't you gonna arrest me? \nSt ANNE You know better than that ... \nHe will exit when he stops speaking. Before he does he wanders the lab showing particular interest in the Dummy of Jennifer 8. \nI arrest you, you'll get bail, and be walking outta here anyway - and I'll have no one to talk to - Your Chief said he'd make you available to me. If you go to the store, call in, and let your duty officer know. \n131:  INT.  BOBBY'S BEDROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  NIGHT. \nBOBBY is in hysterics. A gale of tears. Fits his words between them. His Mom does her best to cope with his grief and her own. \nMARGIE Your Daddy would have wanted you to be strong .. We gotta be strong for Daddy, darling .. \nBOBBY I don't want her in this house .. I want my Dad. Why did she have to come here .. I want my Daddy .. \n132:  INT.  KITCHEN.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY. \nFingers search out and identify phone numbers. Dial for inform- ation and HELENA whispers \"I need the number for a cab, please.\" \n133:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThe Camera's getting closer and so is St ANNE. And today there is a definite change of mood. Still very measured. Still a pro- fessional demeanor. But a bad sense of shit about to come down. \nSt ANNE .. there was a gale that night .. all the doors are swinging .. so this door swings back and clips you .. and down you go .. within 35 seconds of uncon- sciousness, you're back on the fire es- cape, and you're confused, really con- fused .. you don't know if Tuesdays come in two's or happen once a week .. \nBit of a cold coming on and near enough for BERLIN to catch it. \nYou see a figure coming up the stairs. Ross ain't meant to be on the stairs? He challenges you .. and this ain't a piece of wood with a nail through it .. this guy's got a 12 gauge Winchester up your nose .. and he's drunk .. and you're dizzy .. and your eye's fulla blood .. you ain't thinking good, and you're seeing worse .. Wow! .. it just went off! .. You just put him down? .. and you get hit by a Glaser, you stay down .. But he ain't dead .. Now, you realize you shot your partner .. \"Oh, Suzanna, how do I get outta this?\" I know .. The \"Serial Killer\" shot him .. And here comes the malice, John .. 17 seconds later, you put another one in his throat .. Isn't that what happened? \nBERLIN No. \nSt ANNE Tell us what happened, then? \nIf St ANNE can raise an eyebrow he does. By implication BERLIN is ditching his \"Killer.\" During this St ANNE rewinds his Sony. \nYou're telling me it's his flashlight I saw, O.K., he sees my flashlight? And I'm coming up the stairs with a Beretta in my hand. And he's frightened. He hits the door on me. Picks up my gun. He's running. He runs into Ross, and in panic, he shoots him. \nThe little Sony snaps to a stop and St ANNE looks at his watch. \nSt ANNE Not unless he had a gun in one hand, and a phone in the other, he didn't. Ross was shot at ex- actly two fifty-seven a.m. The janitor put a call through to the local police, at 2:57 a.m. You obviously realize how I can get so accurate with my timing? \nSt ANNE backs off and carefully replaces the Sony on the table. \nRoss switched into channel 8, & we got a recording of the whole incident. I was gonna play it to you, but I got a meeting, we'll have to do it after lunch. It's one, let's make it back by three? \n137:  INT.  BEDROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY. \nHELENA is curled up under blankets. Maybe day-dreaming but not asleep. She's maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else. Sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen. The car pulls up and its engine silences. HELENA is already out of bed. \n138:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/PORCH/FRONT YARD.  HOUSE.  DAY. \nSilhouette of a figure outside the front door. Someone rattles the handle but it's locked. And by the time HELENA reaches the door the visitor has gone. Thinking it's Berlin she twists the key and steps onto the porch. A stale winter fog settling down. \nHardly a sound except her own voice. \"John? Is that you?\" Just the rattle of local Crows and a Bull heaving somewhere in some distant field. \"John?\" She cautiously descends wood stairs and walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown Chevrolet. \nExploration of the car establishes nil. More confused than con- cerned she listens. Country sound and not a sound out of place \nThen suddenly she is alert. Something clatters somewhere. Like cans kicked in the garage? Was it the garage? \"John, is it you?\" \n139:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  DAY. \nHELENA locks the front door. Moves into the kitchen. Locks the back door. Glum silence in the house. Nothing but an old alarm clock ticking. Then a sound like something moving. Like a door creaking open? Was it in the garage? The living room? Upstairs? \nShe returns to the living room. Curtains drawn and almost dark. The endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes. If anybody's here they're upstairs? HELENA moves to the bottom of them \"John, are you up there? It's me, darling. I got a cab.\" \nThe only reply is more silence. She begins to climb the stairs. \nOne hand on the wall. She ascends slowly. Her helplessness giv- ing way to suspicion with each new step. At the top she pushes into the bedroom \"John, are you here? Darling? Are you alright?\" \nApparently no one is here. Certainly no one in the bed. And no one in the bathroom. She reappears with an expression suppress- ing anxiety. Feels her way past an antique wardrobe. Curiously its door is open. A full length mirror inside. Shuts it as she passes and for a split-instant the Man in the room is revealed. \nAlmost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist. HELENA in speechless with shock. Both she and the INTRUDER are breathing hard. The only other sound is the wardrobe door whin- ing open again under its weight. Manifests a reflection of his back. Totally in black. Black wool hat. Leather jacket. Gloves. \nINTRUDER Got really fucken lucky, didn't ya? \nHe backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip. The frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still on the INTRUDER's back. HELENA stares unseeing at her own face. \nI was getting kinda concerned about you Jenny. Like, how blind are you? Blind as your friend? Or less blind? Coz she could see, you know. Had a view outta one of em. But you don't see nothing do you? Nothing at all? \nHe reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife. Even closed this thing is 10 inches long. A leather loop attat- ched at one and. He teases the metal in front of HELENA's eyes. \nCan you see this, blind girl? \nNot a switch-blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out. \nGimme your hand. \nToo terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him. \nGimme your fucken hand. \nHELENA lifts her hand and he takes it. He runs the edge of the blade over her palm. Then closes her fingers around the handle. \nYou like it? \nShe is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks. \nI cut your friend's head off with that .. \nWords come out she can barely hear herself. \"You are a coward.\" \nYou say something, Jenny? \nIn this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol. \nI'd like to cut you. I'd like to cut you so bad .. But ain't life strange? You're my little buddy now .. I guess we all got lucky? \n140:  EXT.  CAR PARK.  POLICE STATION.  CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY. \nFog and dusk in that order. Headlights descend the slope. Park and CITRINE plus cane get out. As he crosses the lot a Uniform fires up a Harley. Next face is SERATO heading for his car. He accosts the Chief with a piece of paper. It is read with escal- ating incredulity. This would be comic if it wasn't so serious. \nSERATO She's in love with him, Chief, and try anything? \nCITRINE Are you going up there? \nSERATO No, I just sent Travis. I've got a call to make. \nCITRINE What about the man? .. Has he seen this? .. [No he hasn't] .. Alright, make your call, and get up there ... Bullshit or not, I wanna proper statement .. \n141:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nCITRINE walks in in his overcoat. BISLEY looks across from the window. And the ASSISTANT up from a crossword. \"Are they busy?\" \nASSISTANT No, Sir, they just got back. \nBERLIN wipes a thought through his hair with fingers. \"I don't know what that means.\" Walks past into the bedroom. Everything taken apart. Every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes. \nBERLIN ... he's either here to take something .. or leave some- thing .. I don't find nothing .. \n146:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nBERLIN pours last of the whisky. Looks totally snuffed out. He and HELENA sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a mile apart. A yellow pad on the table covered in notes. BERLIN swallows scotch and reads to himself \"I guess we all got lucky?\" \nHELENA You gotta stop drinking, darling. \nAnother mouthful of scotch & she hears the glass hit the table. \nHe's glad you're drinking. Every drink you take you're helping him. \nBERLIN He doesn't need my help. \nHELENA I know about alcohol, John. \nBERLIN You do? \nHELENA I'm blind because my father drank. \nThat's what she knows about alcohol and he'd prefer to be dead. \nI lost everyone I ever loved .. I lost my hopes .. my future .. I'm in love with you, John .. I don't want them to take you away from me .. \n147:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nSt ANNE is close enough to kiss BERLIN. Right into his space & talking right into his face. And today he's not in a good mood. \nSt ANNE He humiliated you. In front of every one .. In front of a bunch of secret- aries? .. Well, that would piss any- one off? ... That would piss me off .. I'd be real mad if a guy did that to me, & called himself a friend .. Coz that ain't a friendly thing to do? .. You side with \"friends\" .. You don't go bitchin on them behind their back? \nAnd he suddenly switches gear. And whispers like it's a secret. \nHe wasn't much of a \"friend\" at all? \nBERLIN Ross was my best friend. \nSt ANNE Did you shoot your \"best friend?\" \nBERLIN No. \nSt ANNE The next time I ask you that quest- ion, you're gonna tell me the truth. \nSt ANNE shunts back in his chair. Expands the frame as he goes. Sergeant TAYLOR sits on a chair with his back to the wall. Cig- arettes and ashtray on the table next to his. St ANNE lights a Pall Mall and as if it's an after-thought he snaps the Sony on. \n[TAPE] .. \"Just be careful now, coz I'm coming up.\" .. [Footsteps on cast iron stairs] \"Is that you, John? .. Answer .. Now .. or I blow this fucken staircase to pie- ces.\" [Sound of someone breathing hard] \nBERLIN already looks devastated. He's about to got annihilated. \n\"Me, Freddy.\" .. [Just the gale] \"What the hell's going on up there, Brother? I been calling ton minutes.\" .. [Lungs heave for air) \"Hey, c'mon, John, talk to me?\" [Just the sound of breathless- ness] \"Jesus Christ .. What are you do- ing? What the fuck are you doing? It's me - Holy shit - John - John - Not you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard! [2 shots] \nSt ANNE clicks the Sony off & BERLIN is too stunned to breathe. \nSt ANNE That's second degree - you wanna stop at that? Will you give me that, John? \nBERLIN gives him nothing but silence. A knock on the door \"Come in.\" And the ASSISTANT hands St ANNE a note. Reads it and excus- es himself. Leaves the silence for BERLIN. But TAYLOR breaks it. \nTAYLOR He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it .. \nBERLIN He ain't offerin me shit. \nTAYLOR lights a cigarette and exhales. Something of a real red- headed fuck about him. And BERLIN would like to break his neck. \nYou're letting it show, King Jay. \nTAYLOR I don't like you. But don't kid yourself .. I don't take no ple- asure sitting in on another cop .. \nHe rolls ash off his cigarette and pushes it round the ashtray. \nYour an alcoholic, aren't you? (BERLIN stares) It's written in your file .. \nThe phone rings and TAYLOR answers. Puts his red eyes at BERLIN. \nThey want you to look in the mirror. \nBERLIN has to find every strength for this one. Humiliation com- pounds. Gets up and stares at his own haunted face in the glass. \n148:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThe MYOPIC peers into BERLIN's face. St ANNE stands close with his toilet roll. Light refracts in the MYOPIC's lenses \"I seen him up there quite a lot.\" St ANNE blows his nose \"Is that the man you saw that night?\" He stares again at the tormented face. \nMYOPIC Well .. I dunno .. it could be? \nSt ANNE Alright, thank you, Mr Dawson .. \nHe's escorted to the door and his space is occupied by CITRINE. \nCITRINE What's all this \"deal\" business? \nSt ANNE on his way to the door now. He pauses for the question. \nBut he does know what it is. The pill he found in the V.W. van. \nYou don't know how it got there? \nTAYLOR stares a rock drill and St ANNE stares something similar. \nYou don't use it for breathlessness? \nBERLIN focuses a fragment of hope. But no sign of hope in here. \nI'm running outta questions, John, and you're running out of lies? I'm offer- ing you one last chance, and you better take it, or the U.S. Attorney is gonna put you in the God-damned gas chamber .. \nBERLIN I need .. some time .. to think Sir .. \nSt ANNE Alright. Think about it. But don't you make a fool of me. You come in here with one more lie, and I bull- shit you not, I'm gonna press for the maximum penalty there is. And that's the death penalty, Sergeant. \n151:  INT.  WAITING AREA.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN hurries in and grabs HELENA's hand. Instantly transmits the adrenalin. They head for the door with him whispering hard. \nBERLIN We got a break - isn't much, but it's a break .. the man that murdered Ross gets asthma - it's not a breath fresh- ner, darling - it's an asthma inhaler .. \n152:  INT.  KITCHEN.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY. \nBERLIN/HELENA couldn't have been in the house longer than it's taken to call Los Angeles. MARGIE infected with the excitement although as yet she hardly knows what's going on. BERLIN paces the tiles on a long phone lead. Eyes to MARGIE while they wait. \nBERLIN This capsule came out of a V.W. van - I didn't even think about it - stuck it in the ashtray - if I'd been smok- ing, ita been thrown away weeks ago .. (Phone) No, Amanda - it's definitely Amanda .. \nAnother excruciating wait plus further explanations for MARGIE. \nI had the van - this guy drove that van takes his medication and loses one .. (Phone) - Dan - Hearing - Are you sure? - Would you try Frisco for me? - I'll try and get a second name .. \nDumps the phone and stokes anxiety in HELENA and MARGIE's eyes. \nNo Amanda with a white Volkswagen .. You don't have a Yellow Pages for Oakland, do you? (She don't) I got- ta get down there, find that store .. \nEverything happens in a hurry. He embraces HELENA. She'll pray for him. Already out the back door with MARGIE in tow. A black & white parked in the drive with VENABLES stuffed inside. Plus a grim wind tearing trees. BERLIN pauses as he reaches his car. \nBERLIN You be careful .. This man's close .. \nCatches her eyes. Can barely look at them. They're full of hate. \nMARGIE If you find him, John. I want you to call me. I wanna know his name. \n153:  EXT.  HILLSIDE.  OAKLAND.  DAY. \nWide over the bay area. Wind swept and rain swept. City lights beginning to come on. In the distance the docks and far beyond the ocean. Somewhere here is a solitary phone booth. \"I'm look- ing for a special type of rattan .. friend of mine recommended you, said I should ask for someone called Amanda .. You don't? O.K. .. Thank you.\" Followed by sound of a phone slamming down. \n154:  INT.  PHONE BOOTH.  HILLSIDE STREET.  DAY. \nA stack of coins and a pair of ripped out Yellow Pages. BERLIN crosses off another number. Running out of craft shops and run- ning out of quarters. A new number hears the same old bullshit. But this one is answering good! Fights to keep his voice light. \nBERLIN (Phone) She's not there? - Let me just make sure I got the right Amanda - lotta freckles, right? .. Right .. That's right, that's her .. Well, eh, what time d'you expect her? .. O.K. I'll eh, try and pop over this afternoon. \nAnd he comes out of there running. The Chevy roars up the hill. \n155:  INT.  ANTIQUE MARKET.  CRAFT EMPORIUM.  DUSK. \nThe kind of store heads open in abandoned warehouses. A jungle of jewelry and cane furniture and ethnic junk.  Many chairs of the ilk Berlin saw in the Volkswagen van. And now he's staring at its driver. His P.O.V. through windows. He watches as a red headed Girl clears the till in preparation to close up. within moments the lights are dead and AMANDA is heading for her door. \n156:  EXT.  MARKET/WAREHOUSE.  CAR PARK.  DUSK. \nPlenty of rain to hurry in. AMANDA. drives a red Datsun. She ex- its the car park with a man in a brown Chevrolet following her. \n157:  EXT/INT.  CAR/STREETS.  SUBURBS.  OAKLAND.  NIGHT. \nThe Chevy tails the Datsun through city streets. A lot of rush hour traffic. Music to go with it and it's probably Mussorgsky. \nA final cut and headlights are navigating the hills. Disappear and reappear as they ascend. Steep inclines and the houses are middle class. Too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain. \nStill climbing the Datsun takes a side street. BERLIN keeps 50 yards behind. She turns off and parks in a sloping driveway. A white Volkswagen van at the top of it. BERLIN has already pull- ed over. Kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house. \n158:  EXT.  STEEP STAIRS.  PORCH.  HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nBERLIN just rang the doorbell. Imposes an impartial expression. But this is his last chance and he knows it. The front door is opened & secured on a safety-chain. AMANDA carries a white Cat. \nBERLIN I'm sorry to trouble you, but eh .. Wait a minute, don't I know you? \nAnd she stares like he does not. Before she stares like he does. \nYou're Amanda? Remember, you near- ly ran into me? Way up in Trinity? \nHis smile disarms the securities. And she opens the front door. \nAMANDA As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into me? What's the problem? \nBERLIN I'm afraid it's the \"van\" again. \nAMANDA The van? \nBERLIN Is it your vehicle? \nYou'll have to put that question to the Chief. I've nothing to add. \nBOBBY appears somewhere behind the Ladies. T.V. commentary con- tinues. \"Meanwhile, Sergeant Berlin remains in a cell at police headquarters arraigned on what is believed to be  a $500,000.00 bail. As Mayor Heineman said, this, is a 'sad day' for Eureka.\" Except for the one face that isn't sad and it belongs to BOBBY. \n168:  INT.  CORRIDOR/CELLS.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nThe cell window is reinforced glass. BERLIN smashes on it like an insane man. TRAVIS (apparently on cell duty) has never seen nothing like this before. CITRINE doesn't want to see any more. \nBERLIN I'll sign anything you want. Please. Bring here her .. I want Helena here .. \nCITRINE You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down. \nBERLIN I am calm .. I am calm .. \nBut he isn't and CITRINE moves off. BERLIN cracks blood out of knuckles on the glass. Hollers up the corridor after the Chief. \nGet St Anne .. I want St Anne .. \n169:  EXT.  DRIVE.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY. \nGale still making a mass of the trees. A police Chevy pulls up and TAYLOR gets out. Puts a knuckle on the window of a black & white. A Uniform wakes and TAYLOR interrupts his apologies \"Go.\" And the young Cop does the drive as TAYLOR heads for the house. \n170:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY. \nHELENA descends the stairs with her luggage. She's towards the bottom when TAYLOR appears via the kitchen. Lights momentarily stall as the gale sucks their electricity. Ignorant of his pre- sence she loses her bags and disappears into the den. He moves after her and startles the shit out of MARGIE as she comes out. \nMARGIE Jesus. What are you doing here? \nTAYLOR Been trying to call, your line's down .. I just wanna let you know we're taking the guard off today. \nMARGIE heads for a table and unloads a strong-box of documents. \nIs she going somewhere? \nMARGIE I'm taking her back to the Instit- ute. Her new term starts tomorrow. \nHe watches her select various papers aware of what she's about. \nTAYLOR Not gonna try and bail him are you? I really wouldn't bother, Margie .. \nHELENA reappears wearing a coat and TAYLOR is in generous mood. \nYou want me to drive her? .. I'm through with my shift .. \nMARGIE No .. I'll drive her .. \n171:  INT.  CELL.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nHere's a classic twenty-two. BERLIN is consumed with anxiety & rage. But get mad in here and get nothing. No shoe strings and no wrist watch. But a wrist-band like something medical summar- izing his charge. St ANNE sits impassive as BERLIN walks floor. \nBERLIN I'll sign anything you like - you write it, I'll sign it. But I want her and Margie here. I want an opp- ortunity to talk to them - that's all I'm asking? - That's my deal? .. \nSt ANNE O.K. I'll put it to your Chief? \nBERLIN Well, you'd better put it to him pretty dammed quick, Mr St Anne, because if you don't, she's dead. \nSt ANNE Didn't push her down stairs on their previous meeting, did he? \nBERLIN He was up there to plant the gun. \nSt ANNE Did Taylor plant this, too? \nProduces a Zippo in a plastic sack and BERLIN's senses capsize. \nIs it yours? \nA question for which St ANNE expects no answer and he is right. \nWe found \"Jennifer Eight.\" At least, we've found a headless and handless girl. A couple of hunters found her. \nMaybe BERLIN asks him \"Where\" or maybe his expression's enough? \nAbout 4 miles south of the institute, less than 50 feet from the road. This was less than 100 feet from the body. \nBERLIN can't believe it and knows St ANNE wouldn't believe him. \nIs it yours? - (no answer) - I know it's yours? - You know it's yours? The only prints on it are Freddy's? You wanna tell me how it got there? \nBERLIN wouldn't believe it either. Door open and TRAVIS enters. \nTRAVIS Margie Ross put up your bond, Sir. \nSt ANNE and BERLIN look surprised. And BERLIN looks at St ANNE. \nBERLIN Are you getting in the way of it? \nSt ANNE examines the bail/bond paper and raises eyes to BERLIN. \nSt ANNE I don't make the law. \n172:  EXT.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DUSK. \n", "test1_input": "Rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them. \nShe's blind, Ross - that's why all the scars - hear that traffic light? That noise is to help blind people - that's why the marks on her finger- tips? - this lady reads in Braille .. \n27:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN sits at a desk at the end of the room. Nothing here but a legal pad and a phone. The pad is covered in names & numbers. Right now he's into a call and this is sounding promising.\"How old?\" And he writes 26. \"How long?\" About 6 weeks ago. Hope in his eyes as he looks across to a woman called ANN. She's doing what he's doing on a different line \"Wait a minute, I specific- ally said I was looking for a girl?\" And all hope over because Lesley is a boy. But here comes ANN & this might be something? \nANN Shasta-Trinity Institute. Line one. \nSticks a sheet of notes on his desk and he junks the last call. \nBERLIN (New call) Hello .. Yes .. This is Sergeant Berlin .. Yes, that's right .. I believe my assistant explained? .. How long ago was that? .. Uh-huh. O.K. .. Who is who? .. Whass his name? Goodridge? O.K. I'll hold .. \nROSS in transit grinning from ear to ear. BERLIN interested in little but his notes and ROSS in nothing but obvious good news. \nROSS Pig Woman agreed to take a test. \nBERLIN I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics - (Yes, yes, I'm holding) - Last seen 5 weeks ago .. \n28:  EXT.  LANDSCAPE/ROAD.  TRINITY FOREST.  DAY. \nMussorgsky is back on a shock cut. Big music and a shattering landscape. Juniper woods and mountains. Sunlight on fresh fal- len snow. Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley. \nRoss's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches it away. An unexpected building in the distance. Victorian at a glance but probably later. A clock tower and fifty lifeless windows. The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture. \n29:  EXT.  THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nPine trees and slush and parked cars. The Chevrolet swings in and parks in front of the mansion. Breath in the air and eyes on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance. \n30:  INT.  ENTRANCE/RECEPTION.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nBERLIN first with ROSS following. As soon as they hit the ent- rance they trigger a recorded voice. \"YOU ARE NOW AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE. THERE ARE SIX STEPS.\" Midway up them with ROSS look- ing back. \"RECEPTION IS THROUGH SWING DOORS AND TO YOUR RIGHT.\" \n31:  INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICER.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nGOODRIDGE is mid-50's with a beard like Abraham Lincoln. Sits far side of his desk alternating eyes between ROSS and BERLIN. The latter studies a photograph of a Girl in a file. It's pos- sible they've found Jennifer Two? \"How recent is the picture?\" \nGOODRIDGE As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber? \nBERLIN I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for .. \nGOODRIDGE Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you? \nBERLIN I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is? \nGOODRIDGE Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there. \nHe doesn't like them but not as much as ROSS doesn't like him. \nROSS A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with? \nGOODRIDGE You find something curious in that? \nROSS Yeah, I guess I do. \nGOODRIDGE Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't \"blind\" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left .. \nROSS And you got no idea with who? \nGOODRIDGE No, Sergeant, I got no idea with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either .. \nROSS could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex- cuses himself to answer it. Whatever he hears he isn't liking. \nYou have an appointment with Miss Robertson? \nBERLIN Yes, Sir. \nGOODRIDGE As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about? \nBERLIN Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with. \nGOODRIDGE I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her .. \n32:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nLooking back down a deserted corridor. Someone tried to put sun- shine on the walls with yellow paint. Somewhere a long way away there is a sound like children singing. ROSS loathes this joint. Loathes its silence. Eyes back to BERLIN as he rings a doorbell. \nROSS Where is everyone? \nBERLIN I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building? \nHere come footsteps and the door is opened by HELENA ROBERTSON. Early 20's and blonde and not immediately beautiful. But delic- ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes. They look away for introductions as though she's shy. ROSS & BERLIN grab glances as they follow in. Neither expected HELENA to be blind. \n33:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nClaustrophobia evaporates instantly. Great views down the val- ley from every window. Plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and colors. But no pictures on the walls. No friendly photographs. Nor any lights. Although the afternoon is shutting down there isn't a light in the room. ROSS elects to stay at the windows. BERLIN takes an offered chair. HELENA sits nervously opposite. \nHELENA What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross? \nBERLIN I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.? (She nods) O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K. \n", "test1_true": "BERLIN What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend? \nLots of headshake. And lots of silences. \"I really don't know.\" \nThat's O.K. Can you give me any idea what this fellow was like? (Headshake) Well, d'you know how old he was? (Headshake) Alright, let me put it this way? How old d'you think I am? Twenty- six? Thirty-nine? Or fifty-three? \nHELENA Fifty-three. \nPossibly the only grin ROSS is going to get out of this place. \nBERLIN You must have some idea about him. \nHELENA When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde? \nBERLIN No. \nHELENA Why not? You heard my voice? \nA good point. And a point taken. And BERLIN might even say so. \nWe don't have some kind of sixth-sense, you know. Ex- cept in ridiculous novels .. \nNow another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room. \nHe used a breath freshener ... \nA sardonic headshake from ROSS. Well that solves the case then! \nAnd I think his name was John? \nBERLIN John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John? \nHELENA I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some? \nBERLIN would but ROSS wouldn't. She leaves and whispers begin. \nBERLIN This looks promising .. I think this one could be it? \nROSS Thank Christ we got a witness. \nBERLIN Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something? \nROSS What? She's blind, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano? \nHe thumbs a cluster of cheap busts of composers on an upright. \nWe're better off having another pop at old Abe Lincoln down the- re? Get angry with the prick. Get some of his \"useful visions\" in? Someone must have seen something? \nNegative from BERLIN. Checked it out. Sunday and no one about. \nThis is fucken crazy. Two hours here, two hours back, and the only word I've written is John .. \nA touch later and the sun is setting. ROSS stands at a window to watch it go. Watches one or two cars driving away. Watches a bird sitting outside on the fire-escape. BERLIN's voice can just about be heard off screen \"You said he spoke? Can you re- member what he said?\" ROSS saunters back into HELENA's answer. \nHELENA Well, he just said, come on, hurry up, will you, because it's starting to snow again. \nEmpty teacups and empty notebook. ROSS sits opposite BERLIN. \nAnd I remember, he was a lit- tle breathless from carrying the cases because the elevat- or had gone out that weekend. \nBERLIN The elevator wasn't working? \nHELENA No, it has a mind of its own. \nA clock strikes four somewhere. And BERLIN knows he's lost it. \nBERLIN Can I see your hands? \nHELENA My hands? \nHe takes her hands and HELENA immediately looks uncomfortable. He examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes. \nI have a class.  I have to go. \nBERLIN Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small? \nHELENA No. Except he smoked. Like you. \nBERLIN Me? \nHELENA Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's. \nA taut instant between ROSS and BERLIN. BERLIN caught out and he knows it. ROSS roars in silence \"YOU LYING PIG\" and writes in his notebook. The angle switches to see \"BERLIN IS A LIAR.\" \nI'm late .. I really have to go .. \nEveryone suddenly on their feet and HELENA gets into a jacket. \nBERLIN D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog? \nHELENA No. \n", "test1_id": 636, "test2_input": "41:  EXT.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY.  (HELICOPTER) \nThe Mercedes and Music travel north. The latter made sinister by this landscape. Forest plunging into dark ravines. The sun colors the mountains red. But most of the valley is in shadow. \n42:  EXT.  DRIVE/PARKING.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nA high wind in the chimneys. And the view is still from above. Like someone's looking down from the top of the building. And maybe someone is? BERLIN parks it and gets out. Stretches and walks towards the institute. He looks very small from up here. \n43:  INT.  GYMNASIUM.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nHELENA plays Elgar in an empty gymnasium. Sunlight streams in staining the air red. As BERLIN arrives doors on the opposite wall flap together like somebody just hurried out. Did he see someone? Perhaps not. The trees outside move a lot of shadows. \nMusic stands. Vacant chairs. BERLIN takes one to watch her re- hearse. Realizes just how beautiful she is. And HELENA realiz- es someone is there. Before she can ask he identifies himself. \nHELENA Have you been here long? \nBERLIN No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music .. \nHELENA I'm sorry. I'll get my things. \nBERLIN No problem. I'm not in a hurry. \nBut she's already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag. \nMatter of fact, I saw a little restaurant place down the road. Looked kinda pretty? I thought maybe we could have some lunch? \nNo answer but the answer is no. BERLIN finds her book for her. \nAlright, whatever .. Was some- one in here with you? When I came in the door was flapping? \nHELENA I don't think so .. No one comes here at the weekends .. \n44:  INT.  STAIRCASE.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nThe gale shouts its head off. The Camera looks down from above. Nothing to see except the stairwell and a hand on the banister. \nHELENA (O.S.) I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had? \nBERLIN (O.S.) I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a \"hollow car?\" \nHELENA (O.S.) Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded \"hollow\" .. \nAny moment now they turn a corner of the stairs into close-up. \nMaybe it was a foreign car? Our kinda cars sound \"fat.\" \nThe elevator is parked on this floor with its doors half open. \nAre you sure you wanna see it? It's another three floors up? \nDespite breathlessness he does. \"How often does it break down?\" \nOh, all the time. They keep threatening to have it re- placed, but they never will. \n45:  INT.  ATTIC APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nGloomy windows and a wardrobe. BERLIN walks in leaving HELENA at the door. \"I sat right there, on the bed.\" The bed is gone but why tell her? He checks the wardrobe. Guess what? Hangers. \nHELENA If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back? \nBERLIN Of course I would .. \nHis smile deteriorates as he realizes she's \"staring\" at him. \nWhat are you staring at, Hel- ena? .. I mean .. I'm sorry .. \nHELENA That's alright. You suddenly reminded me of him .. He was standing right where you are, kind of breathless, like you. \nNothing happening except the wind. Then a smile as she leaves. \nI'll get my coat, wait for you downstairs .. \nAnd he begins an exploration. Musty bathroom with old-fashion- ed fixtures. A tap leaking behind shower curtains. Nothing in the cabinet. Nothing under the sink. Six steps and he is in a kitchen. Finally finds something worth looking for. Tears the sack out of a vacuum cleaner. Discovers a knot of hair from a black dog. Simultaneously the door slams. Shock powers him in- to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock. Hits the door and shouts. Hears footsteps moving rapidly away. \n46:  INT.  RECEPTION.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nA huge Christmas poster advertises SHASTA-TRINITY ARTS/CRAFTS. HELENA sits in the deserted foyer reading Braille. The volume is the size of a phone directory. BERLIN appears via the main entrance. Windswept and wasted and surprised she's still here. \nBERLIN I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out. \nHELENA It was probably the wind. \nHellava wind that turns a key! But he says nothing. Takes the book while she gets into her coat. She's obviously made an ef- fort. A change of clothes and her hair pinned up. But she has got the sweater on inside out and the label is under her chin. \nBERLIN What are you reading? \nHELENA Hamlet. Have you read it? \nBERLIN No. \nHELENA You should. It's wonderful. \n", "test2_true": "47:  INT.  RESTAURANT/DINER.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY. \nRed brick walls and help yourself to salad. All but empty and their food is yet to arrive. BERLIN is clearly having a tough time with the conversation. Basically because there isn't any. \nBERLIN .. I'll tell you what, if I prom- ise to stop being a cop, will you promise to stop being a witness? \nHELENA sits frozen like she's waiting for results of an X-ray. \nI mean, we don't havta sit here waiting for me to ask the next question? You could ask one, too? \nHELENA Are you wearing a uniform? \nBERLIN No. \nHELENA Oh. \nBERLIN Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with. \nHELENA I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me .. \nBERLIN There's no one \"looking at you\" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me. \nAnd he likes what he's looking at. And maybe HELENA senses it. \nHELENA Are you married? \nBERLIN Was. But I don't like to talk about it. \nHELENA You just asked me to ask you questions. \nBERLIN I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that. \nHELENA \"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears.\" \nBERLIN Yeah, that'll do .. Is that \"Hamlet?\" \nHELENA No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry? \nHis attention is temporarily elsewhere. A Lunch Party just arr- ived. It's clear GOODRIDGE is profoundly unhappy to see BERLIN. \nBERLIN I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing? \nHELENA Do you pray? \nBERLIN Pray? \nHELENA You said, you were in the bad lands? \nBERLIN No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail. \n48:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY. \nBig pines either side of the driveway. The Camera sits in the back more interested in the approaching institute than BERLIN. \nBERLIN .. I got really sick of the street .. so I went to school and became a Scientific Services Officer, which is basically a Scene of Crime Off- icer. Then this came up, and I got what they call a Lateral Transfer .. \nPulls into a parking spot and the next sound is the hand brake. \nI couldn't take another minute of Los Angeles .. Felt like I'd said sorry in every street in the city .. \nHELENA Sorry? \nBERLIN .. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee .. \n49:  EXT/INT.  FIRE ESCAPE/APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DUSK. \nBERLIN looks down from the fire escape. For the first time the place sounds busy. Cars arriving and doors slamming. Voices of Students coming back from the weekend. \"Why were you out there?\" HELENA waits inside and didn't realize he was back in the room. \nHELENA Coz I wanted to feel the snow on my face .. I think that's when I heard her call him John? \nTime to go and both know it. Stale shadows and growing silence. \nIs it snowing now? \nBERLIN No. Getting dark though. \nAnd his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it. \nYou think you'd know this man? If he was in the room with you again? \nHELENA You've already asked me that .. \nThe silence is almost uncomfortable. BERLIN continues to stare. \nAmber's dead, isn't she? \nBERLIN Yes. I'm sorry. \n50:  EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET.  CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY. \nPretty houses in a pretty little street. Hills in the back and sunshine out front. BERLIN pulls up in his Mercedes and does a bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes. This could only be MRS CITRINE. A budget smile and he's inside. \n", "test2_id": 637, "test3_input": "A side table features several pin sharp pencils. A Sony pocket recorder. Two packets of Pall Mall reds. Two yellow legal pads. The chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file. \nSt ANNE Alright, let's not beat about the bush, what ever that may mean, and get down on it. You were specific- ally instructed by your chief, not to go anywhere near the blind inst- itute? So why did you go up there? \nBERLIN Because of a feeling. I had a bad feeling this man was gonna turn up. \nSt ANNE Which man is that? \nBERLIN The man I detail in my report, Sir. \nThe report that's in his hands. (St Anne knows well which man.) \nIs this an interview, or an interrogation? \nSt ANNE It's an enquiry ... \nBERLIN I'm not prepared to be interrog- ated. I'll be interviewed as an officer, who may be expected to cooperate with the investigator. \nSt ANNE Well, that's fine by me, John. And I'm sure that's fine by your Chief. \nHe smiles the non-smile. Tosses his pencil down. And sits back. \nSo you thought your man might show? \nBERLIN Yes. \nSt ANNE Bit of a long-shot, wasn't it? \nBERLIN It was the only shot I had .. \nSt ANNE So the one night you decide to go up there, he goes up there? \nBERLIN That's right. Except I'd decid- ed to go up there every night .. \nSt ANNE Despite the wishes of your Chief? \nBERLIN Yes. \nSt ANNE You were prepared to fal- sify your reports to him? \nBERLIN I had very good reasons for do.... \nSt ANNE Just a second, John. I knew there was something missing. \nSt ANNE cuts him off to pick up the phone. Obviously something vital is needed. \"Could you bring an an ashtray in here? Got a coupla guys who smoke in here.\" And attention back to the file. \nYou don't mind if I jump around a little this morning, do you? Just while I'm easing my way into this? \nBERLIN You're asking the questions, Sir .. \nSt ANNE You had an argument with Ross? Ass- aulted one of the officers, right? \nBERLIN I wouldn't use the word \"assault.\" \nSt ANNE You got a \"racy temper,\" Sergeant? \nBERLIN Not especially. \nSt ANNE Just something they did, on this occasion, made you lose your rag? \nBERLIN Not they. He. Taylor put a piece in the newspaper, which in my op- inion put my witness in jeopardy. \nSt ANNE From whom? \nBERLIN From the man I detail in my rep- ort. A crazy man, who to my cert- ain knowledge has killed at least eight girls. Six in San Diego, one someplace else, and one up here .. \nSt ANNE Not a lotta support for that \"scenario\" though, is there? \nBERLIN Not a lot. \nSt ANNE Not even from Ross? \nBERLIN No. \nSt ANNE Is that why you lost your temper with him? Frustration? No one believing you? \nHis ASSISTANT brings the ashtray. And St ANNE smiles gratitude. \nSo what can you tell me about you man? \nBERLIN What do you mean, Sir? \nSt ANNE I mean, who is he? \nBERLIN I don't know who he is. Who's \"Jack The Ripper?\" He's Jack The Ripper with an automobile. \nSt ANNE You didn't run a profile? \nBERLIN No, Sir .. I didn't have the res- ources, and it isn't my expertise. \nSt ANNE This crazy man? What makes you think he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson? \n", "test3_true": "St ANNE I'm asking a question .. \nBERLIN Because he reads I'm investigating the disappearance of her friend, & Miss Robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety. How good of a \"witness\" is she? He's crazy, but not stupid, he's intelligent. Got a flexible M. O., and he doesn't wanna get caught. \nSt ANNE Just like \"Jack The Ripper?\" \nThis is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both. \nAlright, we'll have plenty of time to discuss your \"Mystery Man,\" and his \"flexibility\" later, Right now, I'd like to talk about the \"event.\" \n127:  INT. ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nCITRINE rests on his cane staring through the one-way glass. A menu of anxieties. But perhaps sadness is his principal expres- sion. His eyes slide to the ASSISTANT \"Can you turn that thing on?\" Glad to oblige and Voices cut in. This is CITRINE'S P.O.V. \nSt ANNE [BERLIN] Alright, the door comes back and hits you? Knocks you down? Knocks you out? For how long? [I don't know] Approximately, you figure? A minute? [O.K.] O.K. then what happened? Immediately you get up? \n128:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN I realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs \nSt ANNE Did you check your weapon? \nBERLIN Maybe. It would have been instinctive. All I know was I was in possession of it .. \nSt ANNE You didn't check it? \nBERLIN Not that I specifically remember. \nSt ANNE Why not? \nBERLIN I don't know. I wasn't think- ing about it .. I was dazed .. \nSt ANNE You were woozy? Confused? \nBERLIN I was unconscious 10 seconds ago. \nSt ANNE I understand. Then? \nBERLIN Then I picked up the flashlight, tried to get Ross on the radio .. Nothing. Static. I got blood on my hand, realized my eye was cut. \nSt ANNE Could you see out of it? \nBERLIN Yeah, I could see. Then I ran. Climbed out of the window, ran down the fire escape, and right at the bottom, I found Ross .. \nSt ANNE Were you breathless? \nBERLIN Sure I was breathless ... \nSt ANNE When did you realize you were no longer in possession of the .25? \nBERLIN Not until I was in the hospital. \nSt ANNE You figure you lost it in the hospital? Or on the way there? \nBERLIN No, I thought it must have fallen down the stairwell. \nSt ANNE [BERLIN] Like the flashlight? [Yeah] Had you been drinking that night? \nBERLIN It was Christmas Eve. \nSt ANNE That wasn't my question? \nBERLIN Yes. \nSt ANNE [BERLIN] How about Ross? [Sure] Were you drinking in the car? [?] There was a bottle in the car? \nBERLIN I think Ross had a mouthful? \nSt ANNE But not you? \nBERLIN I may have had a nip? \nSt ANNE To keep out the cold? .. Very cold that night, very windy, wasn't it? \nSt ANNE motors off & refers to notes without looking at BERLIN. \nWhich hand was the flashlight in? \nBERLIN My left hand. \nSt ANNE And the Walther was in your right? \nBERLIN The Beretta was in my right hand .. \nSt ANNE You said you didn't check it? So how d'you know which gun you're holding? \nThe chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass. \nYou said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight? You said you were confused? You pick up the flashlight in confusion, how d'you know you didn't pick up the 25? \nBERLIN Let's not start playing games, Mr St Anne. \n", "test3_id": 638}

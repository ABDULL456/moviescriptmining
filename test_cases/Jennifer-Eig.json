{"test1_input": "ROSS I don't think Popeye would be here. \nVENABLES (V.O.) Dead dog over here, Sir ... \nROSS Find the knife. And Venab- les, is the coroner called? \nVENABLES Yes, Sir .. He's delayed .. \nBLATTIS Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you? \nBERLIN My pleasure .. Who's Popeye? \nBLATTIS Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T .. \nOff he fucks under an ailing sky. BERLIN lands a friendly grin. \nBERLIN So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing? \nROSS Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months. \nHe finds keys and change and a sandwich in the Wino's raincoat. \nHow does anyone dead as this lose a knife? \nBERLIN What about that kid, Ross? \nROSS Oh, shit. Of course. The kid. (Stands to shout) Travis. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so get it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at? \nTRAVIS stares up like he just stuck his dick in a light socket. \nTRAVIS I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir \nROSS Whatta you mean, \"horrible?\" \nTRAVIS I think I've found a hand. \n12:  EXT.  INFILL.  GARBAGE DUMP.  DAY. \nROSS crouches in garbage. Peers into a trash sack with assist- ance of a flashlight. \"You're right. It's a fucken hand.\" Pas- ses the light to BERLIN. His turn to examine the ruptured bag. \nBERLIN Looks like a woman's hand? \nBERLIN finally stands. Offs the flashlight. And hands it back. \nROSS What do you think? \nBERLIN I think you're here all day. \n13:  EXT.  INFILL.  GARBAGE DUMP.  DAY. \nPissing with rain and unspeakably miserable.  The 'grid-search' is in progress and 50 square yards of the dump have been ripp- ed to pieces. Intermittent voices from police radios. More veh- icles down below including an ambulance with hazards revolving. Up here half a dozen arc-lights scald off vapor. BERLIN search- es under a busted umbrella. Looks up and runs into ROSS's eyes. \nROSS How much longer we here? We're not gonna find nothing else .. ? \nHe wears a rubber cape & looks like a huge pissed-off Napoleon. \nBERLIN We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs? \nROSS The dogs? \nBERLIN Two dogs. He should do the dogs. \nAnd both turn towards a Voice shouting from deep in the gloom. \nVENABLES Sergeant - we got a brassiere over here. Looks like it could be blood. \nROSS Oh, shit. \nBERLIN Alright, I'm coming .. \nAnother intrusion from the radio. TRAVIS repeats the question. \nTRAVIS The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict? \nROSS Ask him. \nBERLIN Yeah, he can go ... \nROSS Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here. \nDid someone say something funny? Does BERLIN just about smile. \nBERLIN It's good to be with you, Ross. \nAnd this is probably the only time ROSS will look happy today. \nROSS Glad you finally made it, Bro ... \n14:  EXT.  CAR PARK.  POLICE STATION.  CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY. \nThe Mercedes descends an incline and parks. Brown Chevys and black & white patrol cars. Dismal lights and raining like it doesn't end. BERLIN gets out and unloads the trunk (aquarium & insulated picnic box). Slams the trunk and reveals BLATTIS. \n", "test1_true": "Proffers a big yellow one plus assistance carrying equipment. \nBERLIN Is this normal? \nBLATTIS Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June. \nRaining hard enough to hurt. A brisk intimacy across the lot. \nBetter in the summer.  You get to fucka few tourists .. \nHe hits a security code at the door. Obviously familiar with the station. Dialogue continues as they step into a corridor. \n15:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBLATTIS [BERLIN] Not married are you, Sergeant? [No.] That's good, you get to fuck a few more. So how long you known Freddy? \nBERLIN Freddy? Forever - he was my serg- eant when I was a kid - don't get to see a lot of each other - but we been buddies two hundred years .. \nBLATTIS Did he get you the job? \nBERLIN I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire .. \nBLATTIS Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you. \nThey push through doors into the biggest room in the building. A dozen desks back to back and all the clutter and clatter of typewriters and paperwork and Secretaries swapping the gossip. \nToo many cops to describe and no time to remember them anyway. But here's one making introductions. About 60 years old. Face a mix of brick and fat. The Chief of Eureka Police is CITRINE. \nCITRINE Sergeants Serato, and Taylor. \nAny handshakes and greetings that fit in around the equipment. \nMr Travis, I think you know .. \nBERLIN Do me a favor, Travis?  Bring in the resta the stuff from my car? \nBLATTIS tosses his parasol \"Don't lose it\" and follows BERLIN. \nBLATTIS Did you find the knife, Sergeant? \nBERLIN No .. But we have a theory .. \nBLATTIS Kid told me he didn't take it? \nBERLIN Maybe he's lying to you? \nBy now they're in an L shaped room with wood benches and bull- etin board all over the walls. Bullshit everywhere in packing cases. Dusty Playboy spreads amongst other junk on the boards. \nBLATTIS Is it true you found a hand? \nAnd he benches the aquarium as BERLIN loses the insulated box. \nIs that it? \nCITRINE (O.S.) Interview over, Blattis ... \nBLATTIS C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes .. \nRight now the box contains camera equipment which is unpacked. \nCITRINE .. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do .. \nBLATTIS Grateful for your candor, Sir. \nCITRINE Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about .. \nBLATTIS Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant? \nCITRINE Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it .. \nA Woman's face around the door. \"Los Angeles for Sergeant Ber- lin.\" And goodbye BLATTIS as Berlin reaches for the telephone. \nBERLIN Why did he ask if it was frozen? \nCITRINE That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone .. \nCITRINE splits as BERLIN picks up \"Hey, Ronzo, good of you to call.\" A long phone lead and he continues to unpack equipment. \nBERLIN (Phone) Listen, my time isn't good - but two things - really important - the bras- siere I sent you? - I need to know if those stains are human blood - and if they are, do they match the blood in the sample? - C'mon, gimme a break, I don't know anyone up here, it would take two weeks - C'mon, Ronny, I'm ask- ing nice? I really need to know wheth- er I'm interested in that brassiere? .. \nA cut-out of Popeye The Sailor with fist round a camera on the wall. Telephone resistance is collapsing and he breaks a smile. \nYou're my favourite man - raining - I gotta go - Ronny - I gotta go - I got a house fulla removal men and a date at the morgue - And, Ron, Con- gratulations - you're my first call .. \n16:  INT.  MORGUE.  COUNTY HOSPITAL.  EUREKA.  DAY. \nROSS has a Vic inhaler up his nostril. An inadequate defense. A sudden stink slams into his neck muscles. Head and inhaler travel rearward. He shifts eyes to BERLIN who scans the Bum's autopsy reports. A PATHOLOGIST comments on his handiwork into a microphone hanging from the ceiling. \"Except as previously noted, the liver is not remarkable.\" ROSS doesn't believe it. \nPATHOLOGIST .. if the knife hadn't killed him, the booze would .. I nev- er seen such a bad cirrhosis .. \nBERLIN You say the cut's left to right? (He does) Isn't that unusual? He's left handed? \n", "test1_id": 636, "test2_input": "BERLIN Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10. \nDaftest thing Ross ever heard. BERLIN is poised to make a print. \nROSS You want my advice? \nBERLIN Maybe? \nROSS Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that \"bye-bye.\" Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief .. \n22:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY. \nBERLIN & ROSS are opposite ends of a bed jammed on the stairs. \"Bastards. I gave em a 20 buck tip.\" Various navigational sug- gestions from ROSS win them another stair. Plus advice from a 12 year old called BOBBY. \"You gotta go left, Dad.\" ROSS knows he's gotta go left! Both heave as MARGIE walks out the kitchen. \nMARGIE You're all done except the floor. \nThe house is a zoo of furniture. Bullshit piled up everywhere. \nBERLIN You're a saint, Margie, thanks .. \nBy now she's got the apron off and her coat on. \"C'mon, Bobby.\" \nMARGIE Don't forget the wagon, Darlin? \nAnd off they go via a slammed door as the phone starts to ring. \n23:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  DAY. \nIn they stagger. The bed goes down. And BERLIN sprawls on top of it. Devastated for oxygen. \"Alright. That's it. I'm fucked.\" \nROSS You gotta stop smoking .. \nBERLIN I am stopping smoking ... \nROSS I don't mean this \"system\" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean stop .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, you can .. \nBERLIN How'd you do it, old man? \nROSS Someone bet me a dollar .. \nBERLIN A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar .. \nBERLIN manages to find air to sit. Reaches for the Ansa Phone. \nROSS Alright. I'll bet you fifty? \nFirst call comes from Delaware Roofing vis-a-vis the estimate. \nBERLIN Fifty dollars?  You got a bet. \nDuring these proceedings the machine has moved to another call. \n[MACHINE] [J.B./Ronzo/Got some results for you/ First/ the blood on the bra is human/ and it's not a popular brand/A.B. Neg and that's a rare one/Two/the blood on the brassie- re is compatible with the blood from the hand/Three/If you need anything else the official answer from all us Christians down here, is fuck off/Shoot me a duck/Bye] \nROSS What are you gonna do, Soldier? \nBERLIN I'm gonna dig up \"Jennifer.\" \n24:  INT.  (TELETYPE)/ADMIN.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nAnd here's part of the \"exhumation.\" CITRINE stares at a tele- type machine waiting for transmission on Jennifer to complete. Approximate date of birth/Approximate date of death/ Identity Unknown. Visible misgivings as he hauls it out and reads. One or two chairs already on desks. ROSS still at his pawing over documents with a detective called SERATO. Cigarette smoke and shirt sleeves. ROSS looks up and catches CITRINE as he passes. \nROSS Chief, I gotta talk to ya about this fat lady? \nCITRINE What about her? \nROSS She's making my life a misery .. I wanna give her a lie-detector test? \nCITRINE continues up the carpet. \"Alright, we'll talk about it.\" \n25:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT. \nA florescent glow from a T.V. monitor supplies the only light. BERLIN vacillates interest between the scanner and the screen. \nCITRINE (O.S.) What is that? \nBERLIN Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here? (Green on the screen) It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something? \nBut CITRINE isn't interested in finger nails. He's staring at a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl. She wears a brassiere stuffed with newspaper and a black wig. (Welcome Jennifer Two) \nShe's almost identical to Jennifer. Slim - White - same age - bra size is even the same. Nicely made lady. \nCITRINE stares at the Dummy like he's gonna ask it a question. \nCITRINE How do you know her hair's black? \nBERLIN Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair. \nCITRINE What is all this Jennifer stuff? \nHe waves a handful of teletype before dumping it on a bench. \n", "test2_true": "BERLIN Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think \"Jennifer,\" and this lady got hit by the same guy? \nCITRINE I don't see that at all .. \nOn the board is a super-imposed picture of a hand over a wrist. \nBERLIN I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut .. \nCITRINE Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body? \nA question he doesn't need because he hasn't an answer. CITRINE has an eye on further photographs relevant to the Jennifer case. \nI don't know nothing about this \"Jenn- ifer\" girl, cept what some of the guys told me - but principal feature of the case was a gruesome displayal of the body. He wanted it found. So if this is the same guy, why's he hidden this one? \nAnother question he can't answer - and this time he doesn't get a chance - BISLEY walks in with an apology for the interruption. Got a face like Humphrey Bogart's mother fucked a different guy. \nBISLEY Just wondered if you had time to get around to my pharmacy stuff? \nBERLIN You'll have it in the morning .. \nBISLEY Alright, I'll try again tomorrow. \nBisley has gone but his tension stays. BERLIN unwraps fresh gum. \nCITRINE Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this. \nBERLIN I thought it was Taylor's case? \nCITRINE Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had. \nThis is CITRINE's shop and BERLIN isn't gonna row it with him. \nBERLIN What do you want me to do, Chief? \nCITRINE I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is right now, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this .. \nHe refers to a little bicycle. Vouchered and obviously stolen. By now CITRINE is at the hinges. A pause before he disappears. \nWhy don't you give it a minute, & stop by my office. We should talk. \n26:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  CITY OF EUREKA.  NIGHT. \nMelted neon in the streets. A wet mid-town night. Nothing but sound of windshield wipers and click of a Zippo lighter. ROSS rides stoic passenger while BERLIN drives with festering eyes. \nROSS .. what does he think it is? \nBERLIN [ROSS] Everything it isn't [make a left]. He even tried a \"self-inflicted.\" \nROSS It's possible. \nBERLIN C'mon, Ross, the bra and hand were in different bags a 100 feet apart .. \nThey stop at a light and a beeper goes as warning to the blind. \nWhat's she gonna do?  Dump her bra in one bag, her hand in the other, and wander off whistling Hey Jude? \nROSS It's the garage on the far corner. \nBERLIN is worrying at his fingertip on the wheel of the Zippo. \nYou can't stop it, can you? \nBERLIN What do you mean? \nROSS Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles. \nBERLIN What do you mean, Ross? \nThe lights change and off they go and BERLIN waits for a turn. \nROSS Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present? \nBERLIN Why don't you dump the \"Fat Lady?\" \nROSS Because I dislike her too much .. \nBERLIN O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him. \nROSS No you don't. That's how you think you feel about him. That's how you feel about yourself. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for you. \nAnd by now they've arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt. It's indicative of their friendship that ROSS can talk like this. \nWait for me. It might not be ready. \nHe quits the car and BERLIN watches him scurry towards a service shop. Rain beats on the roof and BERLIN looks stubbed out. A lot of cuts coming up and here are some of them. Runs a hand through his hair in unconscious frustration. A finger constantly bothers the Zippo. Eyes towards ROSS who silhouettes in florescent light. \nSomewhere in the background the lights change to red. Once again the beeping sound of traffic-lights speaking to the blind. Maybe he looks across but that doesn't matter. Something just happens inside his head he isn't yet quite aware of. Everything in close up. Big on the Zippo. Big on BERLIN. And he leaps out of the car. \nBERLIN sprints through the weather.  A station wagon is still in the air at the end of an hydraulic jack. Surprise from ROSS and a MECHANIC as BERLIN arrives. Fuck the fanbelt and listen to this. \nBERLIN I just had this insane idea - if I'm wrong, I'll take a week off and redecorate your entire house .. \n", "test2_id": 637, "test3_input": "A side table features several pin sharp pencils. A Sony pocket recorder. Two packets of Pall Mall reds. Two yellow legal pads. The chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file. \nSt ANNE Alright, let's not beat about the bush, what ever that may mean, and get down on it. You were specific- ally instructed by your chief, not to go anywhere near the blind inst- itute? So why did you go up there? \nBERLIN Because of a feeling. I had a bad feeling this man was gonna turn up. \nSt ANNE Which man is that? \nBERLIN The man I detail in my report, Sir. \nThe report that's in his hands. (St Anne knows well which man.) \nIs this an interview, or an interrogation? \nSt ANNE It's an enquiry ... \nBERLIN I'm not prepared to be interrog- ated. I'll be interviewed as an officer, who may be expected to cooperate with the investigator. \nSt ANNE Well, that's fine by me, John. And I'm sure that's fine by your Chief. \nHe smiles the non-smile. Tosses his pencil down. And sits back. \nSo you thought your man might show? \nBERLIN Yes. \nSt ANNE Bit of a long-shot, wasn't it? \nBERLIN It was the only shot I had .. \nSt ANNE So the one night you decide to go up there, he goes up there? \nBERLIN That's right. Except I'd decid- ed to go up there every night .. \nSt ANNE Despite the wishes of your Chief? \nBERLIN Yes. \nSt ANNE You were prepared to fal- sify your reports to him? \nBERLIN I had very good reasons for do.... \nSt ANNE Just a second, John. I knew there was something missing. \nSt ANNE cuts him off to pick up the phone. Obviously something vital is needed. \"Could you bring an an ashtray in here? Got a coupla guys who smoke in here.\" And attention back to the file. \nYou don't mind if I jump around a little this morning, do you? Just while I'm easing my way into this? \nBERLIN You're asking the questions, Sir .. \nSt ANNE You had an argument with Ross? Ass- aulted one of the officers, right? \nBERLIN I wouldn't use the word \"assault.\" \nSt ANNE You got a \"racy temper,\" Sergeant? \nBERLIN Not especially. \nSt ANNE Just something they did, on this occasion, made you lose your rag? \nBERLIN Not they. He. Taylor put a piece in the newspaper, which in my op- inion put my witness in jeopardy. \nSt ANNE From whom? \nBERLIN From the man I detail in my rep- ort. A crazy man, who to my cert- ain knowledge has killed at least eight girls. Six in San Diego, one someplace else, and one up here .. \nSt ANNE Not a lotta support for that \"scenario\" though, is there? \nBERLIN Not a lot. \nSt ANNE Not even from Ross? \nBERLIN No. \nSt ANNE Is that why you lost your temper with him? Frustration? No one believing you? \nHis ASSISTANT brings the ashtray. And St ANNE smiles gratitude. \nSo what can you tell me about you man? \nBERLIN What do you mean, Sir? \nSt ANNE I mean, who is he? \nBERLIN I don't know who he is. Who's \"Jack The Ripper?\" He's Jack The Ripper with an automobile. \nSt ANNE You didn't run a profile? \nBERLIN No, Sir .. I didn't have the res- ources, and it isn't my expertise. \nSt ANNE This crazy man? What makes you think he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson? \n", "test3_true": "St ANNE I'm asking a question .. \nBERLIN Because he reads I'm investigating the disappearance of her friend, & Miss Robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety. How good of a \"witness\" is she? He's crazy, but not stupid, he's intelligent. Got a flexible M. O., and he doesn't wanna get caught. \nSt ANNE Just like \"Jack The Ripper?\" \nThis is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both. \nAlright, we'll have plenty of time to discuss your \"Mystery Man,\" and his \"flexibility\" later, Right now, I'd like to talk about the \"event.\" \n127:  INT. ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nCITRINE rests on his cane staring through the one-way glass. A menu of anxieties. But perhaps sadness is his principal expres- sion. His eyes slide to the ASSISTANT \"Can you turn that thing on?\" Glad to oblige and Voices cut in. This is CITRINE'S P.O.V. \nSt ANNE [BERLIN] Alright, the door comes back and hits you? Knocks you down? Knocks you out? For how long? [I don't know] Approximately, you figure? A minute? [O.K.] O.K. then what happened? Immediately you get up? \n128:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY. \nBERLIN I realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs \nSt ANNE Did you check your weapon? \nBERLIN Maybe. It would have been instinctive. All I know was I was in possession of it .. \nSt ANNE You didn't check it? \nBERLIN Not that I specifically remember. \nSt ANNE Why not? \nBERLIN I don't know. I wasn't think- ing about it .. I was dazed .. \nSt ANNE You were woozy? Confused? \nBERLIN I was unconscious 10 seconds ago. \nSt ANNE I understand. Then? \nBERLIN Then I picked up the flashlight, tried to get Ross on the radio .. Nothing. Static. I got blood on my hand, realized my eye was cut. \nSt ANNE Could you see out of it? \nBERLIN Yeah, I could see. Then I ran. Climbed out of the window, ran down the fire escape, and right at the bottom, I found Ross .. \nSt ANNE Were you breathless? \nBERLIN Sure I was breathless ... \nSt ANNE When did you realize you were no longer in possession of the .25? \nBERLIN Not until I was in the hospital. \nSt ANNE You figure you lost it in the hospital? Or on the way there? \nBERLIN No, I thought it must have fallen down the stairwell. \nSt ANNE [BERLIN] Like the flashlight? [Yeah] Had you been drinking that night? \nBERLIN It was Christmas Eve. \nSt ANNE That wasn't my question? \nBERLIN Yes. \nSt ANNE [BERLIN] How about Ross? [Sure] Were you drinking in the car? [?] There was a bottle in the car? \nBERLIN I think Ross had a mouthful? \nSt ANNE But not you? \nBERLIN I may have had a nip? \nSt ANNE To keep out the cold? .. Very cold that night, very windy, wasn't it? \nSt ANNE motors off & refers to notes without looking at BERLIN. \nWhich hand was the flashlight in? \nBERLIN My left hand. \nSt ANNE And the Walther was in your right? \nBERLIN The Beretta was in my right hand .. \nSt ANNE You said you didn't check it? So how d'you know which gun you're holding? \nThe chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass. \nYou said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight? You said you were confused? You pick up the flashlight in confusion, how d'you know you didn't pick up the 25? \nBERLIN Let's not start playing games, Mr St Anne. \n", "test3_id": 638}

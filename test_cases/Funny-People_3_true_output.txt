GEORGE I got money. I want to challenge myself. You said you liked it. 
TERRY You know, I read it four years ago. I need to read it again. I don't remember not liking it. I just can't tell you the studio will make it. Your last few movies didn't do so well. 
GEORGE I thought they did well overseas. 
TERRY You always do well in Australia, but that's about it. 
GEORGE What if I do it for no money, just with back-end? 
TERRY I don't know if that's going to cut it either. The head of the studio does a lot of drinking, I don't think he finds that whole area funny. Maybe if you commit to do another one of the Davey movies, I could tie it to that, so they have to do both. 
GEORGE I'vedone four Davey movies.They wantme to do another sequelto that?We don't even have ascript. 
TERRY Wellthere's this great script goingaround town, Happy Holidays. Whichis about an immature 40 year old man who acts like a kid. In it he comes home for the holiday season for the first time in ten years. And havoc ensues. You get to make fun of Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah and Christmas and New Years. They say they can turn it into a Davey movie. 
GEORGE Could I at least shoot the Making Amends movie first? 
TERRY No. 
GEORGE Maybe I'll just write something myself. 
TERRY I wish you would. You've never been able to do it in the past. You always talk a big game about writing your own shit. But I've yet to see a script land on my desk. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DUSK 
George and Ira are sitting at a large kitchen table. There is a computer on the table and index cards. On the floor is a corkboard. 
IRA See, the thing I was thinking, was...you always play an immature guy. What if the joke of the movie is you're incredibly smart, intellectual and well-mannered. You just go the opposite way with it. 
GEORGE There's nothing funny about being smart. All comedy comes from immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Charlie Chaplin. They were all immature. They were all knuckleheads. Who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally? What's funny about that? What else you got? 
IRA I. .I gotta go through my notes. 
GEORGE I'm thinking about taking a gig, and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground. 
IRA Well we'll still write the script, right? 
GEORGE Yeah, if we can come up with an idea. 
IRA Let's just keep banging at it. 
GEORGE I can't. I've got a date. 
IRA You have a date? Who do you have a date with? 
GEORGE This woman my agent set me up with. She raises money for this environmental group. I guess she's like a normal person. I can't live here alone in this house forever. I need something of significance in my life. So I'm gonna go out on some dates. No pressure. 
IRA You know what you should do, just as an experiment? You should try and not fuck her? 
GEORGE Why would you say that? 
IRA Because you're always saying you don't know if women like you for who you are. You don't know if they like you because you have money or you're famous. Why not take some time and get to know them before ass-raping them. In a romantic way. 
GEORGE That's insulting. Don't take out your frustrations on me because you can't get laid by acting like I'm some sort of deviant. I'm an adult. I have adult sexual relationships. No one does what they don't want to do. Sex is how people decide if they like each other. I'm testing my compatibility by ass-raping them. 
IRA See, you can't do it. You can't even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them. 
GEORGE That's not true. I'm bored of sex, anyway. There is literally no body- part/orifice combination I haven't experimented with. There is nothing left to do. There is no nationalities I haven't.slept with, no age groups I haven't slept with. I'm fully ready for normal. 
IRA What nationalities have you slept with? 
GEORGE US. Canada. Mexico. England. France. Spain. North Korea. Burma. Rwanda. Kenya. Tibet. Serbia. Chechnya. Iran. The Green Zone. Darfur. The Killing Fields of Cambodia. Mongolia. What about you? 
IRA New Jersey. Do handjobs count? Because then also California. 
INT. RESTAURTANT - NIGHT 
George is talking with RACHEL WARWICK. 
GEORGE You know, I haven't been out on a blind date, ever. This may be the first one. 
RACHEL Oh I go out on them all the time. I've been on a bunch of J Dates. 
GEORGE What's J Date? 
RACHEL It's a website where Jewish people find each other.

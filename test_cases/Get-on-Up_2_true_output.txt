We find Aunt Honey sitting a chair.     She holds a small dog in her arms. 
SEVEN PROSTITUTES wash clothes in tubs and hang them on a line to dry. 
Aunt Honey clearly runs the house. She rises from her chair. Clearly she takes no shit. 
JOE ..S'much appreciated Honey. Sure is mighty kind.. 
AUNT HONEY What the hell am I supposed to do with that donkey, Joe? 
JOE BROWN Thought you could sell it. 
AUNT HONEY I don't sell donkey, Joe. And Jumpin' in the Army ain't gone make this boy go away. 
Joe looks away from Honey. 
JOE (to James) Look after yourself Junior. 
Aunt Honey and James watch Joe cross the street and disappear. 
AUNT HONEY Everybody gotta be somewhere. What's your name, sugar? 
JAMES Junior. 
AUNT HONEY Guess you Little Junior now. 
Honey turns to a small two story building in the rear of the yard. 
AUNT HONEY (CONT'D) Big Junior! 
A huge 15 year old boy comes out of the building and begins walking down the stairs. This is the younger version of Big Junior who we met outside the jail. 
AUNT HONEY (TO JAMES) (CONT'D) You show me you can bring it in you an me ain't got no problem. (as Junior approaches) Junior'll show y'how to do. 
EXT. THE TERRY. STREET. DAY. 
Big Junior leads James away from Aunt Honey's. Big Junior turns to James. 
BIG JUNIOR I do this... (BJ touches his hat) You say `Pretty girls', unnerstand? So when they come, you be ready, alright? I'll say- Yessir, yessir, come on down the street-we got sweet whiskey, we got music- (touches his hat) 
JAMES Pretty girls. 
BIG JUNIOR We got cards, we got dice, dancing- (touches his hat again) 
JAMES Pretty girls. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUS STOP. THE TERRY. AUGUSTA. DAY.   JAMES 9 YRS 
Soldiers disembark from a troop Bus. Big Junior and James stand on the platform playing and dancing in bare feet. The soldiers ignore James. 
We again begin to hear "James' Theme" in James' head. He dances faster, sharper. The soldiers stop and take notice of his ever sharping skill. 
INT. AUNT HONEY'S PARLOR. LATER THAT NIGHT. 
The Brothel is in full swing. Girls. Soldiers. Drunks. Hustlers. Music. Ten soldiers scramble over only five prostitutes. 
James hands over money to Aunt Honey. She bundles him up and kisses him. He holds onto her tightly. She sets him down. 
AUNT HONEY You done good Little Junior. You the sweetest little boy in the world. Hear me? 
James nods as two soldiers begin fighting over one of the prostitutes. Each pulling her in a different direction. Honey rises. 
AUNT HONEY (CONT'D) (to James) Go on in the kitchen. Find you a scrap to eat. 
Aunt Honey pulls out a knife that has been nuzzled inside her bra. James watches as she fixes the situation. 
INT. BARBERSHOP. THE NEXT DAY.   JAMES 19 YRS 1952 
The band has just gotten their hair-cut like Louis Jordan (and James Brown). 
Bobby Byrd looks at his hair in the mirror. 
BOBBY I don't know, James.   This don't look too gospel. 
JAMES What you talkin' about? Your hair is rising up to the Lord right? Like a flame. 
Nayfloyd looks deep into the mirror in front of him. 
NAYFLOYD The flames of hell. We're the Gospel Starlighters. We a gospel group. This is R & B hair. 
JAMES What you think "Caldonia" is, Nafloyd. 
NAFLOYD (Ruffled) We just playin' around with "Caldonia" when we practicing. That don't make us R & B. We still Gospel. 
INT. BIG BILL'S RENDEZVOUS. TOCCOA, 1954. NIGHT. 
The place is packed. On stage the 22 year old Little Richard is all over the piano, singing the hell out of Tutti Frutti. 
AT THE BACK -- Bobby and the band stand in shock and awe. 
NAFLOYD I swear he's gonna break that piano. 
James is transfixed. Motionless. Soaking it up. 
ON STAGE -- The song ends. The crowd explode.

Toby watches Harvey eat a few. 
HARVEY Hey, watermelon. That's pretty good. 
TOBY I recommend the pi√±a coladas. They are excellent and very authentic tasting. 
Toby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off the shelves, stuffing his bag. Harvey gets up and comes after him. 
HARVEY Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during lent? 
TOBY Sure. I don't see why not. You can't eat meat on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime. 
HARVEY Ya think there's any connection between lentils and lent? 
TOBY I don't think so but I'll ask Sister Mary Fred at church on Sunday. 
HARVEY Sister Mary Fred, huh? Is she cute? Sounds kinda mannish but who am I to be picky. 
TOBY Harvey, you're funny. She's a nun. 
HARVEY So what? Maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy. 
TOBY Harvey, she became a nun because she had a higher calling. 
HARVEY Higher calling. That is such a crock of shit. I don't know why you waste your time prayin' anyway. 
TOBY Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And I'm a very spiritual person. You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself. It might cheer you up. 
Toby turns on his heels and walks off. 
HARVEY (calling after him) What? Do I seem depressed, Toby? 
Toby doesn't respond. 
Harvey shrugs and digs deep into the jelly bean bag. He pulls out a fistful. 
CLOSE ON HARVEY'S HAND 
Jellybeans in every imaginable color. Harvey fingers a few and then picks a blue one.

HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE 
A few items from the previous scene are present on the sound stage indicating that it's a set of AMERICAN SPLENDOR -- The Movie. 
THE ACTOR HARVEY stands alone, his hand filled with Jelly beans. 
BOB THE DIRECTOR Okay, that was great. The bakery scene is next... 
ACTOR HARVEY steps out of the frame, revealing a craft service table behind him. At the table, the REAL HARVEY and the REAL TOBY load up on donuts. The two discuss the food on the set. 
Ironically, the Real Toby is actually more extreme than the Actor who plays him -- even more robotic, and completely incapable of eye-contact. 
The REAL TOBY discusses the finer points of nerdom and evaluates the Actor's nerd quotient. The Real Harvey explains to Actor Toby that nothing -- not even gourmet jelly beans -- would have cheered him up at that point in his life. 
He was too lonely and depressed.

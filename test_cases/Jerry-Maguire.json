{"train": "JERRY MAGUIRE \nJERRY MAGUIRE \nEARTH FROM SPACE \nThe blue marble as seen from space.  We hear the calm voice of Jerry Maguire, talking just to us. \nJERRY'S VOICE Airight so this is the world and there are five billion people on it.  When I was a kid there were three.  It's hard to keep up. \nAMERICA FROM SPACE \nThe great continent through mist and swirling skies. (Satellites and other pieces of skycasting equipment float by.) \nJERRY'S VOICE That's better.  That's america. See, America still sets the tone for the world... \nKID ON BASKETBALL COURT \nA puberty-ravaged kid dribbles a basketball, stares straight at us. \nJERRY'S VOICE In Indiana -- Clark Hodd.  13. The best point guard in the country. Puberty hasn't been easy. \nDiscreetly, his hand slips into his pants and scratches. \nGirl on a high dive she's poised.  A faraway look in her eyes. \nJERRY'S VOICE (continuing) Becky Farling.  You'll see her in the next Olympics. \nShe launches her dive into mid-air, into nothingness. \nON TEENAGE GIRL BOXER \nthrowing punches toward the camera. \nJERRY'S VOICE Seattle, Washington.  Dallas Malloy. Went to court to be allowed to box professionally. She's 16. \nON A YOUNG BASEBALL PLAYER \nat bat. \nJERRY'S VOICE Art Stallings, Indio, California. Check out what pure joy looks like. \nHe swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter than that.  He drills it over the first baseman's head, just out of reach of his glove. Art runs to first, laughing.  Pats the first baseman's butt.  Gotcha. \nON GOLDEN BOY QUARTERBACK -- FRANK CUSHMAN \nA line of NFL scouts watch a dazzling pass from a future star. \nJERRY'S VOICE In Odessa, Texas, the great Frank Cushman.  Cush is 20. Quarterback, role model, my client. He'll probably go number one in the draft this year. \nCush turns into a closer shot.  He's a living magazine cover. \nA YOUNG CHAMPIONSHIP GOLFER \neyeing a long but level putt. \nJERRY'S VOICE There's genius everywhere, but until they turn pro, it's like popcorn in the pan. Some pop... \nThe kid misses the shot, whips his club at his coach. \nJERRY'S VOICE (continuing) ...  some don't. \nHold on the kid, he's all youthful adrenalin, breathing hard. Portrait of an intense young competitor. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. NFL OWNERS MEETING/PALM DESERT FOUR SEASONS -- DAY \nA wall of new NFL merchandise.  Television monitors blink with the latest endorsement films. Into frame moves JERRY MAGUIRE, 35.  He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes and Sports Team Owners.  We hear Herb Alpert's epic instrumental, \"The Lonely Bull.\" \nJERRY'S VOICE Now I'm the guy you don't usually see. I'm the one behind the scenes.  I'm the sports agent. \nINT. NFL OWNER'S MEETING LOBBY -- MINUTES LATER \nJerry sits in a red leather chair, across from an agitated General Manager.  He cooly works out figures on a yellow legal tablet. \nJERRY Easy now, we can spread these numbers over five years... \nJERRY'S VOICE You know those photos where the new player holds up the team jersey and poses with the owner? \nFlash of photo \nAnonymous Athlete holds up jersey, standing next to Team Owner. Zoom in on someone's shirt-sleeve on left of frame. \nJERRY'S VOICE (continuing) That's me on the left. \nON ANONYMOUS NEWPORT BEACH BUILDING \nJERRY'S VOICE Inside that building, that's where I work.  Sports Management International. \nThere is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the words he's typing.  His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow moist. \nJERRY'S VOICE What started out as one page became twenty-five. Suddenly I was my father's son.  I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job, how I ended up here out of law school, the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field... I was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who said: \nSHOT OF DICKY FOX \nDICKY FOX The key to this job is personal relationships. \nAs Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now. \nJERRY'S VOICE And suddenly it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients.  Caring for them, caring for ourselves, and the games too. Starting our lives, really. \nSHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear. \nHe pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence. \nJERRY'S VOICE (continuing) Hey, I'll be the first to admit it. What I was writing was somewhat \"touchy feely.\" \nHe deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and continues on, boldly. \nJERRY'S VOICE (continuing) I didn't care.  I had lost the ability to bullshit.  It was the me I'd always wanted to be. \nINT. KINKO'S COPIES -- NIGHT \nJerry in T-shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out. Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the Night nearby. \nJERRY'S VOICE I printed it up in the middle of the night, before I could re-think it. \nIndustrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly, taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the counter, for Jerry's approval. \nTHE THINGS WE THINK AND DO NOT SAY (The Future of Our Business) \nKINKO'S GUY That's how you become great, man. You hang your ba11s out there. \nJerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does. \nJERRY (self-effacing) Thanks. \nON MEMOS \nbeing stuffed into mail-slots. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING \nJerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up. He looks younger, lighter. \nON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING) \nSuddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura. (\"Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea who it was?\")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone, and dials with urgency. \nJERRY Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh, listen did those manuscripts get... Oh they did... No no no no no, that's fine... \nINT. ELEVATOR -- DAY \nJERRY Jerry in suit, alone with his luggage.  Dry throat. clammy, holds onto the handrail to steady himself. \nINT. LOBBY -- DAY \nThe lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders. (\"Finally, someone said it!\") Suddenly another agent begins to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26 year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen forever. It is a watershed moment in his life. \nJERRY'S VOICE I was 35.  I had started my life. \nSwing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the other. \nAGENT # 1 (RACHEL) How long you give him? \nAGENT # 2 (CHRIS) Mmmm.  A week. \nON AIRPLANE WHEELS \nfolding up into a plane, as music and credits end. \nINT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT \nWe move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby. The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy phone conversation with her boyfriend. \nWOMAN Monkeyface... monkeyface, listen... I'm not going to say it here.... no... \nJerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps.  Battery's low. \nWOMAN (continuing) ...  oh listen, I got you the perfect white shirt, at this out of the way place... no... quit trying to make me say it! \nJerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying not to listen. \nWOMAN (continuing) how about if I do it and don't say it... mmmm... see you soon... \nShe laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her. \nJERRY I have to ask. \nJERRY But wait... \nBACK TO DOROTHY \nShe is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story. The plane is now quieter.  She listens to the easy sound of Jerry discussing his charmed life. \nRAY (waking up) Mama -- \nDOROTHY Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping. \nHe sneezes, three big ones in a row.  She hands him more kleenex, riveted on the story.  And listens. \nJERRY'S VOICE Now little do I know that my assistant. has assumed that I've now proposed. So she has gotten the lounge band to actually play \"Here Comes The Bride\" when we walk back in. \nDorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively.  She tries to share the laugh with her son, who stares at her. \nBACK TO JERRY -- LATER \nJERRY Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, \"Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.\" And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said \"yes\" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February. \nWOMAN Jerry.  You two will be together forever. \nBACK TO DOROTHY \nShe takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class. Dorothy blows her nose, moved against her will. \nRAY What's wrong, mom? \nDOROTHY First class is what's wrong.  It used to be a better meal.  Now it's a better life. \nShe pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been listening to its author.  She opens it and begins to read. \nINT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING \nJerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon. \nJERRY (quietly, like a coach) You'll know when you see him. You'll know when you see him. \nBobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly in tiger-print sweats.  He looks like Mickey Dolenz.  He holds flowers. \nWOMAN Oh my God, you're right.  I know. (Jerry smiles) He's not The One.  He's not the One. \nJerry's face falls.  Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace, faking it.  Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for loved ones.  Music. \nINT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING \nDorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage conveyor belt.  She clutches a cup of coffee.  In the background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit. \nDOROTHY Ray! Ray! \nMaguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the dark depths behind the flaps. \nJERRY Can I help? \nDOROTHY Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm -- \nJERRY I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body. \nDOROTHY (surprised) Hmm.  Pretty good. \nJERRY Now what did you lose? \nDOROTHY My son... my mind... \nOver her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner, riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the Delaware. \nJERRY Well, while I go look for him, why don't you hang onto this curious gentleman behind you -- \nDorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches him off the belt.  She bends down into his face.  She speaks softly but intensely, with no frills. \nDOROTHY Remember \"imagination?\"... remember what that means?  Well, this is one of my bosses so you will now IMAGINE me screaming at you right now. Do NOT do that again.  Ever ever EVER. \nShe rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young woman of 26.  It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a day. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Well, thanks. \nJERRY Well, take care. \nDOROTHY And have fun at your bachelor party. \nJerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough.  Dorothy freezes. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Oh no. \nJERRY No no. I knew. \nDOROTHY (slow sigh) Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise. \nJERRY No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called \"my twenties.\" See you later. \nJerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office. \nINT. CRONIN'S -- DAY \nSugar dines alone now.  Casually whips out a portable phone. \nINT. SMI ELEVATOR -- DAY \nJerry in the elevator, eyes wide, mind racing.  Dorothy Boyd sees him, raises a hand to say hello.  Decides this is not a good time. \nINT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY \nClose on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to the back office.  Music \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMaguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk.  He takes a breath, and begins to go to work. From within his bottom drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook.  Then from another drawer, a phone book. And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third smaller phone book. They are lined in front of him now, as he dials. \nINT. CUSHMAN HOME/ODESSA -- DAY \nFrank \"Cush\" Cushman picks up the phone.  Today, the young football God wears a yellow scarf on his head. He's still playing NBA Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks. \nEXT. CRONIN'S -- DAY \nSugar at the table.  Chameleon-like, he adopts the personality of whomever he talks to. \nSUGAR Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya first 'cause you're the most important guy in sports... \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMaguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax into the machine at the same time. \nJERRY Carla, right now you're paying 25% of your endorsments to SMI, I would cut my commission by 7%... \nAs he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom drawer. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nSugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable. \nSUGAR You read that memo I snuck to you, the guy's tired of the job.  Tired of making you money. \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMaguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all while he talks quickly on the phone. \nJERRY And when I got you that big contract in Chicago, and the fan poll in the Sun-Times was 93% against you, who went and found you that sympathetic journalist who turned it all around, it was me... \nINT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSeveral other agents working the cause behind Sugar, who breezes through the calls. \nSUGAR He's costing you money, Debra... he's oldschool. \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nJerry on the toilet.  Not a minute to spare. \nJERRY SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team... \nINT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSUGAR I've got the clients.  I've got the juice. \nINT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY \nDorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts.  To the right and left of her are the phones are ringing. \nSomething is amiss. She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts Exec CLEO, 32. \nDOROTHY What's going on? \nCLEO (no big deal) They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it at Cronin's. \nDorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat. She is strangely affected by the news. She scoots back on her roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office door. \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nThe pace has accelerated. \nJERRY -- personal attention -- \nINT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSugar talks faster. \nSUGAR -- more money, more endorsements -- \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nTIDWELL Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire -- \nWe meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of Tidwell, TEE PEE, 24.  Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version of his brother.  He says into the phone: \nTEE PEE Hello Jerry Maguire. \nTidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family monitoring the important call. \nTIDWELL --  the house is fallin' apart, we don't even know where we're gonna live in a year, and I'm supposed to be a \"superstar,\" man!  Are you catching my flow, here? \nJerry looks at his watch.  Doomed. \nJERRY I need a decision from you, Rod. \nINT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nSugar has three phones going. \nSUGAR Killer, Steve, good decision. (next call) So it's yes, right?  Excellente. (next call) Tell me it's yes... yes?  YES! \nTidwell enters bedroom.  Marcee, Tyson and Tee Pee in tow. \nTIDWELL --  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening? \nJERRY (dying) Mmm.  Hmm. \nTIDWELL It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready? \nJERRY Yes. \nTIDWELL Here it is.  \"Show me the money.\" (pause) Show.  Me.  The.  Money. \nJERRY I got it. \nTIDWELL Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me. \nThe lights have gone down in the city, and he hasn't had a chance to turn his own light on.  He sits in the oncoming darkness, watching the blinking white lights on the phone bank on the desk. \nJERRY Show.  Me.  The.  Money. \nTIDWELL Congratulations.  You're still my agent. \nTidwell hangs up.  Feeling good about the decision, he enters his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe collection. Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head. \nTEE PEE An African-American man running with a little ball, working for white owners and white agents. It's the iconography of rascism... (off Tidwell's dismissive look) ... but I woulda stayed at the bigger company. \nINT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY \nSugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself on the sofa.  He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof. The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his. \nINT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nJerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.  He looks back and symbolically flips the light switch off. Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off. So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly turned the lights on. \nEXT. CORNER OFFICE -- NIGHT \nBam.  Jerry's door opens.  He exits his office with box.  He is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged. Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving. \nJERRY Well, don't worry!  I'm not going to do what you think I'm going to do, which is FLIP OUT! \nJERRY (continuing) \nJerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his face.. \nJERRY (continuing) But let me just say, as I ease out of the office I helped build -- sorry, but it's a fact -- \nON DOROTHY -- WATCHING \nfrom her cubicle. \nJERRY -- that there is such a thing as manners.  A way of treating people... \nHe notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound. \nJERRY (continuing) These fish have manners!  They have manners. \nAnd now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger. Another cup of water as he finds power. \nJERRY (continuing) In fact.  They're coming with me! I'm starting a new company, and the fish will come with me and... you can call me sentimental. \nHe begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside. \nJERRY (continuing; to fish) it's okay... it's okay... \nNearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck. \nJERRY (continuing) But if anybody else wants to come with me, this moment will be the ground floor of something real and fun and inspiring and true in this godforsaken business and we will do it together!  Who's coming with me besides... \"Flipper\" here? \nBut clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie. \nFADE TO \nEXT. DOROTHY'S HOME -- NIGHT \nLights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.  The sound of women's voices. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nA living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced Women. This is their talk group.  We meet JAN, 30, who speaks shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks. She holds a too-full glass of red wine.  (Much of the talk in this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses) \nJAN I love men.  I respect men.  But that doesn't change the fact that most of them belong in cages... \nThe other nine women nod with deep understanding. \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nDorothy does the dishes.  Across the room, Laurel has her nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window.  She is a no- frills woman. She has some time ago shut off those aspects of her life spent pursuing the opposite sex.  They are in mid- argument. \nLAUREL What about medical? \nDOROTHY Of course, medical! \nLAUREL (unconvinced) You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous. \nDOROTHY (irritated) If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too. \nLAUREL (more irritated) You know how much those Well Child exams cost -- \nDOROTHY (overlapping) Of course I know -- \nLAUREL/DOROTHY A hundred and fifty dollars. \nLAUREL And that's just when he's well -- \nThey talk over each other arguing for a moment and then: \nDOROTHY Wait. Where is he? \nLAUREL He's in the living room asleep. \nDorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry. \nDOROTHY Wonderful.  Next time you lecture me, don't leave my little boy in a room with your Divorced Women's Group... \nShe exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the garbage disposal.  She has a hard time saying this, so she says it so nobody can hear: \nLAUREL Sorry. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nRay dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's Woes. Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up.  In frame another woman, ALICE, 50, speaks passionately to the group. \nALICE Okay I've finally, finally, gotten my anger straight here.  I'm going to visualize Carl being here and finally tell him -- \nDOROTHY Shhhh! \nDorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Come on, buddy, we're going to bed. \nINT. HALLWAY-- NIGHT \nShe stops for a moment, little boy in her hands.  The enormity of the day arrives with a thud. \nDOROTHY (to herself) What did I do? \nINT. JERRY'S CONDO -- NIGHT \nJerry is quickly packing for a road trip.  Avery looks on. They are both in a manic state. \nJERRY The power move is to go unannounced. (sotto) Black suit, right? \nAVERY (sotto) And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. (full volume) Tell me again, how was it left with Cush? \nJERRY (perfect imitation) \"Dad says we gwan sleep on it. \nAVERY Ugh! \nJERRY (turns, with clothes) Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed. (sotto) Jacket on, tie in pocket. \nAVERY (sotta) Good. (full volume) They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you. \nJERRY I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time. \nAVERY Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire. \nJERRY That's right. \nAVERY King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room! \nJerry drives back on the same bumpy road.  On the radio, it's the Rolling Stones.  He wants to sing along.  He thinks he knows the words, but... \nJERRY (sings) Feelin... \nHe realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics.  No one will ever know what the words are.  He switches again and finds \"Let's Groove Tonight\" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent. He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately.  Switches again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows. Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' \"Refugee.\" He drives through the countryside, singing the call and response of the song, like a happy idiot. \nINT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT -- DAY \nJerry turns into shot.  He's on the pay-phone.  He's jacked. \nJERRY Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery there? Where can I reach her? \nINTERCUT \nINT. DOROTHY/LAUREL'S HOUSE -- DAY \nDorothy is at her home work desk.  Curious and nervous about the new arrangement. \nDOROTHY Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta, didn't leave me her hotel number. \nThrough the back kitchen door comes CHAD THE NANNY, 29, red hair cropped above the ear. Baggy overalls.  Slipping through life with little turbulence.  He's with Ray, who holds pieces of wood and a hammer. \nCHAD The new playhouse rocks, Dotty. \nRAY (jumping) Yeah! \nDOROTHY Honey -- later, okay? (Ray jumps on her) Whoop.  Wait. \nJERRY Hello? \nDOROTHY (back to phone) Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff. \nChad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor.  He sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire. \nJERRY No, that's fine.  What calls came in today? \nDOROTHY Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is... \nShe flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to today, which is blank. \nDOROTHY (continuing) ... light. \nJERRY Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery -- \nAVERY Wait a minute, it has to be one of the NFL hotels we do business with -- let me look -- but in the meantime, about this job -- \nShe reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through a list of phone numbers.  Jerry can't help but share the qood news: \nJERRY (importantly) Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set. \nDOROTHY We are? \nJERRY It's all going to work. \nDOROTHY I just got goosebumps. \nShe examines her own skin with surprise. \nJERRY (manic, quiet) It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world. \nDOROTHY Well, I'm happy for you. \nJERRY Happy for us. \nOddly, the phrase affects her physically. \nDOROTHY Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222. \nJERRY Thanks. \nDOROTHY Call me later, hon. \nShe hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad. Both of them stare at her. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Wait.  Did I just say \"hon\" to him? \nCHAD (laughing) Yeah, Dotty. You did. \nDOROTHY Twenty six years old.  I'm already saying \"hon\". Hug your mother quickly -- \nChad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy. Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad. \nINT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY \nJerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual. \nJERRY Avery, I signed Cush.  Again. \nINTERCUT \nTIDWELL I said -- last I heard, Jesus Christ was still in heaven.  And you ain't even played in the NFL. \nCush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic. \nJERRY This can't be happening to me. \nAVERY Jerry!  Do something -- \nJerry throws himself in front of Cushman. \nJERRY HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you, five years old?  Am I taking the kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow up, both of you!  We are a family. And we go to the draft in an ORDERLY FASHION. \nBeat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too much. \nTIDWELL Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese. \nCUSH Me too, dude.  Especially that big old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's just insanity, man. \nTIDWELL Heard that. \nTidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five. Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites her. \nEXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT \nThe headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity. Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. (\"Is it San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  \"Cush!\")  Fans at the outskirts are calling out to the young star (\"Go get the big chi-ching, Cush!\") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position. Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. (\"I'll either surf or ski.\")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job. \nShot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed. \nINT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER \nTidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute. Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state. \nJERRY At last I find you. \nTIDWELL (sharply) Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom. \nIn a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's ego. \nJERRY Come on.  Come with me.  We're going to take a walk through this lobby. I want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are.  The best- kept secret in the NFL. The biggest wide-receiver in the game. Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever you do, don't sit down. Let 'em see how big you are.  You ready? Let's do it. \nHe is privately thrilled, but offers only: \nTIDWELL (begrudgingly) A'right.  Let's walk. \nWe hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's \"Magic Bus\" from Live at Leeds. \nINT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT \nMaguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past the reporters, the competing agents, the team representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones everywhere, in every hand. \nThere is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard, introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does not sit down.  Music continues. \nINT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY \nTough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire and Tidwell from the opposite corner. \nPATRICIA Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the draft... \nINT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT \nArizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming draft selections. \nWILBURN Good, I hope he unloads him so I can buy a decent quarterback. Who's he talking to? \nPATRICIA Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha. \nWILBURN They don't look interested do they? \nPATRICIA Actually... \nWilburn looks concerned. \nINT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT \nJerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman. \nTIDWELL I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby? \nJERRY Yeah.  And it might have even worked too. \nTIDWELL Let's do it again. \nJerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell continues talking. \nTIDWELL (continuing) You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story? \nJERRY I gotta get back to Cushman. \nTIDWELL Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me... \nKEITH Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v. again! \nCUSH Hell, I'm already sick of me. I got \"Cushlash.\" \nMore laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He speaks casually, directly. \nJERRY Look, before I go back to Denver. I think we should put something down on paper.  Something that says, \"hey, I'm with Jerry Maguire.\" \nHe pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous. \nMATT Not right now, Jerry. \nJERRY Do I know everything there is to know here? (silent beat) You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you? \nMore silence. \nMATT Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you. \nJERRY (quickly) Said who?  Sugar? \nMATT Hey, I'm learning as I go. \nJERRY So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back? \nMATT I'm sorry, I -- \nJERRY I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door. \nJerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself. \nJERRY (continuing) It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll fix this up.  You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right? \nAnother rough silence is broken by little brother Keith. \nKEITH (blurts) Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be a famous athlete and I'm gonna sign with you'. \nJERRY Shut up! (beat) I'm sorry... sorry. \nKEITH (sympathy for Jerry) S' cool. \nShot moves in on Jerry. \nJERRY Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. (beat) Because I'm still sort of moved by your \"my word is stronger'n oak\" thing -- \nMATT We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella. \nJerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his things. Cush hangs on to his guitar. \nCUSH I'm sorry, Jerry. \nMATT They say it's show \"business,\" Jerry, not show friends. \nJerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room, settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in all it's neon logo glory. \nJERRY Well. Okay. Of course. You're twenty years old, and I'm just another guy in a suit.  It's all business. It didn't work out.  You didn't buy my product, which is, unfortunately, mm. Let me see, there's a speech that I'm supposed to make -- right! -- \"I'll be out there cheering for you.\" \"The door is always open!\"  See? I'm a class act. (breath, directly) But maybe this would have all worked, us being real human beings, coming through for each other, really, and now I'll never know. You'll never know. Weren't you curious? (they aren't) No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine. And you'll be fine.  And Keith I bope you do call me. \nFlushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on guitar. \nINT. LOBBY -- NIGHT \nJerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions, innocently. \nPATRICIA LOGAN Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's had three concussions? \nJERRY I'm sorry... excuse me... \nINT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery. Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and media workers move tables and work out camera and seating arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty tables. \nINT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room. \nAVERY I just heard. \nJERRY What do I do?  How do I spin this? \nAVERY Oh honey.  It's spun. \nShe keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets. \nJERRY What did I do to you? \nShe is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know? \nAVERY It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me -- \nJERRY Could you just stop moving? \nON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE \nis leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy athlete. \nINT. RED CARPET LOUNGE -- DAY \nTidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight. Jerry nurses a stiff drink. \nTIDWELL Everybody on this show cries now. \nJERRY Rod -- \nTIDWELL (off t.v. ) You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother? \nJERRY What are you doing with me, Rod? \nTIDWELL Huh? \nJERRY Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale! \nTidwell looks at Jerry, impassive. \nJERRY (continuing) See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on \"do not do this\" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom! \nTIDWELL Well, boo-fucking-hoo. \nJERRY The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic -- \nTIDWELL (shaking head) No. \nJERRY It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. \nTIDWELL You are not allowed to act this way. \nJERRY Why not? \nINT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY \nThey sit together. Jerry holds another drink. \nTIDWELL Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your \"nya nya nya.\" \nJERRY (ruefully, to attendant) Another drink please. \nTIDWELL Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money. \nJERRY (the hell that never ends) Oh my God. \nHe looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him. \nEXT. PORCH -- NIGHT \nDorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.  There is only room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel sits in it. \nDOROTHY He's coming over. \nLAUREL At eleven at night? \nDOROTHY He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over. \nLAUREL Dotty -- this is not \"guy.\". This is a \"syndrome.\"  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you. \nDOROTHY Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in. \nDorothy exits.  Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room. \nLAUREL Okay, but he better not be good looking! \nINT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nDorothy puts Ray to bed. \nDOROTHY 'Night buddy.  This is my favorite part of your head. \nShe kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the mirror. \nShe checks her look, in spite of herself. Visible on the wall above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo. Music. \nINT. CAB -- NIGHT \nJerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks later, post-flight, rolling with anything. \nJERRY Okay, turn here!  Sharp right turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo. \nThe cab turns onto a very small street.  Cars parked on both sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights. \nJerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it.  Same with the oncoming car. \nJERRY (continuing) Yes, good, floor it, kill us!! \nEXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nNow camera starts to move around the house, from this window showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room and stare at Jerry. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks up to see Ray. \nRAY Hi. \nJERRY Hi Ray. \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME \nLAUREL All I'm saying.  You don't have the luxury of falling for some drowning man.  Be practical.  Now. Which top? \nShe holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down front. The other is striped, cute, functional. \nDOROTHY Okay, you want to talk about practical? Let's talk about my wonderful life. Do you know what most other women my age are doing right now? They are partying in clubs, trying to act stupid, trying to get a man, trying to keep a man... not me. I'm trying to RAISE a man. \nShe grabs the sexier top, and puts it on. \nDOROTHY (continuing) I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look? \nLAUREL Good. \nDOROTHY Thanks. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a piece of rope. \nRAY And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo? \nJERRY Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad. \nRAY Let's go the zoo. \nJERRY Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right. (more) \nJERRY (cont'd) All my life I've been trying to talk, really talk, and no one wants to listen.  You know that feeling? \nRay nods vigorously. \nRAY Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo. \nJERRY Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed. \nRAY You said \"fuck\". \nJERRY Yeah I know.  I did. \nRay loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee. \nRAY I won't tell. \nJERRY We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands. \nRay looks at Jerry's hands. \nRAY I don't see any. \nJERRY (points respectfully) Funny. \nRAY Funny... (imitates him) (hears mom approaching) I better go to bed. \nRay hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy attitude, and a tray. \nDOROTHY Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab. \nJERRY (slightly confused) Good idea.  Thank you. \nAnd we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little boy asleep. \nJERRY (continuing) Right.  Of course. \nJerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it, inelegantly. \nDOROTHY So.  Our company. \nShe watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a little. Then stands. \nJERRY Okay.  Lil' speech before I go. \nHe gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully: \nJERRY (continuing) Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your. Job. (beat) Our company is in good shape. You and your son... we... are just fine.  You still have a job. I want you to feel confident!  In. Me.  And I have a problem with people who talk about themselves in the third person, but let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire. \nHis confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent. \nJerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind. \nJERRY I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotation. \nRod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed. \nTIDWELL Did you tell him about the \"ten million for four years?\" \nJERRY Uh, not today, but -- \nTIDWELL John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table. \nJERRY I understand your anxiety. \nTIDWELL Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the \"coin.\"  It's the... \nHe says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk. \nTIDWELL (continuing) --  the kwan. \nJERRY That's your word? \nTIDWELL Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan. \nJERRY (impressed) But how did you get \"kwan?\" \nTIDWELL (irritated) I got there from \"coin,\" dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan. \nJERRY Great word.  Towel? \nTIDWELL No, I air-dry. \nJERRY Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and -- \nA portable phone beeps. \nTIDWELL Is that your porty or mine? \nJERRY You. \nTidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it. \nTIDWELL Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin' in the new agent.  He says I'm not marquee.  I know... I know... \nTidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of Marcee going off. \nTIDWELL (continuing) My wife is upset with you. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY \nThe conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on, gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not be listening. \nJERRY Here's what I'm saying.  This is a renegotiation.  We want more from them, so let's show them more from us. Let's show them your pure joy of the game, let's bury the Attitude a little, let's show them -- \nTIDWELL (irritated) You're telling me to dance. \nJERRY No, I'm saying to be -- \nHe mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance. \nTIDWELL (little voice) \"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.\" (pissed) That's the iconography of rascism, man! \nJERRY Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it? \nTidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor. \nTIDWELL Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. \nJERRY Fine. \nHe begins gathering his things. \nTIDWELL I'm an athlete, not an entertainer. These are the ABC's of ME.  Get it? I don't dance. \nJerry rubs face. \nTIDWELL (continuing) What's wrong. \nJERRY Forget it.  Forget it. \nTIDWELL No tell me. \nJERRY I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. \nTIDWELL You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you. \nJerry has had enough for one day. \nJERRY (loopy, punch-drunk, arms flailing) Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you! I'll see you in L.A.! \nLaurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos. \nRAY I wanna go too. \nLaurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living room. \nDOROTHY We'll see you soon, honey. Bye. \nJERRY Bye you guys. \nRay extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees one. \nINT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT \nLaurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on the lawn. \"All Shook Down.\"  Replacements. \nEXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nJerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind them. \nLAUREL Hey! \nAs Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can have privacy with her sister. \nLAUREL (continuing) Forgot your keys -- \nDOROTHY (privately) That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling? (eyes tear up) I mean, he must have been needing that. \nWomen's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm. \nLAUREL No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date. \nDOROTHY (laughing, wiping tear) Oh, knock it off! \nLAUREL (can't help it) And don't be a shoulder for him to cry on either. \nWe stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood, slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the street. \nINT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nJerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play. \nJERRY It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, \"it's nobody's fault.\" It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it -- \nDOROTHY Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but -- \nMariachis approach the table. \nHEAD MARIACHI A song for the lovers? \nJERRY/DOROTHY (too quickly) No.  No thanks. \nDOROTHY We work together. \nJerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so, reluctantly. \nJERRY See, you choose. If you fall for someone, if you make a commitment, you should make it work.  It's only when \"options\" entered the picture that things got bad. I'm speaking historically now.  It's a modern day concept, nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel? -- I think the only good thing to (more) \nJERRY (cont'd) come from this period in history is probably the movie \"Annie Hall.\" \nDOROTHY (evenly) Maybe you should call her. \nJERRY No no no.  I just underestimated her... (touches wound) her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this? \nA FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses. \nFLOWER GIRL A rose for the lady. \nJERRY You want a -- \nDOROTHY \u0001\u001f(\u0010   (scoffs) No.  No way. \nJerry gives her few bucks, she exits. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- (stops herself) Jerry? \nJERRY What? \nDOROTHY (simply) Let's not tell our sad stories. \nJerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness. \nDOROTHY (continuing) I'll be right back. Quit thinking those murky thoughts, okay? We're young, we're semi-successful. Life is good. \nShe exits and we hang on him for a moment. \nINT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER \nDorothy on the phone outside the bathroom. \nDOROTHY I'm getting him up, don't worry.' Ray will never see his mother's raging physical needs. \nShe starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second. \nLAUREL First you gotta tell me something. \nDOROTHY No-- \nINT. HALLWAY -- MORNING \nJerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices. \nINT. KITCHEN -- MORNING \nLAUREL Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head. \nDOROTHY Please, if I start talking -- \nLAUREL Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung. \nON JERRY \nlistening.  Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of honesty an agent rarely hears. \nDOROTHY ... so what am I, for taking the opportunity, Laurel? (more) \nDOROTHY (cont'd) Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am I a bad person? All I know is that I found someone who was charming and popular and not-so-nice to me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why should I let this guy go, when everything in my body says This One is The One. \nLAUREL Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details -- \nDOROTHY Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him. \nThey look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag. \nON JERRY \nrubbing his face. \nRAY Hi Jerry! \nDorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing there, well within earshot.  As Ray pounds down the hallway in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming her. \nDOROTHY Oh God. \nJERRY Easy, easy -- \nJerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel. \nJERRY (continuing) I could pretend I didn't hear, but I won't, I heard everything. (to Laurel) Thank you for your honesty, as always. \nLAUREL (frozen polite) Coffee, Jerry? \nJERRY Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders prefer cereal first -- \nRAY Let's have Apple Jacks! \nApple Jacks it is.  Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal. Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly complete-looking family. \nRAY (continuing) What's going on, Jerry? \nJERRY A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy. \nThe sisters look at each other.  Ray looks around, he feels happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs and continues to feel happy. \nINT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY \nJerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room. \nDOROTHY That was great of you this morning. \nThe Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway. \nJERRY (friendly, dismissive) Look, let's just root for a big offer so we can move out of this room to a real office. \nShe feels slightly slapped down, but covers.  She opens a window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand. \nON FAX \nConnecting. \nFOUR FACES \nwaiting for the results.  Everybody has a stake in this fax. Lives are very clearly hanging on this results.  Marcee shuts her eyes. \nMARCEE Read it to me, and don't say anything unless it's over nine. \nThere is a stunning disappointment on the fax.  Jerry's heart sinks.  His face slackens. \nJERRY Aw shit -- \nDOROTHY Take care you guys. \nTidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Look...  I was up for a job in San Diego before I left SMI. It's with the Chargers. \nAIRPLANE WHEELS \ntouching down. \nJERRY Don't even talk about that yet. I'll find something fast for Tidwell. We'll stay afloat. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY \nTidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend, director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is arguing with Tidwell. \nMaguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a camel. \nDOOLER Look, Rod, just get on the camel! \nJERRY Bill, Rod, wait -- \nTIDWELL Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME. \nJERRY Rod, get on the camel. \nDOOLER (shoots look to Jerry) The sponsor wants a camel -- \nTIDWELL Jerry, back me up.  It's either the camel or me... \nTidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions. \nJERRY (takes the bullet) Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway. \nDOOLER Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him. \nEXT. SET -- LATER \nJerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the background, another athlete rides the camel. \nTIDWELL There you go, dude.  You're learning how to represent me.  We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad -- \nJerry rubs his face. \nJERRY Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? \nTIDWELL Oh, we gonna be friends now? \nJERRY What do you know about dating a single mother? \nTidwell warms to the personal question. \nTIDWELL Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother. \nJERRY Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego. \nTidwell is always happy to hold forth. \nTIDWELL First, single mothers don't \"date.\" They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her? \nJERRY How do I know? \nTIDWELL You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know? \nJERRY No, I don't know. \nTIDWELL Then you gotta have The Talk. \nJERRY But I sure don't like that she's leaving. \nTIDWELL Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. \nJERRY The kid is amazing. \nTIDWELL (shaking head) No.  A real man does not shoplift the \"pooty\" from a single mom. \nJERRY I didn't \"shoplift the pooty.\"  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- (a look) Alright, I shoplifted the pooty. \nTIDWELL Shame on you.  SHAME on you. \nINT. ZOO -- DAY \nJerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's arm. Life-changing decisions in the air. \nDOROTHY They offered me everything I asked for, it's only 2 hours away. I think it's good for us. \nJerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray. They approach the reptile house. \nRAY Show me the animal, Jerry! \nTIDWELL (wary) I think so. \nJERRY (intense) Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life? (points) Heart. But when you get on the field -- (more) \nJERRY (cont'd) (finger rises to Tidwell's head) -- you're a businessman.  It's wide-angle lenses and who fucked you over and who owes you for it. That's not what inspires people. I'm sorry, but that's the truth, can you handle it? Just a \"question,\" Rod.  Between friends. \nTIDWELL I don't want to be friends anymore. \nJERRY Fine. \nTIDWELL Beautiful. \nJERRY (angry) We still having dinner in L.A.? \nTIDWELL (anqry) Only 'cause my wife likes your wife! \nJerry exits.  Tidwell is pissed.  And hurt. \nTIDWELL (continuing) \"No heart.\"  \"No heart?\" (yells after him) I'm all heart, motherfucker! \nHe gets on the bus. \nINT. CRAB RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nThe Tidwells and the Maguires.  Tyson and Ray run around the table of this family-style restaurant. Marcee is very very pregnant. They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body. \nMARCEE -- so I go to see a so-called \"black\" film the other day -- (then) -- honey, no more salt for you, I don't want you dehydrated for Monday Night Football.  Most important game of your career. (more) \nMARCEE (cont'd) (then) -- TWENTY minutes of coming attractions. All black films, all violent, I'm talking about brothers shooting brothers, Wesley Snipes with guns the size of our house, killing, blood flowing, cars crashing... blood blood blood blood. Is this all they think we want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed Shindler's List.  Give me a little credit, I mean hooo -- \nTIDWELL I hate you going to movies alone withoutme -- \nMARCEE Oh baby -- \nHe cracks more crab, gives her the biggest piece. \nSHOT OF JERRY AND DOROTHY \nSitting across the table, stunned, just watching this intricate and perfect marriage. \nSHOT OF MARCEE \nShe takes a breath and gets a weird look. \nTIDWELL What baby? \nMARCEE Baby.  Baby.  Baby... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT \nMarcee gives birth, Rod assisting.  Jerry and Dorothy watch from behind thick glass.  She hangs her arm on his shoulder, looks at him.  Jerry stares straight ahead. Mortified, with dry throat. \nINT. DOROTHY AND JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed. Dorothy sits down near him on the bed. \nDOROTHY What were you thinking tonight? Watching them go through the complete human emotional experience? \nJERRY I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible. \nDOROTHY Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours. \nHe makes a noise. As in -- it's no big mystery. \nDOROTHY (continuing) And I really don't know your noises yet. \nJERRY Well, when you wonder, ask me. \nDOROTHY (unsatisfied) Okay... I will... \nBeat.  He feels inadequate. \nJERRY Why do you love me? \nDOROTHY Why do you love me? \nIt is, of course, the better question.  And before he can answer, there is a pounding at the door. \nRAY Jerry, can I come in and watch t.v.? \nDOROTHY                       JERRY I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes, second --                     buddy -- \nThe door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed, stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for the remote control.  Dorothy watches, disconnected.  A steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen. \nINT. PRESCHOOL -- NEXT DAY \nDorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of the playroom.  She watches the boys and girls playing together in a room full of bright colors and games.  Music. Anxiety building. \nEXT. RAY'S PLAYHOUSE -- NIGHT \nTRAINER Can you feel your legs? \nTIDWELL Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for a minute. \nON JERRY \nwho watches.  Only marginally relieved.  Is he okay? \nON FANS \nCrowd noise rises.  Is he okay? \nON TIDWELL \nCan he move?  Is he okay? \nON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM \nNot a breath is taken.  Is he okay? \nHe rises.  Stadium explodes.  At first on wobbly feet, he raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the crowd.  Crowd noise doubles. \nON MAGUIRE \ngasping for breath. \nON TIDWELL \nHas never felt like this before in his life.  It is the pure and absolute love of the spotlight.  And his fans. \nAnd then... it's real and he feels it.  Tidwell breaks out in a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.  He does a high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards. \nON JERRY MAGUIRE \nwho watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let go of the spotlight. \nON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM \nGoing absolutely nuts.  Marcee hysterical, laughing and crying. \nMARCEE (to Tee Pee) You ain't talking now, are you??? You're a silent motherfucker! \nTyson watches in silent awe of his mother. \nBACK ON TIDWELL -- CLOSE \nFinishes his small but heartfelt dance.  It is a personal catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people. \nTIDWELL (to himself) Nike. \nHe moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry, casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome with emotion.  He sits down on a camera case, head in his hands.  Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero. \nOVERHEARD FAN I always knew he was great. \nMaguire rubs his face.  Overcome. Photographers and others rush past to be closer to Tidwell. \nINT. TUNNEL -- LATER \nJerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and Sportswriters.  Success has returned, in all of it's superficial grandeur.  He is a star again, by association. We catch the look on Maguire's face.  Try as he might, he can't manufacture the joy of the moment.  There is a void. Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn nodding, holding a thumbs up.  He tries to get to Maguire, but cannot.  And then a commotion behind them all. \nREPORTER It's Tidwell! \nTidwell exits the locker room.  Press and media surround him. Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him.  He works his way to Maguire. \nThey hug. Cameras flash.  Tears roll down from beneath his purple shades. \nTIDWELL We did it. \nAnd now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable phone rings.  Both men reach for their porties.  It's Maguire's.  With anticipation, he answers. \nJERRY Hello. (beat) It's Marcee.  She says she couldn't get through on your phone. \nTidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with his wife.  Jerry watches, as Tidwell leans on his shoulder. \nON SUGAR AND SWENSON (WATCHING THEM) \nBob Sugar watches from the nearby wall where he stands with his client, quarterback John Swenson. \nSWENSON Why don't we have that kind of relationship? \nINT. ARIZONA KAROAKE BAR -- NIGHT \nRod Tidwell sings karoake, on stage.  He's struggling through U2's \"One.\"  In the audience are many Arizona players, as well as most of Tidwell's family. \nTIDWELL One love... you got to share it... \nINT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT \nTee Pee is stuck at home, babysitting twenty kids. \n", "test1_input": "She makes a pissed-off sound.  She then walks over, taking his shoulders and bending them forward.  She is an expert at body manipulation, loosening him as she talks. \nAVERY Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off to make you a tribute film. All those guys from the office are coming.  Everybody loves you.  Just calm down, relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time.  And you'll never guess who narrates your bachelor movie. \nINT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT \nJerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise.  He falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack. He looks around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets. \nTHE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V. \nIt is hosted by MICHAEL JORDAN. \nMICHAEL JORDAN I have often wondered where my career would have been had Jerry Maguire been my agent.  The answer -- Yugoslavia. \nTepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his friend BILL DOOLER.  Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik on steroids. \nDOOLER You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party. \nJERRY Oh come on -- \nDOOLER This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming. \nJERRY (eying crowd) You're imagining it. \nThey are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar.  Sugar is a Maguire wannabee.  Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder. \nSUGAR We still having lunch tomorrow, Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton tested positive for marijuana. That moves Cush solidly up to numero uno in the draft. \nDOOLER Oh, that'll really help this party! Let's all talk business! \nJERRY Dooler, you know Bob Sugar. \nSUGAR (smoothly) The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you. \nDOOLER Sorry I yelled.  You have exquisite taste. \nSUGAR Everybody's having a great time. You're both nuts -- the movie's great. \nSugar moves on, cheerfully. \nDOOLER I like that guy. \n(The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation, is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends. MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For (\"He hated being alone.\") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock girlfriend (\"Sports makes me ill\"), The Now Married With Kids Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend (\"Beneath the cute exterior, more cute exterior.\") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend, The Brainy Girlfriend, (\"Great at friendship, bad at intimacy\") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his- way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to burn all these old phone numbers.) \nJERRY (wounded good sport) ... this is... uh... too funny... \nDOOLER They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong. \nJerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut to music. \nINT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY \nElevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy Knoll. \nHe passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls. The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward his back office. \nWENDY (as in 'get ready') Marcee's here.  She's already in your office. \nJERRY Thanks, Wendy. \nINT. JERRY MAGUIRE'S OFFICE -- DAY \nJerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot. Already standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively MARCEE TIDWELL, 25. African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking smartbomb.  She is also five months pregnant. \nJERRY Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife? \nMARCEE Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no! \nAcross the room, 4 year-old menace TYSON ceases trying to pry a plexiglass case off the wall. \nJERRY Tyson, hello. \nTyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids. He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another habit -- and sits down at his desk.  He slips into crisis mode like an old shirt. \nJERRY (continuing) How can I make your life better? \nMARCEE I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition. (more) \nMARCEE (cont'd) He is the biggest, fastest, raddest wide-receiver in the league.  Now I don't know what you do for your four-percent \n--The door opens, Bob Sugar pokes his head in. \nSUGAR Cronin's okay for lunch? \nJERRY Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock. \nSUGAR Pleasure. \nMARCEE You've called our house, right? \n", "test1_true": "Sugar exits.  Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact level of intensity. \nMARCEE Now I don't know what you do for your five-percent, but this man, my husband has a whole plan, an image... we majored in marketing, Jerry, and when you put him in a Waterbed Warehouse commercial, excuse me, you are making him common.  He is pure gold and you're giving him \"Waterbed Warehouse\" when he deserves the big four -- shoe, car, clothing- line, soft-drink.  The four jewels of the celebrity endorsement dollar. \nJerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the best in him.  The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it. \nMARCEE (continuing) You gonna get that -- \nJERRY Not a chance. \nShe smiles. \nJERRY (continuing) Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention. \nMARCEE (upping the ante) Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it! \nJERRY (it's infectious) Damn right. \nHe climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint, the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall. \nMARCEE Look at that handsome man, trying to build a life up there by the air-conditioner. We're coming to get ya, darlin!  We are so close to having it all! \nON THE POSTER -- CLOSE \nIt is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL, 27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST. Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash (\"Tyson!\"). \nEXT. CRONIN'S GRILL -- AFTERNOON \nCrowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes. \nJERRY Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet... \nSUGAR You okay? \nJERRY (looking up) I'm fine.  What's up? \nSUGAR I came here to let you go. \nJERRY Pardon me? \nSUGAR Came here to fire you, Jerry. \nFor a long moment there is only silence.  They study each other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the other's next three or four moves. \nSUGAR (continuing) It's real, Jerry.  You... you should say something. \nSuddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed. \nJERRY Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene... \nSUGAR I know.  It sucks.  I suck. \nIn a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's \"Birthday Song\" to someone else. Jerry is dying. \nJERRY You... \nSUGAR (razor sharp) You did this to yourself.  You said \"fewer clients.\"  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself -- \nJerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can speak, Sugar continues. \nSUGAR (continuing) -- although I do gotta hand it to you.  For about five minutes you had everyone applauding smaller revenues. \nQuietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier. \nJERRY You... ungrateful... unctuous... \nSUGAR (unctuous) ... dick? \nJERRY Dick. \nMaguire reaches for water.  The sound of the ice cubes jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning. \nSUGAR Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second? \nJERRY You'll lose. \nSUGAR (musically) You wanted smaller. \nJERRY I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too. \nSUGAR Jerry -- \nJERRY -- and I'll get 'em. \nSUGAR (patronizing) You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters -- \nJerry fights the desire to use his fists.  Hangs onto the table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down. Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's mind.  Rising percussive music. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \n", "test2_input": "moving to her car.  She hears him.  It's not loud enough for her. \nJERRY WAIT A SECOND! \nShe stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip. She turns and he is now close to her. \nJERRY (continuing) I know a way to s... to save on Medical and rent and... look... \nHe grips one hand with the other.  Dorothy looks at his strange behavior.  He looks over to the cab, where Ray is making a sad face at him through the window. \nJERRY (continuing) ...  what if we stayed together? What if we uh... got married. \nShe looks at him.  It's an odd proposal. \nJERRY (continuing) If I said that, would you stay? \nDOROTHY No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't... \nJERRY Will you marry me? \nShe looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara. \nEXT. DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY \nRod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" at the wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard. Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner, are Chad and Dooler. \nON JERRY \nwho stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and well-dressed BROTHER. \nBROTHER Where are all your friends? \nJERRY (looking around) In the band. \nINT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWe are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring. \nDorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and he offers the ring. \nINT. DOROTHY'S HALLWAY/KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThe bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the hallway of the small home where the event has taken place. \nDOROTHY Wow.  We actually -- \nJERRY Yeah, we did. \nGiddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and relatives watch the video of the wedding. And now the enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now. He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily. \nLAUREL If you fuck this up, I'll kill you. \nJERRY (as she exits) Glad we had this talk! \nNearby, Tidwell watches all.  He moves to Jerry. Confidentially: \nTIDWELL You never had The Talk, did you? \nJERRY No. \nTIDWELL Well, this was another way to go. \nJerry smiles.  Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took, and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together. Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the room: \nTIDWELL (continuing) This is my agent, man!  And we're all gonna have a great season! \nHe pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata. \nFADE TO \nEXT. PHILADELPHIA PLAYING FIELD -- DAY \nTidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is on. \nINT. PHILADELPHIA PRESS BOX -- DAY \nAcross the room, he sees GM Dennis Wilburn standing with Avery. \nHe turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday. \nINT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY \nThis is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on the big-screen home t.v.  At the center is Marcee Tidwell. Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the t.v., Tyson does the \"Daddy Dance,\" a dance of pure joy. \nTYSON (proudly, to family) That's my motherfucker! \nMarcee reaches out and collars her dancing son. \nMARCEE Why don't you be the first man in your family not to say that word? And then we'll let you live. \n", "test2_true": "MARCEE (continuing) Now go kiss your daddy, quick. \nTEE PEE (cooly) That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle... \nMarcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit. \nINT. STADIUM HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nJerry stands waiting.  Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback JOHN SWENSON.  Still no Tidwell. \nEXT. PHILADELPHIA LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT \nFinally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet bag. \nJERRY How's your head? Bubblicious. \nTIDWELL Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed. \nJERRY I'm a little worried -- \nTIDWELL I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago. \nINSANE FAN (interrupting loudly) FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS... ROTLISS... \nWith great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to other tired players. \nTIDWELL Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd don't discuss gambling with me. \nInsane fan moves to another player.  Jerry proceeds carefully. \nJERRY We can still take the offer, Rod. \nTIDWELL (stops) No. \nJerry regards his slightly befuddled friend. \nJERRY Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan. \nTIDWELL (irritated) Hey, that's my word, okay? \nTidwell wearily heads for the bus.  Jerry stands in the parking lot. \nJERRY I'll see you in Arizona. \nTIDWELL I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers. \nJERRY Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster. \nTIDWELL Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife. \nJERRY What's that supposed to mean? \nTIDWELL Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone. \nJERRY I don't know -- how's \"dedication\" for an answer? \nTIDWELL You don't want to go home, do you? \nJERRY Why are you doing this to me, Rod? \nTIDWELL I'm asking you a question -- \nJERRY No, you're -- \nTIDWELL I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage? \nJerry looks at Rod for a moment.  It is the simplest question, and one in which he has no quick answer. \nJERRY Not everyone has what you have. \nTIDWELL Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend. \nJERRY (shaking his head) You're jabbing at me. \nTIDWELL I'm sorry I asked. \nJERRY No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you. (beat) Loyalty.  She was loyal. (unconvincing) Everything grew from there. \nTIDWELL That's an answer. \nJERRY Damn right. \nTIDWELL (jab) For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married. \nJERRY Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really \"friends?\" \nTIDWELL Why not -- \nJERRY Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our \"friends\" hats on -- \n", "test3_input": "Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out the field.  Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle suit. \nPICKLE MAN Nothing like Monday Night, huh? What is it, 2 billion viewers? \nTIDWELL (irritated) Shouldn't you be out there doing some pickle dance or something -- Pickle Man nods and goes out to dance for the crowd. \nVOICE Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude -- \nTidwell turns.  It's Bob Sugar approaching. Laser-like, ready to feed on his insecurity. \nSUGAR Listen, I spoke to your quarterback. He's my client, you know.  And I said, \"take care to get those passes down, let Tidwell look good on t.v.\" \nTidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick. \nSUGAR (continuing) You should let me do more for you. I would have had you your deal by tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend of mine. I would have had him on the air, talking about you, tonight, when it counts. \nTIDWELL Get outta here.  Go. \nSUGAR Where's your agent tonight? \nTIDWELL Don't know. \nSUGAR Rod.  I know this is \"uncool\" to do this now, but you belong with the big boys.  You belong with the money. You belong with -- \nHere comes Jerry Maguire. \nJERRY Get the fuck away from my guy, Sugar. \nTidwell can't help it.  He beams as he sees his agent approach. \nTIDWELL Jerry!  You made it -- \nJERRY (off Sugar) Go.  Flee. \nSugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about what I said. \nTIDWELL Thanks for coming. \nJERRY (bittersweet) I missed ya.  What can I say? \nINT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT \nThey watch the game. \nGIFFORD (ON T.V.) It's a bruiser out there tonight. \nMICHAELS (ON T.V.) Arizona refusing to go into the quiet night of this rough football season. Come on, I'm trying to be poetic here. \nTidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly. \nDIERDORF (ON T.V.) Ooof.  Another rough hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell. Nothing poetic about that. \nINT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT \nMaguire moves through the box. \nINT. FIELD -- NIGHT \nTidwell takes a hit.  Hangs onto the ball. \nINT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the unsettled look on young Tyson's face.   She pulls him over to her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee.  He is the only thing in her world, as she says: \nMARCEE What does daddy say? \nTYSON \"It looks worse than it is... \nMarcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling gain on the field. \nFRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE They don't pay enough for a man to take that kind of ugly hit -- \nMARCEE (to others) Boy, no s-h-i-t. \nBig laughs from the living room.  Except Tee Pee. \nTEE PEE He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself. \nMARCEE Can you be quiet? \nTEE PEE What'd I say? \nINT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT \nMaguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops back for a pass, and is sacked. \nPhiladelphia fans cheer wildly.  The game is turning uglier by the minute.  Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet look at the next play. \nON PRESS BOX MONITOR \n", "test3_true": "EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT \nWe are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.  Tidwell lies still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell. \nTV MONITOR -- SLO-MO \nThe hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still. \nINT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nSilence.  Utter silence. \nGIFFORD'S VOICE --   you sure hope his family wasn't watching that. \nAnd then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee begins to sob.  Camera catches the face of Tyson, now panicked.  Scared, he embraces his mother. \nINT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM \nMaguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium.  He turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a guard, heading into the bright t.v. light of the football field. \nINT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nGathering around the television, the family waits through a commercial for more information on Rod's injury. \nTEE PEE He should have kept his head tucked down. \nMARCEE (immediately) Shut up!!! \nTEE PEE I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth. \nMarcee lunges for him. \nMARCEE Can't you be loyal to your brother who LOVES you?? (she is held back) Get out of my house! \nAcross the room, the phone starts ringing.  A COUSIN answers. \nCOUSIN It's Jerry Maguire! \nEXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT \nJerry Maguire on the portable. \nJERRY He took a shot.  He's unconscious. \nMARCEE I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm -- \nJERRY Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there. \nMARCEE \"Stay calm?\"  I'm freakin... \nJERRY Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. \nMARCEE My whole life is this family, Jerry. It doesn't work without him. \nShe takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field. \nJERRY DON'T TOUCH HIM!!! \nEXT. CENTER OF PLAYING FIELD -- NIGHT \nWe're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful, sleeping face.  They are all. YELLING, trying to pull him out. \nSHOTS OF NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCES \n1)   A full sports bar in arizona silently watches Monday Night Football. \n2)   Generic living room of sports fans, all watching Tidwell pinned to the screen. \n3)   Generic outdoor bar-b-que as white fans watch t.V. \n4)   Tidwell living room.  All gathered around the television. \n5)   Maguire straining at the sideline. \nON TIDWELL -- CLOSE \nDead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only silence. \nPOV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE \nThe Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.  We don't hear them.   We see them, their motions increasingly manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.  Screaming.  We read their lips.  (\"Rod!\" \"Rod can you hear us!\")  We see the anguish and escalating fear on their faces.  The Trainer leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap right in front of Rod's still face.  His hands head toward each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling of sound...  getting closer and then finally coming together, bringing with him the sounds of the stadium. \nON TIDWELL \nwho blinks back to life.  Concerned men are yelling very loudly, right in his face.  Tidwell becomes aware he is the absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.  As crowd noise begins to rise. \nTRAINER Let's get you off the field! \nTIDWELL Wait. \n"}

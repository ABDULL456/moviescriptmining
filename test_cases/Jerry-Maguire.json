{"test1_input": "TIDWELL I said -- last I heard, Jesus Christ was still in heaven.  And you ain't even played in the NFL. \nCush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic. \nJERRY This can't be happening to me. \nAVERY Jerry!  Do something -- \nJerry throws himself in front of Cushman. \nJERRY HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you, five years old?  Am I taking the kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow up, both of you!  We are a family. And we go to the draft in an ORDERLY FASHION. \nBeat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too much. \nTIDWELL Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese. \nCUSH Me too, dude.  Especially that big old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's just insanity, man. \nTIDWELL Heard that. \nTidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five. Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites her. \nEXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT \nThe headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity. Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. (\"Is it San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  \"Cush!\")  Fans at the outskirts are calling out to the young star (\"Go get the big chi-ching, Cush!\") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position. Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. (\"I'll either surf or ski.\")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job. \nShot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed. \nINT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER \nTidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute. Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state. \nJERRY At last I find you. \nTIDWELL (sharply) Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom. \nIn a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's ego. \nJERRY Come on.  Come with me.  We're going to take a walk through this lobby. I want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are.  The best- kept secret in the NFL. The biggest wide-receiver in the game. Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever you do, don't sit down. Let 'em see how big you are.  You ready? Let's do it. \nHe is privately thrilled, but offers only: \nTIDWELL (begrudgingly) A'right.  Let's walk. \nWe hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's \"Magic Bus\" from Live at Leeds. \nINT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT \nMaguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past the reporters, the competing agents, the team representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones everywhere, in every hand. \nThere is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard, introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does not sit down.  Music continues. \nINT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY \nTough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire and Tidwell from the opposite corner. \nPATRICIA Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the draft... \nINT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT \nArizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming draft selections. \nWILBURN Good, I hope he unloads him so I can buy a decent quarterback. Who's he talking to? \nPATRICIA Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha. \nWILBURN They don't look interested do they? \nPATRICIA Actually... \nWilburn looks concerned. \nINT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT \nJerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman. \nTIDWELL I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby? \nJERRY Yeah.  And it might have even worked too. \nTIDWELL Let's do it again. \nJerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell continues talking. \nTIDWELL (continuing) You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story? \nJERRY I gotta get back to Cushman. \nTIDWELL Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me... \n", "test1_true": "JERRY You know what was great about you down there?  For about five minutes, you unloaded that rather expansive, let me just say \"large\" chip that resides right there on your shoulder, and you know what? You were brilliant.  Take care. \nJerry starts to exit. \nTIDWELL You're loving me now, aren't ya? \nJERRY (mock serious) I'm not about love -- I'm about \"showing you the money.\" \nTidwell nods deeply, respectfully. \nTIDWELL Good.  I was just testing ya. (beat) But just you saying that? Makes me love ya. \nJERRY Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow. \nTIDWELL Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man -- \nJERRY Call me tomorrow. \nTIDWELL I might call you later! \nTidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk.  A small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs. \nINT. CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT \nWe glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square. It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags, sweatpants, and more.  Half-finished room service food abounds.  Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend ANNE-LOUISE mill about the room, basking in the glow of the man of the moment.  Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap, wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's \"Something In The Way.\"  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin. \nCUSH (to hotel waiter) Hey, what size are you? \nWAITER Eleven. \nCUSH (grandly) Why don't you grab a couple pairs of them new Nikes by the door -- \nWaiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door. \nWAITER Dude, you're like a God. \nCUSH (immediately) God, you're like a dude. \nIt's a great line, and the room breaks up.  This is charisma, the future of the NFL.  Waiter exits, as Cush continues strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly. \nJERRY Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make. \nCUSH \"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings... \nJERRY Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big. \nCUSH \"Something in the way.  Yeah.\" \nMATT Well, he's gotta go number one. \nCUSH \"Ooooooo.\" \nJERRY He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England -- they want him bad. \nCush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith. \nMATT What happened to Denver? \nJERRY Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. (beat) Million. \nAnne-Louise whistles loudly.  She is instantly embarrassed, and puts a hand up.  Sorry.  In the next room, the phone is ringing. \nMATT I don't know, Jerry. \nKEITH Should I unplug the phone? \nCUSH Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night. \nJERRY Just be friendly and say \"no comment.\" \nCUSH Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered. \nJerry holds up a finger -- watch me.  Jerry picks up the ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation. \nJERRY \"This is Cush.\" \nSuddenly, everyone is, laughing.  The room lightens. \nINT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY \nBob Sugar talks on his hotel phone. \nSUGAR It's Sugar.  He must be there, right? Just sniff or something if he's there. (Jerry sniffs, panicked) Alright, buddydude.  Just remember. You're swimming with the big boys now. You let your dad do all the talking.  I'm the one who got you the deal you needed.  This is business not friendship. Be strong.  You're global now. \nSugar hangs up. \nJERRY \"No comment. \nJerry hangs up.  The room is still laughing.  His head is spinning. \n", "test1_id": 372, "test2_input": "KEITH Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v. again! \nCUSH Hell, I'm already sick of me. I got \"Cushlash.\" \nMore laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He speaks casually, directly. \nJERRY Look, before I go back to Denver. I think we should put something down on paper.  Something that says, \"hey, I'm with Jerry Maguire.\" \nHe pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous. \nMATT Not right now, Jerry. \nJERRY Do I know everything there is to know here? (silent beat) You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you? \nMore silence. \nMATT Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you. \nJERRY (quickly) Said who?  Sugar? \nMATT Hey, I'm learning as I go. \nJERRY So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back? \nMATT I'm sorry, I -- \nJERRY I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door. \nJerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself. \nJERRY (continuing) It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll fix this up.  You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right? \nAnother rough silence is broken by little brother Keith. \nKEITH (blurts) Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be a famous athlete and I'm gonna sign with you'. \nJERRY Shut up! (beat) I'm sorry... sorry. \nKEITH (sympathy for Jerry) S' cool. \nShot moves in on Jerry. \nJERRY Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. (beat) Because I'm still sort of moved by your \"my word is stronger'n oak\" thing -- \nMATT We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella. \nJerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his things. Cush hangs on to his guitar. \nCUSH I'm sorry, Jerry. \nMATT They say it's show \"business,\" Jerry, not show friends. \nJerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room, settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in all it's neon logo glory. \nJERRY Well. Okay. Of course. You're twenty years old, and I'm just another guy in a suit.  It's all business. It didn't work out.  You didn't buy my product, which is, unfortunately, mm. Let me see, there's a speech that I'm supposed to make -- right! -- \"I'll be out there cheering for you.\" \"The door is always open!\"  See? I'm a class act. (breath, directly) But maybe this would have all worked, us being real human beings, coming through for each other, really, and now I'll never know. You'll never know. Weren't you curious? (they aren't) No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine. And you'll be fine.  And Keith I bope you do call me. \nFlushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on guitar. \nINT. LOBBY -- NIGHT \nJerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions, innocently. \nPATRICIA LOGAN Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's had three concussions? \nJERRY I'm sorry... excuse me... \nINT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery. Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and media workers move tables and work out camera and seating arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty tables. \nINT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT \nJerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room. \nAVERY I just heard. \nJERRY What do I do?  How do I spin this? \nAVERY Oh honey.  It's spun. \nShe keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets. \nJERRY What did I do to you? \nShe is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know? \nAVERY It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me -- \nJERRY Could you just stop moving? \n", "test2_true": "JERRY Everything's on the fucking run! Everything -- \nShe stops.  Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors. \nAVERY Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell -- \nJERRY Look, I don't want a -- \nAVERY It's not \"love me.\"  It's not \"trust my handshake.\"  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be \"confusion\" about that. \nJERRY Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. \nAVERY So honesty is outlawed here, I can't be honest? \nShe turns and exits again.  He follows. \nJERRY Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty.. \nAVERY What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember? \nJERRY I think you added the \"brutal.\" \nShe stops, slaps down another media packet.  Blows a troublesome piece of hair out of her face. \nAVERY Jerry, there is a \"sensitivity\" thing that some people have.  I don't have it.  I don't cry at movies.  I don't gush over babies. I don't start celebrating Christmas five months early, and I don't tell a man who just screwed up both of our lives -- 'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For better or worse.  But I do love you. \nJerry looks at his fiancee.  Standing here, watching Avery coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks different to him. \nJERRY Avery -- \nShe knows what's coming.  She moves fast to avoid him. \nAVERY Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now. \nJERRY -- stop -- \nShe exits back into the main ballroom.  For a moment, she stops. They face off.  This is it.  They are quickly interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB, \nCURTIS WEINTRAUB Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest! Hello! \nNeither look at him, they remain fixed on each other.  Curtis gets a whiff of what he walked into. \nCURTIS WEINTRAUB (continuing; exiting quickly) Goodbye! \nAVERY I'm warning you.  Don't say it. You won't have another chance. \nJERRY Listen to me! \nAVERY No. \nJERRY It's over -- \nShe continues moving into the next room. \nAVERY Didn't hear it. \nJERRY There is something missing here. \nAVERY You've never been alone and you can't be alone -- \nJERRY Listen to me, it's over. \nShe can barely believe it.  She blinks. \nAVERY No one has ever dumped me. \nJERRY I'm not trying to make history. \nAVERY I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work. \nJERRY (it slips out) No. \nShe takes a breath.  It sinks in.  From somewhere, the small voice of her vulnerability. \nAVERY Oh Jerry. \nJERRY (steps closer) You know I didn't ever want to hurt you. \nShe gets an odd look, shaking her head.  Starts to step away, then thinks better of it.  She WALLOPS him in the face with the back of her hand.  Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest.  He sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards.  She straddles him, addresses him fully, right in his bruised face. \nAVERY I won't let you hurt me, Jerry. I'm too strong for you.  Loser. \nINT. JFK AIRPORT -- NEXT MORNING \nJerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell. Both wear sunglasses. \nTIDWELL You love me now, don't you? \nJERRY Very much. \n", "test2_id": 373, "test3_input": "Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos. \nRAY I wanna go too. \nLaurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living room. \nDOROTHY We'll see you soon, honey. Bye. \nJERRY Bye you guys. \nRay extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees one. \nINT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT \nLaurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on the lawn. \"All Shook Down.\"  Replacements. \nEXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nJerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind them. \nLAUREL Hey! \nAs Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can have privacy with her sister. \nLAUREL (continuing) Forgot your keys -- \nDOROTHY (privately) That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling? (eyes tear up) I mean, he must have been needing that. \nWomen's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm. \nLAUREL No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date. \nDOROTHY (laughing, wiping tear) Oh, knock it off! \nLAUREL (can't help it) And don't be a shoulder for him to cry on either. \nWe stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood, slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the street. \nINT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nJerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play. \nJERRY It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, \"it's nobody's fault.\" It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it -- \nDOROTHY Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but -- \nMariachis approach the table. \nHEAD MARIACHI A song for the lovers? \nJERRY/DOROTHY (too quickly) No.  No thanks. \nDOROTHY We work together. \nJerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so, reluctantly. \nJERRY See, you choose. If you fall for someone, if you make a commitment, you should make it work.  It's only when \"options\" entered the picture that things got bad. I'm speaking historically now.  It's a modern day concept, nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel? -- I think the only good thing to (more) \nJERRY (cont'd) come from this period in history is probably the movie \"Annie Hall.\" \nDOROTHY (evenly) Maybe you should call her. \nJERRY No no no.  I just underestimated her... (touches wound) her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this? \nA FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses. \nFLOWER GIRL A rose for the lady. \nJERRY You want a -- \nDOROTHY \u0001\u001f(\u0010   (scoffs) No.  No way. \nJerry gives her few bucks, she exits. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- (stops herself) Jerry? \nJERRY What? \nDOROTHY (simply) Let's not tell our sad stories. \nJerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness. \nDOROTHY (continuing) I'll be right back. Quit thinking those murky thoughts, okay? We're young, we're semi-successful. Life is good. \nShe exits and we hang on him for a moment. \nINT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER \nDorothy on the phone outside the bathroom. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. BATHROOM \nSbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play a mournful \"Tears in Heaven.\"  She smiles at the image, in fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning, fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis in another direction. \nDOROTHY Come on, let's take a walk. \nINT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT \nMusic feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the nearby light, Jerry swats it away. \nJERRY Well -- this would be goodnight. \nDOROTHY Good night. \nThey don't kiss.  They take great care not to touch too much. \nJERRY I'll see you tomorrow. \nThey don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him close. Kisses him.  It's a good one. \nDOROTHY Good night. \nBut they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps. They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again, tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container she's brought back from the restaurant. \nDOROTHY (continuing; breath) I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel. \nJERRY Same to you. \nDOROTHY No.  I have to go in.  I live here. \nJERRY Right.  I'll come in. \nDOROTHY Okay. Wait here a second. (beat, then) Do we really want to do this? \nJERRY (half-unsure) Oh hell yes. \nShe exits, as shot lingers on Jerry.  That odd moment when you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nDorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in evidence. \nDOROTHY He's asleep, right? \nCHAD Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy? \nDOROTHY Still going. \nChad raises his eyebrows. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Shhh. \nEXT. PORCH -- NIGHT \nJerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and down. \nCHAD Treat her right, man.  She's... \nJERRY (self-conscious) Yeah... well... \nCHAD She's great.  And I know this is a little awkward, but I want you to use this. \nChad ruumages in bag for a moment.  Jerry is somewhat horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a cassette tape. \nCHAD (continuing; intense) This... is Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two masters of freedom, playing in a time before their art was corrupted by a zillion cocktail lounge performers who destroyed the legacy of the only American artform -- JAZZ. \nJerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open. Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside. \nINT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT \nFierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed. Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is gone. \nDOROTHY What is this MUSIC? \nThey both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.) \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME \nLaurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window.  Laughter from the next room.  She pops open the styrofoam appetizers her sister brought back from dinner. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING \nRadio clicks on.  It's still dark.  Only the glow of the digital lamp.  Jerry alone in bed.  He gets up, coughs, pulls on some pants.  Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on toys. \nINT. KITCHEN -- MORNING \nDorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first possible drops of coffee. \n", "test3_id": 374}

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall. 
Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR. 
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm. 
BUTCH (to Fabienne) No! It's not your fault. (he approached her) You left it at the apartment. 
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. 
He touches her hand, she flinches. 
BUTCH If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader. 
He kisses her hand. Then rises. 
Fabienne is still sniffling. 
Butch goes to the closet. 
FABIENNE I'm sorry. 
Butch puts on his high school jacket. 
BUTCH Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you. 
FABIENNE Why does it mean that? 
BUTCH Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch. 
FABIENNE Won't the gangsters be looking for you there? 
BUTCH That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split. 
Rising from the floor. 
FABIENNE I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry. 
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face. 
BUTCH Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. (pause) I love you, remember? (he digs some money out of his wallet) Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast. 
FABIENNE Don't go. 
BUTCH I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie. 
FABIENNE Blueberry pie. 
BUTCH Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?  Okay? 
FABIENNE Okay. 
He kisses her once more and heads for the door. 
BUTCH Bye-bye, sugar pop. 
FABIENNE Bye. 
BUTCH I'm gonna take your Honda. 
FABIENNE Okay. 
And with that, he's out the door. 
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her. 
INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY 
Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street. 
BUTCH Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. "Bedside table  on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch." 
EXT. CITY STREET  DAY 
The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. 
CUT TO: 
A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY 
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. 
EXT. ALLEY  DAY 
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. 
EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY 
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home. 
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. 
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. 
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice. 
EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY 
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears disturbed.

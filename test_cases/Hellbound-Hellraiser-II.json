{"train": "HELLRAISER II by Peter Atkins - November 1, 1987 Second Draft \nHELLRAISER II : HELLBOUND \nScreenplay by Peter Atkins Original Story by Clive Barker \n2nd. Draft November 1, 1987 \nFADE IN: \n1    TITLES \nThe screen is composed of large, straight-edge areas of black and white that rest against each other in a manner that suggests some kind of pattern, without making a final sense; it is as if we are too close to something that, could we see it from a distance, would be clear to us. \nThese areas shift and change - both their own shape and their relationship to their neighbors.  New patterns are being made, new solutions found - but they are just beyond our comprehension. The effect should be aesthetically pleasing but simultaneously frustrating and, perhaps, a little unsettling. \nShortly into this sequence, and subsequently inter-cut throughout, we begin to see, in FLASHBACK, the story of HELLRAISER.  Arriving first as very short shock-images, these brief sections eventually convey to the audience all the necessary emotional and narrative information they will need to understand the background to HELLBOUND. \nMeanwhile, the black and white shapes are still moving, the unseen patterns still shifting. \nOver this constantly mobile background, the TITLES begin to appear. \nAs the TITLES unroll, another change comes over the puzzle pieces behind them.  Where before they moved and related only in two dimensions, gradually we see that they are now claiming depth as well.  The puzzle we are looking at is now a three-dimensional one.  The pieces are now solid blocks of various geometric shapes, locking together, moving apart, finding their final position. \nFinally, as the TITLES come to their conclusion, the camera pulls back until we can see clearly what we have been looking at.  As the final piece clicks into positions we see it is THE LAMENT CONFIGURATION from HELLRAISER. \nThe closed box rests before our eyes a moment and then the circle in the centre of the side that faces us gives way to an image of a dusty street with a market. Simultaneous to this, the camera TRACKS into this image until it fills the screen \n2    EXT   A STREET BAZAAR   DAY \nThe TRACK continues up through the market and then turns through the stalls to find a store behind them. As we TRACK through the store's doorway, we pass through a beaded curtain that momentarily reminds us of the TORTURE ROOM in HELLRAISER. \n3   INT.   STORE   DAY \nOnce we are in the store itself, though, this impression disappears. It is an ordinary, slightly seedy, junk shop. \nThe stall seems to sell an odd mixture of items; native trinkets share space with second-hand items from European colonists. These second-hand goods give us some sense of period. They suggest the late 'twenties/early 'thirties. This is reinforced by the sounds coming from one of them, an old-fashioned mahogany-cased wireless. A foreign voice speaks from it in a language we don't understand, though perhaps the words \"BBC world service\" are discerned in the middle, and then a dance-hall tune of the period begins to play. (Depending on availability, it would be nice to have something relevant - 'I'll follow my Secret Heart', perhaps, or 'Dancing in the Dark'.) \nInto shot comes an ENGLISH OFFICER. His uniform, too, suggests the 'twenties, the last days of Empire. He is tall, thin, and dark-haired, but at no stage do we see his face clearly. He stands in front of the stall. \nThe TRADER suddenly stands behind the counter. He has been crouched beneath it, as if checking or preparing something. He is a big, impressive-looking black man. His face is totally impassive as he stares at his customer. \nNeither of the men speak. Obviously, a deal has already been struck and today is the pay-off. \nThe OFFICER, a little arrogantly - suggesting racist contempt, slaps down a bag of gold on the stall's counter. \nKeeping his eyes firmly on the OFFICER, he reaches beneath him and brings something up from under the counter and places it In the OFFICER'S outstretched hand. He is holding a LAMENT CONFIGURATION. \nThe OFFICER turns and leaves. The camera TRACKS out of the store, looking at the TRADER as he watches the departing OFFICER. \n4    INT   THE OFFICER'S QUANSETT HUT   DAY \nIt is typical of temporary military quarters, complete with a curved ceiling of corrugated material. It is stripped of furniture. The blinds are down. \nThe OFFICER, still in uniform, sits cross-legged, the BOX held before him. \nHe is already well into the solving process and very soon after the shot begins the BOX begins to speed its own solution. \nFinally, two sections of the BOX shoot upwards and begin to peel apart from each other, ready to reveal its secret. \nThe OFFICER, suddenly nervous, drops the BOX and scuttles back across the floor to stare at it. The BOX lands upright, its extended parts still open above it. For a beat of two, nothing happens. We become aware of the OFFICER'S pulse, throbbing excitedly on the soundtrack. \n5    INT   THE OFFICER'S QUANSETT HUT   DAY    OFFICER'S P.O.V. \nSlowly we, the camera, and the OFFICER, move towards the still, silent, but menacing BOX. \nWe approach it until finally we are above it, looking down into the opening it has made in itself. There is undefined movement inside. \nSuddenly, something flies up directly at us. We glimpse it only briefly, but enough to see its nature. Unlike the hooks that flaw at FRANK in HELLRAISER, this is more organic than metallic. Pink and flesh-like but on a long gray-blue stalk, it flies upward, its lips peeling apart gapingly to reveal scores of yellow, discoloured, and viciously sharp teeth-like hooks. \nThe OFFICER screams and the screen begins to take on a red tint so that, just as the thing is about to fill the screen with its hungry mouth, the entire screen turns red. \nCORTEZ Oh. shit... \n9   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY \nRONSON is sitting back in the chair, looking at the now slightly calmer KIRSTY. \nRONSON We got two missing people and a house full of corpses. \nHe holds out his hand towards KIRSTY in a theatrical manner. \nRONSON Talk to me. \nKIRSTY swings her legs off the bad, but remains sitting on it, her feet on the floor. She doesn't look directly at RONSON but begins to take in the (few) details of the room for the first time. \nKIRSTY I thought Steve had talked to you? \nRONSON Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But - do me a favor? - none of this DEMONS crap. \nKIRSTY closes her eyes, almost wincing, as memory comes. \nKIRSTY opens her eyes. Consciously, she slows the rhythm of the dialogue down. \nKIRSTY He talked about Demons, huh? \nRONSON Yeah. \nKIRSTY turns her head to look directly at RONSON. \nKIRSTY It's true. All of it. It's all true. \nRONSON stares at her, impressed by her conviction and intensity. There is a second of shared silence. \nSuddenly, a shocking ELECTRONIC CRACKLE shatters the mood. RONSON starts, then realises it is the radio at his belt. He snatches it up and speaks into it. \nRONSON Ronson. \n10    INT   BEDROOM  LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT \nAnother OFFICER, KUCICH, is standing, radio in hand, by the blood-stained mattress. CORTEZ stands beside him, gun now safely re-holstered. \nKUCICH Kucich here,sir.  We just found another one, though it suffered a little... \nKUCICH looks at CORTEZ, who looks embarrassed. \nKUCICH ...er, accidental damage in discovery. Anyway, just about the only portable evidence we've got here - apart from human remains - is the mattress. Looks like someone was messed up real bad on it. \n11    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKUCICH (off-camera) Can we send it downtown? \nRONSON throws KIRSTY a look of exasperation with his colleague. The camera stays on KIRSTY's face as RONSON speaks. \nRONSON What the hell are you asking me for?  Tag it.  Move it. \nKIRSTY (to herself) The mattress... The mattress... JULIA. \nWithout waiting for a reply, RONSON switches the radio off and clips it back to his belt. \n12    INT   BEDROOM   55 STREET   NIGHT We are looking at the mattress. KUCICH has left the room. \nCORTEZ draws a pad from his packet. The pad is stapled, and the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property. In the act of tearing a label from the pad, CORTEZ catches his thumb on the staple. \nOFFICER Shit! \nThe label is adhesive-backed. CORTEZ licks it and presses it on the mattress. He writes on it - 55L/E1.  As he stands up from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on the mattress. (It is important that we see it is only a single drop - and nothing like the amount LARRY spilled on the floorboards.) \nCORTEZ leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him move the mattress.  We move in to see the drop of blood disappear very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in. \nAs this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest RUMBLE. \n13    INT   OPERATING ROOM   NIGHT \nMALAHIDE Tiffany. Come. \nAll the TIFFANYS move quietly toward him until they all disappear from view. Then the real TIFFANY comes into shot, her back to us, and walks toward what we now see to be the real MALAHIDE, who is standing in a doorway deliberately framed like a mirror to confuse the customers. \nTIFFANY places her hands docilely on to MALAHIDE's outstretched ones. \n22   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY has been dozing fitfully, but is awakened by strange noises. At first terrified, she slowly realises it is simply someone being put in the room next door. \nShe waits until activity has ceased and then moves to her door. It is unlocked. She moves out into the corridor. \n23   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT \nLooking warily from side to side, KIRSTY edges out into the corridor, along it, and then stops by the door of the adjoining room. \n24   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT   C.U. \nA hand fits a piece of jig-saw puzzle into the space it belongs. We know it is a jig-saw by the shape of the pieces, but it is clearly not the conventional type - a picturesque photo - because all we can see at this close-up angle are large areas of black and white. \n25    INT. TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT \nWe now see that the puzzle is on the floor of a room of a similar size to KIRSTY'S. It is slightly more decorated; It has curtains and wallpaper. And a tiled floor. Sitting cross-legged on the floor next to the puzzle is TIFFANY. \nThe puzzle, which we can now see more clearly, is an intricate abstract design in black and white. There are several pieces still un-fitted but TIFFANY is working steadily, efficiently, and with complete concentration. \nOn a wall behind her there is a visual record of her progress over the last few months. Sealed in plastic by staff members are. Puzzles she has solved, with dates marking her advancement. They begin with the simplest wood block animals usually given to very small children. passing through photo-puzzles of increasing difficulty, and culminating in one or two other examples of the kind of complicated pattern-work she is involved in now. \n26   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT \nWe pull out to see that this is KIRSTY'S P.O.V. from the glass panel in the door of TIFFANY'S room. \nTIFFANY looks up at one point and eye-contact is made. KIRSTY gives a tentative smile and a small wave. TIFFANY stares at her. The stare is long but unresponsive and finally TIFFANY returns to the puzzle. \nKIRSTY has her back to us and the camera is quite close in when a hand suddenly moves into shot and touches her shoulder. \nKIRSTY jumps back in alarm, fear on her face. But it is only KYLE. \nKYLE raises his hand in apology. \nKYLE Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. God, if anyone should know not to do that, it's me. I'm sorry. O.K.? \nKIRSTY nods and gives a nervous smile. KYLE, still embarrassed by his foolishness and eager to change the subject, nods towards the glass panel. \nKYLE Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY. \nKIRSTY What's the matter with her? \nKYLE Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years. \nKIRSTY God, that's terrible. \nKYLE Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out. \nKYLE ushers KIRSTY back into her own room. \n27   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY \nAs he closes the door to KIRSTY's room, KYLE reaches into the pocket of his lab-coat and produces a small box of pills. \nKYLE Anyway, let's concentrate on you for a moment. Wanna suck on this for me? \nKIRSTY looks up at him sharply. He is proffering a pill and grinning facetiously. \nKIRSTY Hey, good joke, Kyle. Do you always come on to the mentally ill? \nKYLE's face falls. He blushes. Pressing the pills into KIRSTY's hand, he backs off to the door, apologising. \nKYLE Shit. Sorry. Here's the pills. Red face. Door. Bye. \nHe exits hurriedly, closing the door behind him. KIRSTY grins despite herself. She looks at the pill for a second or two and then puts it firmly back in the box. Realising there is no bedside table, she puts the box on the wooden chair. \nIn the first, a middle-aged, overweight woman sits completely motionless in the middle of the floor. She is dressed in a shapeless white robe and is sitting crosslegged. Her head is shaven, her eyes are rolled completely up into the sockets so that only white shows. \nIn the second, a very thin man of about thirty is pressed as tight as he can be into one corner of the room. His hair is long and he has a full beard. He is naked but not unadorned - his body and much of his cell wall is smeared in excrement. \nIn the third, a man of about MALAHIDE'S age-stands in the centre of the room. He is of normal build but his head is shaved. His face, scalp, and hands are covered in self-inflicted and amaterurish tattoos- all of crosses. He is dressed in T-shirt and jeans. With both hands he holds aloft a silver crucifix, pointing it in all directions, as if under constant siege by Devils. He mutters prayers and invocations constantly. \nIn the fourth, a man in his early twenties restrained in a strait-jacket. He shuffles around on the call-floor, his eyes twitching and flitting from one part of his body to another. \nBROWNING (muttering) Get them off me. Get them off me. \nOff-camera, we hear the sound of KIRSTY's sobbing - which bridges the CUT TO: \n33 INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM DAY \nKYLE enters, having heard KIRSTY crying. She is sitting with her legs over the side of the bed with her face in her hands. \nKYLE immediately sits next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. He doesn't force her to speak. He lets her let the tears out. Finally, she looks up. \nKIRSTY I...I had a visitor. \nKYLE What? \nKIRSTY Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's ...it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help! \nKYLE (Carefully) Kirsty, I'm sorry...  don't understand. I... \nKIRSTY I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised. \nKYLE responds quickly to this. His faith in MALAHIDE is strong, despite that curious incident of the previous night when MALAHIDE followed RONSON out of the room. \nKYLE Dr. Malahide. Yes. Look, I'll fetch him. You take it easy. I'm sure he can help. \nKYLE stands up, making soothing motions with his hands, and heads for the door. \nKIRSTY Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy. \nKYLE If anyone can help, HE can. \nKIRSTY turns and gives KYLE a strange look as he opens the door. \nKIRSTY Yeah? He got a ticket to Hell? \n34    INT.    HOSPITAL CORRIDOR     DAY \nWe TRACK with KYLE down the corridor, eventually reaching an impressive door, which is slightly ajar. Even before we reach it, we hear MALAHIDE's voice. He is clearly on the phone. Because of the nature of what he is hearing, KYLE pauses when he reaches the door, listening with a confused expression on his face. \nMALAHIDE (off-camera & gradually fading up) Officer Kucich? Yes, Doctor Malahide. You've spoken to Ronson? Yes ... That's right. The mattress ... No, I'll meet you by the side entrance. No, no, my HOUSE. Yes, let me make that clear. The house, NOT the hospital. ... Yes ... Fine, and thank you. \nWe hear the phone click. KYLE waits a moment and then walks swiftly through the door, speaking as he does so. \nKYLE Doctor Malahide ... ? \n35   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM    DAY \nKIRSTY'S face fills the screen. Her voice is slightly dreamy, as if she is still trying to understand herself the story she is about to tell. \nKIRSTY It must have been going on forever... \nHer voice trails off. We pull out to see KIRSTY sitting up on her bed. MALAHIDE on the wooden chair, and KYLE standing by the door. \nMALAHIDE's voice pulls her back. \nMALAHIDE Kirsty...? \nKIRSTY snaps back and continues to speak in a more normal voice. \nKIRSTY But the part I know about, That must have started with my Uncle Frank... \nMALAHIDE Then let us speak of it ... \nDISSOLVE TO \nIt is a book of faces. There are about fifteen sheets in the binder. Some of them are genuine photographic prints, some photocopies of original photos. They range widely in age, race, and sex. They are all full-face portraits. Chronologically, the range is extensive too. Some pictures (generally photocopies) appear to date from the earliest days of photography, the late 1880's, others have an Edwardian appearance, or suggest the 1920's. Only one or two seem to be less than thirty years old. \nKYLE flicks back and forward in the book, wondering on the significance of these people. \nHe is lost in the musings when the click of the front door tells him MALAHIDE has returned. \nKYLE closes the book and quickly slips it back into the drawer. He heads rapidly for the window he came in through but realises MALAHIDE is too close for him to open it and make good his escape. Instead he stands between the window and the curtains, pulling the latter closed over him. \nMALAHIDE enters the room, leading BROWNING who is still strait- jacketed. \n44    INT.    BEHIND THE CURTAIN        NIGHT \nWe see KYLE standing very still in the limited space behind the curtains. It is clearly seen that, given the thoroughness with which he closed the curtains and his immobile position, he is unable to see what is happening in the room. He can hear, but not see. \n45   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    NIGHT \nMALAHIDE leads BROWNING across to the mattress. Standing beside it, he unbuckles and removes the strait-jacket from his patient. \nBROWNING, beneath the strait-jacket, is naked to the waist. His arms and cheat are a mass of scars of various age and size. \nMALAHIDE gestures to the mattress. Now that his arms are free, BROWNING is scratching furiously. \nMALAHIDE Mr. Browning. Please, lie down. \nBROWNING lies down, still scratching, trust and hope in his eyes. \n46  INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   BROWNING'S DELUSION  (BROWNING'S P.O.V.) \nAs if looking through BROWNING's eyes, we see his body stretched out before us on the mattress. \nThe naked chest and arms are covered with raised lumps, red and painful-looking. \nAs his scratching arms attack these lumps, they break open, revealing vile black insects that have hatched beneath his skin. BROWNING brushes these away while he scratches at the remaining lumps. \n47   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT \nBROWNING has already re-opened some of the more recent scars, and blood slowly rises to the surface of his skin. \nMALAHIDE walks over to his writing tableland goes into one of the drawers. \nHe produces an old-fashioned cut-throat razor and walks back to BROWNING \nMALAHIDE Here. This will help. \nHe proffers the razor. BROWNING siezes it. MALAHIDE steps back quickly, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension on his face. \nBROWNING slashes at his body and left arm with a short, sharp, slicing motions. In his mind, he is lancing the cysts that contain the tormenting insects. In reality, he is inflicting horrifying damage on himself. \nBlood pours from the multitude of wounds, running over his body and down onto the mattress. \nSuddenly, without any preliminaries, two painfully thin, flayed, mucus-covered arms shoot out of the mattress, one on either side of the still-busy BROWNING. \nThey wrap themselves tightly across his chest and crush him tightly to the mattress, as a head, similarly wasted, oozes out of the mattress to the side of BROWNING's head. \nBeneath his delusions, BROWNING suddenly has an inkling of what is happening to him. His eyes widen and his mouth opens ready to emit a scream but the monster beneath him forces a hand over his mouth as it buries its face into the soft flesh of his neck. \nTwo legs now rise from the oozing slime that the bloodstains on the mattress have become. They too wrap themselves around BROWNING so that he is held tight. \nFinally, with titanic effort, he gathers enough momentum to roll completely free of the mattress and falls to the floor beside it. The thing on his back now is pulling free from the bed of bubbling, frothing slime that the mattress now is with a sliding, slurping sound. \nThe monster's face is now deep in the flesh of his throat, and even as BROWNING forces himself up first onto one knee and then, very unsteadily, onto his feet, we can see him wasting away - his face losing its fullness and colour, his chest sinking in on itself. \nThe creature, which is still wrapped around him and clinging tight is, unlike him, growing in stature by the second. Muscles are inflating, arteries pumping more vigorously, and flesh itself filling out. \nIts horrific thin-ness when it first appeared effectively unsexed it but now, as its regeneration continues, the fullness of its hips, the roundness of its thighs, and the sacs of fat and muscle that bloom above its ribs confirm its female nature. If there was any doubt that this was JULIA, it is now disappearing. \nBROWNING is now nearly a walking corpse and it is the strength of his will alone that allows him to take a few faltering steps with JULIA still enveloping him. With the desperate strength with which she clings to him and the way her legs are wrapped around his hips, it is like an obscenely perverse parody of sexual passion. \nMALAHIDE has been watching all this with an incredible mix of emotions playing across his face. Still human enough to feel both fear and disgust at what is happening he is nevertheless awe struck and exhilarated. He has waited all his life for such an irrefutable demonstration of the power and the truth of the supernatural. \nSimilarly, the scientist in him is fascinated by the living anatomy lessons that JULIA's regeneration and BROWNING rapid decay offer. \nKYLE opens his mouth a few times, as if unsure what to say. \nKYLE It's all true. \n53   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT \nTIFFANY walks around her room, staring at her completed puzzles - those on the wall and the one on the floor - and waiting for the next one. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \n54   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY \nA simple shot tells us it is the next morning. \n55   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY \nMALAHIDE , dressed in a black suit, is in the room, staring at the empty mattress. We TRACK with him through to his LIVING ROOM. \n56   INT.   LIVING ROOM  MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY \nIn contrast to the secret and private obsession room, this room is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful professional. \nIt is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white walls. The walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three large canvases of abstract art. \nThe longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table, which rests against it about half way down. On this table is a very simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful white lilies. Above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror. \nAs MALAHIDE enters, the first thing he sees is a bloody palm- print on one of his white walls. He blinks at it and looks down into the room. We CUT TO; \nJULIA. At first it seems she is staring at the lilies, but as we TRACK around her, we realise she is staring at the reflection of her skinned self. \nHer face snarls at herself, she roars with rage, forms her hand into a fist and shatters the mirror. \nMALAHIDE rushes towards her. She swings round and freezes him with a glance. \nThey hold their positions for a moment, MALAHIDE nervous and JULIA furious, and then JULIA makes herself relax. She sighs, takes a few deep breaths, and then speaks. \nJULIA I'm cold. \nTIME CUT \n57   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY \nCLOSE UP on a strangely Art Deco electric fan heater, with bright red coils emitting waves of heat. \nWe pull out to see MALAHIDE standing by the table with the flowers. There is now a half-full glass of wine on the table, along with an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored. A pack of cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of MALAHIDE's jacket. \nJULIA enters the room and closes the door behind her. She is dressed in one of MALAHIDE'S suits. It is a light weight suit of white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries. \nShe crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre of the room, to allow MALAHIDE to look at her. \nJULIA Well? \nMALAHIDE'S nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to smile. He nods his head slowly a few times. \nMALAHIDE Yes... Yes. You look... \nJULIA Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish? \nMALAHIDE No. You look... \nHe pauses, lost for words. \nJULIA doesn't wait for an answer. She crosses to the table and takes up his glass of wine. She downs it in one. \nMALAHIDE stares at her, a little surprised. \nJULIA Yes, I still like WINE ... \nShe smiles strangely at him and then moves closer. Slowly, keeping her eyes on his, she reaches into his breast pocket for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth. \nKIRSTY (to herself) Kyle...? \nShe folds up the photograph and puts it in her pocket. \nShe crosses to the door and opens it. She does not go through it immediately but stands in the doorway for a moment, her hand still on the door, cocking her head slightly as if listening. \nKIRSTY (slightly louder) Kyle? \nShe can't hear anything, but she regards that as a bad sign, not a good one. She leaves the room. \n68   INT.   STAIRS/LANDING   DAY \nKIRSTY makes her way up the stairs. Unlike KYLE a little earlier she moves up them quite quickly and advances onto the landing. \nWhen she is on the landing and looking at the closed door to JULIA's Boudoir she stops, standing still and staring at the door. \nKIRSTY suppresses a shudder. She bites her lip, takes two or three deep breaths, crosses to the door firmly, and flings it open, moving into the room even as she does so. \n69   INT.  THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY \nKIRSTY moves three or four steps into the room and then stops dead. The door swings shut behind her. \nKIRSTY's eyes flick left and right, taking in the sickening details of the room's contents, and then stare straight ahead, focusing on the figure in white which is turning around to face her. \nJULIA completes her turn and looks at KIRSTY completely impassively for a moment. Then her mouth opens up into a smile of welcome - but there is nothing but hate in her eyes. \nJULIA Kirsty! How nice of you to drop in. \nJULIA glances meaningfully at the dead thing that lies beside her feet and then back at KIRSTY. \nJULIA You have surprisingly good taste in men. \nKIRSTY's fear and disgust are momentarily displaced by a furious rage as she realises what JULIA has done. Her face erupts into anger and she screams out. \nKIRSTY Kyle! No! I'll kill you, you... \nShe flings herself across the room at JULIA even as she speaks. \nJULIA is completely unphased by this attack and simply raises one arm. She siezes the wrist of the arm that KIRSTY has raised into a clenched fist and effortlessly throws KIRSTY bodily back across the room. We realise for the first time the immense physical strength that JULIA now possesses. \nKIRSTY smashes into the door and falls to a sitting position against it. She is shaken and slightly hurt enough not to get to her feet immediately but she stares at JULIA with undimmed hatred. \nJULIA throws a look halfway between a smile and a sneer. \nJULIA Oh, you can try it, you little bitch. I'd love you to try it. But I'm not just the woman I was. \nKIRSTY What, you mean you're something more than a whore with a vicious streak? \nJULIA I mean I'm something more than human, you little shit! \nJULIA snaps this first line but then holds her anger in check. She shakes her head and an amused smile plays across her lips. \nJULIA Oh, Kirsty. They didn't tell you, did they? I'm afraid they've changed the rules of the fairy tale; I'm no longer just the wicked step-mother. \nThe smile disappears and she delivers the next line with an utterly straight face. It is, after all, the truth. \nJULIA Now I'm the Evil Queen. \nThe hatred and the heat returns to her voice. \nJULIA So come on; Take your best shot, Snow White. \nKIRSTY scrambles to her feet and again charges at JULIA. \nJULIA steps forward to meet her advance and delivers a single back-handed swipe across KIRSTY's face with such force that not only is the girl knocked off her feet but is actually knocked unconscious. \nKIRSTY rolls onto her back and lies at JULIA's feet. \nJULIA stares down at the unconscious body. When it was awake, it was KIRSTY and her attitude to it was based on personal enmity. Now, it is simply another body and she judges it differently; it is firm, full, healthy, and young. We see the expression on her face change from hatred and triumph to pure appetite. She licks her lips and her eyes glisten. She begins to bend slightly towards it. \nMALAHIDE (off-camera) Julia! \nJULIA It certainly is. \nMALAHIDE turns away to meet her eyes. \nThere is a beat or two where absolutely nothing happens. \nThe mirror explodes inwards into the alcove. \n76   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY \nThe room is filled with smoke and suffused with blue light. \nTwo of the walls simply part physically, revealing entrances into the corridors of Hell. These corridors are lined with gray walls and seem to run for a great distance. \nTIFFANY still sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor, staring about her in astonishment. \nSurrounding her, in various parts of the room, are the four CENOBITES from HELLRAISER. \nThe FEMALE CENOBITE smiles and advances towards TIFFANY. \nThe leader of the CENOBITES, PINHEAD raises a hand. \nPINHEAD Wait. \nThe FEMALE stops and looks questioningly at PINHEAD. \nPINHEAD, at a more leisurely pace, crosses towards TIFFANY and looks down at her. She stares back at him, the remnants of her insanity a temporary defense against fear, her face registering nothing. \nPINHEAD looks up. \nPINHEAD No. \nThe FEMALE looks across at him. \nCENOBITE No? \nPINHEAD shakes his head. \nPINHEAD No. \nHe glances down at TIFFANY again. \nPINHEAD It is not HANDS that call us... \nHe looks up and stares directly at the shattered two-way mirror. \nPINHEAD ... It is DESIRE. \n77   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY \nThe wall opposite the shattered mirror has also opened up to reveal a way into Hell. \nMALAHIDE and JULIA are no longer in the alcove. \nWe hear the ringing of their footsteps. They are making their way down the corridor. \n78   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY \nThe four CENOBITES have gone. \nTIFFANY looks around the room again. She stares from one entrance to the other. Her manner is reminiscent of when she is making decisions during her solving of puzzles. \n79   INT.   BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY \nKIRSTY is still on the floor in the boudoir of blood. This room too is now suffused with blue light and smoke. There are no gateways to Hell in the walls but there are several cracks in the plaster and these appear to be spreading. \nKIRSTY moans and opens her eyes gingerly. She puts a hand to her face, rubbing at the place where JULIA hit her. \nStill a little groggy, she lifts herself slowly to a sitting position, her legs stretched out. Only when she has blinked a few times, shaken her head, and rubbed her jaw again, does full consciousness return - at which point she looks quickly about the room ( possibly expecting another attack from JULIA) and notices the light and the smoke. \nShe has been in this atmosphere before. She knows precisely what it means. Her mouth opens and her eyes grow nervous again. \nThe corridors that MALAHIDE sees are different to KIRSTY'S; they are grotto-like, dotted with stalactites and stalagmites and not immediately unattractive. The walls contain portals of a glass- like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lights of different colors and MALAHIDE peers eagerly into several of these. \nIn one, the view is like an aquarium. An alien fish swims past his eyes. Its body resembles a human brain but it has pincer-like claws. MALAHIDE presses his hand against the glass as the thing comes nearer. Suddenly, from within its body, the thing produces a perfect human forearm and hand and meets MALAHIDE's hand on the other side of the glass. \nMALAHIDE starts slightly but then keeps his hand there. He is turning his head to call JULIA's attention to this marvel when the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat against the glass with tremendous force. \nMALAHIDE jumps back sharply, but the thing shatters the glass and leaps out at him. He gasps and runs up the corridor, the thing hopping after him on its one hand. \nAs they pass JULIA, she tuts with the slightly exasperated but indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher. She steps on the thing, squashing it flat. It emits a horrible death-cry. \nJULIA Do be careful. \n83   INT.   HELL'S SITTING ROOM   DAY \nWhite light fills the screen and KIRSTY steps through it into view. Instantly the White light contracts and disappears. \nKIRSTY finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting room. \nThe room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summer's day. The birdsong KIRSTY heard earlier continues but is, if anything, even more melodic, even more sweet. \nThe room is vaguely Edwardian in its decor; real wood furnishings and decorative porcelain ornaments. There is a large wooden dresser, on top of which are many photographs in old-fashioned brass frames. \nDespite herself, KIRSTY cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure at the appearance of the room. \nShe touches some of the furniture, as if to assure herself it is real. \nShe approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large framed photographs. She gasps in pleasure. \nWe see the photograph. It is a family group and looks to be have been taken ten to twenty years ago. It is of a man, a woman, and a young girl of four or five. \nThe man is clearly LARRY, albeit a younger version, and the little girl has dark, thick, slightly curly hair - just like KIRSTY'S. The woman is beautiful and has similar hair to her daughter. \nKIRSTY's eyes prick with tears - but they are clearly tears of happy memories. She smiles. \nKIRSTY Mommy... \nKIRSTY puts down the photograph of her family and looks around the room again. A troubled look crosses her face. \nDespite the aparent Summer light in the room, KIRSTY suddenly realises what it is that is odd. \nShe looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face. There are no windows in the room. And no door. \nAt this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes apparent. It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the total effect is simply less sweet than it was. \nKIRSTY looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a look of concern. \nThe photograph has changed. It is now a wedding photo. The wedding of LARRY and JULIA. \nSuddenly the photograph begins to bleed. Blood pours from the paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass-so that it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the picture showing.  The blood begins to escape out of the frame, trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping onto KIRSTY's fingers. \nWith a cry of horror, KIRSTY drops the frame. It lands on the floor and the glass shatters. The blood continues to flow. In fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly fountains out, spreading across the floor. \nKIRSTY steps back and glances at the dresser. Blood is flowing from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the floor. \nBy now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much predominant and, as KIRSTY sweeps all the frames off the dresser and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking. \nKIRSTY throws her hands to her ears. \nKIRSTY Nooooo! \nShe rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her fists. \nThe walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists strike, like flabby flesh. KIRSTY stands back in disgust. \nThe wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling. \nThe light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly. It is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing. \nKIRSTY turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has given in to decay. The sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten, the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot. A skinned rat runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board. \nA rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which run wildly across the floor. \nPINHEAD puts out his hand in an expansive gesture. \nPINHEAD But, please; feel free. Explore. We'll always be here... \n85   INT.   CORRIDOR \nKIRSTY can't quite believe this but she has no intention of questioning it. She runs into the corridor and away, with PINHEAD's last words echoing after her. \nPINHEAD ... we have Eternity to know your flesh! \nDelighted CENOBITE laughter follows her back into the labyrinth. \nKIRSTY drops the transformed BOX into her pocket as she begins running through the corridors again. The labyrinth seems tighter now - the corridors shorter, the turns sharper. Corner after corner we see KIRSTY turn. \nAccompanying this tightening, the light in the corridors becomes gradually murkier - not quite dark, more like the oppressive colourlessness that descends before a thunderstorm breaks. \nOccasionally there are little hissing noises from the walls themselves, which are accompanied by small jets of dull and heavy smoke escaping between the bricks. \nOver all this, there grows in volume on the soundtrack a rhythmic, labored, resonant sound - a sound somewhere between breathing and machinery. \nSuddenly, as KIRSTY turns one more corner, a hand reaches out to touch her. \nKIRSTY throws herself back against the far wall of the corridor, unsure whether to fight or flee. Then her face relaxes. It is TIFFANY. \n86   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH \nIn another corridor within the labyrinth, MALAHIDE and JULIA are walking. \nThey too have found their way into the inner sections. They too are in tighter, sharper corridors where the light is distressing. They too hear the machine-like breathing noise. And what is revealed behind the portals in the corridor walls is less ambiguous in its unpleasantness; in one we see CHATTERER in some Hell's equivalent of a beauty salon. He is being re-made. This involves the scar tissue being manually peeled from the upper part of his face to reveal beneath small, vicious, human eyes. \nMALAHIDE's attitude has begun to change, as well. His nervousness now clearly outweighs his delight. He' rushes on to the next portal. \nIf the last room was a beauty salon, this is the orgy room. But the orgy is very strange. It is a very dark room, filled with a faint layer of smoke. In the background, a bound man is having his chest licked by a kneeling woman. She pulls her face back for a moment. Her tongue is horrifically long and studded with short, sharp blades. The man's chest is stripped of skin where she has been attending him. His face is a picture of ecstasy. \nIn the foreground, three people are buried up to their waists in the floor. They are naked. The one in the middle is a woman, the other two, men. The one in front of her faces her, the one behind has his back to her back. They are all very, close. The men have various hooks in their chests, connected by chains to the unseen walls and their faces are impassive. The woman is unwounded and her head flicks back and forth, as if in the grip of a sexual climax of stunning ferocity. The movements of her head keep the details of her features blurred until, finally, it turns to give MALAHIDE a three-quarter profile and holds its position, its mouth open, its eyes half-closed in pleasure. It is JULIA's face. \nMALAHIDE gasps and pulls back from the portal. The camera TRACKS back to reveal that JULIA is still in the corridor, just a few yards in front of him \nJULIA Come. I have such sights to show you. \nMALAHIDE shakes his head crazily from side to side and begins to back away. \nJULIA looks at him and walks toward him slowly. She smiles. She strokes his cheek. She moves closer, gently slipping her arms around him and molding her body to his. She extends her tongue and licks lightly at his lower lip. He opens his mouth and returns the kiss, pressing her body more firmly to him. The kiss becomes quite passionate. \n87   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH \nKIRSTY and TIFFANY are now walking together. \nKIRSTY is talking to her as calmly as her sense of urgency will allow. \nKIRSTY Do you see? You were RIGHT. This IS a puzzle, too. But WE'RE CAUGHT in the puzzle. \nKIRSTY stops walking and catches hold of TIFFANY's arm. TIFFANY stops, looks at the hand holding her arm, and then looks into KIRSTY's eyes. \nKIRSTY Yeah? \nTIFFANY smiles directly at KIRSTY and then returns her nod. \nKIRSTY Yeah? \nTIFFANY nods again, more emphatically. \nKIRSTY Yeah! \nKIRSTY throws her arms around TIFFANY and hugs her. \n88   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH \nJULIA is leading MALAHIDE down a corridor which has intersections every few yards on both of its sides. \nJULIA walks past these shadowed entrances without pause, without a single sidelong glance. She is clearly confident, clearly back on her own turf. \nKIRSTY hurriedly, throws the blanket back over it. \nA voice issues into the room. It sounds like LARRY but, as we shall see, it is not. \nVOICE No. Over here. Behind the screen. \nKIRSTY walks carefully around the screen, giving it a wide berth in case of a trick. \nThere is a figure standing against the wall behind the screen. It is deeply shadowed by the screen itself but is clearly male. \nKIRSTY gulps back a sob and her eyes fill with tears. \nKIRSTY Daddy... ? \nThe figure leans slowly into the light, speaking as he does so. \nFRANK That's it, baby. Come to Daddy. \nKIRSTY stands still. There is a second where her face registers nothing. Then she screams. \nKIRSTY NO! \nit is her UNCLE FRANK, back in his skin and dressed in white shirt and jeans. \nFRANK chuckles. KIRSTY backs away from him into the room. FRANK puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture. KIRSTY realises he is not moving after her. She also sees that his body is curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by the screen. Is there something else there? Something she can't quite see? FRANK's voice stops her wondering. \nFRANK What's the matter, Kirsty? It's only Frank. It's only Uncle Frank. \nKIRSTY's anger at being tricked wins over her fear and distress and she shouts at FRANK in fury. \nKIRSTY I should have known! I should've known he wouldn't be here! This place is only for filth like you! \nFRANK sneers. \nFRANK Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh? \nKIRSTY Yes! \nFRANK Shit. Bull. Shit \nFRANK pauses and smiles. Then he begins to move more fully into the room, shifting his weight as he does so and dragging what was hidden into the light. KIRSTY screams again. \nFRANK's white shirt is cut off at the left shoulder. His arm is bare and, from the elbow down to the wrist, joined to another forearm. The flesh is completely fused, like that of siamese twins. As FRANK moves into the room, the owner of the other arm is revealed. It is his brother, LARRY. KIRSTY's father. \nLARRY, like his brother, is dressed in a white shirt (cut off at one shoulder) and jeans and, like his brother, has his skin back. His face is frozen into a permanent expression of terror and he seems incapable of any independent movement, simply being pulled along by FRANK. \nKIRSTY steps back in horror. \nFRANK See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank. \nKIRSTY No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick! \nFRANK 'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all. \nKIRSTY's fear of FRANK is now outweighed by her contempt for his argument. \nKIRSTY You're full of shit, Frank Cotton. My Dad wasn't like that at all. He could feel. He could love. He loved ME. \nKIRSTY's voice breaks. \nKIRSTY He...he loved me. \nFRANK Don't waste your tears. Look at him! \nHer hatred for FRANK gives KIRSTY her strength back. \nKIRSTY He loved me, you bastard! He Loved me, he loved my mother. He even loved that bitch you betrayed him with! \nFRANK begins to move towards KIRSTY again, LARRY dragging behind him. \nFRANK Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to see me recently. That's why it's so nice to have you here, baby. Daddy's little girl. So pretty when she's upset. Come to Daddy, \nJULIA watches with avid interest. \n92   INT.   BROTHERS' ROOM \nLARRY and FRANK are fighting furiously, tumbling around the room. LARRY is fuelled by righteous anger and revenge but FRANK has had more experience of dirty fighting. \nAt one stage their free hands each have hold of the other man by the throat and are rolling along one of the walls, each trying to establish the dominant grip. \nThey smash violently against one of the walls in the room. It gives and they fall through into the next room. \n93   INT.   KNIFE ROOM \nThis is a small square room. With the exception of the doorway to the BROTHERS ROOM, every inch of the walls is covered with sharp and deadly-looking double-bladed knives -ie One blade is buried in the wall up to a central hilt/handle and the other blade juts out menacingly into the room. \nThe two brothers tumble into the room. Their grips loosened by their fall through the wall, they land on the floor and rise to their feet, staring at each other but taking in the vicious nature of the room as well. \nFRANK How convenient. \nKIRSTY comes through and gasps as she sees the walls. \nLARRY Stay there, baby. Don't come in. \nFRANK Yes. Stay there. I'll be with you in a minute. \nLARRY and FRANK trade blows. \nFRANK lands a powerful blow to LARRY's jaw. It straightens LARRY up and FRANK slams the flat of his hand against his brother's chest. \nLARRY flies backwards. He flings out his arm to balance himself but he is nearer to the wall than he thinks and the impetus of his fall drives his arm onto the knives. \nLARRY cries out. FRANK grins and prepares to force his wounded brother completely onto the knives. \nSuddenly KIRSTY flies across the room at FRANK and beats at his back with her fists. \nFRANK snarls and, without turning around completely, flings her away from him. KIRSTY goes flying but lands just safely short of the deadly walls. \nLARRY, in the pause KIRSTY gave him and galvanized by her example, has found more strength. He pulls his arm painfully forward, clear of the knives, and throws himself to the side, forcing FRANK onto the knives. With a vicious push, LARRY impales his brother completely. \nFRANK howls, loud and long. \nWithout pausing, LARRY pulls a knife free from the wall and, with one vicious slice, separates himself from his brother. \nLARRY rushes to KIRSTY and helps her to her feet. They embrace. \nThere is a cry of horror off-camera. We pull out. TIFFANY has followed her friend. She stares in shock at LARRY's wounded arm and at the impaled FRANK. \n94   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL \nJULIA is being given more glimpses of the transforming MALAHIDE. \nThe major surgery seems to be complete. There are no spinning blades of needles in sight as the gashes open. MALAHIDE's head is completely bald and his face, like the rest of his skin is blue. The only new sophistications are that his upper and lower eyelids have been stretched wide and stapled to his face and forehead, and that a new mouth has been sliced into what was his cheek before his features were pulled permanently to one side. \nOver the sound of LEVIATHAN's breath and the CENOBITE machinery still at work on MALAHIDE, FRANK's howl is heard. \nJULIA's head turns to the direction of this new sound. \nJULIA Frank... \nShe turns away without a backward glance and moves back into the corridors. \n95   INT.   THE KNIFE ROOM \nFRANK is still impaled on the knives,  but his anguished howl has Become  small whimpers of complaint (with, given his history with the  CENOBITES,  perhaps  the tiniest note of pleasure in  there, too) \nKIRSTY,  LARRY and TIFFANY are now gathered together to one side of the room near the door that leads to the corridor. They should leave, but a kind of sick fascination keeps them watching FRANK. \nFRANK realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives and lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to. \nHe turns his palms to face the knives and, with a growl of self- encouragement, drives them deeply onto the knives so that he can begin to push the rest of his impaled body backwards. \nIt takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed, but succeed he does. He flops backwards into the room. \nThey reach the end of the corridor.  It terminates in a T- junction. \nTIFFANY automatically heads in one direction.  KIRSTY makes to follow, but LARRY hesitates. \nLARRY Wait a minute.  Why are we following her? Who is this? \nKIRSTY This is Tiffany \nKIRSTY shrugs. \nKIRSTY ... She's good at puzzles. \nLARRY Fine. \nThey take the turn TIFFANY has indicated. \n97   INT  THE KNIFE ROOM \nJULIA still holds FRANK tight. \nSlowly, she raises the hand which holds his heart until it is in front of his face.  FRANK's eyes are glassing over but he can still see. \nJULIA Nothing personal, babe. \nWithout ceremony, she bursts the heart with one quick squeeze. \n100    INT  THE CENTRE OF HELL \nLARRY, KIRSTY and TIFFANY come running toward the camera. Initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were running along has widened and the walls retreated.  Suddenly, they come to a stunned halt together, staring ahead of them with awestruck faces. \nKIRSTY Oh. My. God. \nThe camera moves around them to take in what they see.  They are of course in the central chamber of LEVIATHAN. \nLEVIATHAN is spinning again, the black beams flying around the chamber. \nTIFFANY screams. KIRSTY grabs her. \nKIRSTY Tiffany, listen.  You've solved it. But we've got to solve it the OTHER way.  See?  See? We've got to get out. \nTIFFANY is frozen. \nLARRY Come on! \nLEVIATHAN spins, the beams fly. \nKIRSTY Please!  Tiffany, Please! Get us out!  Take us home, please! \nTIFFANY nods. They are just about to leave when LEVIATHAN stops spinning. \nA large beam flies down , carrying an object which lands on the catwalk before the HUMANS, who all take a step or two backwards. The beam withdraws. The object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic bag, but then internal movement begins to rip at this covering.  Hands appear out of the rips and complete the removal.  We realise that the bag-like thing was a kind of caul, a membranous after-birth that some creatures produce their young in. \nThe thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of the shredded caul.  Like a new-born child, it is stained and soiled with amiotic fluids and blood.  But it is not a new born child. \nIt is a NEW CENOBITE.  And it used to be MALAHIDE.  The transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete.  Its skin is entirely blue, its head entirely bald.  The decorative wounds and tortures we saw being applied are all present;  its flesh is peeled back in various places, its features are threaded and distorted by, wire, its eyelids are stapled open. \nFor a second it stands and regards the HUMANS before it. \nTIFFANY gasps in recognition. \nKIRSTY too knows what it was. \nKIRSTY Malahide ... \nFor some reason, KIRSTY draws from her pocket the photo she took from the OBSESSION ROOM. She stares at it. \nKIRSTY Jesus Christ!  Of course ... \nThe MALAHIDE CENOBITE stretches its arms and flexes its fingers. \nMALAHIDE And to think I hesitated ... \nIn her left hand she still holds the BOX, but her right hand is only a few inches from TIFFANY's left. \nTIFFANY reaches her hand to her, not knowing JULIA as the others do. Their fingers just manage to interlock when JULIA's face registers a disbelieving shock. \nThere is a terrible ripping sound. JULIA's new skin, so recently gained, is giving up its hold and has ripped right up the spine. JULIA is drawn from it. \nJULIA NOOOOOOOOOO! \nWith a final, slurping sound, the skinned woman slips from the skin and disappears down the new corridor. \nThe momentary break in tension allows LARRY to make one last effort. He rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him. TIFFANY, finally, realising what has happened, screams in terror and disgust, especially when she looks at what she has brought round the corner in her hand. She drops JULIA's skin to the floor as the three of them scramble to their feet and begin to run again. \nStill clutched in the skin's hollow fingers is the white diamond BOX. \nAs they turn another corner, they see, very far in the distance, a glimmer of light. TIFFANY points excitedly. \nKIRSTY My God, it's her room! \nLARRY Let's go! \nHe starts urging the girls down the corridor - a long and very narrow one - but KIRSTY shows some resistance. \nKIRSTY No. No, there's something wrong... \nBefore they can discuss it, a new rushing sound is heard. They look back. \nHurtling towards them is the ENGINEER from HELLRAISER. \nTIFFANY screams. \nLARRY Jesus. O.K. No more arguments. Just RUN! \nThey begin one last panic-fuelled run down the narrow corridor, the ENGINEER at their heels. \nThe sequence is equivalent to KIRSTY's pursuit by the ENGINEER in HELLRAISER, the twist here being that as they approach the entrance into TIFFANY's room the walls of the corridor, already thin, begin to close together. \nLARRY is bringing up the rear (the corridor is now so narrow only single file is possible) and he can almost feel the ENGINEER'S breath on his neck. \nLARRY Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!! \nFinally, almost impossibly, they reach the gap in the wall. TIFFANY tumbles through, then KIRSTY, and finally LARRY. Less than a micro-second after LARRY has made it, the walls seal themselves. \n104   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM    (2nd VERSION)   DAY \nAs we see clearly the room they have come into, we perhaps share the feeling that KIRSTY expressed in the corridor; Something Is Wrong. \nThe tiles that make up the floor are patterned as before but the individual tiles are larger. The room itself seems more spacious, the ceiling higher. \nThere is a bowl of flowers by the window. The flowers were in full bloom before their trip to Hell but now they seem long dead. \nThe audience have to notice most of this for themselves because LARRY, KIRSTY, and TIFFANY are too relieved by, and tired from, their escape to take this in immediately. LARRY seats himself in the chair, KIRSTY perches on the end of TIFFANY's bed. TIFFANY however walks straight across to her window. She is the first to notice anything. She stares at the flowers. \nKIRSTY Tiffany ... ? \nKIRSTY rises from the bed and joins TIFFANY by the window. \nKIRSTY But these were ... Daddy? \nLARRY rises to his feet. Just as he stands, a fleeting expression of bewilderment crosses his face. He strokes at his right arm with an unconscious gesture as he crosses the room. \nKIRSTY doesn't look at her father right away. \nKIRSTY These flowers. I saw them just... \nShe looks at her father. A sea of sweat has broken out on his brow and face as he stares intensely at the flowers. KIRSTY's voice slows, begins to trail off. \nKIRSTY ...the day ...before... yesterday Daddy? Daddy! \nLARRY's eyes close. His entire face screws up as if an excruciating pain just hit him. He clamps his arm across his chest, the hands clutching his shoulders. He opens his eyes and looks at KIRSTY for a second, his expression one of surprise. Then his eyes roll up into the sockets and he collapses to the floor. \nTIFFANY has hardly had time to turn from the bowl of flowers before KIRSTY is kneeling by her father. \nTIFFANY screams. \nThe 1st GOWNED FIGURE pulls the mask and cap away from its face - It is PINHEAD. His colleague does the same. It is the FEMALE CENOBITE. \nKIRSTY Oh, Fuck. \nShe's had too much experience with these two to hesitate. She grabs TIFFANY's arm and bursts through the double doors to the corridor. \n108   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY \nWe are now looking along the corridor in the other direction - back towards the elevator. \nKIRSTY and TIFFANY come into shot, running rapidly along the corridor. \nAs they make their way, a rumbling, flatulent sound is heard from the overhead pipes and they all begin to drip blood not water. \nWe hear the sound of the doors flying open behind them. \nKIRSTY and TIFFANY reach the elevator. KIRSTY presses frantically on the call button, while TIFFANY looks behind them with frightened eyes. \nKIRSTY C'mon. C'MON! \nThe sound of steadily-pacing, purposeful feet is heard coming up the corridor, getting louder, coming closer. \nKIRSTY begins hammering on the closed elevator doors. TIFFANY stifles a cry with her hand. \nKIRSTY COME ON!! \nSuddenly, the doors fly open. KIRSTY and TIFFANY tumble into the elevator. \n109   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY   (GIRLS' P.O.V.) \nWe see the door-frame of the elevator and the floor buttons beside it and, looking down the corridor through the open elevator doors, PINHEAD and the FEMALE CENOBITE marching towards us. \nWe also see KIRSTY'S finger jabbing frantically at the floor buttons. The doors are not closing. The CENOBITES are getting very close. \nFinally, just as PINHEAD breaks from his determined but medium- paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three yards, extending his arm as he does so, the door slams shut across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start up. \n110    INT.   ELEVATOR   DAY \nKIRSTY leans against the back wall of the elevator, breathing heavily. TIFFANY stands very still in the middle, a frozen expression of fear on her face. \nKIRSTY Faster, you bastard, faster! \nShe slams her fist against the elevator wall. The elevator stops. Its lights flicker. \nKIRSTY Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. \nThe elevator starts again. \nKIRSTY It's 0.K. They can't beat an elevator. Not upstairs. It'll be O.K. \nThe lift stops, but this time it's where they want it. KIRSTY's finger hesitates over the DOOR OPEN button. \nKIRSTY It'll be O.K. \nShe presses the button. \n111   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY   (GIRLS P.O.V.) \nWe are looking at the closed elevator door.  When it opens we will be looking down the corridor on the main hospital floor - the floor with the girls' rooms on. \nThe door flies open. CHATTERER II lunges in at them. \nKIRSTY screams, but because of the eagerness of his lunge they are able to get around him as his impetus carries him to the back of the elevator. \n112   INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR      DAY \nThe door begins to close as the girls straighten up in the corridor and as CHATTERER II turns around to come back out at them. \nHe tries to put his hand out to stop the door closing, but succeeds only in trapping his fingers in the door. \nPINHEAD No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining. \nKIRSTY No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information. \nPINHEAD Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell. \nCarefully, making no fast movements, KIRSTY reaches into her pocket where she placed the photograph from MALAHIDE's OBSESSION ROOM. She brings out the picture that she realized earlier was of PINHEAD and hands it to him. \nHe takes hold of it and looks, his face registering nothing. \nPINHEAD What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank? \nKIRSTY No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU. \nPINHEAD Nonsense, I... \nKIRSTY It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think! \nThe FEMALE CENOBITE strides across the room. \nFEMALE CENOBITE Enough! \nShe raises her hand towards KIRSTY. PINHEAD's arm flies out and stops her. \nPINHEAD Wait! \nHe is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally puckering, as if something is stirring. \nPINHEAD I...remember. \nKIRSTY You were ALL human! \nThe other three CENOBITES stop moving and stare at KIRSTY. Any advances they were making on KIRSTY or TIFFANY stop as the same dim, distant, recollection begins to stir within them. \nSuddenly, the door bursts open. MALAHIDE is there, still floating, his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and insane joy. \nMALAHIDE Tiffany. Come. \nHe turns his palms downwards, mirroring his gesture in the hall of mirrors. \nTIFFANY lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head. \nOne of the snake-like limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies towards TIFFANY's face. Before anybody can react, its scalpel tip has sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair. \nMALAHIDE Tiffany. Come. \nKIRSTY throws her arms around the cowering TIFFANY and snarls at her tormentor. \nKIRSTY Leave her alone, you asshole! \nMALAHIDE makes no reply, but suddenly several more limbs fly towards the GIRLS and begin to weave in front of KIRSTY's face like snakes awaiting their moment. \nAt this stage, the camera CUTS TO the watching PINHEAD. He lets the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor. \nMALAHIDE looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes meet PINHEAD'S. He turns more fully to face PINHEAD and the other CENOBITES who are now standing with their leader, and a strange smile crosses his face \nMALAHIDE Oh,good. A fight. \nSuddenly, the air is full of flying chains. MALAHIDE is hooked everywhere. It is like a high-speed version of FRANK's final re- capture in HELLRAISER. The chains start tugging almost instantly. \nIs MALAHIDE about to be ripped apart? \nWith contemptuous, dismissive speed, the limbs that ooze from MALAHIDE's palms have sliced the chains to pieces and, almost before we have time to realise that, three of them have lengthened, thickened, and hardened and have skewered the FEMALE CENOBITE, CHATTERER II, and BUTTERBALL to the walls. \nThe three limbs detatch themselves from MALAHIDE. The three CENOBITES are all well above the floor, pinned and twitching like the rats in FRANK's attic. \nAs they die, they suddenly revert; there are three human corpses on the walls of the room. A woman, a fat man, and a little boy. \nMALAHIDE smiles. Be looks at PINHEAD again and advances. Suddenly a heavy torture pillar smashes into him, knocking him slightly off-balance. \nPINHEAD is backing across the room, weaving pillars in front of him as he moves. MALAHIDE moves forward, knocking them out of the way. As each pillar is knocked aside, PINHEAD's face is more and more human. Finally, when the face we see is nearly that of the ENGLISH OFFICER from the opening, he turns his head slightly away from the advancing MALAHIDE and finds KIRSTY's eyes. A look passes between them. Understanding? Gratitude? Friendship? \nKIRSTY grabs TIFFANY and, dragging her to her feet, pulls her further back down the catwalk as MALAHIDE floats to a landing between them and the BOX. \nMALAHIDE Ah, girls. And how are we feeling today? \nThe blades on the end of his limbs twitch eagerly. \nMALAHIDE You have your whole lives behind you now. \nThe limbs fly forward. KIRSTY screams and both girls run up the catwalk. \nAbout halfway back up, however, TIFFANY stops, turns around, and begins to walk back. KIRSTY calls out. \nKIRSTY Tiffany! No! \nThe camera stays with TIFFANY as she makes her way back. KIRSTY's voice stays on the soundtrack for a time, imploring her friend to turn back and then simply stops. This should be abrupt enough to make the audience notice but smooth enough to avoid their attention leaving TIFFANY. \nMALAHIDE waits, happy to see a patient so keen on the knife. \nVery slowly, TIFFANY moves forward, inch by slow inch. This is something she HAS to do; the expression on her face is not determination but terror. And MALAHIDE is very happy to encourage this. \nMALAHIDE Surgery is open, Tiffany. What was today's agenda? \nHis scalpels flick in the air, making small slicing motions. \nMALAHIDE Ah, yes. Evisceration. \nStill TIFFANY comes forward, closer and closer until she is surely close enough to be grabbed. \nSuddenly, she is grabbed. But from behind, and by a human hand. TIFFANY gasps, and turns to see who has seized her. She screams. It is JULIA. \nThe limbs retract into MALAHIDE's palms. He smiles. \nJULIA Doctor. I've missed you. \nJULIA, having presumably just replaced her skin, is not quite as perfect as before; there are bloody lines like scars beneath her ears and chin as if the skin required some adjustment before being put on. \nJULIA moves forward, her left arm still holding TIFFANY, her smile returning MALAHIDE'S. \nMALAHIDE I knew you'd come back. \nJULIA I'm a girl who keeps her promises. \nJULIA is right next to MALAHIDE now. Smoothly, she releases her grip on TIFFANY and embraces MALAHIDE sensuously. He returns the embrace. They kiss. \nUnseen, TIFFANY moves to the edge of the catwalk and picks up the BOX. Her fingers move over it, finding its solution. Suddenly, LEVIATHAN's breath becomes a roar of anger and fear. \nMALAHIDE breaks away from his kiss, his face a mixture of confusion and rage. JULIA plants both hands in the middle of his chest and pushes. He falls over the lip of the catwalk but, almost before he drops from sight, he is suddenly pulled backwards through the air, screaming, as LEVIATHAN's limb retracts. JULIA jumps back. shouting. \nJULIA Do it, Tiffany! Do it! \nTIFFANY's fingers fly over the BOX and suddenly we see what is happening. The mountain-like LEVIATHAN is following the movements of the small replica in TIFFANY's hands. As TIFFANY inverts the new configuration back towards a closed BOX, LEVIATHAN too is being twisted and turned. Being closed. \nThe whole centre of Hell shakes as if suffering a mild earthquake. JULIA and TIFFANY almost lose their footing, but TIFFANY continues working. She is nearly, there. LEVIATHAN is halfway between its white diamond, majesty and a huge closed BOX. \nTIFFANY takes her hands from the BOX. It is done. The larger BOX operates a few seconds behind it's control, so that we can inter- cut the final sliding and creaking into position with the following human drama; \nAs LEVIATHAN makes its final closing, the mild tremors of before become larger. Hell shakes violently and this time TIFFANY does lose her footing. She looks set to tumble into the vast abyss to the side of the catwalk but just manages to catch hold of the edge with one hand. The small BOX flies from her hand and hurtles down into the miles of blackness below. TIFFANY dangles over the edge, her feet kicking wildly for a foothold that doesn't exist. \nSuddenly, a hand extends to her. She looks up. It is JULIA. For a second, nothing happens. \nJULIA Trust me. \nTIFFANY lifts one hand off the edge and grabs at JULIA's proffered wrist. \nJULIA begins to pull up and for a moment it seems the crisis is over. Then a terrible and familiar ripping noise is heard: The skin of the arm that TIFFANY clings to begins to rip free at the shoulder. Gradually, like a shirt's threads unraveling, it comes off. TIFFANY's weight pulls it clear like a very long and very tasteless evening glove and it seems she will finally make the long drop. At the final second, as the arm-skin comes off, the entire skin flies from the body and falls with its arm into the abyss. TIFFANY screams. She is going to die. \nBut suddenly the two arms that have Just lost their skin fly out again and catch her fingers. TIFFANY is hauled over the edge and staggers to her feet, staring into the-bloodied face of KIRSTY, who had donned JULIA's skin to help her friend. \nThe two girls share a quick and joyous embrace and then run rapidly up the catwalk. The camera stays with LEVIATHAN. \nThe rumbling stops. And the mountainous BOX creaks into its final, sealed position. \n", "test1_input": "MALAHIDE Sorry.  Must get that door fixed.  Detective Ronson? \nMALAHIDE holds his hand out, as RONSON nods in response. \nMALAHIDE I am Doctor Malahide. \nThe man shake hands. MALAHIDE gestures behind him. \nMALAHIDE My assistant, Kyle Macrae.  And this must be Kirsty? \nMALAHIDE speaks quickly, as if to get the formalities out of the way.  As he says her name, he smiles benignly at KIRSTY who, still distraught from her memories and shocked at the slamming of the door, simply stares at him. \nMALAHIDE turns his attention back to RONSON, drawing him away and speaking to him in a lower voice. \nMeanwhile, KYLE walks over to KIRSTY and smiles at her - long enough to embarrass her into smiling back. \nMALAHIDE I've read the boy's statement. Quite the adventure they believe they had. I'd like to talk to her alone. Do you think ... ? \nRONSON looks over his shoulder at KIRSTY.  He then looks carefully at MALAHIDE and then nods slowly. \nRONSON Mmmm.  O.K.  Frankly, I think she's more your territory than mine.  Shame. \nRONSON looks back at KIRSTY. \nRONSON Kirsty.  Doctor Malahide's going to look after you now.  Maybe we could talk some more tomorrow. \nKIRSTY nods vaguely and then, just as RONSON reaches the door, calls out to him. \nKIRSTY Wait!  The mattress.  You've got to destroy it.  She DIED on it, you see.  The mattress.  It's haunted now.  She can come back... like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK. \nRONSON smiles helplessly at her, then glances at MALAHIDE with a \"you see what I mean\" expression, and leaves the room. \nKIRSTY (to herself) The mattress ... \nMALAHIDE stares at her briefly, with a strange expression on his face and then abruptly follows RONSON through the door. \nKIRSTY is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior, but KYLE stares incredulously as MALAHIDE leaves the room. \nKYLE Uh...excuse me a moment. \nHe follows to the door and stands in the doorway, looking down the corridor. \n15    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR    NIGHT \nRONSON stands before a set of double-doors, talking to a UNIFORMED OFFICER. \nMALAHIDE comes into view, walking swiftly, and instantly talks over their conversation. \nMALAHIDE Detective. I'll be able to help this girl. But I need your assistance ... \n16    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT \nLooking back at the corridor, we see the door to KIRSTY'S room ajar, and KYLE standing by it looking down. \n17    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT  (KYLE' P.O.V) \nA LONG SHOT of MALAHIDE and RONSON.  KYLE, and we, are too far away to hear what is said, but MALAHIDE in nodding and gesturing emphatically, as if persuading RONSON of something. \n18   INT   HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT \nKYLE returns into the room and closes the door. His expression is puzzled, troubled. Then he remembers there is a patient here and he smiles. KYLE So...You're Kirsty, huh? \nKIRSTY You a doctor, too? \nKYLE smiles again. \nKYLE Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle Macrae. Call me Kyle. \nKIRSTY draws a deep breath, temporarily calmed. She even manages a smile. \nKIRSTY Hi, Kyle. \n", "test1_true": "MALAHIDE Now, Kirsty... \nKIRSTY looks at him warily. \nKIRSTY The cop. He didn't believe me. \nMALAHIDE I suspect not. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong, does it? \nKIRSTY Do you believe me? \nMALAHIDE offers a re-assuring laugh. \nMALAHIDE Well, I don't know yet. However, you're not lying. YOU believe this is the truth. \nKIRSTY It IS the truth. \nSuddenly, the door opens again. An INTERN is standing there. For the briefest of moments, MALAHIDE looks furious and then, catching himself, assumes his calm demeanor. \nMALAHIDE Well? \nINTERN Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's Tiffany. She's escaped ... again. \nMALAHIDE sighs. \nMALAHIDE Very Well. \nHe looks down at KIRSTY. \nKIRSTY I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will come back with something to help you sleep. We shall speak tomorrow. \nMALAHIDE and KYLE follow the intern from the room, KYLE giving a last friendly smile as the door closes behind them. \n19   EXT.   CARNIVAL   NIGHT \nWe are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival. On either side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked doors and tarpaulin-draped entrances deny. A light rain is falling. \nA huge wooden cut-out of a grinning clown dominates one stall while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole place; LOTS 'O' FUN. \nAnother has a banner proclaiming FREAK SHOW, with the subheading YOU'LL GASP AT THE GEEK! \nOn the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height while beyond them impossibly huge oil-drums squat against the moon-bright but cloudy sky. \nInto shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl, TIFFANY. \nTIFFANY is a girl in her early teens but looks younger then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over- delicate features. \nFor the last months, TIFFANY has been finding ways out of the institute and making her way here, where she has one special obsession, which we will soon see. \nFollowing her into shot, but many yards behind, come two INTERNS from the Institute. They contrast each other almost comically, one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner. They're not quite the Stan and Ollie of the medical world but with some serious rehearsal they could get there. \n1st INTERN Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it. \nEven as the first INTERN says this, we see TIFFANY make a sharp left turn into a stall entrance. \n20   EXT.   HALL OF MIRRORS   ENTRANCE   NIGHT \nA front view of the stall into which TIFFANY has run. The large sign above it proclaims 'HALL OF MIRRORS' and a smaller sign perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the entrance says 'YOU'LL BE AMAZED'. \nThe two INTERNS enter at a run. \n21   INT.   HALL OF MIRRORS    NIGHT \nThere follows a hopelessly one-sided pursuit through the mirror maze as TIFFANY effortlessly eludes the two INTERNS. \nThere are three major facets to this sequence; 1) Comic relief - as the two interns make fools of themselves. There could even be a room of distorting mirrors where the thin INTERN becomes fat and the fat one thin. 2) TIFFANY'S ease and expertise with patterns and puzzles. 3) Confusion of the audience's sense of the real and the unreal. \nThis goes on long enough for us to realise the 1ST INTERN was right to worry, how long TIFFANY could elude them. Then, jarringly, as the screen is full of reflected TIFFANYS there suddenly appears amongst them a single image of MALAHIDE. \nEverything stops. \nThe image of MALAHIDE (and we shouldn't he sure yet if we're looking at a reflection or the real man) puts its hands out, palms up. \n", "test1_id": 615, "test2_input": "He strokes at her back gently and their bodies relax. \nJULIA (almost coyly) Now all we need is a skin. \n60   INT.   BATHROOM KYLE'S APARTMENT   DAY \nCLOSE UP on shower jets hitting KIRSTY's face and naked shoulders. \nHer eyes are closed, but she smiles in pleasure as the water refreshes her. \nA knocking is heard. KIRSTY moves her head out of the water's path and shouts. \nKIRSTY Yeah? \n61   INT.   KYLE'S APARTMENT   DAY \nIt is basically a studio apartment - everything except the bathroom facilities is in the one room. There is a sofa - with sheets and blankets on it - a bed, a dining/all-purpose table with two chairs, shelves full of records and books, and a small working desk against one of the walls. The desk is weighed down by text books and notes and, tacked to the wall above it, are medical prints, some of the brain and central nervous system, but also two fullcoloured anatomical prints - one of a man and one of a woman. They could almost be portraits of JULIA and FRANK. \nKYLE, fully dressed, is standing by the bathroom door, his hand still in a knocking position. \nKYLE You O.K.? \nSilence. \nKYLE Kirsty? You 0. K.? \nThe bathroom door opens and KIRSTY Comes into the main room, dressed in a toweling robe that is clearly a 'hers' not a 'his'. \nShe crosses the room to a mirror, rubbing at her wet hair with a towel. \nKIRSTY No bad dreams. \nKYLE So you slept O.K.? \nKIRSTY gestures at the sofa. \nKIRSTY As much as that bed of nails allowed. \nKYLE glances meaningfully at the bed as he replies. \nKYLE Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on... \nKIRSTY Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh? \nKYLE grins. \nKYLE Like the robe? \nKIRSTY returns the smile via the mirror. \nKYLE crosses the room to sit at his dining table. Empty coffee cups, the remnants of a loaf and some cheese suggests their breakfast was simple and finished some time ago. \nKIRSTY gathers her clothes from by the sofa and moves back into the bathroom to dress. \nKYLE waits a few moments and then speaks. \nKYLE I think I need to talk. About what I saw. \nKIRSTY emerges, fully dressed, her hair still damp. \nKIRSTY You thought I was crazy, didn't you? \nKYLE spreads his hands wide. \nKYLE Jesus, yes! What do you expect. I mean, God, I still do! It's just that now I'm crazy too. \nHe grins wryly. KIRSTY moves to the sofa and sits down. \nKIRSTY And you're sure it was a woman? \nKYLE God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know. \n", "test2_true": "KIRSTY Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway. \nKYLE Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me. \nFor a moment, they laugh together but then stop.  KIRSTY stares downward and then suddenly bursts into tears. \nKIRSTY What can I do? How can I save him? \nKYLE joins her on the sofa. He offers an arm but she shakes it off. \nKIRSTY The box. I need the box. \nKYLE The box? Like in your story? Like in his house? \nKIRSTY's tears suddenly stop. She looks at KYLE. \nKIRSTY (sharply) What? \nKYLE The Boxes. In the House. I told you. \nKIRSTY What do you mean? \nKYLE The boxes! I TOLD you. \nKIRSTY You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got... \nKYLE Yeah. The things you were talking about. \nKIRSTY heads instantly for KYLE'S door. \nKIRSTY I'm going. \nKYLE runs across the room and puts a restraining hand on his door. \nKYLE Wait a minute. What do you mean, 'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE? \nKIRSTY nods and pulls at the door handle. \nKIRSTY Get out of the way. \nKYLE Are you crazy? \nKIRSTY I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way! \nKYLE WHY? \nKIRSTY (shouting) Because I'm going to get my father! \nTears start to her eyes and she stares at KYLE defiantly. Then she repeats, more softly; \nKIRSTY I'm going to get my father. \nThere is a two-second silence between them as they stare at each other. \nFinally, Kyle backs away from the door, raising a finger. \nKYLE Two seconds. Just two seconds. Don't move. \nHe rushes across the room, grabs a jacket, and moves back to the door. \nKYLE O.K. Let's go. \nKIRSTY Kyle, you don't have... \nKYLE I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.? \nKIRSTY stares at him, her face at first blank then suffused with emotion. She leans across and plants a chaste kiss on his lips then pulls back. There is a beat while they simply stare at each other and suddenly they are tight in each other's arms, kissing fervently. But the kiss is fuelled, not by passion, but by fear and their mutual need for human solace in the face of the unknown. \nAs the kiss continues, the camera pulls back from them. \n62   INT.   THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY \n", "test2_id": 616, "test3_input": "CLOSE UP as JULIA (still bandaged) and MALAHIDE come together for a kiss. They part and, as JULIA moves across the room, the camera begins a long TRACK around the room. \nFirst, it reaches a naked GIRL. As catatonic as TIFFANY, she says nothing but her eyes betray her terror. Her hands are tied above her. \nJULIA moves in towards the girl, her eyes glittering with an alien hunger beneath their gauze mask. As she nears the girl, the TRACK passes them and moves through the room. \nMALAHIDE has done his mistress proud. It had been an empty upstairs room (no furniture, bare floorboards) but now it resembles a nightmarish cross between a butcher's shop and a bordello. \nThe camera slowly reveals, as it TRACKS, that there are seven more people in the room. Seven dead people. Dried-out husks. \nThe TRACKING is now completing its circle around the room. After the corpses, we return to JULIA and the GIRL - but the GIRL too is now a hollow, dried-out shell. \nJULIA moves back into the centre of the room and stands still. \nMALAHIDE crosses the room to her quickly, drawing a wicked- looking kitchen knife from his pocket as he does so. He reaches JULIA and raises the knife to her face. \nWith one swift, precise movement, he slices the bandages across the side of her face. JULIA raises her hand and pulls the mask away. \nThe camera sweeps in toward her as she does this until her face is in CLOSE UP as the bandage-mask is pulled aside. \nHer face is perfect. \n63   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY \nMALAHIDE emerges from his front door. He is still in his black suit and looks every inch the respectable professional. He looks neither left nor right but moves straight off, a busy man with things to do. \nA few seconds after he has gone off-camera, KYLE and KIRSTY emerge from around the corner of the house. \nKYLE gestures to KIRSTY to follow him and leads her around to the window he broke in through on the previous night. \n64   INT. OBSESSION ROOM   DAY \nThe room is much as we saw it last. \nThe window slides up and KYLE pulls himself into the room. He looks around it carefully. Sure that the monster he saw the previous night is no longer in the room, he helps KIRSTY in through the window. \nKIRSTY's eyes go at once to the three LAMENT CONFIGURATIONS in the glass cases. She crosses the room eagerly. \nKYLE rushes after her and stops her opening one of the cases. \nKYLE Wait! The .. thing ... I want to be sure it's not here. \nKIRSTY nods and KYLE leaves the room. \n65   INT.   STAIRS/LANDING MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY \nKYLE advances carefully, and slowly, from the stairs onto the landing. He looks about him at every step he takes. \nAhead of him on the landing is a door, which is very slightly ajar. \nHe advances gingerly down the landing to the door. \nWhen he reaches it, he pauses. We see his face working as he ponders his choices -should he push it open inch by slow inch, or slam it inwards quickly? \nVery slowly he moves his hand towards the door. The camera matches his movement, moving in on his hand, the door, and the space between. \nHis fingertips are less than an inch from touching the door when another hand shoots into view and grabs his wrist. \nJULIA has crept up beside him on the landing while all his attention was on the door. \nKYLE swings round in horror, his mouth opening to scream when he sees that JULIA has her other hand to her mouth, her finger at her lips in a silencing gesture. \nThere is of course, nothing for him to recognize from the monstrous vision of the previous night. JULIA's arms, chest, and face are completely re-skinned now. All KYLE sees is a beautiful stranger in a white dress. \nJULIA Sssh. I think it's still here. \nKYLE What? The...The thing? \nJULIA nods. \nJULIA Yes. I had to stop you going in there because I knew you'd cry out. Any normal person would. It ...It's just TERRIBLE. \n", "test3_true": "JULIA No. Not now. \nKYLE swallows, nods, and gently, pushes the door open. He walks into the room. \n66   INT.   THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY \nThe camera follows KYLE into the room. He reaches the middle before horror and disgust stop him. \nHe hears a click behind him and turns to see JULIA has come into the room and closes the door behind her. She looks at KYLE. \nJULIA Was I right? Is it terrible? \nKYLE stares all around him. All eight victims have been sucked dry. He is surrounded by dead husks. \nHis face is ghastly. He looks like he is about to faint. He nods. His voice is a cracked whisper. \nKYLE Yes. Yes, it's terrible. \nJULIA crosses the room rapidly towards him. Her face is a picture of concern. \nJULIA Oh. You look awful.  You poor boy. Come here... \nAs she speaks, JULIA's arms are opening out to him. KYLE sees the comfort offered and advances towards her, too. \nAs they come together, the camera moves around them and we see, for the first time, that JULIA is still incomplete; Her entire back is still glistening raw flesh, the naked bones of the spine still clearly visible. \nTheir arms go around each other just as JULIA completes her speech; \nJULIA ...Come to Mother ... \nAs KYLE's hands touch the sticky, mucoid meat of her shoulders, it is instantly clear to him what has happened. For a moment he freezes in terror. \nHis arms fly from her and he throws his head back. But JULIA is very strong now and her grip does not relax. \nKyle's expression is a mixture of terror and confusion as he stares into the beautiful face of the monster. \nJULIA smiles at him, a hungry, aroused smile. \nJULIA What's your name? \nKYLE can hardly speak for fear. \nKYLE Kyle... \nJULIA I'm JULIA. \nShe raised one hand from his back to the back of his head and presses his face to hers. \nJULIA plays it exactly as a sensual, passionate kiss, her mouth wide open, her head moving rhythmically and sinuously. \nKYLE's reaction is somewhat different; his arms flail in panic (though only from the elbow - JULIA'S grip prevents anything more) and his head makes jerking, backward movements against her pressing hand. \nThe camera moves around the embracing couple until it is behind JULIA. \nThe back of her gown, as we know, is extremely low. As the kiss continues, we see skin creeping above the line of the gown at the base of her spine and gradually flowing up her back until finally it meets and blends perfectly with ragged and raw edges of the skin at her neck and shoulders. JULIA is complete again. \nWhile this process has been going on, KYLE has been dying slowly and horribly in her arms, his lifeforce being sucked into her through their open mouths. His body, by the time her back is completely formed, is shrunken, hollow, and dried up. \nJULIA takes her arms from around the corpse of KYLE and steps back, allowing the husk to fall to the floor. \nJULIA licks her lips and looks down, not without affection, at the dead KYLE. She smiles. \nJULIA Thank you, Kyle. \n67   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY \nKIRSTY has found the black ring-binder and laid it on the writing table. \nShe has separated one of the photographs from the others and laid it out on the table beside the binder. It is the ENGLISH OFFICER from the opening sequence. KIRSTY has obviously recognized something familiar in it but she can't quite grasp it completely. \nShe is still puzzling over it when she suddenly realises that several minutes have elapsed since KYLE left her there. Her head straightens up and her puzzled look is replaced by a slightly worried one. \n", "test3_id": 617}

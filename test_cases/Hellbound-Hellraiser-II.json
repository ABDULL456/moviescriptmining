{"test1_input": "CORTEZ Oh. shit... \n9   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY \nRONSON is sitting back in the chair, looking at the now slightly calmer KIRSTY. \nRONSON We got two missing people and a house full of corpses. \nHe holds out his hand towards KIRSTY in a theatrical manner. \nRONSON Talk to me. \nKIRSTY swings her legs off the bad, but remains sitting on it, her feet on the floor. She doesn't look directly at RONSON but begins to take in the (few) details of the room for the first time. \nKIRSTY I thought Steve had talked to you? \nRONSON Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But - do me a favor? - none of this DEMONS crap. \nKIRSTY closes her eyes, almost wincing, as memory comes. \nKIRSTY opens her eyes. Consciously, she slows the rhythm of the dialogue down. \nKIRSTY He talked about Demons, huh? \nRONSON Yeah. \nKIRSTY turns her head to look directly at RONSON. \nKIRSTY It's true. All of it. It's all true. \nRONSON stares at her, impressed by her conviction and intensity. There is a second of shared silence. \nSuddenly, a shocking ELECTRONIC CRACKLE shatters the mood. RONSON starts, then realises it is the radio at his belt. He snatches it up and speaks into it. \nRONSON Ronson. \n10    INT   BEDROOM  LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT \nAnother OFFICER, KUCICH, is standing, radio in hand, by the blood-stained mattress. CORTEZ stands beside him, gun now safely re-holstered. \nKUCICH Kucich here,sir.  We just found another one, though it suffered a little... \nKUCICH looks at CORTEZ, who looks embarrassed. \nKUCICH ...er, accidental damage in discovery. Anyway, just about the only portable evidence we've got here - apart from human remains - is the mattress. Looks like someone was messed up real bad on it. \n11    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKUCICH (off-camera) Can we send it downtown? \nRONSON throws KIRSTY a look of exasperation with his colleague. The camera stays on KIRSTY's face as RONSON speaks. \nRONSON What the hell are you asking me for?  Tag it.  Move it. \nKIRSTY (to herself) The mattress... The mattress... JULIA. \nWithout waiting for a reply, RONSON switches the radio off and clips it back to his belt. \n12    INT   BEDROOM   55 STREET   NIGHT We are looking at the mattress. KUCICH has left the room. \nCORTEZ draws a pad from his packet. The pad is stapled, and the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property. In the act of tearing a label from the pad, CORTEZ catches his thumb on the staple. \nOFFICER Shit! \nThe label is adhesive-backed. CORTEZ licks it and presses it on the mattress. He writes on it - 55L/E1.  As he stands up from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on the mattress. (It is important that we see it is only a single drop - and nothing like the amount LARRY spilled on the floorboards.) \nCORTEZ leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him move the mattress.  We move in to see the drop of blood disappear very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in. \nAs this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest RUMBLE. \n13    INT   OPERATING ROOM   NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "Sitting upright in the centre of the room is a FEMALE PATIENT. She is awake and staring out at the camera.  Twin probes/clamps are in each of her ears to hold her in place.  Her head is shaved and the skin on the back of her head has been cut open and peeled apart.  The flaps of the skin are held away from the area being worked on by four clamps. (we never actually see round to the exposed brain itself) \nImmediately behind her, and probing with professional skill and coolness into her exposed brain, is DOCTOR MALAHIDE.  He is in his late forties and looks like all the great doctors look - rational, civilized, competent, and powerful.  There is an intensity in his eyes and the lines  of his face though that suggests something more than normal. \nThe room has several attentive listeners and observers, but the one nearest to MALAHIDE is his personal student/assistant KYLE MACRAE, young, conventionally good-looking, with an open, friendly, face. \nMALAHIDE is holding forth on the secrets of his trade, several times looking away from his patient while still working on her, to make sure his audience understand his points. \nMALAHIDE We can bring them back properly more often than scientific orthodoxy dictates, ladies and gentlemen.  And the knife, far from the enemy of of analysis, is often its greatest ally in solving the puzzles of psychosis. Analysis isolates and massages. Surgery pinpoints and corrects. ... though you've got to know what you're doing, of course... \nPolite laughter from several students. \nMALAHIDE Some things are obvious. Here, for example, ... \nHe prods in at a specific area. \nMALAHIDE ...are the optical motor nerve control centers. \nThe PATIENT begins to blink in time with MALAHIDE'S prodding. The affect is half-comical, half-distressing.  Perhaps MALAHIDE carries it on just that half-second too long for innocent demonstration.  But the students give impressed murmurs anyway. \nMALAHIDE Now. This case. A deeply-buried psychosis severe enough to produce frighteningly frequent hysteria and aggression. Incurable. Say others. Not so. Analysis isolates. The knife exposes. Medication controls. \nAs he speaks, MALAHIDE injects a syringe directly into the PATIENT's brain. Her face spasms momentarily. \nMALAHIDE stands back slightly. His face is serene, calm, and confident. \nHe takes a small, motorised drill and sets to work on the brain. \nMALAHIDE And then, ladies and gentlemen, we REBUILD. With all the care and knowledge that our years of training have given us ... \nHe looks around at them all, smiling slightly. \nMALAHIDE \n... WE BRING THEM BACK. \nThe students murmur their approval. Perhaps they even applaud. MALAHIDE acknowledges their reaction with a modest nod. \nSuddenly, an intercom on the wall cuts in. \nINTERCOM Dr. Malahide, the new arrival is awake, and appears very distressed. \nMALAHIDE steps back briskly and begins to peel his cloves off. He nods at a nearby student. \nMALAHIDE My part in this is over.  You may tidy up for me.  Kyle, you come with me. \nMALAHIDE and KYLE leave the room. \n14    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY has her hands over her face and is shaking.  RONSON stands and crosses to her.  He takes her hand from her face and calms her. \nRONSON Easy, easy.  Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now. \nKIRSTY I saw it...him.  But I got away. And I took the box.  And I solved it.  And they came. \nRONSON Who? \nKIRSTY The Cenobites. \nShe stares directly at RONSON, daring him to disbelieve. \nKIRSTY The Demons. \nRONSON stares back, perhaps a glimmer of belief in his eyes. \nOn the soundtrack, the sudden and shocking sound of a door being slammed open and hitting the wall. \nKIRSTY screams. Even RONSON is startled. \nIn the doorway are DOCTOR MALAHIDE and KYLE.  MALAHIDE advances into the room, smiling apologetically as he does so. \n", "test1_id": 615, "test2_input": "MALAHIDE Sorry.  Must get that door fixed.  Detective Ronson? \nMALAHIDE holds his hand out, as RONSON nods in response. \nMALAHIDE I am Doctor Malahide. \nThe man shake hands. MALAHIDE gestures behind him. \nMALAHIDE My assistant, Kyle Macrae.  And this must be Kirsty? \nMALAHIDE speaks quickly, as if to get the formalities out of the way.  As he says her name, he smiles benignly at KIRSTY who, still distraught from her memories and shocked at the slamming of the door, simply stares at him. \nMALAHIDE turns his attention back to RONSON, drawing him away and speaking to him in a lower voice. \nMeanwhile, KYLE walks over to KIRSTY and smiles at her - long enough to embarrass her into smiling back. \nMALAHIDE I've read the boy's statement. Quite the adventure they believe they had. I'd like to talk to her alone. Do you think ... ? \nRONSON looks over his shoulder at KIRSTY.  He then looks carefully at MALAHIDE and then nods slowly. \nRONSON Mmmm.  O.K.  Frankly, I think she's more your territory than mine.  Shame. \nRONSON looks back at KIRSTY. \nRONSON Kirsty.  Doctor Malahide's going to look after you now.  Maybe we could talk some more tomorrow. \nKIRSTY nods vaguely and then, just as RONSON reaches the door, calls out to him. \nKIRSTY Wait!  The mattress.  You've got to destroy it.  She DIED on it, you see.  The mattress.  It's haunted now.  She can come back... like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK. \nRONSON smiles helplessly at her, then glances at MALAHIDE with a \"you see what I mean\" expression, and leaves the room. \nKIRSTY (to herself) The mattress ... \nMALAHIDE stares at her briefly, with a strange expression on his face and then abruptly follows RONSON through the door. \nKIRSTY is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior, but KYLE stares incredulously as MALAHIDE leaves the room. \nKYLE Uh...excuse me a moment. \nHe follows to the door and stands in the doorway, looking down the corridor. \n15    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR    NIGHT \nRONSON stands before a set of double-doors, talking to a UNIFORMED OFFICER. \nMALAHIDE comes into view, walking swiftly, and instantly talks over their conversation. \nMALAHIDE Detective. I'll be able to help this girl. But I need your assistance ... \n16    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT \nLooking back at the corridor, we see the door to KIRSTY'S room ajar, and KYLE standing by it looking down. \n17    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT  (KYLE' P.O.V) \nA LONG SHOT of MALAHIDE and RONSON.  KYLE, and we, are too far away to hear what is said, but MALAHIDE in nodding and gesturing emphatically, as if persuading RONSON of something. \n18   INT   HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT \nKYLE returns into the room and closes the door. His expression is puzzled, troubled. Then he remembers there is a patient here and he smiles. KYLE So...You're Kirsty, huh? \nKIRSTY You a doctor, too? \nKYLE smiles again. \nKYLE Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle Macrae. Call me Kyle. \nKIRSTY draws a deep breath, temporarily calmed. She even manages a smile. \nKIRSTY Hi, Kyle. \n", "test2_true": "MALAHIDE Now, Kirsty... \nKIRSTY looks at him warily. \nKIRSTY The cop. He didn't believe me. \nMALAHIDE I suspect not. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong, does it? \nKIRSTY Do you believe me? \nMALAHIDE offers a re-assuring laugh. \nMALAHIDE Well, I don't know yet. However, you're not lying. YOU believe this is the truth. \nKIRSTY It IS the truth. \nSuddenly, the door opens again. An INTERN is standing there. For the briefest of moments, MALAHIDE looks furious and then, catching himself, assumes his calm demeanor. \nMALAHIDE Well? \nINTERN Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's Tiffany. She's escaped ... again. \nMALAHIDE sighs. \nMALAHIDE Very Well. \nHe looks down at KIRSTY. \nKIRSTY I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will come back with something to help you sleep. We shall speak tomorrow. \nMALAHIDE and KYLE follow the intern from the room, KYLE giving a last friendly smile as the door closes behind them. \n19   EXT.   CARNIVAL   NIGHT \nWe are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival. On either side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked doors and tarpaulin-draped entrances deny. A light rain is falling. \nA huge wooden cut-out of a grinning clown dominates one stall while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole place; LOTS 'O' FUN. \nAnother has a banner proclaiming FREAK SHOW, with the subheading YOU'LL GASP AT THE GEEK! \nOn the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height while beyond them impossibly huge oil-drums squat against the moon-bright but cloudy sky. \nInto shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl, TIFFANY. \nTIFFANY is a girl in her early teens but looks younger then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over- delicate features. \nFor the last months, TIFFANY has been finding ways out of the institute and making her way here, where she has one special obsession, which we will soon see. \nFollowing her into shot, but many yards behind, come two INTERNS from the Institute. They contrast each other almost comically, one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner. They're not quite the Stan and Ollie of the medical world but with some serious rehearsal they could get there. \n1st INTERN Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it. \nEven as the first INTERN says this, we see TIFFANY make a sharp left turn into a stall entrance. \n20   EXT.   HALL OF MIRRORS   ENTRANCE   NIGHT \nA front view of the stall into which TIFFANY has run. The large sign above it proclaims 'HALL OF MIRRORS' and a smaller sign perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the entrance says 'YOU'LL BE AMAZED'. \nThe two INTERNS enter at a run. \n21   INT.   HALL OF MIRRORS    NIGHT \nThere follows a hopelessly one-sided pursuit through the mirror maze as TIFFANY effortlessly eludes the two INTERNS. \nThere are three major facets to this sequence; 1) Comic relief - as the two interns make fools of themselves. There could even be a room of distorting mirrors where the thin INTERN becomes fat and the fat one thin. 2) TIFFANY'S ease and expertise with patterns and puzzles. 3) Confusion of the audience's sense of the real and the unreal. \nThis goes on long enough for us to realise the 1ST INTERN was right to worry, how long TIFFANY could elude them. Then, jarringly, as the screen is full of reflected TIFFANYS there suddenly appears amongst them a single image of MALAHIDE. \nEverything stops. \nThe image of MALAHIDE (and we shouldn't he sure yet if we're looking at a reflection or the real man) puts its hands out, palms up. \n", "test2_id": 616, "test3_input": "The corridors that MALAHIDE sees are different to KIRSTY'S; they are grotto-like, dotted with stalactites and stalagmites and not immediately unattractive. The walls contain portals of a glass- like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lights of different colors and MALAHIDE peers eagerly into several of these. \nIn one, the view is like an aquarium. An alien fish swims past his eyes. Its body resembles a human brain but it has pincer-like claws. MALAHIDE presses his hand against the glass as the thing comes nearer. Suddenly, from within its body, the thing produces a perfect human forearm and hand and meets MALAHIDE's hand on the other side of the glass. \nMALAHIDE starts slightly but then keeps his hand there. He is turning his head to call JULIA's attention to this marvel when the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat against the glass with tremendous force. \nMALAHIDE jumps back sharply, but the thing shatters the glass and leaps out at him. He gasps and runs up the corridor, the thing hopping after him on its one hand. \nAs they pass JULIA, she tuts with the slightly exasperated but indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher. She steps on the thing, squashing it flat. It emits a horrible death-cry. \nJULIA Do be careful. \n83   INT.   HELL'S SITTING ROOM   DAY \nWhite light fills the screen and KIRSTY steps through it into view. Instantly the White light contracts and disappears. \nKIRSTY finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting room. \nThe room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summer's day. The birdsong KIRSTY heard earlier continues but is, if anything, even more melodic, even more sweet. \nThe room is vaguely Edwardian in its decor; real wood furnishings and decorative porcelain ornaments. There is a large wooden dresser, on top of which are many photographs in old-fashioned brass frames. \nDespite herself, KIRSTY cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure at the appearance of the room. \nShe touches some of the furniture, as if to assure herself it is real. \nShe approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large framed photographs. She gasps in pleasure. \nWe see the photograph. It is a family group and looks to be have been taken ten to twenty years ago. It is of a man, a woman, and a young girl of four or five. \nThe man is clearly LARRY, albeit a younger version, and the little girl has dark, thick, slightly curly hair - just like KIRSTY'S. The woman is beautiful and has similar hair to her daughter. \nKIRSTY's eyes prick with tears - but they are clearly tears of happy memories. She smiles. \nKIRSTY Mommy... \nKIRSTY puts down the photograph of her family and looks around the room again. A troubled look crosses her face. \nDespite the aparent Summer light in the room, KIRSTY suddenly realises what it is that is odd. \nShe looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face. There are no windows in the room. And no door. \nAt this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes apparent. It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the total effect is simply less sweet than it was. \nKIRSTY looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a look of concern. \nThe photograph has changed. It is now a wedding photo. The wedding of LARRY and JULIA. \nSuddenly the photograph begins to bleed. Blood pours from the paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass-so that it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the picture showing.  The blood begins to escape out of the frame, trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping onto KIRSTY's fingers. \nWith a cry of horror, KIRSTY drops the frame. It lands on the floor and the glass shatters. The blood continues to flow. In fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly fountains out, spreading across the floor. \nKIRSTY steps back and glances at the dresser. Blood is flowing from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the floor. \nBy now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much predominant and, as KIRSTY sweeps all the frames off the dresser and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking. \nKIRSTY throws her hands to her ears. \nKIRSTY Nooooo! \nShe rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her fists. \nThe walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists strike, like flabby flesh. KIRSTY stands back in disgust. \nThe wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling. \nThe light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly. It is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing. \nKIRSTY turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has given in to decay. The sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten, the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot. A skinned rat runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board. \nA rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which run wildly across the floor. \n", "test3_true": "84   INT.   BARE CHAMBER   HELL \nThe smoke and wind subside but not entirely. \nKIRSTY is standing in exactly the same position in a room of exactly the same proportions, but which is completely empty and which has walls of the same gray stone that the corridors do. \nSuddenly, rising up from behind KIRSTY, comes PINHEAD. \nPINHEAD Ah, Kirsty. And we thought we'd lost you. \nKIRSTY swings round in terror. As the mist continues to clear, she sees, advancing to join PINHEAD, the FEMALE CENOBITE and the CHATTERER. Beyond them, it is now revealed, that this chamber has no fourth wall; it gives directly onto the corridors \nFEMALE CENOBITE So sweet of you to come back. \nKIRSTY begins to work furiously at the BOX she has brought from MALAHIDE's house. It sent them away at the end of HELLRAISER. She obviously hopes it will work again. \nPINHEAD raises a hand and the box simply flies out of KIRSTY's hands and hovers in the air between them. KIRSTY stares, open- mouthed. \nPINHEAD How can it send us back, child? We're already here. And so are you. \nSuddenly PINHEAD works at the box himself - by remote control and with dazzling skill. \nHe turns the box rapidly through positions KIRSTY and we have never seen before - even opening it out at one stage into  a large, two-dimensional square. Finally, it closes itself down - but in a wholly new shape; a white, multi-faceted, diamond shape - and drops back into KIRSTY's hands. \nHe stares at KIRSTY and makes a small gesture with his brow. It is ALMOST cute. If anything, it resembles the cocky, aren't-I- clever look STEVE gave KIRSTY after swallowing the cigarette in HELLRAISER. Then his face assumes its normal deadly blankness. \nKIRSTY shakes her head dumbly and begins to back into a corner, hoping that if they converge on her, she might just be able to slip around them and get back to the labyrinth. \nKIRSTY No! You... You can't! It wasn't me...I didn't do it! I didn't open the box! \nFEMALE CENOBITE Didn't open the box. And what was it last time? Didn't know what the box was. And yet we DO keep finding each other, don't we? \nPINHEAD Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it. \nFEMALE CENOBITE Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us? \nTo some extent, KIRSTY's ploy is working. The CENOBITES are moving closer together as they advance to the corner in which she stands. \nKIRSTY But I didn't open it! I didn't! \nPINHEAD Then why are you here? \nKIRSTY I've come for my father! \nKIRSTY shouts this with brave defiance. PINHEAD laughs in response, a very unattractive sound. \nPINHEAD But he's in his own Hell, child And quite unreachable. \nSuddenly KIRSTY makes her break shouting out as she does so. \nKIRSTY I don't believe you! \nIt seems for a moment she has succeeded. She swings around the side of the CENOBITES and begins to run across the chamber. The CENOBITES do not move but suddenly, from nowhere a hook flies across the room, attached to a metal chain. The hook buries itself in the wall only inches in front of KIRSTY's face, the chain pulled tight and barring her path. The wall begins to bleed. \nKIRSTY screams. \nThe CENOBITES turn to face her, but make no attempt to cross the room to her new position. \nPINHEAD But it's true, He is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours. \nKIRSTY And what about you? \nPINHEAD almost smiles at the naivete of the question. \nPINHEAD It's different for us. \nFEMALE CENOBITE We've always been here. \nPINHEAD We have no more surprises. \nSuddenly, as quickly as it came, the hook withdraws from the wall and flies back into nothingness. \n", "test3_id": 617}

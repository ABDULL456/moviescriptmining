{"train": "WHITE SQUALL \nby \nTodd Robinson \nRevised First Draft \nOctober 31, 1994 \nFADE IN: \nSUPER:  A TRUE STORY - MYSTIC HARBOR CONNECTICUT 1994 \nCREDITS OVER \nWind on the water.  Soaring gulls and sand pipers glide over the pilings and sagging bulkheads. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) Though I hadn't seen or spoken to Sheldrake in over thirty years, it seemed impossible that his heart was the thing that had finally failed him... \nINT.  LATE MODEL CAR - SAME \nCHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind the wheel.  He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street that leads to the wharf. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) I never got close to him, nobody did.  But by the time we made Tampa, I was sure I knew who he was, that I understood what he saw, what nourished his soul and tested his faith... \nEXT.  WHARF - DAY \nChuck stares out across the harbor.  In the distance, the echoes of singing masts.  Shrouds and canvas softly ping. The small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their moorings. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) He had taken us to worship, where, what was for him, the holiest of holies.  And, for us too by the end... \nEXT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - LATER \nChuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of people.  They surround a small building, a neighborhood clinic.  A worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates the structure. \nIN MEMORY OF NATALIE \"ALICE\" SHELDRAKE M.D., CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961 \nNext to the stone a funeral urn.  A YOUNG MINISTER gropes for meaning. \nMINISTER I didn't know Richard Sheldrake personally, but his many friends who knew and worked with him, wanted to make sure that he was returned home, here, to be remembered with his beloved wife... \nChuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice fading away.  The afternoon wind is coming up with the tide.  He quietly heads towards the water.  Drifting, drawn, lost. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) Though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange.  He had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars.  Like me, alone among many.  But most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine Albatross, he was always and would forever be... our Skipper. \nA SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  A beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips into port.  A picture out of another time, another place. It takes him away... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  FOREST - WATER TOWER - DAY \nA towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and sycamores.  The tower is immense.  A single ladder runs up to the top. \nAT THE TOP \nJust above the tree tops, the view is spectacular.  CHUCK GIEG, 16, sits thin and unsteady.  Chuck's gaze is drawn upward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds.  Chuck's older brother WILL, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself to the top. \nWILL You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look? \nCHUCK I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve. \nWILL It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff. \nCHUCK It's not a vacation, it's private school. \nWILL I thought this was your dream come true. \nCHUCK That's not why he's sending me. \nWILL Why then. \nCHUCK Because it looks good. \nChuck looks out, yearning.  Will considers him, troubled. \nCHUCK I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be \"William\". \nWILL Nobody says you have to be like me. \nCHUCK He does. \nWILL You don't give him enough credit Chas. \nChuck takes a last look at the building clouds.  The sky rumbles.  Distant thunder. \nWILL We better go. \nEXT.  GIEG HOUSE - DAY \nMaple street, USA, tree lined and quaint.  The Gieg home is a modest two story house with a covered porch.  The family station wagon is poised for departure.  CHARLES, 45, a generally serious man broods as MIDDY, their mother, 40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house.  Chuck and Will appear from the woods. \nCHARLES (ticked) You plan on making this plane or not? \nWILL Don't take any wooden nickels Kemosabe. \nCHUCK I won't. \nWill shoves out a hand at Chuck. \nWILL And lighten up will ya. \nRICK I gotta admit I never thought you'd be back after the great \"Bowsprit Affair\". \nTOD Me and Skipper had a meeting of the minds. \nCHARLIE How's that? \nTOD I begged. \nCHUCK (warming a little) What the \"Bowsprit Affair\"? \nRICK Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit. \nTOD Not just any 'local' girl. \nRICK The 'local' mayor's 'local' daughter. \nTod smiles, reminiscing. \nCHARLIE Thing is, the net in the basket isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o wraps them up in the jib.  After the deed was done... \nRICK He says they did the deed... \nTOD Trust me, we did the deed. \nCHARLIE After the \"alleged\" deed was done, they fell asleep.  Big Daddy Lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears Casanova sawing logs. \nTOD Believe me, I needed the rest... \nCHARLIE He gets the whole crew on deck, gets us on the halyard, and orders the old \"heave ho...\". \nRICK Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o and the mayor's daughter, naked as pilot whales... \nCHARLIE (to Tod) I don't know who was more surprised, you or Big Daddy. \nTOD To tell you the truth, I think it was her father. \nAt the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view. \nRICK Well gentlemen, there she is. \nThe cab stops.  Besides many colorful fishing boats, is the ALBATROSS.  At ninety-two feet, she dwarfs everything in the harbor.  Her white hull glows like ivory and her twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck. Breathtaking. \nCHARLIE Home sweet hell on the water. \nEXT.  DOCK - DAY \nThe boys pile out of the taxi.  What seemed like a pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up close.  The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover the hull.  Looks of disappointment. \nCHUCK What happened to it? \nA voice from behind turns Chuck. \nBILL She cleans up.  We'll have her ship shape before we shove off. \nThis is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew and... first mate.  Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on the back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Viking giant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's English professor. \nPuffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at Tod and the others.  He speaks with the voice of Moses. \nLAWFORD \"That this same child of honor and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. For every honor sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head.  My shames redoubled!  For the time will come... \nChuck feels something and looks up where he meets the intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins. Their eyes lock. \nLAWFORD ... That I shall make this northern youth exchange, his glorious deeds for my indignities.\" \nThen, the man is gone.  Haunting.  Only Chuck has seen him.  Tod smiles back at Lawford impishly. \nTOD Would you be addressing me, sir? \nLAWFORD I would. \nRICK What's that supposed to mean? \nLAWFORD (beat) Henry the IV part I Act I Scene ii. I suggest you read it. \nLawford sneers and walks away.  It's all a show. \nCHARLIE It means Shakespeare.  B-o-r-i-n-g. \nBILL It means if he catches anybody basket-napping on watch this passage, he's gonna use their lizard for 'cuda' bait. \nRICK (lightly) Well that's a hell of a how-do-you- do. \nBILL Drop your gear, go below and pick yourself some bunks. \nChuck and the others climb aboard. \nINT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY \nChuck makes his way down the companionway into the main cabin.  Other crew members are already unpacking. \nThe sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of bunks on each side of the cabin.  In the middle of the room is a gimbaled table.  This is where the crew will eat and study. \nRICK Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg. \nAmong the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub with soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and rodent-like. \nRobin approaches with a hand extended.  He carries a 8x10 photo of a young man in a football uniform. \nROBIN I'm Robin. \nChuck regards the photo. \nBILL Now what's the problem, Goodall? Everybody swims. \nThe crew are piling back on deck.  George stands in the open galley door.  The smell of fresh bacon is intoxicating. \nJOHN I don't. \nLAWFORD You will if you wanna eat.  Right George? \nGeorge nods, wielding a butchers knife.  The crew stand shivering, waiting on John. \nJOHN (to Bill) You gonna swim for your breakfast? \nBill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts, swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard arm.  He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet below.  It's a long way.  Robin turns away. \nLawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor. \nLAWFORD \"Down, down beneath the deep, That oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a sound and peaceful sleep, With the salt waves dashing over him.\" -- Lord Byron gentlemen. \nWith that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge KERSPLASH!  He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself up and gets in John's face. \nBILL Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in twice.  So I guess I'll be eating your breakfast too. \nJohn considers him, then strips off his shirt.  But instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down. \nHe manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard arm -- the topgallant.  It's a pissing contest and everybody knows it. \nMIKE I got five bucks says he doesn't. \nCHRIS I got five that says he doesn't live. \nTOD I'll take a dollar of that. \nROBIN This is crazy! \nRobin refuses to watch.  The others share a look. \nJohn makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the end of the yard.  He tosses a look towards Bill but with no way to back down, he launches into the air.  Everyone gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive. Falling, falling, falling... \nCHUCK Jesus. \nROBIN I can't watch this. \nJohn hits the water like a bullet.  The crew run to the side waiting for him to come up.  Nothing.  Finally, he breaks the surface.  Easy.  He climbs up waiting, somehow, to claim victory. \nSuddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appeared silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him. \nRICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of command like a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life. \nBILL Skipper on deck! \nThe crew line up clumsily.  Skipper has a gaze that blazes right through them. \nHe looks out to sea.  Searching, ominous.  He waits until the silence is filled with everyone's attention. \nSKIPPER You know what's out there?  Wind and wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools that'll hold a sailing ship for weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane.  A blow that could knock the bridge off a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and sandbars that'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all. \nHe spits into the water.  The crew sheepishly throw glances to the horizon. \nSKIPPER So look out there... and explain to me why any man in possession of any sense at all, would take on the sea with sail? \nSkipper turns his gaze back to the boys.  There is a fire in his eyes.  Nobody dare answers. \nSKIPPER Because there's something else out there.  It beckons in the wind and sings in the shrouds.  Voices. Whispering... \nHis ear to the wind. \nSKIPPER They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men you don't even know.  Men you can't even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish, that part of you and I that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told.  It's a part of us that can only be found on mountain tops and deserts, in the deepest caverns, smoking battle fields and... across oceans. \nHe turns back to the sea, dark. \nSKIPPER Out there, is where it all waits. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) He was everything I had expected, part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh. He spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness.  He had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as Bill Butler.  And as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror. \nSkipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded to the main mast and reads the inscription. \nSKIPPER (reading) \"Where we go one, we go all.\" \nWith that, he disappears below.  Nobody moves.  This is exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits the fan. \nTERRY This -- is gonna be a long eight months. \nINT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY \nThe boys devour a hearty breakfast.  Tod is the 'galley slave' and fills glasses with orange juice. \nTOD Chow down boys.  The milk and eggs are the first things to go once we put out. \nJohn enters balancing two plates heaped with food. \nRICK You know we gotta dumbwaiter for that. \nJohn looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall. \nRICK Not that one.  Tod-o here. \nThe guys groan. \nTOD Har, har, har... \nJohn approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry who doesn't notice him.  Finally he looks up, startled. \nSKIPPER And if I catch anybody, ever, jumping off a yard arm again I will personally break what bones are left and send you home in a wheel chair. \nA wave explodes over the bow.  A wall of water crashes over the deck knocking down several of the boys.  Terry can't take it anymore and explodes. \nTERRY We're gonna die!!!  We're all gonna die! \nHe lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him. \nSKIPPER Excellent point.  As you might have noticed, being out here pretty much puts you in the moment.  If you panic, if you lose your head, you die.  Maybe you take your mates with you.  How'd you like to have to bet on Terry here getting us home today? Each one of you is responsible for the rest.  \"Where we go one, we go all\".  If your buddy is asleep at the switch we're all fish food. \nHe's making his point which is lost on no one. \nSKIPPER The ship beneath you is not a toy and sailing is not a game.  The Albatross will take us far gentlemen, but she demands constant attention.  Respect her, and we'll do fine.  Oh, and one more thing. There is nothing that goes on, on this boat that I don't know about. She speaks to me in the night.  So don't test me.  Not even a little. \nSkipper walks over and puts an arm around Terry who is fighting sobs. \nSKIPPER Nothing like experience to put things in perspective.  Huh son? (to Bill) Alright.  Let's go home. \nINT.  CHART HOUSE - DAY \nLawford addresses some of the crew.  Chuck, Robin and John are among them.  John glares at Lawford.  The guys giggle. \nLAWFORD That's not a satisfactory answer. \nJOHN Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me. \nLawford pauses for a moment and then explodes theatrically. \nLAWFORD Shit?!!! \nHe slams a text book into John's hands. \nLAWFORD Read for me please the words of Mr. Keats at the bottom of the page. \nJohn stares back, simmering.  Robin interrupts the potential confrontation and reaches for the book. \nROBIN I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind. \nJOHN Shut up donut. \nJohn pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for a moment.  He begins reading but struggles with the cadence. \nJOHN (reading) Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne. \nLAWFORD You know what he is talking about here? \nBlank faces. \nLAWFORD (ranting) Awe.  Humility.  He's telling you that he has traveled the seas as Homer did.  As Ulysses had before him as he tried to find his way home to Ithaca after the Trojan Wars. \"That deep browed Homer\"... \nHe points to his head. \nLAWFORD Brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the mind; \"... ruled as his demesne.\" He commands the voyage of the imagination, like a god. (pause) That is what one of the greatest literary minds of modern times, Mr. Boutillier, has to say about Homer. \nHe snatches the book back. \nLAWFORD You think the Odyssey is dull?  I'll tell you something, it's about each one of you -- right now.  Doubt and expectation.  Friendship, community, self sacrifice and accountability. \nHe holds up the text. \nLAWFORD This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage. \nJOHN What is it... the secret? \nLawford breaks into a huge belly laugh. \nJOHN (confused) What? \nLAWFORD If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nAerial shot.  The Albatross is under full sail leaving Bermuda for the last time. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) And so it was the Albatross that took to the open sea with the wind in her snapping canvas and a bone of white foam in her teeth... In each of us were feelings of anticipation and hesitation for the man at the wheel and of the unfamiliar world he was leading us into. \nShe crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music, building. \nDECK - DAY \nThe crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail.  Chuck struggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in. \nALOFT \nThe crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the rigging. \nBOWSPRIT NET \nThe crew pull down the jib trying to furl it.  Most of the sail ends up dragging in the water. \nABOVE \nThe squaresails are dropped simultaneously. \nWIDE \nWhite foam boils from the bow of the Albatross as she crashes through the waves. \nAT THE WHEEL \nAlice smiles and puts her arms around Skipper's waist. It's coming together. \nSKIPPER No.  That's for sure.  Charlie, take his place. \nPhil goes below, a little ashamed.  The crew scatters. Chuck, still at the wheel, pipes up. \nCHUCK If it's all the same, I'd like to stay on deck. \nSkipper regards Chuck, who looks back with both fear and eagerness.  Suddenly he sees something in this kid.  Maybe himself.  He almost smiles.  Almost. \nSKIPPER Take the wheel. \nEXT.  FORETOP - SAME \nDark clouds blot out the sky and stars.  Thunder rumbles far away.  The seas have built but there's no wind... yet. With no steerage, the ship is tossed. \nTod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl. The mast swings from side to side, but the air has gone dead calm.  Skipper looks up, anticipating. \nSKIPPER Everyone out of the rigging NOW! \nBILL Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!! \nTOD (shouting) HERE IT COMES!! \nON THE DECK \nThe crew in the rigging scamper down to the safety of the deck. \nSKIPPER Bill, on the wheel with Chuck. \nBill joins Chuck and takes hold of the wheel.  Then it hits. \nA wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of thunder and flashing lightning.  The bow explodes through twelve foot swells.  This is what the Albatross was born to do. \nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME \nIt's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks.  Pots crash, books and personals go flying.  The guys are scared. \nON DECK \nThe main and jib sheets tighten.  Skipper looks at Chuck and Bill.  It all comes down to moments like these and he loves it. \nSuddenly, there is a loud CRACK!  A violent flapping noise.  Skipper leaps to the port and looks forward.  Tod comes running back. \nTOD We blew the inner! \nALICE I'll go. \nSKIPPER Bring it down and run up the storm jib.  We'll fix it later.  Stay out of reach of the blocks! \nTod and Alice disappear. \nSKIPPER (with a twinkle) Well, we're in it now. \nChuck studies him, frightened, but reassured. \nEXT.  BOW - SAME \nThe shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind. The block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it.  No one dares go near it.  For a moment, it seems to hang there seductively.  John, naive of its power, leaps for the rail and grabs it. \nALICE NOOO!!! \nSuddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John high off the deck and over the side.  He holds on for dear life, screaming. \nAT THE WHEEL \nSKIPPER (to Chuck) Hold her steady. \nSkipper bolts forward. \nAT THE BOW \nAlice uncleats the jib halyard, leaving one turn on the pin and shoves it into Tod's hands. \nALICE Release this when I tell you!! \nSkipper joins Tod as Alice scrambles along the deck and pulls herself into the bowsprit netting.  When the block and jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail yelling... \nALICE NOW!!! \nAs John is snapped inboard Alice leaps up, grabbing the sail, leaning out over the open water.  Waves explode through the netting.  As Tod releases the halyard, John falls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive.  Lawford and Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit. \nSkipper looks her over.  Relieved.  No broken bones.  Good work.  But then this is what he expects.  He respects her and now, everyone can see why.  He looks at John sprawled on the deck. \nSKIPPER Be careful will ya? \nJOHN What ever you say Cap... \nSKIPPER Let's get that storm jib up. \nSkipper gives Alice a private look, then returns to the stern where Chuck holds tightly onto the wheel. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) The storm lasted sixteen hours and it set us all on equal footing.  It was the first time that we shared an episode on an even plane.  As we stood our watches we were equally out of control of our situation, regardless of our physical abilities or social backgrounds.  And though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nThe crew is cleaning up.  Alice supervises repairs to the jib while others stow line, scrub the deck and chip paint. Lawford paces. \nLAWFORD You know what they say in the Navy don't you? \nRICK What's that, Big Daddy? \nThe more experienced crew members have heard this all before. \nTerry pops up, pissed that they're reeling him back in. \nSuddenly the animal on the other end of Robin's line explodes out of the sea.  It's a six foot Thresher shark. Terry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and screaming. \nTERRY Get me out!!!  Get me out!!! \nMIKE Oh my god!!  It's a... \nSKIPPER (calmly) Shark. (to Robin) Don't lose it son. \nGeorge grabs a gaffing hook while Robin fights the rod, trying to bring in the big fish. \nGEORGE Keep it coming. \nRobin battles the fish.  George clumsily tries to help. The crew make their way to the rear to watch. \nCHARLIE Whoops. \nCharlie and Rick and the others heave to get Terry up. Finally he makes it.  Sprawling onto the deck. \nTERRY Oh Jesus!  Oh Jesus Christ!! \nThe crew turn and cheer Robin on as he brings the shark alongside. \nGEORGE He must be two hundred pounds! Bring him in close and try to hold him steady. \nGeorge leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook into a gill.  Several of the boys hold onto him as the fish flops around violently. \nGEORGE Got him! \nSkipper comes down to inspect the catch.  The shark is longer than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water, snapping and twisting.  Terry stands shaking, freaked. All of them are. \nRICK Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister Mary Anne's butt. \nThe guys laugh nervously.  Terry just stares at the man eater, but it's infectious.  After a moment he's laughing too.  Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile. \nSKIPPER Well, now you have something to write home about. \nMore laughter.  Suddenly, Tom, who is lookout on the foretop, cries out. \nTOM Land ho!!!  Land ho!!! \nEveryone turns around to look.  The guys at the stern let go of George and he nearly tumbles overboard.  In that instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears back into the sea.  Robin and George share a stunned look. \nGEORGE Shit. \nROBIN There's more where that came from. \nSkipper returns to the wheelhouse with Alice.  Together they scan the horizon.  Clouds build over the land ahead. \nALICE Cheated death again. \nHe slips an arm around her. \nSKIPPER Yep. \nEXT.  ANTIGUA - HARBOR - DAY \nA group of islanders have assembled to watch the crew approach in the long boats. \nINT.  LONG BOAT - SAME \nChuck gazes across the strange landscape.  As the boats dock, the crew pile out and scatter.  Local children follow them wherever they go.  Chuck, Robin and John find themselves alone.  Most of the buildings are primitive. They wander over to a shop. \nROBIN What do you say?  Cokes?  I'm buying. \nCHUCK & JOHN Sure. \nEXT.  SHOP \nChuck and Robin reappear, sipping cold Cokes.  Mike and Chris walk by across the street.  Robin speaks up loud enough for them to hear. \nROBIN You're right Chuck.  There's nothing quite as refreshing as a cold ten cent Coke that only costs ten cents! \nThe three clink their bottles.  Mike and Chris slink away. \nEXT.  COLONIAL FORT - DAY \nA crumbling fort overlooks the harbor.  Below, the Albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water. Large bronze muzzle-loading cannons still lie in their gunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that will never come. \nEach of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the Caribbean view. \nROBIN You think Skipper and Alice do it? \nCHUCK Do what? \nROBIN Ya know... \"It\". \nCHUCK That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know? \nJOHN She isn't that old. \nCHUCK What do you mean? \nJOHN I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty. \nROBIN How would you know? \nJOHN Trust me donut.  I know. \nROBIN What?  Come on... \nSKIPPER Start the engine.  All ahead full!! Scallop the Square and drop the rest!! \nHe shoots a glare at Tod and Chris. \nTOD (bewildered) I don't know what happened Skipper. It just blew out. \nSkipper turns to the task at hand without a word.  What had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and confusion. \nPhil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the spear gun and smiles to himself at Tod's arrogance turned humility. \nEXT.  DECK - TOBAGO CAYS - DAY \nThe Albatross has dropped anchor along a remote group of flat, lush atolls.  Tall palm trees grow almost to the waters edge.  The crew have the mainsail down and Alice supervises the repair of the sail.  Phil sits above it all sunning himself in the bowswain's chair. \nROBIN Where are you from any way? \nCHUCK Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you? \nROBIN Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'. \nTOD Sorry to here it. \nCHUCK Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all... \nPhil reels himself down. \nPHIL Christ, I'm gonna choke on 'feel good'... \nRobin looks up, taken back. \nTOD Why are you such a penis Phil.  Do you do it on purpose or can't you help it. \nPHIL Tug my chain Johnstone. \nSkipper comes on deck.  Robin and Chuck flip Phil and Terry the finger. \nSKIPPER After midterms we'll finish our run down to Curacao. \nThe crew reacts, grumbling. \nSKIPPER I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there. \nPHIL (to Terry) Joy, rapture... \nSKIPPER Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning. \nGeorge appears from the galley and rings the ships bell. \nGEORGE That's chow. \nThe crew drop what they're doing and stampede down into the cabin. \nINT.  CABIN - NIGHT \nRobin thrashes in his bunk calling out.  Sweat glistens on his face.  Chuck stumbles out to his bunk with Rick and some of the others. \nRICK Hey man, wake up.  Wake up! \nThey shake him.  Robin wakes, disoriented, eyes filled with tears. \nROBIN I was falling... \nPhil grumbles from his bunk. \nPHIL Hey, shut up will ya? \nCHUCK It was a bad dream... \nROBIN It was so real... \nCHUCK Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up. \nPhil rolls over in his bunk trying to go back to sleep. \nROBIN Who told you that? \nCHUCK My dad. \nROBIN It works? \nCHUCK Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep. \nHe pats Robin on the leg.  The guys return to their bunks. Favor Phil, listening. \nCHUCK (lingering) You okay now? \nRobin stares at the photo of his brother. \nROBIN That's how he died you know. \nCHUCK Who? \nROBIN My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down... (beat) They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there. \nCHUCK Jesus, you never told them? \nROBIN I couldn't. \nPhil stares at the ceiling, affected by what he has overheard.  Someone creeps down the companionway and whispers. \nMIKE (hushed) Hey you guys, come on! \nSKIPPER Spirits have a way of bringing that out. \nGEORGE And being sixteen. \nSKIPPER They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too. (beat) I promise you one thing... \nGEORGE What's that? \nSKIPPER They'll know about it in the morning. \nSkipper smiles. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nThe drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach. As they ready the boat for the trip back Robin looks out to sea... \nROBIN (alarmed) Jesus H. Christ. \nTod looks up. \nTERRY What now pork chop? \nROBIN Look! \nThe guys turn their gaze to the ocean.  The Albatross... is gone! \nTERRY Holy shit!  Where'd she go? \nThe crew is suddenly stone sober.  Stunned. \nCHARLIE What the hell is going on? \nMIKE She's gone!  The boat's gone!! \nPhil breaks into sort of a blind panic. \nPHIL Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!! \nJOHN Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister. \nCHUCK Alright.  Everybody just stay cool. We'll figure this out. \nMIKE Who the hell checked the mooring? \nROBIN I did.  Why? \nCHARLIE Maybe she pulled free... \nMIKE What if they don't know.  If she's adrift, if they're asleep, she could run aground.  She could break up on the reef. \nPHIL (to Robin) Maybe you didn't check it good enough. \nROBIN (defensive, frightened) I did.  I swear. \nOddly, it's Phil who stands up for Robin. \nPHIL Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't. \nJOHN That's enough. \nPHIL How the hell are we gonna get outta here? \nJOHN We'll think of something. \nPHIL Oh, praise the lord. (announcing) Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something. \nWithout warning.  John lunges at Phil.  Phil screams, trying to defend himself.  The guys all dive in.  Suddenly it's an all out brawl. \nJohn out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat of the boat. \nSuddenly, from behind, comes a blistering \"THWACK!!\" as Chuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head. Stunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood dripping from the back of his head. \nJOHN Nobody calls me an idiot. \nHe weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand. The guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover. \nPHIL God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose! \nCHUCK Shut up, Phil. \nChuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over and vomits. \nTERRY Well that's just great.  Now what are we supposed to do? \nChuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palm tree, propping him up.  The others huddle to stay warm. \nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING \nThe crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day.  Bloodied and sun burned.  A fly buzzes around Rick's face, waking him.  He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus.  He gazes across the water, stupefied. \nRICK Oh-my-god... \nThe others stir and follow his gaze.  The Albatross sits in exactly the spot where they left her. \nROBIN I'm not sure if this is really good or really bad. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY \nThe sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly.  George tries to maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his hands. \nGEORGE I got a live one! \nPHIL Long enough. \nJohn looks down, resigned. \nJOHN They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards. \nCHUCK Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test. \nROBIN I'm in. \nThey turn and look to Phil, who still shows the tell-tail signs of their fight. \nPHIL Me, too. \nJOHN Why would you do that? \nCHUCK Because we believe in you. (beat) Because we're your friends. \nEXT.  CURACAO - HARBOR - DUSK \nAs a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the Albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks several hundred yards away.  On the dock, the students of the school wait.  As soon as the ship is in view, they start to cheer.  Chuck squints. \nCHUCK What are they doing? \nROBIN I can't make it out? \nRobin calls up to Phil, who is at the wheelhouse. \nROBIN Hey, Phil... Swing up the 'binocs' and tell us what you see. \nPhil picks up the binoculars and focuses. \nPHIL (puzzled) They're waving... handkerchiefs or something. \nRICK What? \nCHARLIE Maybe they're surrendering. \nPHIL Wait a second... \nPhil lowers the binoculars and turns to Skipper. \nPHIL They're girls!  They're all girls! \nSkipper shares a knowing look with Alice. \nTOD Gimme those. \nTod snatches the binoculars. \nTOD WHHOOOOAAAAA!!!!!!  WOMEN!!! \nEveryone on board rushes to the port side.  Every single person on the dock is a young girl waving a white handkerchief.  Spontaneous cheers from the boys. \nAs the 'Big A' pulls to the dock, John and Tod run for the gunnel door and swing it open.  The girls flood the deck. \nBILL Good morning, ladies. \nThey chatter in Dutch and hurry aboard.  Like wall flowers, Robin, Phil and Chuck stand on top of the chart house watching utopia unfold before them. \nROBIN What are we supposed to talk about? \nPHIL You've gotta be kidding? \nROBIN But, they don't speak English. \nPHIL There are some things that everybody does in the same language. \nCHUCK Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move? \nPHIL Like this! \nPhil reaches up for a free line.  With a running start he swings out over the water... \nPHIL Yeeee Haaaaa!! \nHe careens back onto the deck and lands in front of two startled, but impressed girls.  Robin and Chuck applaud. Phil takes a bow.  All hell is breaking loose. \nSkipper and Alice welcome aboard the headmaster, MS. BOYDE, 50's, dumpy but tough. \nSKIPPER A very enthusiastic welcome. \nMS. BOYDE We don't often have guests.  Our girls have been looking forward to your visit for some time.  Welcome to Curacao. \nSKIPPER Thank you.  You're all ready to sail then? \nMS. BOYDE I should think so. \nALICE I'm sure they won't be disappointed. \nA man's voice bellows up from the dock. \nFRANCIS (O.S.) Ahoy there!! \nEveryone stops and freezes.  Phil turns, disbelieving. It's his parents, Francis and PEGGY BOUTILLIER, standing next to a limousine dressed in brightly colored tourist garb. \nPEGGY Surprise! \nFRANCIS Well, well.  What do we have here? A floating brothel? \nALICE (cool) Hardly. \nPHIL I can take care of myself. \nFRANCIS (sarcastic) Oh, really? \nPHIL Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone? \nFrancis slaps Phil across the face nearly knocking him out of his chair.  Everyone and everything.  It's humiliating. \nPEGGY Francis!! \nShe cradles Phil's red face.  He fights the tears. \nFRANCIS Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat... \nPHIL It has nothing to do with him. \nFRANCIS Well, what does it have to do with? Us? \nPHIL No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once? \nPhil pulls free and exits.  He can feel eyes all over him. \nEXT.  SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT \nAlice watches, swept up in the nostalgic romance of it all.  Skipper joins her. \nSKIPPER He would have loved this. \nALICE Your father? \nSKIPPER All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands. \nALICE You miss him. \nSkipper manages a sad smile. \nSKIPPER Every hour.  Every minute. (pause) I wish he was here.  I wish he could have sailed our girl.  Seen these boys... \nShe smiles warmly. \nSKIPPER I'd have liked to have said goodbye. \nALICE He knows. \nSKIPPER You sound so sure. \nALICE I am about this. \nSkipper turns and stares at her deeply. \nALICE What? \nSKIPPER He never would have believed a woman like you existed. \nAlice smiles and turns back to the dancers. \nALICE Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars? \nSKIPPER Guilty. \nALICE On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are. \nThe music changes to a calypso waltz.  Skipper takes Alice by the hand. \nSKIPPER Would you allow me? \nShe's sixteen again.  There's something about him that still makes her blush. \nSkipper leads her to the dance floor.  He hesitates, looking deeply into her eyes.  As they begin to dance, the boys notice and exchange looks. \nLawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and smoking cigars. \nGEORGE If I didn't know better I'd say the old man was acting almost halfway human. \nLAWFORD He is halfway human. \nOne by one the couples clear for the Skipper and his bride.  They glide, lost in each others arms.  They dance a dance for the ages.  As if it might be for the last time.  The music swells. \nEXT.  PIER - NIGHT \nChuck and Bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full moon hangs above the horizon.  Bregitta doesn't understand what Chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him. \nCHUCK I can't remember feeling like this about myself, a place, someone like you.  We've come such a long way, seen so much.  But nothing like this. \nBregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand.  He's nervous. \nCHUCK I'm not the best at expressing myself.  Maybe the only reason I can now is because I know you don't understand me. (beat) I like you so much.  Too much.  But how could I?  I mean, if we can't even communicate, how could I know you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an hour and I'll never see you again. \nBregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses him tenderly.  Then, in perfect English... \nBREGITTA I like you, too. \nChuck's eyes widen, astonished.  Bregitta smiles, takes Chuck by the hand, and leads him to a small covered boat moored to the pier. \nBREGITTA Come on.  We don't have much time. \nBlushing deeply, Chuck follows her into the boat. \nEXT.  STREET - SAME \nRobin walks down the street hand in hand with one of the girls.  A long string of colored lights illuminate the length of the street.  Robin clumsily tries to kiss the girl.  She laughs. \nAlice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin. \nALICE It's through her lung. \nSkipper turns to Phil. \nSKIPPER (to Phil) Nice shot. \nPhil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away. Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last to look away.  Skipper grimly walks over to one of the deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds it out to Phil. \nSKIPPER Finish it. \nPhil looks at the mallet, horrified. \nPHIL (stammering) I'm not gonna kill it. \nSKIPPER You already have.  Now go on.  Do it. \nPhil backs away.  Skipper stares at him for a moment, then walks over to the dolphin.  Robin looks away.  The sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the animal seems to silence the world.  There are one of two thumps of her tail and, it's over. \nSkipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabs the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the pieces into the sea. \nSKIPPER What the hell is wrong with you?! \nPhil begins to shake with rage. \nSKIPPER Come on.  You got so much fight in you; you wanna kill something?  Take your best shot.  The first one's free. \nRobin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away. For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper up on the challenge.  Then the impulse passes. \nSKIPPER That's what I thought. (beat) You're done.  You're going home. \nSkipper turns.  The humiliation is more than Phil can take.  He lunges after Skipper.  Lawford grabs him.  Phil swings wildly. \nPHIL You mean-assed bastard!!  You son of a bitch!!  You can't do this!!!  You can't do this!!!  God damn you!! God damn you!! \nLawford leads Phil, struggling, below.  The crew surround the dead dolphin, stunned. \nEXT.  ARUBA - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nThe Albatross is at anchor in the center of the harbor. \nEXT.  DECK - SAME \nPhil comes on deck from below with his duffel bag. Everyone feels bad but no one knows what to say.  Phil turns to get a second load. \nCHUCK Why'd you do it? \nPHIL (regretting it) What's the difference? \nCHUCK You only hurt yourself you know? \nPHIL Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me. \nRICK You're the one who doesn't care, Phil. \nPHIL It hurts too much to care. \nRICK About yourself? \nPHIL About anything. \nPhil turns and disappears down the companionway. \nROBIN We shouldn't be putting him off the boat. \nCHRIS The guy's out of control. \nROBIN Everybody's been outta control on this trip. (beat) Are we a crew or not?  I mean, isn't that what this is supposed to be all about? \nMIKE You're the last person who should be whining about being a \"crew\". \nROBIN How do you figure that? \nMIKE Well, I'd sure like to go into the subject of vertigo and all, but I wouldn't want you to piss yourself. \nRobin flushes bright red.  John fires a look at Mike. \nJOHN You're a regular prick you know that? \nMIKE Tell it to the dolphin, Goodall. \nJOHN Everybody deserves a second chance, ya know?  We'd do the same for you Mike. \nROBIN It's about family isn't it?  I mean are we together on this or not? \nThere is a long pause.  Mike and Chris cave. \nMIKE Hell, do what ever you want.  It won't change anything anyway. \nRobin exchanges a glance with Chuck and together, they climb up the companionway. \nEXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME \nChuck and Robin stand before the door. \nROBIN I can't go in there. \nCHUCK What are you talking about. \nRobin turns away, ashamed. \nSKIPPER Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences. (beat) It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them. \nAlice runs her hands across his face. \nALICE You're still an idealist. \nSkipper turns and slips into her arms. \nSKIPPER Oh hell... \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nPhil is in the long boat with Skipper, ready to shove off. Tension is high.  It's as though they're all waiting for Skipper to give Phil a reprieve.  But, it's not coming. They mumble goodbyes.  Terry and Rick pass down Phil's bags. \nRICK Good luck. \nPhil nods and turns to Skipper. \nPHIL I'm ready. \nSkipper starts to pull the oars to make the crossing to the dock as the crew watches them go.  Robin turns, staring at the ships bell. \nEXT.  DOCK - SAME \nSkipper ties off the boat and Phil hands up his bags.  A black limousine waits, brooding.  Phil climbs up with Skipper and stands, stares at it.  The back door opens, but nobody gets out. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME \nThe crew stand, watching. \nCHARLIE His ol' man's gonna eat him for lunch. \nJOHN I know what that's like. \nRICK Yeah. \nThen, suddenly... \nCHUCK My god... \nAll stares aloft.  In the rigging, climbing up the mast, is Robin.  With the ships bell in his teeth, he is sweating every rung.  Perspiration glistens on his brow. The crew watches, transfixed as he fights his way towards the foretop. \nEXT.  DOCK - SAME \nPhil turns to Skipper.  Working up some courage to say something, anything.  But all that comes out is... \nPHIL I'm sorry. \nA pause between them. \nSKIPPER I know, Phil. \nSkipper extends a hand and they shake.  Phil is about to turn, when a familiar sound draws their attention. \nEXT.  FORETOP - SAME \nRobin, holding on for dear life at the top of the mast, rings the ships bell triumphantly over his head, waving to Phil.  Victorious.  Ding ding!  Ding ding!  Ding ding! The crew begin to cheer. \nEXT.  DOCK - SAME \nPhil stares back, fighting his emotions.  Slowly he raises his hand in a single wave of acknowledgement.  The ringing stops as his eyes meet Robin's.  Waves back.  Skipper turns. \nSKIPPER They never gave up on you, you know. \nPhil chews on it.  Then... \nPHIL Tell 'em I said... thanks. (beat) Goodbye Skipper. \nROBIN'S POV \nRobin watches as the limo pulls away.  He rings the bell wildly.  The crew below wave in a show of silent protest. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) As Robin rang him out, we waved in silent protest against Skipper's decision.  And in the days that followed the low morale was matched only by a sense of arrogance that perhaps the master should step down and let his students take over. \nAERIAL SHOT \nRobin, the Albatross and the drama unfolding below spin slowly away as we climb, turning, higher and higher. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nFoam sprays from her bow as the Albatross slices through the swells. \nINT.  CABIN - SAME \nTod exits the head with a worried look on his face.  He grabs Chuck by the arm and pulls him aside.  Morale is extremely low. \nTOD Listen man, I think I have a problem. \nCHUCK We all have problems. \nTOD I'm pissin' fire man. \nChuck reacts. \nINT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY \nTight on Alice.  Pull back to reveal Tod standing in front of her with his shorts down around his ankles.  Mortified. \nALICE Have a nice time in Curacao, did you Tod? \nAlice gets up and moves to her medicine chest.  Tod starts to pull up his shorts. \nOne of the Cubans pulls Terry out of line and brings him forward.  He alerts the Commander in Spanish. \nCOMMANDER Stow away? \nSKIPPER He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama. \nCOMMANDER That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us. \nTerry is petrified. \nLAWFORD If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress. \nSKIPPER Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere. \nSkipper stares him down.  The Commander signals to one of his men who disappears into the Chart House. \nCOMMANDER Perhaps in appreciation for our country's pursuit of peace, you might offer us some, token of gratitude. \nSkipper doesn't really have a choice. \nSKIPPER What do you want? \nThe Cuban returns from the Chart House with the Ships sextant and hands it to the Commander. \nCOMMANDER This.  And... \nPointing to the ships compass. \nCOMMANDER ... and that. \nGEORGE You've got to be kidding!! \nSKIPPER (cold) Take it. \nWithout hesitation the Cubans pull the large brass compass from its base. \nSKIPPER Now, get the hell off my ship. \nAs they leave the ship, they pause.  The Commander looks back at the Skipper, then deliberately drops both sextant and compass into the sea. \nCOMMANDER You'll really have something to teach your students now. \nSkipper stands towering above them.  The Cuban captain smiles up at him.  Amazingly, Skipper addresses him in perfect Spanish. \nSKIPPER Las estrellas es lo unico, que un marinero verdadero se mesesita para encontrarse.  Verdade Patron? \nThe Cubans stare back, frowning, amazed as they motor away. \nThe crew are stunned by what they have just witnessed. Skipper turns and meets the eyes of admiration, humility and complete respect.  He joins Alice at the helm.  They linger for a moment. \nCHUCK What'd he say? \nGeorge smiles, impressed as well. \nGEORGE He told them real sailors need only the stars. \nWith a new attitude, they turn to Skipper. \nSKIPPER Alright then, let's get outta here. \nThe crew bolt to there positions. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) With staff and string he showed us how to build a sextant.  As we rode the trades, he shared the ancient secrets of how to read the waves and follow stars.  And some mornings later, bathed in the orange glow of a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea like a phoenix. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - PANAMA CANAL - DAY \nPanama appears on the horizon.  The Albatross is dwarfed by the huge freighters moored around her, as she moves through the locks.  The crew stand on deck in quiet reverence. \nINT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT \nThe sounds of slumber fill the cabin.  All seems well with the world.  Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.  A huge bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a trident in his hand. \nChuck wakes with a start.  He bolts upright to see the horrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering before him.  He tries to scream, but hands cover his mouth.  He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway. \nEXT.  DECK - NIGHT \nThe Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship. Where the sails once were, only shredded fabric.  All of the crew have been brought on deck.  Powdered faces glow, surreal. \nJohn's head has been shaved into a mohawk.  Robin, Rick and Chris have been reduced to crew cuts.  The shears start over Chuck's head.  Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY JONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge with the rest of the crew. \nNEPTUNE Hold fast that polliwog and make him presentable. \nChuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face powdered. \nNEPTUNE Let it be known that on this day in the year nineteen hundred and sixty- one there appeared within the limits of my royal kingdom, the sailing ship brigantine Albatross, bound for Galapagos.  All vessels that sail my domain shall be subject to the scrutiny of the underworld... \nTerry is brought topside kicking and screaming. \nNEPTUNE Silence!!! \nTerry shuts up and succumbs to the same fate as the rest. \nNEPTUNE Tonight you shall all enter the Order of the Shellbacks.  Only when you have been duly initiated shall you enjoy the mysteries and protection of the trident.  So, let the festivities begin... \nEXT.  HELM - NIGHT \nNeptune and his court sit smoking Havana cigars as each member of the crew present themselves.  Robin dressed like a pig and crawls around snorting. \nJohn's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does a rain dance.  Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet, hops around like a frog.  Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's girlfriend and must sing everything he says.  Charlie is dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck. Frenetic chaos. \nEXT.  DECK - LATER \nEXT.  DECK - SAME \nThe crew stand at their posts.  The yards and foretop are trimmed with sailors, their faces taught and their bodies hard.  No one looks back. \nEXT.  DECK - PANAMA CANAL - DAY \nAlice steps onto the deck from the chart house with papers in her hands. \nALICE Well gentlemen, I have the results of your college board scores.  I think most of you will be pleased. \nThe crew members collect their exams.  Chuck notices John at the bow, alone, lost. \nCHUCK You okay? \nJOHN Yeah.  How'd you do. \nChuck looks down at his exam apprehensively. \nCHUCK Ninety-six. \nJOHN Congratulations. \nCHUCK What about you? \nJohn slowly passes his test to Chuck. \nCHUCK It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'! \nJOHN I know. \nCHUCK (excited) You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?! \nJOHN I just can't believe it. \nCHUCK This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted. \nJohn tries to choke back his emotions. \nJOHN I couldn't have done it without you. \nCHUCK Yes you could.  You did. (holding up the exam) This is all you.  Nobody else. \nJohn looks out. \nJOHN Thank you. \nChuck smiles and joins John's gaze over the water. \nCHUCK Feels different doesn't it? \nJOHN What? \nCHUCK That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left. \nJOHN What was that? \nCHUCK Anonymous. \nChuck looks at his test grimacing. \nCHUCK I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out. \nJOHN Figured what out? \nCHUCK Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here. \nJOHN I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift. \nIt's Chuck's turn to fight emotion. \nCHUCK You know, I never had friends like this. \nJOHN Me either. \nCHUCK I feel like... we can do anything. \nJohn smiles, clutching his exam. \nJOHN We can. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) In the fading hours of that Pacific dusk, with nothing left to confess, for the first time we felt safe, capable, sure of who we were and where we were going. \nINT.  MAIN CABIN - DAWN \nThe crew sleep in their bunks.  Lawford's voice rumbles down the companionway. \nLAWFORD A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A wind that follows fast, And fills the white and rushing sail, And bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise you salty dogs.  The watch is on. \nChuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out.  The dumb waiter clatters down from the galley with the morning's breakfast.  Skipper and some of the crew are already eating. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nThe Albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage of what little wind there is.  The skies are gray and dank.  Tod and Terry are at the helm.  Chuck and John are amid ship.  John relieves Bill on the forward watch. \nCHUCK Looks like we're gonna get wet. \nBILL Well, we need it.  I want to take a nice long bath and catch some water for my laundry. \nJOHN Save some for me will you? \nBILL You got it.  I'm going below. \nReporters corner them blocking his view.  More reporters clamor after Skipper, who doesn't reply. \nREPORTER #3 Captain, is it true that the ship was hit by a \"White Squall\"? \nREPORTER #2 Is it true the first mate is only fifteen? \nBill steps in between them. \nBILL It wasn't his fault mister... \nREPORTER #4 The National Weather Service says \"White Squalls\" are a meteorological phenomenon of the imagination. Would you care to comment of that? Don't you have anything to say to these parents?!! \nThe reporter pops a flash picture in Skipper's face. Skipper flies around and knocks the camera to the ground. The reporter jumps back, startled. \nSKIPPER Yes I do.  And it's private.  Very private. \nSkipper is swept away towards the CUSTOMS BOOTH by COAST GUARD OFFICERS.  Skipper surrenders the manifest and it is stapled to the outside of the door. \nINT.  CUSTOMS HUT - SAME \nSkipper is whisked inside.  The Coast Guard Officers lock the doors behind them. \nOFFICER Sit down Captain.  We'll have a car here in a few minutes.  Can I get you a cup of coffee? \nSKIPPER No, thank you. \nSkipper sits.  The wails of family members can be heard as they see the list outside.  Flash bulbs and faces press against the windows shouting questions.  He just stares at the floor. \nOUTSIDE \nFrom above we can see the group swarm around the the booth like angry hornets.  The crew are fractured and pulled apart from each other.  Charles, fights his way through the crowd. \nCHARLES Chuck!  Chuck!!! \nChuck tries to get to him. \nCHUCK Dad! \nThey embrace.  Flash bulbs explode all around them. \nCHUCK Where's Mom? \nCHARLES I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe. \nA WOMAN \nStands, staring at the empty ramp.  Lost.  A man comes up behind her and leads her away. \nA reporter shoves a microphone in Chuck's face. \nREPORTER #5 Was it the Skipper's fault?  And is it true drinking was permitted on board?  Why did the ship really go down? \nCharles grabs the guy and shoves him back into the crowd. Chuck strains to see his crew mates but they have been swept away. \nCHARLES Come on. \nCharles puts his arm around Chuck, still barefoot, and together, they walk away.  Photographers trail after them, popping off a few last photos.  Chuck turns and looks back. \nINT.  CAR MOVING - DOWNTOWN - DAY \nA ride reminiscent of the one Chuck and his father took before the journey began.  There is a gulf of silence between them.  Charles breaks it. \nCHARLES I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good? \nCHUCK Yeah, sure. \nChuck stares out the window at the traffic and congestion. A car in front of them runs a red light.  Charles slams on the brakes.  Chuck is shaken up.  Charles notices. \nCHARLES I'm sorry, son.  Are you okay? \nChuck manages a nod. \nINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nLavish and conspicuous by Chuck's recent standards, the store is crowded and jammed with merchandise. Claustrophobic.  Cash registers ring and MUZAK drifts in from above.  Chuck follows as Charles pulls things off of hangers and piles them into Chuck's arms. \nCHARLES Why don't you go and try some of that on? \nCHUCK Okay. \nEXT.  DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nCharles peruses the racks.  He calls to Chuck. \nCHARLES How're you doing in there? \nChuck calls from a dressing room. \nCHUCK (O.S.) Fine. \nCHARLES All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes... \nINT.  DRESSING ROOM - SAME \nChuck is curled up in the floor of the tiny booth.  Still dressed in the clothes from the Gran Rio, perspiration beads on his skin. \nCHUCK (calling out) Okay. \nTears stream down his face.  He looks up and sees himself in the mirror.  The eyes that look back are eyes of the ages.  Involuntary sobs.  He begins to shake.  The tiny booth suddenly like a crypt.  Tight, with no air.  Chuck lets out a gasp. \nCHUCK Oh God... \nTERRY It was an act of stupidity. \nTod lunges at Terry.  Bill and Charlie pull them apart. \nTOD (screaming) Was it my fault we were running all that sail?!  Was it my fault she wasn't dogged down?!!  HUH?!!  I couldn't help that the ballast shifted...!  You son of a bitch!! It wasn't my fault!!  it wasn't. \nTod breaks down, sodding on his knees. \nBILL It's okay, Tod. \nTerry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt. \nTERRY Then whose? \nTod looks up along with Bill and Charlie, all confused. \nTERRY After the lightning strike, we tried to go aloft to drop sail.  We'd done it a thousand times.  We didn't have to wait for an order.  But Skipper called us down. \nCHARLIE If the foremast had taken a strike, everyone in the rigging would've been fried.  What would you have done? \nTERRY We would have scalloped the squares from the deck.  Right Bill? \nBill turns and stares into the water, troubled. \nTOD That's right, that's right!  Bleed the sails from the deck and she could've taken a hurricane! \nIt's a strong argument.  Even Charlie is troubled by the implication.  There is a long moment of silence between them. \nCHUCK This is crazy.  Nothing could have prevented what happened. \nMIKE You guys are missing the point. This is all because of Phil.  Phil and his dear old dad. \nBILL What? \nMIKE How do you think they got this together so fast?  He's been laying for Skipper since the first day. \nCHARLIE Come on.  Like he's got a vendetta or some such shit? \nMIKE You got it. (to Chuck) I told you he was a turn coat the day we kicked him off the boat. \nChuck frowns, troubled. \nCHUCK No.  You're wrong. \nMIKE I'm telling you, the only way to change this is to get Phil to call off his old man.  And that ain't gonna happen.  So the way I see it, it's Skipper or us. \nThe guys react.  It's a no win situation. \nEXT.  MOTEL - NIGHT \nChuck knocks quietly on the door.  Phil answers the door. \nCHUCK Can we talk? \nPHIL I guess. \nFRANCIS (O.S.) Who is it Philip? \nPHIL It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute. (to Chuck) Look, what do you want? \nCHUCK Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you. \nPHIL Well that's just typical isn't it? \nCHUCK Is it true Phil? \nPHIL I gotta go. \nCHUCK You weren't there, you don't know what happened. \nPHIL (defensive) I know enough. \nChuck puts a hand out to stop him. \nCHUCK Phil, please.  It won't change anything.  Tell him to call it off. \nFRANCIS (O.S.) Who are you talking to out there Philip.  Come back in here. \nPhil meets Chuck's eyes, then looks away. \nPHIL I'm sorry. \nHe turns again and reaches for the door. \nCHUCK Wait. \nChuck hands him something.  Phil looks down, disbelieving. It's the ship's bell.  Robin's bell.  Their symbol of unity, of putting loyalty above fear. \nCHUCK We figured he'd have wanted you to have it. (beat) You do what you've gotta do Phil. \nHe leaves Phil standing alone on the porch, full of emotion, trying to grasp it all. \nINT.  HEARING ROOM - DAY \nA small courtroom.  The room is filled with the crew members and their families, including the parents of the victims, as well as the media.  Phil sits with his father and dodges Chuck's eyes.  Coast Guard Officers Tyler, DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings. \nTYLER The United States Coast Guard has been asked to conduct this maritime hearing to consider the revocation of Captain Richard Sheldrake's U.S. Master Seaman's Certificate. \nINT.  HEARING ROOM - LATER \nBill sits at the table with his parents as questions are leveled at him.  Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing ask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the proceedings. \nSkipper stares down Sanders.  He turns to Tyler. \nSANDERS I have no more questions at this time. \nHe turns to sit down, then stops. \nSANDERS Oh, one last thing... Isn't true that your father was a sea Captain? \nSkipper bristles. \nSKIPPER Yes. \nSANDERS Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less. \nSkipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage.  Tyler sees it and tries to intercept. \nTYLER What does this have to do with anything Mr. Sanders? \nSANDERS (smug) Oh, nothing.  I was just curious. \nSKIPPER My father, was more seaman, more of a man, than you might ever hope to be. \nSanders returns to his seat, rattled.  Tyler pounds his gavel. \nTYLER We'll take a brief recess. \nEXT.  BUILDING - DAY \nThe crew huddle in the parking lot.  Fractured, confused. Chuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves. \nTOD There's still a way. \nBILL What do you mean? \nTOD It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order. \nCHUCK You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything. \nTOD They don't know that. (beat) We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid. \nCHUCK But that's not the point... \nTOD That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook. \nLATER \nTod is on the stand. \nDOWNING Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit? \nTOD I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails. \nTyler removes his glasses. \nDOWNING But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard. \nTOD Twice. \nDOWNING Is that what you were trained to do? \nTOD No. \nDOWNING Then what do you think he was trying to do. \nTOD Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas. \nSkipper is becoming uneasy.  He sees what is coming. \nDOWNING So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake? \nTOD No. \nTYLER Then why son, why didn't you follow his order? \nTod meets Skipper's eyes. \nTOD Because -- I panicked. \nThe room is suddenly buzzing.  Tod's Father stands up. \nTOD'S FATHER That's not true Tod. \nTERRY (to Mike) What the hell?  What is he doing. \nMIKE Son of a gun.  He just sent Skipper a life boat. \nTyler turns to Skipper. \nTYLER If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared? \nSKIPPER I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened. \nTYLER Then what are you trying to say then? \nSkipper stands. \nSKIPPER Maybe you can't see what's happening here, but it's clear to me. (to Tod) I appreciate what you're trying to do Tod.  Maybe you could live with it, but I couldn't. (to tribunal) If you think I'm going to let a sixteen year old take responsibility, then you underestimate me.  The Albatross was my ship.  The Ocean Academy was my school.  Her loss is mine and mine alone. (to others) I can't bring your sons back.  If you want my ticket, if that will ease your loss, it's the least I can do.  This... \nSkipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license. \nSKIPPER This is easy.  Living with it, that'll be hard. \n", "test1_input": "FRANCIS I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip. \nSKIPPER I know. \nFrancis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling. \nSKIPPER You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it. (to Philip) Hello, Philip. \nPHIL Sir. \nSkipper's directness bugs Francis. \nFRANCIS Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October. \nSKIPPER As you can see, there's a lot to do. \nFRANCIS Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind. \nSKIPPER This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed. \nSomething in this exchange turns the tone of conversation. \nFRANCIS And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here. \nSKIPPER Happily, it all worked out... This time. (to Bill) Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk. \nPhil follows Bill down the companionway. \nFRANCIS I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me. \nSKIPPER It will be more than that, I can promise you. \nFRANCIS (cool) Take good care of my son. \nThere is threat in his tone. \nSKIPPER We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye. \nFRANCIS He's a big boy. \nFrancis leaves the boat.  Skipper and the crew watch as he climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off. \nLAWFORD Well, that was neighborly. \nSKIPPER He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly. \nLawford shakes his head.  Bill comes up through the companionway. \nSKIPPER Everyone aboard young Bill? \nBILL Yes, Sir. \nSKIPPER Good. (beat) Let's go sailing. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - OPEN WATER - DAY \nThe Albatross is under full power.  There is a sense of excitement and anticipation.  Charlie, Rick, Robin, and Lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail.  Skipper is at the helm with Alice and Bill nearby.  Skipper calls over to Chuck who stands alone at the rail. \nSKIPPER Come over here and take the wheel. \nChuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the wheel. \nSKIPPER Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west. \nCHUCK Yes sir. \nSKIPPER (to all) Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand. (quietly to Bill) Raise the mainsail. \nBILL (calling out) Raise the main! \nLawford and his group bellow out. \nTOGETHER Raise the main!! \nLawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy furled canvas to the main boom.  He guides another to the midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens the halyard and hands it to Robin. \nSKIPPER Take a turn under the pin and lead it out to the others.  You guys in the rear take up the slack.  Heave together now... \nIn a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea chanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt. \nBILL (singing) \"When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup...\" \nThe more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the beat. \nBOYS \"When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup...\" \nLAWFORD Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt it out like men!! \nThe newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look at each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever heard of. \nBILL (singing) \"Not one of us was a sober...\" \nThe boys return the verse half heartedly.  Lawford ties off his line and stares them down.  Skipper notices that the work has stopped. \nSKIPPER What's wrong Mr. Lawford. \nLAWFORD It seems we're short on singers. \nSkipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew. \nSKIPPER Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen.  It lets everyone know you're in sync.  It shows unity, that all thoughts are one.  A crew that sings together stays together. Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and be sailors. \n", "test1_true": "Lawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down with their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  The crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great mainsail starts to rise. \nLAWFORD Tie it off!! \nSKIPPER (to Bill) Outer. \nBILL Outer Jib! \nCHARLIE (confused) Outta what? \nCoached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist the jib. \nSKIPPER (to Bill) We'll bear off to port and run down wind. \nBILL Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward. \nThe newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George, John and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto the footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusion everywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing. \nLawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the others move into their positions.  When Bill sees the yardarm crew is in place... \nBILL Unstop the squares! \nYARDARM CREW Unstop the squares!! \nSKIPPER (to Chuck) Fall off to port.  Ease her around to a heading of northeast.  Sing out when you're there. \nAs the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into a scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind the snapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, the ship heels and surges forward. \nBefore her awakening power, everyone changes their stance and grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out the mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines releasing the stops on the other squaresails. \nCHUCK (in a whisper) Ah... Northeast... sir. \nSKIPPER (barking) Speak up boy! \nChuck jumps, startled.  He self-consciously calls out. \nCHUCK Northeast sir! \nSKIPPER Unfurl the squares! \nTod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending a shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles with the added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice and Lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's position. \nChuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty of the canvas that the Albatross carries. \nBILL Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail! \nSKIPPER Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water. \nCHUCK Yes, sir. \nSKIPPER All stop on the engine. \nBILL All stop on the engine! \nBill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves it to the stop position. \nSKIPPER Behold gentlemen.  The power of the wind! \nAs the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed. Everyone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a powerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through the water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a magical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer. \nSKIPPER Did we lose anybody? \nALICE Not yet. \nLONG SHOT \nThe Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful image of another time.  And yet, here she is. \nON DECK \nEach of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment. Music builds. \nSKIPPER Chart us a course for the windward side. \nAlice considers his request. \nALICE That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there. \nSKIPPER It's time these boys saw some real blue water. \nEXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER \nThe bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a fifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is fierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and sailing well. \nThe crew has never seen mountains of water like this. Disaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front of the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear life.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands effortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains perfectly dry. \nSKIPPER Well... now that I have your undivided attention... I'd like to take this opportunity to make a few points... \nTERRY (aside) This guy is certifiable... \nPHIL Suicidal... \nSKIPPER The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up. \nCaught, Terry and Phil button up. \nSKIPPER Second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr. Butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges.  He's a better sailor today than any ten of you will be when this is all over. \nSkipper directs the next comment directly at John. \n", "test1_id": 2946, "test2_input": "SKIPPER Don't hate yourself.  Hate your weakness.  All right.  Get down. \nRobin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others, mortified. \nSKIPPER I'm only gonna say this one time. I'm not here to wipe noses and asses.  I'm not your mother.  Trust funds and blue blazers don't get you a thing out here.  You wanna act like babies, then get off my boat. \nStunned, the crew is speechless.  Chuck instinctively goes to help Robin.  Skipper snaps like a turtle. \nSKIPPER (to Chuck) He can take care of himself. (to others) Any other 'phobias' I need to know about? \nSkipper fires a look towards Phil. \nPHIL No, sir. \nSKIPPER Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition. \nSkipper turns and then stops. \nSKIPPER Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it. \nCHUCK (aside) Face what? \nThe question hangs in the air like a cloud. \nINT.  CHART HOUSE - DUSK \nThe chart house is the communication and navigation center for the boat.  It also serves as the officers dining room. Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sit around the small table sipping coffee. \nSKIPPER We're awfully quiet tonight. \nThe group remains silent.  Lawford and George exchange a glance.  Skipper catches it. \nSKIPPER Something on your mind, George? \nGeorge looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin. \nGEORGE I think you were too hard on Weathers. \nSKIPPER You do? \nGEORGE Yes.  I do. \nSkipper nods. \nSKIPPER I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together. \nGEORGE (sarcastic) Yes sir. \nSKIPPER You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way. \nEveryone's quiet, but clear.  Skipper and Alice exit. \nGEORGE Fucking bastard. \nLawford lets out a belly laugh. \nLAWFORD I've seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it, screaming, into a bottle.  The bilges are full of them. \nGEORGE What do you mean? \nLAWFORD He's been beyond the reach.  To the edge of the abyss and back.  He'll do well by us all George.  He's a real salt.  There's no malice in him and there's nothing more dear to him than his boys.  So sleep well my friend. \nLawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars, passes one to George and winks. \nINT.  GALLEY - DUSK \nRobin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the horizon.  Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of food. \nCHUCK How ya doing? \nROBIN (without turning) Fine. \nCHUCK Good. \nROBIN Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself. \nCHUCK I just brought you something to eat. \nRobin turns and notices the plate of food and nods.  They stand silently.  It's awkward. \nCHUCK I feel like I got you into this. \nROBIN Forget it. \nCHUCK I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it? \nROBIN (beat) I'm sorry I left you hanging up there. \nCHUCK It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out. \nRobin nods.  They both stare out at the rising moon. \nROBIN My brother and I used to climb to the top of this old beech tree in the back yard and watch the moon come up just like this.  My parents would fight all the time so we'd sneak out there where we couldn't hear 'em and recite scenes from our favorite movies. \nRobin grows quiet. \nROBIN Would you believe I miss it?  The middle of paradise and I'm homesick. \nChuck smiles and puts a hand on his back. \nCHUCK (ironic) Well, I wouldn't worry.  It'll all be there when we get back. \n", "test2_true": "The sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls and pitches.  Chuck sees Terry heaving over the side. John and Tod hear the sound and turn. \nJOHN (disgusted) Come on man.  Show a little backbone! (to Tod) You believe that?! \nTod is fixated on Terry.  Suddenly, without warning, he breaks for the rail and lets fly. \nPhil and Charlie are next.  Chris climbs through the companionway but doesn't make it to the side.  Spontaneous regurgitation.  Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheel housing to avoid being sprayed.  Suddenly everyone is heaving. \nCHRIS Sorry. \nLAWFORD (to Bill) We're gonna have nobody left up here to crew.  Better let Skipper know. \nBill nods and disappears.  John joins Chuck watching the events around him. \nJOHN Well Gieg, I'm glad to see I'm not the only guy on this boat that can take a little rock'n roll.  Bunch of wusses, I swear...! \nChuck watches each of his shipmates.  Then, suddenly, out of nowhere -- Projectile vomit all over John.  He looks at Chuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail. \nJOHN Son of a bitch!! \nChuck looks at John, furious with himself, and begins to laugh.  But after a moment he starts to laugh too.  It's infectious, they crack each other up.  Then, in the middle of belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over the side. \nINT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY \nSkipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in front of him.  There's a knock on the door. \nSKIPPER Come in. \nBILL Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. \nSKIPPER Well, that's all part of it. \nBILL We've got weather moving in from the west. \nSkipper looks up. \nSKIPPER That's part of it, too. \nEXT.  DECK - DUSK \nSkipper stands at the wheelhouse with Lawford, George and Bill, studying the horizon through binoculars.  Dark clouds.  Chuck watches Skipper.  Everyone, looking for a cue. \nCHUCK That a... storm, Skipper? \nSkipper stays glued to the binoculars. \nSKIPPER Uh, huh. \nCHUCK Would you, um, say it's a big storm? \nSKIPPER Sometimes it gets exciting out here. \nLAWFORD What do you think? \nSKIPPER Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting. \nCHUCK Shouldn't we turn away? \nSKIPPER You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight. \nClose on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched tight. \nBELOW DECKS \nBulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly. \nIN THE GALLEY \nPots and pans crash around. \nIN THE MAIN CABIN \nThe cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books on top of Alice.  She turns and looks at the mess, annoyed. \nEXT.  DECK - SAME \nSKIPPER Furl the squares, reef the main, and bend on the storm jib, but keep it furled.  Drop everything but the inner jib.  I want everybody down before we get any lightning. \nBill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders.  Most of the crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging and begin dropping sail. \nGEORGE Why's it always happen at night? \nSkipper regards George, annoyed. \nSKIPPER George... I want hot food in everybody.  Get to it. \nGeorge returns to the galley.  Alice joins Skipper at the wheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear. \nALICE Looks like weather. \nSKIPPER Yep. \nHe slips on a yellow slicker. \nSKIPPER Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear. (to the others) Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks. \nPHIL (impulsively) I'm not staying out here. \nSkipper fires off a look that frightens even Phil. \n", "test2_id": 2947, "test3_input": "But after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip beneath the sea. \nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME \nWater thunders in from every possible exit.  Chris and Rick push Bill towards the dumbwaiter. \nRICK Bill, you go.  We'll be right behind you. \nBefore he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the tiny shaft.  Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser smashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious.  But the pressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the galley and out onto the deck. \nEXT.  DECK - SAME \nSkipper struggles to reach John and the second life boat but sees that it is tangled in the rigging. \nSKIPPER Johnny, it's not good. \nJohn defies him and keeps cutting.  The ship is almost completely submerged. \nJOHN I can get it! \nSuddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges into the water taking lines and rope with it.  John becomes tangled and is dragged into the water.  Only his superior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and keep cutting. \nThe Albatross slips beneath the surface.  Instead of trying to free himself John keeps slashing at the lifeboat lines as he disappears, swallowed by the sea. \nINT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME \nEerie silence.  Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket. Debris float around.  He begins to panic as the water around him rises. \nLAWFORD My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!! \nHe takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.  Then suddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure within. \nON THE SURFACE \nLawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the surface. \nEXT.  SURFACE - SAME \nChuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house door as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'.  Suddenly the ship rolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting up like a huge dorsal fin. \nEXT.  UNDERWATER - SAME \nChuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still finds Robin's arm.  They clasp tightly, but Chuck just can't budge the door.  Then, strangely, Robin releases Chuck's arm and pulls it back through the door.  Chuck looks up, startled.  The small round window in the door is illuminated from the cabin lights on the inside. \nThrough the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes. He fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket.  Robin takes a last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him. \nHe meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange acceptance.  They both know what's happening.  But Robin has refused to take his friend to the bottom with him.  He presses his hand to the glass.  Chuck does the same.  Then with a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door, disappearing into the darkness and eternity. \nEXT.  SURFACE - SAME \nChuck breaks the surface, gasping for air.  He looks around, frantic.  He sees nothing but the sea swells and debris.  All that remains is the sound of the wind and rain on the water. \nSuddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of foam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water like shattered lances as the ship rights herself underwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as if in a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins to rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire length explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave. \nON THE DECK \nLike Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long boat. \nAnd for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea.  Some of the boys begin to cheer prematurely.  But Skipper knows better.  She's filled to the gills with sea water. \nShe shutters.  Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked to the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing, as she finally goes. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nSurvivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the watery tempest.  Strangely, the wind subsides.  The sea becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the water. \nCHUCK OH GOD!!!!! \nHis scream echoes, for the grief of all. \nON THE SURFACE \nThere is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips beneath the waves like a stone.  The stunned crew can only watch. \nThen, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the surface. \nSkipper fights off his emotions.  He knows what it means. John died cutting it free. \nTerry and Bill hang onto a life ring.  Blood runs from Bill's head.  Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto the side of the other freed life boat which has been swamped.  Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but alive.  Several of the boys help pull him towards the boat. \nSkipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for those not accounted for.  But, they are gone. \nAmong the wreckage, the roof of the chart house.  The only sound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell, Robin's bell, still secure in it's fitting. \nEXT.  LIFE BOAT - DAY \nThe boats have been floated and tied together.  Skipper is in one, Lawford in the other.  One of the two boats has been rigged with sail.  Skipper stands in the bow staring into the ink blue water. \nSKIPPER Raise your sail, Bill.  North, north- east.  Keep a sharp look out for Florida. \nBill studies him for a moment, then... \nBILL Maybe we could wait around a little longer, sir... \nThere is a long pause before Skipper answers. \nSKIPPER (quietly) She's gone... She's gone. \nThere is something remarkably touching about this young man trying to take care of him.  He puts a hand on Skipper's shoulder.  It almost makes him crack.  He pats Bill's hand gently. \nSKIPPER Carry on. \n", "test3_true": "SKIPPER North, north-east. (beat) And Dick, please make a note of our final position. \nLawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floating wreckage around them, silent, lost. \nSuddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  The survivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again. \nChuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It's suddenly alive... With sharks. \nLAWFORD Hands and feet inside the boats. \nThey come by the dozens.  Ramming the boats and rummaging through the debris.  They swarm around the boats until it seems as if the water is boiling.  Chuck picks up an oar and starts beating wildly at the sharks. \nCHUCK AAAAHHHH!!!! \nThe others take up the cause and in a moment they are all screaming and cursing the sharks.  It's a frenzy of grief and anger. \nOLDER CHUCK (V.O.) We slashed at the sharks as if striking out at the finger of God. And we all begged silently for the ability to understand what had happened.  But, if there was a God that day, his answer came only in the moaning wind and our questions were left to drift unanswered, in the titanic ocean of our deepest grief. \nExhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost. \nCHUCK (hushed) Wake up.  Wake up.  1-2-3 wake up. \nLike Robin's nightmare of his brother, this is all too real. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nThe tramp freighter GRAN RIO steams toward the life boats. The crew stand silently, watching as the ship approaches. \nEXT.  SHIP - DAY \nChuck stands on the deck of the Gran Rio as the last of the crew scramble up cargo netting hung over the side. Chuck stares out numbly watching as the two deserted long boats drift away. \nEXT.  DECK - GRAN RIO - DAY \nChuck, now dressed, stands in the same spot at the rail, staring out.  A muffled sound pulls Chuck into the present.  He walks slowly down the after deck to a cabin door where sobbing escapes from the other side.  Chuck turns the handle and cracks the door. \nINT.  CABIN - SAME \nCurled up on the floor next to his bunk is Skipper.  A look of shock comes over Chuck's face.  Skipper has come completely unglued, sobbing deeply. \nCHUCK (tentative) Skipper? \nSkipper turns slowly, looking up.  His eyes are red and his face streaked with tears.  He looks at Chuck almost as if he doesn't know who he is.  Lost. \nSKIPPER I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry. \nChuck reels.  It sounds more like a confession than an outpouring of sadness.  Chuck closes the door. \nEXT.  HARBOR - TAMPA FLORIDA - DAY \nSkipper, back in control, and the crew, stand along the port rail of the Gran Rio.  A small flotilla of pleasure boats surround the ship and hundreds of people line the pier.  It's an intimidating sight. \nON THE PIER \nPensive, worried, angry faces of parents and families. Chaos.  Coast Guard Officials try to hold back the mob. \nMAN What about the manifest!!  What about my son!!! \nWOMAN How many made it?  Nobody will tell us anything!! \nOFFICER We don't have a list of survivors yet.  Please stand back.  Don't push! \nAngry shouts drown him out. \nON THE DECK \nThe CAPTAIN of the Gran Rio comes down from the bridge with some of his officers and stand with Skipper and the others.  Several COAST GUARD OFFICERS join them on the deck. \nSkipper turns to the Captain and extends his hand. \nSKIPPER Thank you. \nThe Captain nods.  Skipper turns to his crew, looking over them.  A smile of deep pride passes his lips.  They all see it.  Then, between the Coast Guard Officers, he walks down the ramp.  Lawford and the crew fall in behind. \nEXT.  PIER - SAME \nA shouting mob waits for them.  Reporters and spectators shout and call out questions.  It reaches a fever pitch as the crew descend.  Skipper reaches the bottom of the ramp, his eyes meet a cool, familiar face.  Francis Boutillier. Phil stands next to him, staring at the ground. \nFRANCIS (above the shouting) Welcome home. \nSkipper is shoved forward by the crowd pushing and shoving.  The crew follow but are swept away.  Charlie stops in front of Phil. \nCHARLIE Phil? \nFlash bulbs explode.  Charlie and the others are descended upon as reporters bark out questions. \nREPORTER #1 (shouting) What the hell happened out there captain? \nREPORTER #2 How many boys did you lose...?  And how come you didn't go down with your ship? \nParents begin to realize who has been lost.  Agonizing cries mix with jubilation.  It's emotional chaos.  The crew members are driven apart, they call to each other, suddenly aware of what's happening. \nTOD (panicked) Charlie!!  Bill!! \nTerry suddenly finds himself smothered in the arms of his MOTHER.  He strains to see what is happening to his shipmates. \nTERRY'S MOTHER Oh, sweetheart!  Look at you... \nTERRY Skipper!! \n", "test3_id": 2948}

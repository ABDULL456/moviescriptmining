{"test1_input": "SKIPPER Don't hate yourself.  Hate your weakness.  All right.  Get down. \nRobin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others, mortified. \nSKIPPER I'm only gonna say this one time. I'm not here to wipe noses and asses.  I'm not your mother.  Trust funds and blue blazers don't get you a thing out here.  You wanna act like babies, then get off my boat. \nStunned, the crew is speechless.  Chuck instinctively goes to help Robin.  Skipper snaps like a turtle. \nSKIPPER (to Chuck) He can take care of himself. (to others) Any other 'phobias' I need to know about? \nSkipper fires a look towards Phil. \nPHIL No, sir. \nSKIPPER Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition. \nSkipper turns and then stops. \nSKIPPER Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it. \nCHUCK (aside) Face what? \nThe question hangs in the air like a cloud. \nINT.  CHART HOUSE - DUSK \nThe chart house is the communication and navigation center for the boat.  It also serves as the officers dining room. Skipper, Alice, Lawford, George, and Bill Butler sit around the small table sipping coffee. \nSKIPPER We're awfully quiet tonight. \nThe group remains silent.  Lawford and George exchange a glance.  Skipper catches it. \nSKIPPER Something on your mind, George? \nGeorge looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin. \nGEORGE I think you were too hard on Weathers. \nSKIPPER You do? \nGEORGE Yes.  I do. \nSkipper nods. \nSKIPPER I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together. \nGEORGE (sarcastic) Yes sir. \nSKIPPER You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way. \nEveryone's quiet, but clear.  Skipper and Alice exit. \nGEORGE Fucking bastard. \nLawford lets out a belly laugh. \nLAWFORD I've seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it, screaming, into a bottle.  The bilges are full of them. \nGEORGE What do you mean? \nLAWFORD He's been beyond the reach.  To the edge of the abyss and back.  He'll do well by us all George.  He's a real salt.  There's no malice in him and there's nothing more dear to him than his boys.  So sleep well my friend. \nLawford seductively produces a pair of Havana cigars, passes one to George and winks. \nINT.  GALLEY - DUSK \nRobin leans over the sink elbow deep in dishwater watching through the cabin window, as the sun slips below the horizon.  Chuck stands in the doorway with a plate of food. \nCHUCK How ya doing? \nROBIN (without turning) Fine. \nCHUCK Good. \nROBIN Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself. \nCHUCK I just brought you something to eat. \nRobin turns and notices the plate of food and nods.  They stand silently.  It's awkward. \nCHUCK I feel like I got you into this. \nROBIN Forget it. \nCHUCK I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it? \nROBIN (beat) I'm sorry I left you hanging up there. \nCHUCK It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out. \nRobin nods.  They both stare out at the rising moon. \nROBIN My brother and I used to climb to the top of this old beech tree in the back yard and watch the moon come up just like this.  My parents would fight all the time so we'd sneak out there where we couldn't hear 'em and recite scenes from our favorite movies. \nRobin grows quiet. \nROBIN Would you believe I miss it?  The middle of paradise and I'm homesick. \nChuck smiles and puts a hand on his back. \nCHUCK (ironic) Well, I wouldn't worry.  It'll all be there when we get back. \n", "test1_true": "The sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls and pitches.  Chuck sees Terry heaving over the side. John and Tod hear the sound and turn. \nJOHN (disgusted) Come on man.  Show a little backbone! (to Tod) You believe that?! \nTod is fixated on Terry.  Suddenly, without warning, he breaks for the rail and lets fly. \nPhil and Charlie are next.  Chris climbs through the companionway but doesn't make it to the side.  Spontaneous regurgitation.  Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheel housing to avoid being sprayed.  Suddenly everyone is heaving. \nCHRIS Sorry. \nLAWFORD (to Bill) We're gonna have nobody left up here to crew.  Better let Skipper know. \nBill nods and disappears.  John joins Chuck watching the events around him. \nJOHN Well Gieg, I'm glad to see I'm not the only guy on this boat that can take a little rock'n roll.  Bunch of wusses, I swear...! \nChuck watches each of his shipmates.  Then, suddenly, out of nowhere -- Projectile vomit all over John.  He looks at Chuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail. \nJOHN Son of a bitch!! \nChuck looks at John, furious with himself, and begins to laugh.  But after a moment he starts to laugh too.  It's infectious, they crack each other up.  Then, in the middle of belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over the side. \nINT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - DAY \nSkipper sits at his desk with some charts spread out in front of him.  There's a knock on the door. \nSKIPPER Come in. \nBILL Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side. \nSKIPPER Well, that's all part of it. \nBILL We've got weather moving in from the west. \nSkipper looks up. \nSKIPPER That's part of it, too. \nEXT.  DECK - DUSK \nSkipper stands at the wheelhouse with Lawford, George and Bill, studying the horizon through binoculars.  Dark clouds.  Chuck watches Skipper.  Everyone, looking for a cue. \nCHUCK That a... storm, Skipper? \nSkipper stays glued to the binoculars. \nSKIPPER Uh, huh. \nCHUCK Would you, um, say it's a big storm? \nSKIPPER Sometimes it gets exciting out here. \nLAWFORD What do you think? \nSKIPPER Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting. \nCHUCK Shouldn't we turn away? \nSKIPPER You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight. \nClose on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched tight. \nBELOW DECKS \nBulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly. \nIN THE GALLEY \nPots and pans crash around. \nIN THE MAIN CABIN \nThe cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books on top of Alice.  She turns and looks at the mess, annoyed. \nEXT.  DECK - SAME \nSKIPPER Furl the squares, reef the main, and bend on the storm jib, but keep it furled.  Drop everything but the inner jib.  I want everybody down before we get any lightning. \nBill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders.  Most of the crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging and begin dropping sail. \nGEORGE Why's it always happen at night? \nSkipper regards George, annoyed. \nSKIPPER George... I want hot food in everybody.  Get to it. \nGeorge returns to the galley.  Alice joins Skipper at the wheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear. \nALICE Looks like weather. \nSKIPPER Yep. \nHe slips on a yellow slicker. \nSKIPPER Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear. (to the others) Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks. \nPHIL (impulsively) I'm not staying out here. \nSkipper fires off a look that frightens even Phil. \n", "test1_id": 2946, "test2_input": "Terry pops up, pissed that they're reeling him back in. \nSuddenly the animal on the other end of Robin's line explodes out of the sea.  It's a six foot Thresher shark. Terry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and screaming. \nTERRY Get me out!!!  Get me out!!! \nMIKE Oh my god!!  It's a... \nSKIPPER (calmly) Shark. (to Robin) Don't lose it son. \nGeorge grabs a gaffing hook while Robin fights the rod, trying to bring in the big fish. \nGEORGE Keep it coming. \nRobin battles the fish.  George clumsily tries to help. The crew make their way to the rear to watch. \nCHARLIE Whoops. \nCharlie and Rick and the others heave to get Terry up. Finally he makes it.  Sprawling onto the deck. \nTERRY Oh Jesus!  Oh Jesus Christ!! \nThe crew turn and cheer Robin on as he brings the shark alongside. \nGEORGE He must be two hundred pounds! Bring him in close and try to hold him steady. \nGeorge leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook into a gill.  Several of the boys hold onto him as the fish flops around violently. \nGEORGE Got him! \nSkipper comes down to inspect the catch.  The shark is longer than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water, snapping and twisting.  Terry stands shaking, freaked. All of them are. \nRICK Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister Mary Anne's butt. \nThe guys laugh nervously.  Terry just stares at the man eater, but it's infectious.  After a moment he's laughing too.  Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile. \nSKIPPER Well, now you have something to write home about. \nMore laughter.  Suddenly, Tom, who is lookout on the foretop, cries out. \nTOM Land ho!!!  Land ho!!! \nEveryone turns around to look.  The guys at the stern let go of George and he nearly tumbles overboard.  In that instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears back into the sea.  Robin and George share a stunned look. \nGEORGE Shit. \nROBIN There's more where that came from. \nSkipper returns to the wheelhouse with Alice.  Together they scan the horizon.  Clouds build over the land ahead. \nALICE Cheated death again. \nHe slips an arm around her. \nSKIPPER Yep. \nEXT.  ANTIGUA - HARBOR - DAY \nA group of islanders have assembled to watch the crew approach in the long boats. \nINT.  LONG BOAT - SAME \nChuck gazes across the strange landscape.  As the boats dock, the crew pile out and scatter.  Local children follow them wherever they go.  Chuck, Robin and John find themselves alone.  Most of the buildings are primitive. They wander over to a shop. \nROBIN What do you say?  Cokes?  I'm buying. \nCHUCK & JOHN Sure. \nEXT.  SHOP \nChuck and Robin reappear, sipping cold Cokes.  Mike and Chris walk by across the street.  Robin speaks up loud enough for them to hear. \nROBIN You're right Chuck.  There's nothing quite as refreshing as a cold ten cent Coke that only costs ten cents! \nThe three clink their bottles.  Mike and Chris slink away. \nEXT.  COLONIAL FORT - DAY \nA crumbling fort overlooks the harbor.  Below, the Albatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water. Large bronze muzzle-loading cannons still lie in their gunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that will never come. \nEach of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the Caribbean view. \nROBIN You think Skipper and Alice do it? \nCHUCK Do what? \nROBIN Ya know... \"It\". \nCHUCK That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know? \nJOHN She isn't that old. \nCHUCK What do you mean? \nJOHN I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty. \nROBIN How would you know? \nJOHN Trust me donut.  I know. \nROBIN What?  Come on... \n", "test2_true": "CHUCK No way! \nROBIN Come on man, what'd they look like? \nJOHN Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair. \nROBIN I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em. \nThey crack up. \nCHUCK I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in. \nJOHN That's what they get for not locking the door. \nCHUCK So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath. \nROBIN So... What happened? \nCHUCK My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice \"What?\" \nJohn and Robin crack up. \nROBIN What'd you do? \nCHUCK I said \"Sorry, wrong room\" and walked away. \nJOHN Did you shut the door at least? \nThey bust up again.  Chuck glares back. \nCHUCK I don't remember. \nRobin sits up on his cannon and looks out, suddenly melancholy. \nROBIN My parents don't do it anymore. \nCHUCK How do you know?  They might. \nROBIN 'Cause they're getting a divorce. (beat) That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business. \nJOHN They tell you that? \nROBIN I figured it out. \nCHUCK Yeah. \nJOHN My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters. \nROBIN It matters to me. \nJOHN (kindly) Okay donut.  Whatever you say. \nCHUCK We better get back. \nRobin looks up to John. \nROBIN Did you really see 'em. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - HARBOR - NIGHT \nThe boat moves off leaving the lights of Antigua behind. Chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nThe wind is up and the seas are high.  The ship is under full sail driving at top speed.  Foam sprays from the bow as it slices through the water -- what she was born to do. The crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of the performance. \nTod is at the wheel with Chris nearby.  The sails tower above him like a mountain of silk.  He wrestles the wheel, careful to hold his course against the powerful trade winds. \nSkipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the compass and nods. \nSKIPPER It's a good sail boys. \nTod and Chris beam.  Compliments are rare from this man. \nTOD Thank you, sir.  Shall we trim the main Skipper?  I think we could get another knot or two. \nSkipper turns and looks at Tod, a twinkle in his eye. \nSKIPPER As you like. \nGravy.  The two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet tackle.  Phil joins them. \nPHIL What do you say I have a crack at the wheel? \nTOD I'd say, fuck off junior. \nThey laugh.  Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and angry.  He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart house. \nAs Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and stretches against the powerful wind. \nPhil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the chart house and silently fires.  There is a wicked POP as the spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits. \nTOD Jesus Christ!!  Let it out.  Let it out!! \nThe sound brings Skipper onto the deck like a shot. \nSKIPPER Hard to port!  Hard to port!! \nCalamity, as Tod cranks the ship into the wind.  The canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop.  People dive everywhere to drop sail. \n", "test2_id": 2947, "test3_input": "SKIPPER Spirits have a way of bringing that out. \nGEORGE And being sixteen. \nSKIPPER They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too. (beat) I promise you one thing... \nGEORGE What's that? \nSKIPPER They'll know about it in the morning. \nSkipper smiles. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nThe drunken crew stumble out of the woods onto the beach. As they ready the boat for the trip back Robin looks out to sea... \nROBIN (alarmed) Jesus H. Christ. \nTod looks up. \nTERRY What now pork chop? \nROBIN Look! \nThe guys turn their gaze to the ocean.  The Albatross... is gone! \nTERRY Holy shit!  Where'd she go? \nThe crew is suddenly stone sober.  Stunned. \nCHARLIE What the hell is going on? \nMIKE She's gone!  The boat's gone!! \nPhil breaks into sort of a blind panic. \nPHIL Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!! \nJOHN Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister. \nCHUCK Alright.  Everybody just stay cool. We'll figure this out. \nMIKE Who the hell checked the mooring? \nROBIN I did.  Why? \nCHARLIE Maybe she pulled free... \nMIKE What if they don't know.  If she's adrift, if they're asleep, she could run aground.  She could break up on the reef. \nPHIL (to Robin) Maybe you didn't check it good enough. \nROBIN (defensive, frightened) I did.  I swear. \nOddly, it's Phil who stands up for Robin. \nPHIL Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't. \nJOHN That's enough. \nPHIL How the hell are we gonna get outta here? \nJOHN We'll think of something. \nPHIL Oh, praise the lord. (announcing) Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something. \nWithout warning.  John lunges at Phil.  Phil screams, trying to defend himself.  The guys all dive in.  Suddenly it's an all out brawl. \nJohn out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat of the boat. \nSuddenly, from behind, comes a blistering \"THWACK!!\" as Chuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head. Stunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood dripping from the back of his head. \nJOHN Nobody calls me an idiot. \nHe weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand. The guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover. \nPHIL God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose! \nCHUCK Shut up, Phil. \nChuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over and vomits. \nTERRY Well that's just great.  Now what are we supposed to do? \nChuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palm tree, propping him up.  The others huddle to stay warm. \nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING \nThe crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day.  Bloodied and sun burned.  A fly buzzes around Rick's face, waking him.  He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus.  He gazes across the water, stupefied. \nRICK Oh-my-god... \nThe others stir and follow his gaze.  The Albatross sits in exactly the spot where they left her. \nROBIN I'm not sure if this is really good or really bad. \nEXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY \nThe sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly.  George tries to maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his hands. \nGEORGE I got a live one! \n", "test3_true": "SKIPPER The thing about fishing George, is you need to let 'em run some.  Give 'em just enough slack so they don't break the line.  But at the same time you've gotta keep enough tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em in slowly so they don't really know they're hooked. \nSuddenly George's line goes slack.  He nearly falls over backwards. \nGEORGE I'll try and remember that. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nHound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys stand before Skipper and the others.  Skipper looks dark and angry. \nSKIPPER You know what a loose cannon is? 'Bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship.  All it took was one, crashing around the deck in a storm... It'd smash everything in its way, maybe take out a mast or punch a hole right through the hull.  Think about it, just one cannon not tied down, not anchored, could take a whole 'Man of War' straight to the bottom. \nMIKE (aside) But we don't have any cannons? \nChris jabs him in the ribs. \nCHRIS (hushed) Shut up! \nSkipper turns and faces them. \nSKIPPER Now, if the Skipper were smart, if he could see a storm building, why he'd cut loose every gun on his boat.  Even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea.  Better chance running for port than risk the entire ship, his crew. \nHe takes a pause making sure he has their attention for this part. \nSKIPPER People are like that sometimes. They cut loose and before you know it, they're knocking holes in everything.  So you gotta ask yourself if it might not be better to just put 'em off before they sink the whole thing.  I mean after all, you can always get new cannons. \nHe walks back to his place at the rail. \nSKIPPER (beat) I want a tight ship, everybody shaved and in clean clothes when we make Curacao.  If it goes well, if your mid terms are acceptable, I may reconsider my decision about the rest of the trip.  That's all. \nDejected, the crew goes below. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nUnder sail.  Skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the crew taking exams.  Each writes furiously as Alice scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the chart house door. \nAs the boys scratch out the problems, John seems paralyzed.  He looks over at Phil and copies down his answer.  He checks crib notes hidden in his shorts.  Chuck and Robin both see this and exchange looks. \nINT.  AFT CABIN - DAY \nJohn makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the head.  Robin follows.  Chuck drops down the aft companionway, intercepting John. \nCHUCK Where you going? \nJOHN To take a piss. \nROBIN Really? \nJohn turns around, surprised, sandwiched. \nJOHN Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me? \nCHUCK If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right. \nJOHN You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way! \nChuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove John inside. \nJOHN What the hell!!! \nChuck manages to pin John.  Robin checks his pockets and comes up with the crib notes.  Chuck lets go.  John snatches them, ashamed. \nCHUCK Takin' a piss? \nJohn turns away. \nROBIN Why, man? \nJOHN I don't have to listen to this. \nCHUCK Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you don't, I'm gonna go right up there and have a heart to heart with Skipper and you'll be on the first plane back to idiotville. \nJohn lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.  Robin leaps on top of John. \nROBIN Cut it out man!!  Stop it!!!  What's the matter with you?  If Phil had caught you he'd have ratted you out in a second.  You get caught cheating, you'll get kicked off the boat. \nJohn explodes, tears flowing. \nJOHN I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?! \nCHUCK What? \nHe lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his emotions. \nJOHN I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?! \nCHUCK You're not a moron. \nJOHN Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary. \nJohn chokes back a sob. \nJOHN Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule. \nPHIL I can show you how to use a slide rule. \nThe three turn around, startled. \nROBIN How long you been standing there? \n", "test3_id": 2948}

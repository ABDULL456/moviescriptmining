He reaches into the Rover, lifting out the unconscious Sam. He carries him in both arms, staggering across the dock -- back arched, arms beginning to sag -- and into the corridor. 
79   INT. CORRIDOR                                                79 
Sam promptly collapses and DROPS the unconscious Sam onto the floor. 
SAM Gerty! 
Gerty approaches, gliding along his rail. Sam is freaking out big time, exhausted, panic-stricken, bewildered. 
SAM (CONT'D) I found him outside by the stalled harvester. Who is he? What the fuck is going on? 
A pause. Gerty literally seems lost for words. 
SAM (CONT'D) (demanding an answer) Gerty! 
GERTY We need to get him to the Infirmary. 
SAM Not until you tell me who he is! 
GERTY Sam, we need to get him to the Infirmary immediately. 
Sam SCOOPS the unconscious Sam up off the ground and lifts him towards the INFIRMARY -- staggering -- stumbling -- going: 
SAM Who is he! Who is he! 
Sounding like some deranged homeless man. Gerty gliding alongside him. 
CUT TO: 
80   INT. INFIRMARY -- DAY                                        80 
Lying in the Infirmary bed, propped on a pillow, is the first Sam, the bearded Sam, who we will now refer to as SAM 
He has a wicked black eye and a purple bruise on the right side of his face, looks like he was on the losing end of a brawl. 
He has a DRIP stuck in his arm and a tangle of WIRES attached to his bare chest. A MACHINE is BEEPING away. 
Gerty hovers over him, redressing the BANDAGE on Sam 1's left hand, the one he scolded a while back. 
81   INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER                                      81 
Sam 1's eyes pop open, he is awake, staring directly at Gerty. 
GERTY Hello Sam. (a beat) How are you feeling? 
SAM 1 Where am I? 
GERTY The Infirmary. You had an accident out by one of the harvesters. Do you remember? 
For a second this is playing out like the other Infirmary scene. A case of deja-vu. 
Sam 1's eyes twitch as he catalogues through his memory. Yes he remembers the crash. He remembers something else, too. 
SAM 1 I saw someone out there, Gerty. 
GERTY Who did you see, Sam? 
Just then Sam 1 notices the other Sam -- the more current, clean-shaven Sam -- who we will now refer to as SAM 2. He is standing against the wall watching Sam 1. 
SAM 1 I saw a girl. 
GERTY You saw a girl out by the harvester? How is that possible? 
Sam 1 continues to stare at Sam 2, hardly believing his eyes. 
GERTY (CONT'D) Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries, but all in all the prognosis is good. I'm happy to see you again. 
As he says this Sam 2 crosses slowly from one side of the room to the other, never taking his eyes off Sam 1. It's like Sam 2 is purposefully keeping his distance, reluctant, afraid even, to approach any closer. 
Meanwhile Sam 1 is beginning to look spooked.

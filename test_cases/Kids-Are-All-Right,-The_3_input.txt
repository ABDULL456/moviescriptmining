Nic tightens at the mention of Paul. 
JOEL So, the kids have been spending time with him? 
NIC Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together. 
STELLA (senses the sarcasm) Well, it's great they like him so much.   You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm. 
NIC (CONT'D) Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet? Jules gives Nic a look.   Joel and Stella feel the tension between them. 
STELLA Hey, have you guys tried those AÃ§ai fruit packs? 
JULES No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods. 
STELLA I know.    Joel's addicted. 
JOEL What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational. 
Nic slaps her forehead. NIC Oh, just fucking kill me... 
Everyone stiffens.   Jules is embarrassed. JULES Honey... 
NIC I'm sorry guys, but I just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes. (mocking-voice) "Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves." God! What a bunch of bullshit! 
Nic takes a big swallow from her glass.   Jules windshield wipes Nic's forearm. 
JULES (sotto) How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes. 
NIC You know what, Jules?! I like my wine! Okay? So fucking sue me! And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan! 
JULES Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day! 
NIC Fuck you. Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen. 
JULES I'm sorry. 
INT. RESTAURANT BAR - MINUTES LATER 
Jules walks over to the bar. Nic is sitting in the corner. JULES What the hell is going on with you? 
NIC This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy! I feel like he's taking over my family. 
Jules tries to bring it down.   She yells in hushed tones. JULES No. He's not! 
NIC (nerves fraying) Okay! Okay. I'm sorry.      I'm just exhausted... 
JULES Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge. 
NIC (self-pitying) Sure, and who's gonna pay for that? Jules looks pissed off, and hurt. 
NIC (CONT'D) Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here.

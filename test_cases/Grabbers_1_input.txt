PADDY We're here. 
EXT. BEACH, CAVE MOUTH - DAY 
They stand before the cave mouth, taking it in. Dark and oppressive and claustrophobic. Water drips within. A wave washes up behind them, drenching their feet. 
PADDY Tides coming in. Another hour and this place will be under water. 
O'SHEA Wait here. 
PADDY You can be sure of it. 
Lisa and O'Shea turn on their high beam flashlights and venture into the cave, Mulder and Scully style. 
Water drips from the cave walls while the sound of crashing waves echoes throughout. 
At the cave mouth, the dregs of a wave wash over Paddy's boots. He looks into the cave, anxiously. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       47. 
Venturing further into the shadowy cave, Lisa finds an arched entrance to the rising ocean as fog creeps around her feet. 
O'Shea rounds some rocks, finding Lisa and seeing her flashlight has found a fisherman's shredded slicker. (The remains of the Merry Widow's Deckhand Greg.) 
LISA Are we missing some fishermen? 
O'SHEA (CALLS OUT) Hello! 
Lisa jolts, startled by O'Shea. 
LISA My heart!    What are you doing? 
O'SHEA Just checking. Well, if you know of a better way? (CALLS AGAIN) Hello?! 
LISA What are you expecting?   "Helloooo, 'tis only me." 
A SHADOW rises up stealing the light. O'Shea and Lisa turn. They lift the flashlights and take in the horrifying sight. 
O'SHEA Run! 
They take off, running for the slim cave mouth. Their lights dancing in the darkness as they scramble for the exit -- leading onto the beach. The narrow gap allows just one person at a time. And at a push. Lisa edges through first. 
INT./EXT. BEACH CAVE OPENING - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
O'Shea waits behind Lisa, watching behind them, and sees the light of his flashlight go dark, swallowed by something coming his way. 
O'SHEA Lisa!   Hurry! 
LISA I'm trying! 
O'SHEA Move your arse! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         48. 
O'Shea pushes on her arse as she squeezes through. 
LISA Get your hands off my arse! 
O'Shea shoves harder. 
LISA I swear to God, if you don't stop! 
Lisa kicks back at him, but he keeps pushing. She tumbles onto the seaweed strewn sands, drenched by the incoming tide, as O'Shea squeezes through next. Soon, wedged in himself. 
O'SHEA If I die in here I want you to know it's all your fault! 
LISA Oh shut up. 
Lisa wraps her arms around O'Shea, cheek-to-awkwardly- intimate-cheek and pulls, dragging him loose. With effort. 
The Grabber rushes towards O'Shea, gaining speed.    Almost on him when he escapes, seconds to spare. 
BAM! The Grabber fills the gap in the rock face, trapped by its own bulk. It snarls as one of its tentacles slithers out towards them, but quickly retreats back inside. 
LISA The size of it. 
They back up, horrified. 
O'SHEA It's OK. It can't get us on dry land. Not when it's not raining, it can't. 
WHIPAH! A barbed tongue shoots out from the darkness of the cave and lances O'Shea's Garda hat clean off his head. O'Shea blinks, feeling his bare head. 
O'SHEA ... What? 
A THUNDER-CRACK from the ominous rain clouds. 
LISA Leg it! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       49. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Paddy steps out of the way of an oncoming wave and kicks something with his heel. He kneels down and finds an EGG.

Vincent rips the poster off the wall. 
TECHNICIAN Hey -- c'mon -- 
VINCENT I'll buy you a new one. (TO MINDY) What's the Hab's location? 
MINDY 31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west. 
Vincent marks it off on the map with a sharpie. Draws Mark's location. He needs a ruler. Looks around, grabs the Technician's notebook out of his hands. Uses the spine to connect the dots. Studies it. Grins. 
VINCENT I know where he's going. 
Vincent, lost in his own world now, bolts for his office. As he hurries away (leaving Mindy and the Technician behind): 
VINCENT (CONT'D) I need to get on an airplane! 
TECHNICIAN Who's he talking to? 
MINDY I'm honestly not sure. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark's Rover 2 crests a hill, approaching HIS DESTINATION: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
There, buried in a mound of Martian sand, we catch a glint of metal in the sunlight. 
As Mark drives towards it... 
INT. JPL LOBBY - DAY 
Bruce waits in the lobby as Vincent walks through the front doors. 
TITLE: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California 
They shake hands. 
INT/EXT. JPL STORAGE - DAY 
Bruce and Vincent hurry across the JPL campus. In the background, deer frolic. (NOTE: This is real. Deer frolic out in the open on the JPL grounds. NOTE: It's awesome.) 
VINCENT What are the odds Mark can get it working again? 
BRUCE Hard to say. We lost contact in `97. We think it was battery failure. (THEN) Though I'd like to point out it lasted three times longer than expected in any scenario. 
VINCENT Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce. I want talk to everyone who was here in 
BRUCE They're already waiting for you. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark, on foot now, digs at the location. As he begins to reveal the buried metal... 
INT. JPL - GARAGE 
Vincent and Bruce enter the cavernous JPL garage. A large crowd mills around an APPARATUS covered by a sheet. 
VINCENT This the replica? 
Bruce nods, pulls off the sheet to reveal... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VINCENT (CONT'D) Pathfinder. 
The American spacecraft launched in 1996. It's in two notable sections -- the large LANDER and the smaller SOJOURNER ROVER. 
Vincent's eyes gleam as he stares at the craft. 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark has now uncovered Pathfinder. He stares at it with a similar gleam in his eye. Then he drags the Lander to the back of Rover 2, begins lashing it to a makeshift hitch... 
TITLE: SOL 109 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
Sojourner now sits beside the workbench outside the Hab, watching as Mark methodically takes apart the Lander. 
It looks like he's been at this a while. He removes the battery, replaces it with an environment heater. Like a surgeon performing a heart transplant. 
He locks the heater into place, and as it CLICKS we -- 
CUT TO BLACK.

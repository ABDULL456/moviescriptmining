TRASK Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin' else: first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute found a couple in her personal remains. We got dates of Cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the dates of death of McKenna and Page. We got some hints of his personal history. His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13. His mother pinned all her hopes on her son. He won a national science youth award at the age of eight. They had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time. She saw a good thing. He graduated from high school at 14 -- college at 16 -- no friends -- The kids in his class thought of him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at 18 -- married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter. The marriage lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it annulled. She says he was impotent. World War II he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details. We think we know why he killed Grunemann -- he found out Cable was a dumper; Cable couldn't take that. We think we know why he killed McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail him for it. All fine. But we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go any-damn-where. 
KLUTE That's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive. We wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter. It didn't work out just that way. 
The Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart. The first Technician scoops the torn up photographs into another collecting box. Trask retrieves the company outing photograph. 
TRASK Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway. 
KLUTE I left them here. I was doing some work here. 
Trask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying his relationship with Bree. Klute is clearly unresponsive. Trask resumes. 
TRASK It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here. 
KLUTE Nobody's seen that. 
TRASK If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter. 
ROSS Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it. 
KLUTE He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago. 
TRASK He sure chalks up a lot of flight time. 
Klute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO -- 
INT. STAIRWELL: BREE - DAY 
Bree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians coming down -- stands aside to let them pass -- starts up again and comes face to face with Klute. On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a shyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manner is arduous. She smiles nervously, asks -- 
BREE Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam? 
KLUTE Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment. 
BREE (mock delight) Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints. (then) Can I go in? I need some stuff. 
He nods; she starts by. Then -- 
KLUTE Where'd you spend last night? 
BREE With Trina. 
KLUTE I called Trina. 
BREE Maybe I wasn't there when you called. 
KLUTE Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad. 
BREE (cuts in harshly) How do you know how bad it was? 
KLUTE Why couldn't you stay here with me? 
BREE Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that! 
Pause. Then, evenly -- 
KLUTE Trask wants to talk with you. 
She starts on, then turns back toward him -- rather pleadingly -- 
BREE Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a -- 
KLUTE Trask wants to talk with you. 
She continues on up; Klute continues down. 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Entering without greeting Trask (his manner is not uncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like) she quickly gathers up a few properties, a change of shoes.

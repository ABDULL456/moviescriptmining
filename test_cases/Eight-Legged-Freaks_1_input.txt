INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT 
A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file into a slightly more open area with two branching tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with barrels of toxic waste. 
CHRIS I don't believe it... 
Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the barrel in the drainage ditch. 
MIKE I've seen one of these before! 
ASHLEY What are they? 
CHRIS Toxic waste. 
SAM Where did you see it, Mike? 
MIKE The creek where Joshua gets his spider food. There was one in the water. 
Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel. 
CHRIS We can get out this way! 
BRET No, we can't. (turns to Wade) Isn't that tunnel blocked off, Dad? 
Chris and the others look at Wade. 
WADE Uh... yeah... he's right.   We can't get out that way. 
CHRIS You did this? 
WADE I knew you'd never sell... We're under my property so... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SAM You put all of us at risk. 
WADE I didn't have a choice! I was broke! They gave me a hundred grand! 
Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground. 
SAM I think our lives are worth a little more than that. 
CHRIS We're wasting time. 
Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after them. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs runs along the roof into both tunnels. 
CHRIS One end of these lights should be connected to a generator. That'll be near the entrance. 
They continue down the tunnel.     Entering... 
INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT 
A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground. Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches. 
WADE My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't lying! That's what I can put on the insurance form... giant spiders! 
ASHLEY Ewww... what's that smell? 
The others are reacting strongly. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHRIS Methane.   This cavern is full of gas. 
ASHLEY What does that mean? 
CHRIS One spark and we're all dead. 
Norman swallows his glowing joint. 
Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.

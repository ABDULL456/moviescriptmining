LUCY If I do? 
Emily holds her gaze, seeing the fear. Backing away, Lucy indicates the bus. 
LUCY I have to go. They get mad when I miss the bus. 
Lucy turns to go. Emily watches. Helpless. 
EMILY Lucy, wait... 
Takes her cell phone from her bag. Puts her number on speed dial. 
EMILY If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it. 
Tucks the cell phone in Lucy's coat pocket. 
EMILY I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise. 
Lucy boards the bus. Waves to Emily from a back window as it drives away. Emily waves back, heart in her throat. Might be the last time she sees her alive. 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A sleepless night finds Emily slouched on her sofa, leaving a MESSAGE: 
ANSWERING MACHINE Hey, this is Doug, here it comes - 
BEEP. 
EMILY It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this. 
Hangs up. Clicks on the tv remote. Channel-surfs. World news. Cooking show. Home shopping network. 
Hip-hop music video. Watches it for a moment. Gangster with a mic. Scantily-clad girls shaking their asses. 
The phone RINGS. Emily mutes the tv, picks up. 
EMILY Too late, I met someone else... 
A child's whisper. 
LUCY (V.O.) Emily...? 
EMILY (concerned but calm) Lucy? Are you okay? 
LUCY (V.O.) I'm scared... 
EMILY Why? Why are you scared, honey? 
LUCY (V.O.) They're waiting to get me, I can hear them... I'm sorry... 
EMILY Why are you sorry? 
LUCY (V.O.) I'm falling asleep... 
EMILY Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...? 
LUCY (V.O.) (softly; drifting off) I'm sooorry... 
EMILY Lucy, no, wake up! 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The cell phone lying on the bed at Lucy's fingertips. 
EMILY (FROM PHONE) Lucy...?! 
The illuminated screen casts an eerie glow on her SLEEPING FACE. 
INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Emily drops the phone. Moment of panic. Then a decision. Throws a coat on over her bed clothes. Grabs the phone again, dials a number in desperation. 
EMILY Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening -- (LOSES IT) HELP ME! 
EXT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Emily fumbles with her keys. Gets the right one in the door. Opens it. Jumps in. Starts the engine. Peels off down the road. 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The cell phone turns itself off, plunging the room into total darkness. 
In BLACK, we hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. Down the hall. Stopping at the door. The knob turning. The click of the latch. The door opening. A shaft of light. Edward and Margaret peering in with frenzied anticipation: 
Lucy is asleep. The time has come. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT

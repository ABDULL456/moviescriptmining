ERIC Jeff doesn't dance, Amy--he has no rhythm. Of all his many gifts, rhythm is not one. 
AMY That's not true. He played the trombone in high school. He won a prize. Eric seems startled by this, amused. 
ERIC Seriously? Amy nods. She drains her beer, tosses the cup aside. 
AMY Jeff's won prizes for everything. His Mom has a whole room built just for them. Trophies and ribbons and plaques. He's a very accomplished young man. (she holds out her hand-to 
ERIC) You? 
ERIC (he shakes his head) I don't dance on sand. Stacy makes a SNORTING sound. 
STACY Or grass. Or cement. Or carpet. 
ERIC I dance on teak. 
AMY Teak? 
ERIC It's a type of wood. Very rare. Find me a teak floor and I'll be a dancing fool. Amy shifts toward Mathias, holds out her hand. He stares at it, then glances at Jeff. Before he can speak, Stacy pushes herself to her feet; she's almost as wobbly as Amy. 
STACY I'll dance. 
They lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire. The boys watch them go. A beat, then Jeff glances at his watch. 
JEFF I'm gonna head back. Eric gives him a look of disappointment, 
ERIC You're kidding. Jeff seems STARTLED by this: 
JEFF What? 
ERIC How long is med school? Four years? Jeff nods. ERIC (cont'd) And then you got, whaddya call it, residency? Another nod. Eric turns toward Mathias. ERIC (cont'd) He's gonna be grinding away all that time. Sleepless. Fucking miserable. And know what? He's gonna look back on this night, us right here, and he's gonna say to himself, shit, I wish I'd-- 
JEFF Gone to bed earlier. Eric stares at him; this wasn't the direction he was heading. JEFF (cont'd) If I'm gonna be so short on sleep, I should get as.much as I can now, don't you think? He stands up, brushes the sand from his shorts. Eric shrugs, lifts his cup toward him. 
ERIC All work and no play-- 
JEFF Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. With that, Jeff nods good night to them, then starts off toward the hotel. Eric and Mathias turn back toward the bonfire. They sit in silence, watching the girls dance. After a moment, Amy staggers away from the other dancers, toward a group of young men, drinking together in the shadows. She reaches down, pulls one of them to his feet, starts to drag him back toward the bonfire. The young man is tall, with long blond hair. He LAUGHS, tries to free himself, but Amy is insistent; she keeps pulling at him, and finally he surrenders. They begin to dance. Stacy is dancing on her own, eyes shut, oblivious. Mathias glances toward Eric. Eric shrugs. 
ERIC Amy drifts sometimes, when she drinks. 
MATHIAS Drifts? 
ERIC Like a boat--she bumps into other boats. They continue to watch. Amy and her partner's dancing is becoming steadily more intimate, the gap between their bodies narrowing, then disappearing altogether. Finally, Eric pushes himself to his feet.' ERIC (cont'd) Come on. Let's save everyone some grief. He starts. forward, followed by Mathias. They join Stacy and Amy, and Eric subtly interrupts Amy's pas de deux. The blond- haired young man disengages, drifts back toward his friends. 
EXT. CANCUN BEACH - DAWN 
It's quiet, the sun just breaking the horizon; the beach is nearly empty. A handful of hotel employees are tidying up after the bonfire: carrying off the empty kegs, raking clean the rubbish-strewn sand. Gulls hover overhead, CAWING. 
Jeff appears, running along the beach, his T-shirt soaked with sweat. He stops as he nears us, stands for a moment just above the line of surf, catching his breath, watching the sun rise. Then he turns, starts toward the hotel. 
EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - TERRACE - DAWN 
A breakfast buffet: trays of pancakes, eggs, fresh fruit. There are a dozen tables beneath brightly colored umbrellas. Mathias is the only diner at this hour; he's dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. He studies a piece of paper as he eats. 
JEFF (O.S.) You're up early. Mathias lifts his head: Jeff is standing there in his sweaty shirt, smiling down at him.

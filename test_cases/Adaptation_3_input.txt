MCKEE God fucking help you! It's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character. You must present the internal conflicts of your character in image, in symbol. Film is a medium of movement and image. 
Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. "Any idiot..." writes the guy on one side of him. "Flaccid..." writes the guy on the other side. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Okay, one hour for lunch. 
EXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Students exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 
McKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a bust of Aristotle on the cover. 
MCKEE You want your writing to be original. You want to have an original voice like Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me tell you something, my friends. The key to originality is not eccentricity. 
A guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative "mmmm." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 
It's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly planted on his face as he talks and talks. 
MCKEE Long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema. The Greeks called it stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of ideas. A long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute. Look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. The ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid. Life is rarely vivid. And that's an important point. We are not recreating life on the screen. Writers are not tape recorders. Have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop? Then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. Real people are not interesting. There's not a person in this world -- and I include myself in this -- who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER STILL 
McKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee. 
MCKEE Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty. 
He pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then: 
MCKEE (cont'd) (deadpan) Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends, that there's a fucking God. 
The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter. Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Okay. That's it for tonight. Remember, there'll be a Q and A tomorrow morning before class starts. 
INT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Kaufman tosses and turns in bed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DREAM-LIKE FIELD - DAY 
The daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING 
Kaufman, bleary-eyed, sits in the back.   McKee paces. 
MCKEE Anyone else? 
Kaufman timidly raises his hand. 
MCKEE (cont'd) Yes? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KAUFMAN You talked about Crisis as the ultimate decision a character makes, but what if a writer is attempting to create a story where nothing much happens, where people don't change, they don't have any epiphanies. They struggle and are frustrated and nothing is resolved. More a reflection of the real world -- 
MCKEE The real world? The real fucking world? First of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you'll bore your audience to tears. Secondly: Nothing happens in the real world? Are you out of your fucking mind? People are murdered every day! There's genocide and war and corruption! Every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else! Every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else! People find love! People lose it, for Christ's sake! A child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman! If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know much about life! And why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie? I don't have any use for it! I don't have any bloody use for it! 
KAUFMAN Okay, thanks. 
EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT 
The last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits, leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him. 
KAUFMAN Mr. McKee? 
MCKEE Yes? 
KAUFMAN I'm the guy you yelled at this morning. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MCKEE (trying to recall) I need more. 
KAUFMAN I was the one who thought things didn't happen in life.

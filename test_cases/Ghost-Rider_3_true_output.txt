RAIN'S EYES are fluttering. Extreme concentration. 
THE PEN levitates, tilts into her outstretched hands. The RADIO squeals painfully, pure strident STATIC. Odell punches a new station, but the STATIC continues, grows -- Rain ATTACKS, stabbing the pen into Odell's thigh. He SCREAMS, slams the brakes, loses control of the truck -- 
EXT. HIGHWAY/CORNFIELD - DAY 
The Hummer barrels off the road, SLAMS down hard into a concrete culvert. Without missing a beat, Rain is out and away, plunging into the cornfield. Carrigan and Landsdale bolt after her, guns drawn -- 
ON RAIN, weaving between the stalks. She reaches an old farm implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her taped bindings. Then she's up again, running -- 
ON CARRIGAN AND LANDSDALE searching high and low. Carrigan SEES movement to his right, surges forward -- -- but Rain jigs left and Carrigan misses her, tripping over the farm implement instead. He cuts himself, curses -- Rain continues, straight ahead now. Carrigan motions to Landsdale. The two split up, drifting in different directions. They're gaining on her -- 
BACK TO RAIN, losing ground. She spies a rock, scoops it up -- and SMASHES across C rr_gan's Face! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Carrigan falls, dropping the gun. He searches for it, desperate. Then he SEES it. But as he reaches for it -- -- Rain extends her hand, concentrating, eyes fluttering -- WHOOSH! The gun spins away from Carrigan, into Rain's hands. She doesn't hesitate for a second -BLAM!- First shot wings Carrigan, knocks Rain on her ass. Carrigan DIVES for cover.. She FIRES wildly --CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-- but then the gun is spent and -- -- Landsdale emerges through the corn, bagging Rain with his coat. As a shaken Carrigan gets to his feet, Landsdale slips his belt out of his pants and binds Rain tightly. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Carrigan and Landsdale return to the Hummer, which is still nose down in the culvert. Landsdale carries Rain under his arm, tightly wrapped, no longer struggling. Odell sits on the hood, daubing the bloody wound in his leg with a handkerchief. He SEES Carrigan's wound. 
ODELL Man, she shot you? (off Carrigan's nod, disbelief) Jesus. Lucky she didn't perforate my ballsack with that fucking pen. 
CARRIGAN 
(RE: HUMMER) What's the damage? 
ODELL Mounts are cracked, trans-axle's shot to 
HELL -- (shaking his head) -- this baby ain't goin' nowhere. 
CARRIGAN Fuck. Ma. Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain -- then he just snaps, starts angrily kicking at the door. After a few futile moments, he stops, paces, looks to Landsdale. 
CARRIGAN (CONT'D) We're going to need a place where we can hole up `til tomorrow. Wait for those boys of yours. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDSDALE How `bout up there? Landsdale points past Carrigan at a squat group of buildings and machinery -- a shut-down ROCK QUARRY in the distance. 
EXT. QUARRY - FRONT GATE - DAY 
From a distance, we watch as Landsdale approaches a guardhouse with an empty gas can. A GUARD opens the electric gate, steps out to help. Landsdale pistol-whips him, drags his limp body in through the gate. 
INT_ QUARRY OFFICE - DUSK The Guard slouches in a corner, bound and gagged. Landsdale and Odell lounge nearby, keeping a watchful eye on Rain. Carrigan paces by a window, nervously cutting his deck of cards one-handed. He's watching the shadows lengthen outside, the setting sun. He looks to Rain, who matches his gaze -- creepy eyes penetrating his brain. 
CARRIGAN (to Landsdale, anxious) Where the fuck are those men of yours? 
LANDSDALE Don't worry. They're on their way. Carrigan nods, cuts his cards. He j worried. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK/NIGHT 
The abandoned Hummer in the culvert. A gang of CROWS tear a lizard apart. Dusk TIME-LAPSES into night. Stars. After a time, Nomi's pickup comes racing past. Blaze is driving, cranes to see the passing wreck. He pulls over onto the shoulder. Blaze and Nomi climb out, approach the vehicle. Nomi shines a flashlight, SEES blood on the front seat. She GASPS. Blaze reaches past her, touches the blood stain -- 
FLASH OF THE PAST Chaotic and violent. Rain attacking Odell. The Hummer crashing. The desperate race through the cornfield. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BACK TO THE PRESENT as Blaze steps away from the Hummer, into the field. 
BLAZE She's alive. 
NOMI How do you know ---? But Blaze isn't listening. His gaze is now fixated on the distant lights of the rock quarry. 
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

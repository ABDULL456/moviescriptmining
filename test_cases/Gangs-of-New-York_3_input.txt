... running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in the street. 
120 CONTINUED: 
FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia Commander. 
BILL THE BUTCHER We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break! 
MILITIA COMMANDER I can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out! 
BILL THE BUTCHER Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christ we will move! (turns to his men) Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright instead of die hunkered down, come with us! 
Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to FOLLOW. 
BILL THE BUTCHER We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on! 
The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever. 
Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him. 
He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives pass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HAND shakes ... he fires... too soon! ... 
... and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill. 
The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes lock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ... 
... and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's above him now, looking down at him. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this? 
JOHNNY Tweed. 
Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You'd lie to save your friend. 
JOHNNY (in terrible pain) No. There's no friends for me. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Me the same. Pity us both. 
He EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny. 
BILL THE BUTCHER (to his men) Hold your fire! (toward the Armory) In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam! 
The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward, gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him. 
Amsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory. 
AMSTERDAM Go on, then, talk. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You and me. 
AMSTERDAM (beat) Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body. 
Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it were an empty sack of flour... 
... and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves. 
And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory. 
CUT TO 
121 INT. ARMORY DAY 
As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island. 
Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at his feet. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Your friend made different friends lately. 
AMSTERDAM Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive? 
BILL THE BUTCHER It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door. 
AMSTERDAM I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unless you come with the Dead Rabbits. 
BILL THE BUTCHER You'd lay aside what's between us? 
AMSTERDAM I'm not forgetting where I put it. 
BILL THE BUTCHER If you do, I'll remind you. (he turns, leaves) 
AMSTERDAM What's your call, Bill? 
BILL THE BUTCHER I'm considering where's my better chance. 
He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS it himself and strides out into the street. 
CUT TO 
122 EXT./INT. ARMORY DAY 
Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines. 
From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him. 
The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives. 
Amsterdam WATCHES intently. 
The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what they're saying. There is still no sound...

WIFE I was trying to hold her here for you... 
C'S PRINCE I can capture my own damsel, thank you. 
WIFE Yes, of course. The STEWARD returns, covered in burrs and looking none too happy. 
STEWARD No sign of her, my liege. 
C'S PRINCE Well, what are you waiting for? See if you can find her. The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over. 
C'S PRINCE (CONT'D) The woods can be a dangerous place... She nods to him, out of her depth. He gallops off. 
EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT 
The BAKER searches for MILKY-WHITE along a large PATHWAY, disheveled and exhausted. 
BAKER Moo... Moo...... He HEARS sounds off in the distance. 
BAKER'S POV The STEPFAMILY'S carriage is passing through a large hollowed opening in the base of a huge tree. We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair bobbing animatedly. 
ANOTHER ANGLE The BAKER stands in the middle of the pathway, flagging down the carriage. He pulls an ear of corn from his satchel. As the carriage slows, he hops on the sideboard. 
BAKER (CONT'D) Please, if you would be so kind, may I compare this ear of corn with your hair? The STEPSISTERS scream. 
LUCINDA AND FLORINDA 
(OVERLAPPING) Don't touch us! Get away! How dare you! 
STEPMOTHER Mongrel! (to the driver) Carry on! She pushes the BAKER off the carriage and he somersaults backwards into the brush. The CARRIAGE speeds off. Deflated, the BAKER picks himself off the path and sits on what he thinks is a white rock. There is a muffled "Moo..." He jumps up realizing he's been SITTING on the cow. 
BAKER Milky-White! He hears something and hides behind a BUSH. Then, seeing it is his WIFE, he steps out. 
BAKER (CONT'D) I thought you were returning home! The WIFE screams in fright. Then she recognizes him. 
WIFE Oh! It's you! And you've the cow! She runs to MILKY-WHITE. 
BAKER 
(BRAGGADOCIO) Yes. I've the cow. We've two of the four. 
WIFE Three. 
BAKER Two. 
WIFE Three! She shows him the braid of hair around her neck. 
WIFE (CONT'D) Compare this to your corn. He does and it's a perfect match. 
BAKER Where did you find it? 
WIFE 
(FALSE MODESTY) I pulled it from a maiden in a tower. 
BAKER Three! 
WIFE And I almost had the fourth, but she got away. 
BAKER We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then. 
WIFE We? You mean you're going to let me stay with you? 
BAKER Well...perhaps it will take the two of us to have this child. 
WIFE 
YOU'VE CHANGED./ YOU'RE DARING./ 
YOU'RE DIFFERENT IN THE WOODS./ MORE 
SURE,/ MORE SHARING./ YOU'RE GETTING 
US THROUGH THE WOODS. 
IF YOU COULD SEE--/ YOU'RE NOT THE MAN 
WHO STARTED,/ AND MUCH MORE OPEN- 
HEARTED/ THEN I KNEW/ YOU TO BE. 
BAKER 
IT TAKES TWO./ I THOUGHT ONE WAS 
ENOUGH,/ IT'S NOT TRUE:/ IT TAKES TWO 
OF US./ YOU CAME THROUGH/ WHEN THE 
JOURNEY WAS ROUGH--/ IT TOOK YOU./ IT 
TOOK TWO OF US. 
IT TAKES CARE,/ IT TAKES PATIENCE AND 
FEAR AND DESPAIR/ TO CHANGE./ THOUGH 
YOU SWEAR/ TO CHANGE,/ WHO CAN TELL IF 
YOU DO?/ IT TAKES TWO. He flirts with her. She pulls away, teasing him. 
WIFE 
YOU'VE CHANGED./ YOU'RE THRIVING./ 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOODS./ 
NOT JUST/ SURVIVING,/ YOU'RE 
BLOSSOMING IN THE WOODS. 
AT HOME I'D FEAR/ WE'D STAY THE SAME 
FOREVER./ AND THEN OUT HERE/ YOU'RE 
PASSIONATE, CHARMING, CONSIDERATE, 
CLEVER-- 
BAKER 
IT TAKES ONE/ TO BEGIN, BUT THEN ONCE/

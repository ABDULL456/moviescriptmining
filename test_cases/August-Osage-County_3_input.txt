BARBARA I've seen where that gets me! I'm sick of the whole notion of the enduring female. GROW UP! Cause while you're going through your fifth puberty, the world is falling apart and your kid can't handle it!

BILL Our kid is just trying to deal with this goddamn madhouse you've dragged her into. 
BARBARA This madhouse is my home. 
BILL Think about that statement for a second, why don't you? 
BARBARA Jean is here with me because this is a family event. 
BILL Jean's here with you because she's a buffer between you and the shrill insanity of your mother. 
BARBARA Y'know, you'd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility. 
BILL You can't resist, can you? 
BARBARA You're a pretty easy mark. 
BILL You're so goddamn self-righteous, you know? You're so -- 
BARBARA Surely you must've known when you started porking Pippi Longstocking you were due for a little self- righteousness, just a smidge of indignation on my part -- 
BILL Maybe I split because of it. 
They've reached the back porch stairs. She turns on him. 
BARBARA Is this your confession, then, when you finally unload all? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   69. 60   CONTINUED:                                                    60 
BILL You're thoughtful, Barbara, but you're not open. You're passionate, but you're hard. You're a good, decent, funny, wonderful woman, and I love you, but you're a pain in the ass. 
Bill pushes past her up the stairs, disappears inside. 
61   INT. BEVERLY'S STUDY - AFTERNOON                              61 
Violet stands in the middle of the room. Sunlight streams in through the windows surrounding her. Approaches Beverly's swivel chair, touches the back, ...slowly spins it ...sits. 
VIOLET August... your month. Locusts are raging, "Summer psalm become summer wrath." `Course it's only August out there. In here... who knows? (and then) All right... okay. "The Carriage held but just Ourselves," dum-de-dum...mm, best I got... Emily Dickenson's all I got... something something, "Horse's Heads Were Toward Eternity..." 
Produces a bottle of pills, shakes one out, takes it. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) That's for me. One for me. 
Surveys the photos behind his desk. The girls. Vi and Bev together in happier times. Picks up the hardback Meadowlark Bill left. Finds Beverly's reading glasses on the desk, puts them on. Thumbs through it, finds the dedication: simply: 
VIOLET (CONT'D) For My Violet... 
Violet smiles ruefully, takes another pill. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) For the girls, God love `em. 
Surveys the book with something bordering on disgust. Another pill. Sits. Waiting. For what? She's not sure. 
BARBARA (OS) Mom?!   Food's on the table! 
She takes a final look around, takes one last pill. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   70. 
62   INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                62 
Johnna, Karen, Steve and Mattie Fae carry in serving dishes, set them down on the already overladen table. Charlie pours himself a sweet tea. 
KAREN This is lovely! You do all this? 
JOHNNA                         MATTIE FAE Mm-hmm.                         She's a wonder, this one. 
Bill passes through, carries us into the living room where he finds Jean, still watching the movie. 
BILL Turn that off, it's time to eat. 
JEAN Don't suppose I could eat in here? 
BILL You suppose right. 
Ivy comes down the stairs, looking. 
IVY Did I hear Little Charles? 
CHARLIE He went back out to the car. 
63   EXT. BACK YARD - AFTERNOON                                  63 
Ivy steps out onto the porch. Little Charles is by his father's car, retrieving a Pyrex dish. 
LITTLE CHARLES Mom's casserole. 
Shuts the door, rests the casserole on the hood. 
IVY They said you overslept. 
LITTLE CHARLES Maybe I purposely accidentally overslept. I don't know. I'm sorry. 
IVY Please. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   71. 63   CONTINUED:                                                   63

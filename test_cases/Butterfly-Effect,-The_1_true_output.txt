ANDREA Here, Ev... Finish this up for me. 
Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb back together. 
Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a spotless nurse's uniform underneath. 
EVAN All the dads are gonna be there. 
ANDREA I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I? 
EVAN No. 
ANDREA Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there. 
Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea. 
EVAN (beat) Done. Try it. 
Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile. 
ANDREA You're amazing, kiddo. 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989 
Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks her watch. 
ANDREA Okay have a great day I love you I'll pick you up later gotta go... 
Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. 
MRS. BOSWELL Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you! 
ANDREA I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work -- 
Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea. 
MRS. BOSWELL I think you really need to see this. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. 
MRS. BOSWELL TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE! 
Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. 
Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk. 
MRS. BOSWELL I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first. 
ANDREA What is it? 
MRS. BOSWELL Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this... 
Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it. 
ANDREA I don't understand... Evan did this? 
The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct. 
Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern. 
ANDREA Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture? 
MRS. BOSWELL Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it... 
ANDREA What? 
MRS. BOSWELL When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it. 
Andrea is visibly shaken now. 
ANDREA I have to go. 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER 
Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot even start the car. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER 
The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is stuck to the far end of page. 
Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused. 
LENNY You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it. 
TOMMY You're such a retard!

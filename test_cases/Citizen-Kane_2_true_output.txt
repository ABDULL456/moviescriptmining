KANE (quietly) Is it good? 
CITY EDITOR Yes, Mr. kane. 
Kane looks at him for a minute. 
CITY EDITOR But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice. 
KANE (sharply) It isn't finished? 
CITY EDITOR No, Mr. Kane. 
KANE That's Leland, isn't it? 
CITY EDITOR Yes, Mr. Kane. 
KANE Has he said when he'll finish? 
CITY EDITOR We haven't heard from him. 
KANE He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein? 
BERNSTEIN He sure did, Mr. Kane. 
KANE Where is he? 
ANOTHER HIRELING Right in there, Mr. Kane. 
The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office at the other end of the City Room.  Kane takes it in. 
BERNSTEIN (helpless, but very concerned) MR. KANE - 
KANE That's all right, Mr. Bernstein. 
Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass door indicated before by the Hireling.  The City Editor looks at Bernstein.  Kane opens the door and goes into the office, closing the door behind him. 
BERNSTEIN Leland and Mr. Kane - they haven't spoke together for ten years. (long pause; finally) Excuse me. (starts toward the door) 
INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - 
Bernstein comes in.  An empty bottle is standing on Leland's desk.  He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys. A sheet of paper is in the machine.  A paragraph has been typed. Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on him.  This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face. Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland.  He shakes him. 
BERNSTEIN Hey, Brad!  Brad! (he straightens, looks at Kane; pause) He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane.  Never.  We would have heard. 
KANE (finally; after a pause) What does it say there? 
Bernstein stares at him. 
KANE What's he written? 
Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the paragraph written on the page. 
BERNSTEIN (reading) "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - (he waits for a minute to catch his breath; he doesn't like it) - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" (looks up miserably) I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane. 
KANE Thais. 
Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured. 
BERNSTEIN (reading again) "Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." (he continues to stare at the page) 
KANE (after a short silence) Go on! 
BERNSTEIN (without looking up) That's all there is. 
Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for himself.  Slowly, a queer look comes over his face.  Then he speaks, very quietly. 
KANE Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... (then sharply) Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer - 
BERNSTEIN (miserably) I didn't see that. 
KANE It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it. 
BERNSTEIN (looks at him) I can't take shorthand. 
KANE Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice. 
Bernstein retreats from the room. 
QUICK DISSOLVE OUT: 
QUICK DISSOLVE IN: 
INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT - 
Long shot of Kane in his shirt sleeves, illuminated by a desk light, typing furiously.  As the camera starts to pull even farther away from this, and as Bernstein - as narrator - begins to speak - 
QUICK DISSOLVE: 
INT. BERNSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY - 
Bernstein speaking to Thompson. 
BERNSTEIN He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.

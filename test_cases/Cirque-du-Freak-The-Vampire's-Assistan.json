{"train": "CIRQUE DU FREAK \nWritten by \nBrian Helgeland \nFADE IN: CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS. Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider. As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR appears from the bottom of frame. Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops, suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg tentatively through the air... \nDARREN'S VOICE Come on... Just a little lower... WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over his head, is DARREN SHAN. Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent. The spider just hangs there. \nDARREN Come on... I'll take good care of you. All the bugs you can eat. \nMIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren, Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble. Maybe that's why they're friends. \nSTEVE Hey, Darren! No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can see any feet in front of the bowls. \nSTEVE Did you fall in? Darren! \nDARREN'S VOICE Shhh... Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up. INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall. \nDARREN You're gonna scare him away. \nSTEVE Man, we're getting killed out there. It's three to nothing. Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little. \nDARREN Your problem, Steve, not mine... Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet. WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling. The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve who flashes a wicked grin... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY \nKids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist: \nSTEVE GOAL! Three to one! The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball. Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP! Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal. \nSTEVE \n(EXULTANT) Three to two! Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult. \nSTEVE What does that prove? Huh? The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them. \nDARREN Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2. Lunch's almost over. \nSTEVE That's why he kicked it. To kill time. Well, I still got time to kick your face. \nDARREN \n(BLOCKING HIM) Forget it. The ball. Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief. \nGOALIE Thanks, Darren. He's crazy. Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak. \nTHE STREET Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street. From seemingly out of nowhere... A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out. It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS. \nSTEVE You idiot! The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren. But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off. A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve notices, snatches it out of the air. Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear down the street. Creepy... \nSTEVE Look at this. The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20 - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor. \nSTEVE .Human oddities and other living curiosities... \n(TO DARREN) Other. Does that mean not human? \nDarren shrugs, takes the flyer. \nDARREN A freak show. Ever been to one? \nSTEVE \nDARREN Moving slightly to get a clearer view. \nSTEVE & CREPSLEY Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve jumps, twists around. Unnerved. \nCREPSLEY Who sent you and what do they want? \nSTEVE Nothing. No one. Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him. \nCREPSLEY Then what do you want? \nSTEVE I want to join you. \nCREPSLEY Join me? I don't understand. \nSTEVE I want you to make me a vampire. Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued. \nCREPSLEY Is it because you want to live forever? Because we don't. \nSTEVE I don't care about living forever. But you do seem to live a long time. \nCREPSLEY A long time alone. Do you want to live alone? \nSTEVE I already do. \nCREPSLEY Are you an orphan? \nSTEVE My father's gone; my mother doesn't care about me. \nCREPSLEY Nor mine. You're friendless also? \nSTEVE I have a friend, but he doesn't understand. He's got too much to know what it's like to be alone. As Darren reacts to this... \nSTEVE When you're alone you feel weak. Useless. But I know there must be something strong about it, too. I want to feel the power of being alone. I want to be a vampire. \nCREPSLEY The power of being alone will never be greater than the weakness of it. \nSTEVE I don't care. Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a dismissive hand. \nCREPSLEY It makes no matter. We do not blood children. I'm sorry. Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2- inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud. \nCREPSLEY Do you intend to use that on me? And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face. \nSTEVE Do it. Make me a vampire. \nCREPSLEY Do not tempt me. \nDARREN Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it. \nCREPSLEY Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison. \nSTEVE What's wrong? \nCREPSLEY You have bad blood. \nSTEVE What do you mean? \nCREPSLEY I can taste the menace in your blood. You can never be a vampire. You're evil. Steve scrambles to his feet. \nSTEVE That's a lie. You take that back! Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly. \nCREPSLEY Go home. Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking. \nCREPSLEY \nGO! Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone. \nINT. CLOSET - DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDarren sets the cage on a shelf, shuts the door. Black. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - MORNING \nDarren's Mom making omelettes. Darren's DAD helping, dicing up some ham. Annie sits at the table awaiting the results. \nANNIE Is he in a lot of trouble? \nDAD Nothing a few years in prison won't take care of. \nANNIE I don't see what the big deal is... \nDAD \n(TO MOM) Did you talk to Steve's mom yet? \nMOM Get this. She said she couldn't comment because she didn't make it home last night herself. \nANNIE Where was she? \nMOM Go tell Darren it's breakfast. \nCUT TO: \nMADAM OCTA - VIDEO VIEW Seen through the bars of her cage. FREEZE FRAME. \nDARREN'S ROOM Darren's just snapped her photo with his DIGITAL CAMERA. As the door bursts open and Annie enters... Darren scrambles to block the cage from view. \nDARREN Annie, you gotta learn to knock. \nANNIE Mom said to come eat. What's that? As Annie tries to look, Darren stays in front of her. \nDARREN Out. Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the cage in the closet. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY \nDarren arrives, sits as everyone pretends not to notice. His mom slides his omelette off the pan into his plate. Annie watches everyone's every move. Darren eats a bite. \nDARREN Mom, this is the best omelette I ever had. His Dad can't help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased, but knows she's being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh, Darren shoots her a look. A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie. \nSTEVE Hey, midget, where's the idiot? Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone else. He recovers, does his best Eddie Haskell... \nSTEVE Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It's nice to see ya. As Steve gets several less than welcoming looks... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY \nDarren and Steve enter his bedroom. \nSTEVE What was that? Everyone acting like they don't know me. Did I walk in on something? Darren closes the door. Gets to the point. \nDARREN What happened last night? \nSTEVE Nothing. I hung out in the theater for awhile, but no one was around. The lie hangs in the air a moment. \nSTEVE Sorry about the way I acted. I'm sorry I pushed you. \nDARREN Don't worry. There's, you know, no bad blood or anything like that. \nDARREN Destiny? That doesn't make sense. \nCREPSLEY Try this then. You're reckless enough to steal, responsible enough to come back for a friend. That's enough for me. \nDARREN Not for me. \nCREPSLEY Yes, well, destiny can't be explained. It must be lived. Now, you're wasting my time. \nDARREN There's gotta be another way. \nCREPSLEY There isn't. \nDARREN Please... He's my friend. \nCREPSLEY And he slips away while we argue. Life or death? Yes or no? \nDARREN You'd never be able to trust me. If I got a chance for payback I'd take it. \nCREPSLEY Yes or no? Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods. Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially long, but they look thick and sharp. Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it. \nCREPSLEY You have good blood. Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers. Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers. \nCREPSLEY Lift your hands. Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain. \nCREPSLEY Get used to pain. More lies ahead. He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread. Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers. As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation. \nCREPSLEY The blood flows into your left arm and out of your right. Do you feel it? Getting near your heart? Darren nods, shivers. \nCREPSLEY Almost there. A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down. \nCrepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering. Tries to block out any sympathy he feels. \nCREPSLEY The world will start to slow down. You'll become a witness of time. (snaps out of it) Your friend's time is running out. He pulls Darren to his feet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT \nThey step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly. \nCREPSLEY Take my arm. Don't let go. Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet. Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look. The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past. A moment later and they're in the... \nHOSPITAL PARKING LOT Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding. \nCREPSLEY Lick your fingers. Vampire spit will stop wounds from bleeding. Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot. \nDARREN How'd we get here? \nCREPSLEY It's called flitting. Which room is your friend in? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored. \nCrepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids. Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye. \nCREPSLEY We're in time. He still has a few minutes left. Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork. He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm. A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs twitching. Is he dying? \nDARREN What's happening? \nCREPSLEY He was near death. The journey back is not pleasant. What do you know about him, this boy with bad blood? \nDARREN He's my friend. \nHEFTS MOUSE .to Crepsley the mouse. Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent. \nDARREN \nSTOP -- Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front. \nDARREN It's cruel. \nSTEVE It's nature. Anyhow don't watch. \n(TO KIDS) And don't blink; you might miss it. Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium. The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself. ZAP! The snake STRIKES... And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible! The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning. The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class. \nDarren scoops up the mouse, drops the snake back in. As he starts out, Steve cuts him off. \nSTEVE What happened to the spider? \nDARREN I killed it. Steve hesitates, processes, looks Darren over. \nSTEVE I had a dream. You and Crepsley were in my hospital room... \nDARREN Tell me about it later. Darren starts away. Steve grabs him hard, spins him around. \nSTEVE I'll tell you now. Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the ground, only his left toe touching. \nDARREN I said later. Darren lets go, heads off. Steve watches, wonders. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nDarren walks home, hands in pockets. Annie comes up behind. \nANNIE Darren! Wait up! He looks over his shoulder, keep going. \nANNIE Can I walk home with you? He softens, slows down. After a few silent steps. \nDARREN Got you something. Darren pulls the MOUSE from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups it in her hand. \nANNIE He's adorable. \nANNIE & DARREN - A CREATURE'S POV Coming in low and fast. \nSTREET Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges, stops just short of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates Darren. Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren's pupils dilate oddly; he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog starts to back off.. \nANNIE Hey. That's King. \nDARREN No it's not. King's my buddy. \nANNIE That's King, Darren. It is. Darren realizes it is King. As Darren realizes something's wrong with Darren.. Another growl. From down the street. Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN prowls through the intersection. The one seen at school. It slows, windows blacked out. As it continues, disappears from view... \nDARREN Come on. As Darren hurries Annie along down the street... \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDarren at the kitchen table doing his math homework. His Mom makes dinner, chopping vegetables at the sink. \nMOM How was school today? \nDARREN The usual. Sometimes it was boring, sometimes really boring. Darren's mom laughs. Then... \nMOM Ouch! She drops the knife on the cutting board. A thick drop of BLOOD runs down her finger. Darren flinches at the sight and in that moment we PUNCH INTO his eyes. The PUPILS swirl red; the IRISES flatten and narrow. A dark, ravenous look. \nMOM - DARREN'S POV Holding up her finger. Her skin tone receding back into gray, the blood pulsing with red vibrancy. Alive. A target. \nDARREN Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can ever help you, I will. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nDarren enters to find Crepsley sitting at his desk. He holds a small dark bottle between his fingers (different than the one he gave to Steve). As Crepsley's about to speak... \nDARREN Shut up. Off Crepsley's reaction... \nDARREN This is my home and I'm never gonna see it again, so don't rush me. Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser. \nDARREN Hold onto this for me, okay? Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return. Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell. \nDARREN You're sure it will work? Crepsley opens the window. \nCREPSLEY Your heart will slow down so drastically they won't find a pulse. With the fall from the window, they'll think you're dead. \nDARREN What if I break bones? \nCREPSLEY Even better. They'll mend in a few days. Vampires don't stay broken for long and it takes a very long fall to kill one. \nDARREN And the funeral home? Won't they embalm me or something? \nCREPSLEY Don't worry. I have ways of making my thoughts become the thoughts of others. They'll leave you alone. \nCrepsley gestures to the window. Knowing the plan, Darren climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him. \nDARREN My dad's allergic to grass. It's my job to cut the lawn. \nCREPSLEY You have a new job now. Drink. Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back. \nDARREN So this is destiny, huh? Tastes like crap. Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him. \nCREPSLEY Your breathing is slowing, your heart as well. Do you feel it? Darren can't answer. He blinks his eyes 'yes' instead. \nCREPSLEY You may be aware of what's going on around you. Remember, the grief that you hear will be a release for those who express it. Darren's eyes drift shut. Crepsley lets him go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDarren FALLS, crashes through the trellis and thumps into the lawn. Crepsley looks down from the window, then disappears. CLOSE ON Darren lying face down in the grass. CRICKETS chirp. Beyond, a NEIGHBOR walks his DOG. The dog suddenly turns in the direction of Darren, pulls on its leash. \nNEIGHBOR No, no, come on -- The Neighbor stops short as he sees the body. \nNEIGHBOR Hey -- Hey, kid -- He rolls Darren over, realizes something is very wrong. \nWe stay on Darren, the dog sniffing at him as the neighbor disappears toward the front door. We hear his fist pound. A moment later, Darren's father is there. He looks at Darren, up to the open window, realizes he fell. An instant later, he's on his knees, cradling his son. \nDAD Darren? Darren! A moment later his Mom... \nMOM Darren! Oh my God! We're still on Darren's face, his eye open a slit. \nDARREN'S POV His parents hovering over him in despair. The STARS TWINKLE. The neighbor leans in. \nNEIGHBOR Is he dead? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nDarren's body on a stainless steel table. The MEDICAL EXAMINER shakes his head sadly, looks to his ASSISTANT. \nMEDICAL EXAMINER Cause of death is trauma from the impact of the fall. Poor kid. \nMOVE WITH DARREN Passing among the graves, stretching his arms, twisting. Really beat up. He looks about, the names and dates on the headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something: Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away. \nDARREN What are you doing here? \nSTEVE (smiles; closing in) Vampire hunting. Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground. Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake. Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is resurgent. He throws Steve off. Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams him up against the mausoleum, holds him there. \nDARREN What do you have against vampires? You wanted to become one yourself. \nSTEVE Yeah, I wanted to, but you did. You stole my dream. You stole my destiny. \nDARREN Are you crazy? I did it to save your life. That was the deal. Me for you. \nSTEVE \n(UNHINGING) Liar. You told him I was evil. You planned this all along. And you'll pay! You'll pay -- Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows. \nDARREN I want you to leave... Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now. \nDARREN I want you to leave and forget you ever saw me. Understand? Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder. \nSTEVE I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You and the other one. Crepsley. I'll put a stake in you and burn you to ashes. I'll make sure you never come back from the grave again. WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death... \nCREPSLEY If we ever meet again, I will show you loneliness you cannot imagine. Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off running. Crepsley looks to Darren. \nCREPSLEY Do you still question his blood? Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think. \nDARREN Would a stake through the heart kill a vampire? \nCREPSLEY Yes. But so would getting hit by a truck if it was going fast enough. Steve finally disappears from sight. Crepsley sighs. \nCREPSLEY He'll be trouble before it's over. \nDARREN Before what's over? \nCREPSLEY This adventure we're on. Shall we start? Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city. \nCREPSLEY You'll get used to it after awhile. Vampires are always saying goodbye. A beat, then Darren looks back at him. \nDARREN Let's go. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SUN As it blisters up into, then rises above the horizon. Sunrise. Ominous if you're a full vampire. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RURAL OHIO MOTEL - SUNRISE \nOn the edge of the highway. Silhouetted against the sun. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - SUNRISE \nDarren jams a rolled towel along the bottom of a closed door. \nDARREN How's that? Dark enough? \nCREPLEY'S VOICE (on the other side) Better. \nDARREN It's sunrise. \nCREPLEY'S VOICE I know the time. I know more about the sunrise than anyone alive. \nCrespley sounds irritated. Darren gets mischievous. \nDARREN The one you were driving around my town in. The old black one. \nCREPSLEY I've never owned a car, Darren. I don't need one. \nDARREN It was near school one day. It followed me home a few days later. \nCREPSLEY And you saw me behind the wheel? \nDARREN I couldn't see who was driving. \nCREPSLEY It wasn't me. As Darren considers this, Crepsley stops suddenly. \nCREPSLEY There... Ahead: just more parking lot. A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE. \nDARREN What? \nCREPSLEY Dinner. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nThe woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name. \nWOMAN Yes? Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks. \nCUT TO: \nDARREN & CREPSLEY Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must be willing her over. Darren looks terrified. But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared. The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns, tries to figure out who he is and how she got here... \nDARREN Go. Run. But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she passes out. Darren is horrified. \nDARREN Did you kill her? \nCREPSLEY I put her to sleep. She'll be like this 15 minutes. When she wakes up, she won't remember a thing. \nCrepsley eases her to the ground, finds a vein on her wrist. \nDARREN Will she become a vampire? \nCREPSLEY No. She'd have to share y blood for that to happen. \nDARREN Don't take too much. \nCREPSLEY A vampire who feeds often can control himself. One who drinks only when he must can end up feeding wildly. He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein. \nCREPSLEY The hunger inside us must be fed to be controlled. To be civilized. It's what separates us from... the others. \nDARREN What others? But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth. Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren. \nCREPSLEY Your turn. \nDARREN No. I won't. \nCREPSLEY Darren... \nDARREN I'll never do it. Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in. \nCREPSLEY You can lead a vampire to blood, but you can't make him drink. \nDARREN I'm only half-vampire. \nCREPSLEY No matter, you need blood to live now. You'll drink eventually. When you're hungry enough. The wrist is clean, the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar. \nDARREN I'll die first. \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD) \nDarren and Mr. Tiny reappear in the booth, but the restaurant's patrons are slowed to near motionlessness.A battle royal going on. Crepsley fighting three VAMPANEZE. All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin. Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant. Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows. Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat. Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives the second one back into the third knocking both back. A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat. As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD) \nAs leg whip 'unflits'. The patrons react to him soaring over the counter, slamming into the wall -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD) \nThe patrons near frozen again. Leg whip sliding ever so slowly down the wall. Crepsley and Sinewy One & Two FIGHTING at full speed. Sinewy One pulls Crepsley's arm up behind his back. Crepsley HOWLING as we hear the bone BREAK. Mr. Tiny grabs Darren by the wrist, pulls him toward the door. Behind them... Crepsley drives the back of his head into Sinewy One's face at the same time as Sinewy Two swings in his open palm... Sinewy One releases Crepsley who disappears as Sinewy Two slices open Sinewy One's throat. As Mr. Tiny pulls Darren out the door... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD) \nCrepsley appears. Leg Whip hits the floor. Blood splashes the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees. As Leg Whip stands, Crepsley charges, 'shoulders' him halfway through the wall. Patrons SCREAM, react, scatter. As Crepsley grabs a knife... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HAMBURGER JOINT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (FLITTING WORLD) \nDarren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind, through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight. Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid swing with the knife in his head. Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH. Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style. \nMURLOUGH Smell the blood. The lovely blood. His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth. Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr. Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view... The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out. Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases him to move to catch it. Darren rushes back toward the restaurant. Mr. Tiny catches his watch. Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly from his side. Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat, lifts him off the ground. Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder. Murlough staggers, lets go. \nCrepsley takes Darren's hand and they flit, disappearing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD) \nBeyond the hamburger joint. The world beginning to streak past them. The asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet, passing cars like they were standing still. But Crepsley heaves for breath. In pain. Darren looks back over his shoulder... \nDARREN'S POV Murlough follows. Closing ground. \nDARREN & CREPSLEY \nDARREN It's behind us! Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But... \nMURLOUGH Closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes. \nCREPSLEY Almost out of gas. But looking ahead. Clocks in an instant: a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN having just crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner. Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from behind... Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears. As Murlough FADES after him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT (REAL WORLD) \nDarren and Crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing. Murlough comes out of flit in the center. WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough! He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield. As Darren and Murlough disappear again... \nThe pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street. A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he wipes it, smearing it across his cheek... \nPICK-UP DRIVER \n(RUSHING OVER) Hey, man, are you okay?! He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough stands, SWATS the driver aside. The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STATE HIGHWAY - DAWN \nThe sky getting lighter. A SIGN: Now Entering Pennsylvania. The air shimmers as something flits past... WHOOOSHH! \nDARREN Half vampire. \nCREPSLEY Yes, yes. Three-eighths if you want. What do you think? As Darren thinks... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MR. TALL'S AIRSTREAM TRAILER - NIGHT \nThe Cirque is camped by an ABANDONED FACTORY. Neo-Gothic in scale and mood. Lit up for a performance. Mr. Tall, pulls on his jacket, shouts orders. \nMR. TALL Show time in twenty minutes. Someone tell Rhamus to get his stomachs in gear! He's surprised to see Crepsley and Darren walk up the road. Crepsley's arm seems much better now. \nMR. TALL Larten'Crepsley! As I live and breathe. I thought it would be years before I saw you again. Mr. Tall looks to Darren, throws a surprised look to Crepsley. Crepsley nods. 'Yes'. \nMR. TALL Darren Shan. You've come a long way since the last time I saw you. \nDARREN I liked it better where I was. \nMR. TALL I'm sure. \nCREPSLEY Do you still have my coffin? \nMR. TALL Of course. You're really back? \n(CREPSLEY NODS) Perhaps you could do the show tonight? A few of us are absent or ill this evening. \nCREPSLEY I'd be delighted. \nMR. TALL Mr. Shan will have to pull his weight as well. I'll give him to Evra. Evra! EVRA! \n(LOOKING ABOUT) I hope I haven't gone from one unreliable boy to two. \nEvra arrives. The snake boy from the first Cirque show. \nMR. TALL Evra, my industrious wonder. Here is Darren. Put him to work with you. Show him the snakey ropes. As the two boys consider each other... \nMR. TALL Off with you. Go! As the boys head off, Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley. \nMR. TALL You blooded a child, Larten? What were you thinking? \nCREPSLEY You don't approve? \nMR. TALL I don't matter. What will the vampire generals say when they hear about it? \nCREPSLEY I'm no longer part of their domain. \nMR. TALL So you say. They may disagree. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT \nAs Darren and Evra make their way through. \nEVRA What do you do? Me? I'm a snake boy. I do a whole snake thing. Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to illustrate. It's strange. Funny. Evra looks back over. \nDARREN Do you eat mice? \nEVRA Big Macs actually. They share a LAUGH. Evra 'high fives' Darren. Fast friends. \nAs they continue, Darren looks at the palm of his hand. A few of Evra's SCALES have come off and are stuck there. \nDARREN I caught your act in the last town. Pretty cool. \nEVRA Thanks. I'm not doing it tonight. My snake caught a cold. \nCREPSLEY'S VOICE Darren... Darren turns. Crepsley's back there in the shadows. \nCREPSLEY How do you feel about show business? \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STAGE - NIGHT \nThe audience reacts as Crepsley 'appears' on the empty stage. \nCREPSLEY To be poisoned by a spider may be my fate. It's Darren's cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit, he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length. \nDEBBIE & SAM As she realizes it's Darren. Cool. \nSTAGE Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave. As he smiles... \nCREPSLEY Look glum... Miserable... \nDarren loses the grin. Crepsley opens the cage. Madam Octa steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays. Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances across to the music, spinning a web as she goes. Darren looks out, sees how much Debbie enjoys it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE MOON - NIGHT \nSet against the black sky. Sparks rise up, their source unknown. All very mysterious until... LAUGHTER. Lots of it. Borderline raucous. We follow the sparks DOWN to... \nA BONFIRE Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating, drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp. Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying watching everyone else enjoy themselves. Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick. Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And he's certainly never experienced anything like this. Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum. Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away. Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AN OLD VAN - NIGHT \nA mattress on the floor inside. Using tape and cardboard, Darren 'blacks out' the windows. Crepsley steps over. \nDARREN Almost done. Crepsley looks to the sky. Still dark. The moon setting. \nCREPSLEY Darren... (Darren looks over) \n(MORE) \nCREPSLEY (CONT'D) I'm not going to sleep here. We'll find a nook in the factory. Crepsley starts off. Darren starts to follow. \nCRESPLEY Mattress. Darren sighs, goes back to the van to retrieve the mattress. He starts to pull it out, then stops, nearly doubled over. Concerned, Crepsley steps over. Darren waves him off, straightens as whatever it was passes. \nDARREN I just felt sick for a second. \nCREPSLEY You need blood. Darren gives him a dirty look, grabs the mattress. They start walking toward the factory. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FACTORY - NIGHT \nThe SHADOWS of a loading dock. Crepsley and Darren approach. \nDARREN You think Mr. Tiny might come? Crepsley shrugs, doesn't answer. \nDARREN Who is he? What does he want? \nCREPSLEY What we want is who we are, don't you think? \nDARREN Can't you give me a straight answer just once?! \nCREPSLEY You won't learn by me telling you. You must live some things to know what they are. Darren sighs in deep frustration. Crepsley has a thought. \nCREPSLEY Okay. Why do you like spiders? \nCREPSLEY \n(INTERRUPTS) It wasn't Darren. Another boy. His blood was bad. I should have killed him, but I didn't. Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all. \nCREPSLEY I met Darren shortly after. His blood was good or I certainly would have killed him. Darren reacts again. \nGAVNER PURL How could a boy find you? Crepsley shrugs. Of course he had help. \nGAVNER PURL Tiny? \nDARREN He tried to kill us. \nCREPSLEY He tried to kill me. What he wanted with you wasn't determined. \nGAVNER PURL Perhaps you chose the wrong boy. In Mr. Tiny's eyes. A moment as they consider the unspoken implications. \nDARREN What are you guys talking about!? No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look. \nCREPSLEY What's important enough to track down an exile? What is your news? \nGAVNER PURL War. \nCREPSLEY I'm not interested in your wars. \nGAVNER PURL Well the other side is interested or they wouldn't be trying to get rid of you. Crepsley gets suddenly very angry. \nCREPSLEY I've had enough killing! No more! You've come to the wrong place. I am the wrong place... Gavner raises his hands in surrender. \nGAVNER PURL Even so, I'm glad you're alive. \nCREPSLEY \n(RELENTING) The sun is coming. Will you stay? \nGAVNER PURL I can still make miles. The war won't wait. And neither will bad news. I have to go. \nCREPSLEY Then travel safely. \nGAVNER PURL Would you mind if I walk a bit with your assistant? \nCREPSLEY Take him with you if you want. He's of little use to me. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - NOT FAR OFF - NIGHT \nDarren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over. \nGAVNER PURL You look sick. Doesn't Larten feed you? \nDARREN I won't drink blood if that's what you mean. I promised myself. \nGAVNER PURL Why? \nDARREN You'll get insulted. As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him... \nDARREN I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll become evil. Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself. \nGAVNER PURL The only thing drinking blood will do to you is keep you alive. \nDARREN That's how it would start. I would swear it was just to stay alive. But what'll I turn into? You're on one side of the fence or the other. My father used to say that and now I know what he meant. The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit. \nGAVNER PURL You've already turned, Darren. You need to accept what you've already become. There's no going back. They walk in silence a moment. Then: \nDARREN Why did Crepsley make himself an exile anyhow? \nINT. UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY - DAY \nDarren and Evra come off a rickety staircase, pass through a half-rotted door. There are holes in the roof overhead and huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through. They see Sam, his back to them, staring out a smashed window. \nEVRA Let's scare the crap out of him... They begin to creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam. But as they get close, a SHAPE drops down behind them! \nSHAPE \nARRRGGGH! Darren and Evra are the ones who jump. The shape is Debbie! She almost falls over laughing. So does Sam. \nDEBBIE You should see the look on your faces. But Evra and Darren are not laughing. \nEVRA What're you doing here? \nDEBBIE We could ask you the same thing. We come here all the time. My grandfather used to work here. \nDARREN Must've been a long time ago. \nDEBBIE He says now it's like one of those bombed out World War II cathedrals. Empty of what is used to be. An odd little moment till Sam breaks it. \nSAM Hey, we loved the show, man. It was off the hook. \nEVRA (messing with him) Off the hook, huh? I'll tell all the freaks you said so. \nSAM Are you guys on your own? Just traveling. No parents or nothing? \nDARREN No. No parents. He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on. \nSAM School? \nEVRA No school either. \nSAM You're the luckiest guys on earth. Wanna switch places? \nDARREN You have to be different to be here. \nDEBBIE Different how? Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night. \nEVRA Everyone has a place they belong. The Cirque du Freak is ours. \nDEBBIE I think your skin is beautiful. That wins Evra over. \nDEBBIE Can I touch it? Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it. \nDEBBIE Wow. Has it always been this way? \nDARREN He's a snake-boy. \nDEBBIE You shouldn't call him names because he looks different. \nEVRA It's okay. I am a snake boy. \nSAM You could say you're dermatologically challenged. They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren. \nDEBBIE What about you, Darren? How are you different? \nDARREN I get scared easy. Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped. \nDARREN How'd you get up there anyhow? \nDEBBIE You mean, how did a girl get up there? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FACTORY ROOF - DAY \nEVRA I like her. She asks a lot of questions though. \nDARREN She's just curious. \nEVRA There's no such thing as 'just' with a girl. \nDARREN What makes you such an expert? \nEVRA My snake's a girl. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FACTORY - SUNSET \nThe sun peeps below the horizon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FACTORY PASSAGE - NIGHT \nDarren walks along, flashlight in hand. Going somewhere. He suddenly stops, listens, not sure if he heard something. A following FOOTSTEP? MOVE WITH Darren as he continues. As he passes through a doorway, he ducks around the corner. Waits a few beats. Then he leaps out to see who's following. No one's there. Shaking his head, he continues on. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT \nDarren knocks on a door, waits a beat before it opens and Crepsley emerges from his sleeping place. \nCREPSLEY Good morning, Darren. \nDARREN What's good about it? Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT \nBustling with activity. Nearly show time. Crepsley stands by an open tent flap watching Darren cross camp. Not well. \nDARREN He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him. \nSAM DEBBIE Hey, Darren. Hi... Darren's happy to see them. \nDARREN You guys are coming to the show again tonight? \nDEBBIE Of course. Evra's doing his snake act tonight. \nDARREN Oh, you came to see Evra. \nDEBBIE And you... Darren smiles shyly at that. \nSAM I was hoping for Amanda Bynes. Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent. \nDARREN Hey, I'll catch up with you later. I got some stuff I gotta finish up. \nThey watch as Darren heads off. \nSAM He's gonna be gone in another day or two. Tonight's the last show. \nDEBBIE I know that. So? \nSAM So stop looking at him like you love him. \nDEBBIE You're such an idiot, Sam. \nTENT OPENING Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady. \nMR. TINY .subjugators and saps... \nMR. TALL Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We are an ancient circus... As Mr. Tall drones on... \nMR. TINY Oh, his speeches are impossible. Mr. Tiny opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into view from his palm. Time begins to speed up around them. Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small movements become rattles and shakes. Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed. \nMR. TINY I'm not so complicated, Darren. During war there are those who profit. A war between vampires and vampaneze would have terrible consequences. Therefore... \nDARREN Terrible profits. \nMR. TINY Excellent. I am a profiteer. I exact fees and gains. I'm simple. On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra 'keystones' through his performance with his snake. \nMR. TINY Did Crepsley tell you of the prophesy? \nDARREN What prophesy? \nMR. TINY They say the final battle between vampires and vampaneze will be decided by a child. That's why the vampires won't blood children. To avoid the end of the world. As these words are pondered by Darren... \nMR. TINY I think I underestimated you. I think you could be wonderful. \nDARREN I think you're a creep. I think you suck. \nMR. TINY Too bad. Mr. Tiny closes his hand around the watch. Time returns to normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed. As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at Darren. \nDEBBIE He was great! As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darren's other side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a scarf. Murlough! \nMURLOUGH (low; re: Debbie) Is it Dar-wren's girlfriend? \nDARREN Forget about her -- Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low: \nMURLOUGH She has plenty of lovely blood inside. Inside, outside, hmmm? Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close, HISSES in his ear, flashing those filthy teeth. \nMURLOUGH I don't care about humans. I don't care about you. But the vampire - Larten Crepsley - him I care about. \n(ALMOST SHY) Murlough is a vampire killer. \nOn stage: the spotlight hits Crepsley. \nDARREN You guys are in trouble. There's more than one vampire now. Gavner Purl is here. Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it. \nMURLOUGH Have you seen Purl Gavner's face? Young Murlough sliced it for him. \nMR. TINY Darren, you're a liar. He's a thousand miles gone by now. And master Crepsley is right there. As he points at Crepsley... \nCREPSLEY Holding Madam Octa's cage. Aware something's 'in the air'. \nMURLOUGH Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears. \nDARREN Crepsley! Look out! The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa. Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's hand around Darren's wrist. \nSTAGE As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley. Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show. Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG KNIFE in either hand. Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE 'switches' to life in his hand... \nDARREN & MR. TINY As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back of the boy's neck. That holds him. \nSTAGE CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt. Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect. From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It catches Murlough hard across the chops. \nOFF STAGE Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do. \nSTAGE Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in Murlough's left hand with the one in his right. Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face. Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall. \nDARREN Concentrating. Trying to flit. \nSTAGE Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so brutish after all. He matches the move -- Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley reacts, frozen in shock. \nDARREN & MR. TINY The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing. And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone. \nMURLOUGH Crepsley comes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APPROACH PASSAGE - FACTORY - NIGHT \nCrepsley moving forward. Hurting. He slows, stops. As he looks back over his shoulder. Something's behind him. \nEVRA, DEBBIE & SAM Freeze as Crepsley looks back in the direction from which they follow. From their POV, Crepsley suddenly disappears. \nSAM Where'd he go? They jump as Crepsley appears right in front of them. \nCREPSLEY Evra... Get them out of here. \nEVRA \nBUT -- Evra knows it's useless. As he nods, Crepsley turns and strides back toward where he had been. Sam and Debbie exchange a look. What the Hell? \nEVRA You guys better go back. \nSAM What are you gonna do? \nEVRA Darren's my friend. \nDEBBIE Ours too. Sam's not so sure, but he nods in agreement. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOILER ROOM - FACTORY - NIGHT \nDarren swings back and forth in long strokes like a pendulum, a rag stuffed in his mouth to silence him. \nDARREN'S POV Sweeping the room. Wait! It fixes on a doorway. There's Crepsley. Looking about, everywhere but at Darren. \nBOILER ROOM Crepsley speaks to 'the room'. \nCREPSLEY I can smell it. Why does it hide? \n(STEPPING UP) The vampire is here. WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands ten feet in front of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each other. \nMURLOUGH The vampire will die. \nSTEVE'S VOICE \n(FROM ABOVE) Let's get readyyyyy to rumble! Crepsley looks up, reacts. \nCREPSLEY Even the creatures of the night watch too much TV. Darren swings past through the middle of it all. Murlough charges. Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher. He leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks. Murlough follows. They use the room steel as monkey bars as they climb, clash. Violent, quick attacks. Crepsley gaining a position, abandoning it as Murlough SLAMS in. \nDARREN Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold, lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain. \nEVRA Sam, unhook his legs. As Sam struggles, Debbie pulls the rag from Darren's mouth. \nDARREN Are you guys nuts? Get outta here! \nEVRA It's against our code. Suddenly unhooked, Darren hits the ground. He looks up at Evra who grins down at him. \nEVRA Never leave a freak behind. \nCUT TO: \nCEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives. Crepsley jumps to the space he wants to defend, draws his own. Murlough counters. Two very serious predators'-at work. The animal kingdom at its killing best. A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away. It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's knife finds its way into Murlough's body. It enrages him, but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment. He's now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he inadvertently backs his way into a corner. But as quarters close in, Murlough's rage works to his advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his lowered shoulder sending Crepsley through the air and into... And through a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still raging, Murlough nearly falls through himself. Instead, he slips, drops about twenty feet down inside the building! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT \nDARREN Shut up, Steve. \nMurlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks. Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over. Knocked in a heap. Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's pretty powerful himself. Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings his fist in a vicious arc. Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head. Murlough's getting tired of Darren. \nMURLOUGH You need to stand still so you can die. But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't. He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain. Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with Crepsley hanging onto the end of it. \nFACTORY SPACE The audience who remain chanting: \"Refund! Refund!\" They react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage. \nUPPER FLOOR - FACTORY Crepsley brings up his knife. Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand. With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat. But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART! Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at Crepsley whose throat he still holds. Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back, falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking Crepsley with him. \nFACTORY SPACE SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead. As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them. \nUPPER FLOOR But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie, pushes her to the edge where the rafters are. \nSTEVE Stay back! Or I'll throw her off! I mean it! It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie. She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS. Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice. But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter. Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor. Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them: rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale. \nDARREN It's over, Steve. \nSTEVE Is it? Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will be their last. They separate, try to gain position. \nSTEVE You wanna hear something funny? After your funeral, I went to see your parents. They continue circling. \nSTEVE And they were fine. They acted like they barely remembered you. \nDARREN Liar. \nDarren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling. \nSTEVE \n(SMILES) And your sister. She was moving into your room. They had a yard sale. I bought some of your stuff. Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly: \nDARREN Did you steal money from my mom's purse? \nSTEVE What? \nDARREN Did you? Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious. \nSTEVE Why do you ask? Is knowing that gonna help you rest in peace? \nDARREN No. It's just practically the last thing that ever happened between me and my dad was I was arguing with him. \nSTEVE \n(FLIP) Least you had a dad to argue with. A fury building in Darren. \nDARREN I was telling him he was wrong about you. That's the last time we had together. Fighting about you. \nSTEVE Hate to tell ya. Your dad was right. How do you think we got the money for the dumb tickets? I took it. Just like I'm gonna take you. Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up, no matter how many times Steve hits him. \nWHAM! Darren lets Steve have it. \nDARREN I miss him. \nWHAM! \nDARREN Do you understand? \nWHAM! \nDARREN I miss him so much. WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over. But just as he pitches off the end rafter... Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will fall into the spikes below. Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do. \nCREPSLEY Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you won't have to do it later. Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever. \nDARREN \n", "test1_input": "DARREN Get me one, too. Steve gets up, stomps out of the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY \nSteve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there. At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door open, two sneakered feet behind it. \nMOM I know you want to fight global warming, Darren, but that's not the way to do it. Steve leans back to show his face. \nSTEVE Sorry, Mrs. Shan. \nMOM Oh hi, Steve. I thought you were, Darren. \nSTEVE I wish I was. \n(RE: FRIDGE) You guys got everything in here. \nMOM Help yourself. She sets her PURSE down on the counter. \nMOM How's your mother? \nSTEVE She's okay... She's been working a lot lately. A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda. \nMOM \n(POINTS) Glasses are up there. \nSTEVE I know. Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees... The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse. A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP! A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling, frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse -- Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her celiphone, so... \nMOM \n(INTO PHONE) Hello? .it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - SHAN HOUSE - DAY \nSteve comes up off the stairs. He sets the glasses on a hall table, continues into... \nDARREN'S ROOM Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve reaches past, starts packing it up. \nSTEVE I gotta go. See ya tonight. \nDARREN Huh? Tonight where? He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder. \nSTEVE Cirque du Freak. \nDARREN I got no money right now. \nSTEVE Don't sweat it. I got money. Meet me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion Theater. \nDARREN That place is supposed to be haunted. Steve rolls his eyes, starts out... \nDARREN What am I going to tell my parents? \nSTEVE Tell them you're sleeping over. We can meet early, walk over together. \nDARREN I don't know, man... \nSTEVE D, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna hear about it Monday? Or see it tonight? Steve lets his point sink in, then goes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "ANNIE And that's why we need a dog. She waits for an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look. \nDAD We'll have to think about it. \nANNIE How do you guys decide who's going to say no when you look at each other. \nDAD Whoever's eyes are the widest. And I didn't say no. Yet. As she tries to think through a new approach... \nDARREN Mom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's tonight? Okay? \nMOM (emphatic; no hesitation) No. \nDARREN What? Why not? \nMOM Because I said so, Darren. \nDARREN I'm fourteen. I shouldn't even have to ask stuff like this. \nMOM The answer is no. And I'm not sure I want you hanging around with Steve anymore. \nDARREN I've known him since I was five years old! \nMOM People change and I don't like the way Steve's changing. \nDARREN But -- That's not fair! \nDAD Stop arguing with her, Darren. Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As Annie wonders if she should ask what's up... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium. Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed. Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDarren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold. He pulls himself over, starts down again. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNION STREET - NIGHT \nPart of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish. Darren and Steve hurry around a corner. \nSTEVE I came here after your house. There was a van there, guy selling tickets. (holds up tickets) Rest is history. They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans. \nDARREN You know why they closed it, right? Years ago a kid fell out of the balcony and died. It's haunted. \nSteve catches himself getting spooked. He shoves Darren. \nSTEVE Get inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ZEITERION LOBBY - NIGHT \nPaint peeling. The walls scribbled on. Most of all - it's dark. Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from... \nA HALLWAY They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve... \nDARREN The balcony. Where he fell... \n", "test1_id": 1122, "test2_input": "VOICE May I help you? They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL. Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness. \nSTEVE We're here to see the show. He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand. \nMR. TALL Ticket. Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren. \nMR. TALL Do you have your ticket? Darren. Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it. \nMR. TALL This way. We're about to begin. Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow: \nDARREN \n(LOW) He knew my name. \nSTEVE Maybe he heard me say it. \nMr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But... \nAROUND CORNER When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side. The boys exchange a last look, then push through into... \nTHE ZEITERION THEATER Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special. No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out. Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down. As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second stage light goes out. And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats, the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the trumpets and all is silent. Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center. There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound. A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there.. The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR! Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck. Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr. Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat. \nMR. TALL Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We are an ancient circus. We have toured for five hundred years... \nDarren and Steve exchange a look at this information. \nMR. TALL .Bringing the remarkable and grotesque to generations. Our freaks are not people in masks. They are not harmless misfits. What you see tonight is real. Each performer unique. None harmless. To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non- reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing. A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats. Even the Wolfman takes notice. \nMR. TALL Beauty and the beast. Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance. Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes, step out and start to push the cage off stage. Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD. Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin. Some in the audience recoil. Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then... From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE & SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back with their ankles cinched behind there necks. As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck. As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds. After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus. \nRHAMUS My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And I do have two. He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches. More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda. Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time. Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the sound of metal shifting inside. The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth. He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all. With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him. Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience. As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out. A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly transfixed by the light. But in reality... The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!) down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists over backwards to set his feet down on the stage. Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of. The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales! He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye. Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose. \nDARREN & STEVE \nDARREN He's as old as us. \nSTAGE Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back to look him in the eye. And then... Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left. More applause from the audience. Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until... Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's nothing under the spot and the next instant there is -- \nLARTEN CREPSLEY! Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side. \nDARREN & STEVE Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the print-out from his pocket, compares. \nDARREN It's him... \nSTAGE Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE. \nCREPSLEY It's not true. That all tarantulas are poisonous. Though some can kill a man. With one bite. Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful. \nDARREN Reacts. A spider! \nSTAGE Crepsley makes the introduction. \nCREPSLEY Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that she never learns yours. Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it. Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through. A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks. Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey. Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop. Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise. \nCREPSLEY No...? Shall it be life? Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage. Crepsley faces the audience. \nCREPSLEY I wonder if you would be as shocked to see the same fate for me? Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage -- taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still. \nDARREN & STEVE Have a million questions, but right now the performance has their full edge-of-their-seat attention. \nSTAGE Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder. \nCREPSLEY Though we have been together such a long time, she is no pet. I think she would quite enjoy killing me. Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder. \nCREPSLEY For her bite there is no cure. Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence about to be directed at her master. Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts to play, as simple as it is evocative. Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat, starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair. She sways; she's dancing! Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about 18 inches off the end. She starts to swing. Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She sails up high over Crepsley's head. He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand. Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror. Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM. A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the gloom. It's too dark. The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out. \n", "test2_true": "AUDIENCE MAN But... What happened to him?! \nMR. TALL Don't you know? What happens to us all, can happen to any of us. That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen. \nThe houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed. Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits. \nDARREN Let's get outta here. \nSTEVE No, you go. I'm staying. Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows. \nDARREN Wait. What're you doing? Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight. As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder. Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat. \nSTEVE This is my destiny. Don't ruin it. Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense. \nSTEVE That car today. It was a sign. Sending me here. I was told there'd be a sign. Too friggin' weird. \nDARREN Told by who? The guy in the chat room? The internet guy? \nSTEVE I'll tell you later. If I can. Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back. Darren stands, whispers into the dark. \nDARREN Steve... Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT \nDarren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below. \nDARREN Steve...? No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps. \nCUT TO: \nSTEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he heads further into the dark. \nDARREN Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky. \nDARREN Steve... \nCUT TO: \nSTEVE Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it. The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling. \nDARREN Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees... \nSTEVE He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up. \nDARREN Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as... \nSTEVE Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside. \nCREPSLEY'S VOICE Are you looking for me? Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH! Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY. \nDARREN Rooted to the spot. Watching... \nSTEVE & CREPSLEY Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact. \nSTEVE I -- I know who you are. \nCREPSLEY Tell me, boy. Who am I? \nSTEVE You're a vampire. \nCREPSLEY Too broad a definition. Do you introduce yourself as a human? Who I am is Larten Crepsley. \n", "test2_id": 1123, "test3_input": "DARREN Steve... Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand. \nANNIE Darren, he's freezing. \nDARREN Get dad. Go. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY \nHospital doors BANG OPEN as a gurney bearing Steve is rushed through. Darren and his Dad follow with a DOCTOR. \nDOCTOR What kind of spider was it? \nDARREN I think some kind of a tarantula. \nDOCTOR Where is it? \nDARREN It got away. Darren's Dad holds up the camera. \nDAD We have a picture of it. The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney. \nDOCTOR Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor Lund. And we need to download a photo to poison control. This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in, surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out. PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that his world has only just started to crash down around him. \nCUT TO: \nDR. LUND - HOSPITAL CORRIDOR Tough, no nonsense. Marching along, carrying a print-out, coming to a stop where Darren sits on a plastic chair. He sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of Madam Octa. \nDR. LUND How did you make this and why would you make this? Darren's Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor. \nDR. LUND Poison control couldn't ID it. In fact, the department of Entomology at Harvard couldn't find it in their data base. So either it's a new species or it's a fake photo. \nDAD If my son said he took that photo, then that's the truth. Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then: \nWOMAN'S VOICE What have you done to him?! STEVE'S MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled, cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet. She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder. \nSTEVE'S MOM Did you hurt Stevie?! Did you?! \nShe shakes Darren hard. Darren's Dad gets between them. She breaks down, sobbing. Darren's mom tries to soothe her as she moans about what a bad mother she is. \nDR. LUND Your friend's going to die unless we find out what's in him. On Darren. He looks down to where light spills out from Steve's room. His friend is going to die in there. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nDarren as he lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. His clock switches to 2:58 AM. Deciding, Darren gets out of bed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDressed, Darren climbs out the window, starts down. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT \nDead lonely as Darren approaches, steps up to the glass door. As he leans in to look into the lobby, the door gives a little. It's unlocked. Darren pushes it open with a finger. \nCUT TO: \nINT. UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA - ZEITERION - NIGHT \nDarren's by the credenza where he hid. The coffin is gone. \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT \nMOVE WITH DARREN who comes up from below and crosses. Stay with him as he parts the curtains and comes out on the... \nZEITERION STAGE Where he stops short, sees in the center of the stage -- Crepsley's COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He grips the lid, starts sliding it back. He looks inside to see -- \nMadam Octa perched on the side, staring back at him! Darren stumbles back. The coffin lid SLAMS to the stage as Darren loses his footing, lands on his butt. And then -- APPLAUSE. One pair of hands create a hollow echo. Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping. And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet. A beat. \nCREPSLEY What have you come for this time? Darren pulls out a CRUCIFIX, holds it in Crepsley's face. The vampire takes it, looks it over. It has no effect. \nDARREN Crosses don't hurt you? \nCREPSLEY Why should they? \nDARREN Because... you're evil. \nCREPSLEY Am I? Are vampire bats evil when they drink the blood of cows? \nDARREN That's different. Bats are animals. \nCREPSLEY So am I. So are you. Our appetites don't make us evil. (as Darren ponders...) Why are you here? \nDARREN Your spider bit my friend Steve. Crepsley shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix. \nDARREN He's dying. \nCREPSLEY Yes, well, boys who play with things they do not understand can hardly complain if -- \nDARREN You have to help him! \nCREPSLEY The antidote to her poison is rare. Expensive. Why should someone as evil as I am waste it on Steve? \nDARREN I'll pay you back. If it takes 50 years. Whatever it costs. \nCREPSLEY Money doesn't interest me. \nDARREN There's something you want. That's why you're here waiting for me. Right? Crepsley's surprised and pleased by Darren's intuitiveness. \nCREPSLEY The night Steve came below to speak to me, you were there. Did you hear what we talked about? \nDARREN He wanted to... become like you. \nCREPSLEY You don't just 'become' a vampire. The change is too extreme. And if the shock didn't kill you, your inexperience would. So you become one in stages. A half-vampire at first. With greater strength than a human, but still able to go out in sunlight. You learn from a full vampire. Do you understand? \nDARREN I think so... \nCREPSLEY But your friend has bad blood. He's no good. There's no telling what he'll become as he matures. \nDARREN I don't believe that someone can have bad blood. \nCREPSLEY And yesterday you didn't believe in vampires. Regardless, I've left the Cirque. Left my protection. I need someone to protect me while I sleep. I need an apprentice. \nDARREN \n(SUDDENLY REALIZES) Me? Crepsley nods. \nDARREN You're crazy. There's no way. \nCREPSLEY Then your friend will die. The words hang in the air. Crepsley smiles. \nCREPSLEY You hardly have a choice. It's your destiny. \n", "test3_id": 1124}

{"test1_input": "DARREN Destiny? That doesn't make sense. \nCREPSLEY Try this then. You're reckless enough to steal, responsible enough to come back for a friend. That's enough for me. \nDARREN Not for me. \nCREPSLEY Yes, well, destiny can't be explained. It must be lived. Now, you're wasting my time. \nDARREN There's gotta be another way. \nCREPSLEY There isn't. \nDARREN Please... He's my friend. \nCREPSLEY And he slips away while we argue. Life or death? Yes or no? \nDARREN You'd never be able to trust me. If I got a chance for payback I'd take it. \nCREPSLEY Yes or no? Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods. Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially long, but they look thick and sharp. Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it. \nCREPSLEY You have good blood. Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers. Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers. \nCREPSLEY Lift your hands. Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain. \nCREPSLEY Get used to pain. More lies ahead. He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread. Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers. As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation. \nCREPSLEY The blood flows into your left arm and out of your right. Do you feel it? Getting near your heart? Darren nods, shivers. \nCREPSLEY Almost there. A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down. \nCrepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering. Tries to block out any sympathy he feels. \nCREPSLEY The world will start to slow down. You'll become a witness of time. (snaps out of it) Your friend's time is running out. He pulls Darren to his feet. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT \nThey step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly. \nCREPSLEY Take my arm. Don't let go. Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet. Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look. The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past. A moment later and they're in the... \nHOSPITAL PARKING LOT Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding. \nCREPSLEY Lick your fingers. Vampire spit will stop wounds from bleeding. Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot. \nDARREN How'd we get here? \nCREPSLEY It's called flitting. Which room is your friend in? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored. \nCrepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids. Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye. \nCREPSLEY We're in time. He still has a few minutes left. Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork. He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm. A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs twitching. Is he dying? \nDARREN What's happening? \nCREPSLEY He was near death. The journey back is not pleasant. What do you know about him, this boy with bad blood? \nDARREN He's my friend. \n", "test1_true": "DARREN Never met him. I don't think Steve ever did either. Why do you want to know? And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled. \nSTEVE Darren? And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay. \nCREPSLEY Will you come with me now or do you have things to set in order first? That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every- thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking, Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley. \nCREPSLEY I see... Darren's almost to the door. Crepsley stays where he is. \nCREPSLEY Run if you want. It won't help. You're a creature of the night now, Darren Shan. Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone.

DARREN'S ROOM - MORNING \nDarren asleep in his bed. The door opens and his mom enters. \nMOM Darren... Wake up, honey. Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake. As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in. \nMOM I just got off the phone. Great news. Steve's going to be okay. \nDARREN What? \nMOM The hospital says it's a miracle. Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS. Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back. \nMOM Yeah, it's great news. I know how you feel. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY \nThe door opens and Darren steps out. He takes a long look up and down the street. Nervous. Then he see the sun up in the sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun. He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the bushes... SOMEONE LEAPS! \nANNIE Boo! Darren nearly jumps out of his skin. Annie laughs. \nANNIE Got you! I finally got you! - Darren turns on her, looks like he could kill her. \nDARREN Don't ever do that again. Annie's smile drops away. As Darren continues on... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - SCHOOL - DAY \nDarren walking along, feeling isolated as he moves past the other students. Everything seems weird, off. A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then a COUPLE more coming the other way. \nKID Hey, Shan, you gotta see this. They duck into the classroom. Darren follows. \nSCIENCE LAB TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around the Boa Constrictor tank. Steve holds court. \nSTEVE .Doctor said it was a miracle. They say I'm unique -- Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back. \nSTEVE Hey, Darren. I've been looking for you. We got a lot to talk about. \nDARREN Yeah? \nSTEVE But first... Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren looks from the mouse to the snake... Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy. \nSTEVE Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What happens to us all can happen to any of us. If you watch, it's by your own free will. Say farewell... \n", "test1_id": 1122, "test2_input": "INT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD) \nDarren and Mr. Tiny reappear in the booth, but the restaurant's patrons are slowed to near motionlessness.A battle royal going on. Crepsley fighting three VAMPANEZE. All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin. Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant. Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows. Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat. Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives the second one back into the third knocking both back. A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat. As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD) \nAs leg whip 'unflits'. The patrons react to him soaring over the counter, slamming into the wall -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD) \nThe patrons near frozen again. Leg whip sliding ever so slowly down the wall. Crepsley and Sinewy One & Two FIGHTING at full speed. Sinewy One pulls Crepsley's arm up behind his back. Crepsley HOWLING as we hear the bone BREAK. Mr. Tiny grabs Darren by the wrist, pulls him toward the door. Behind them... Crepsley drives the back of his head into Sinewy One's face at the same time as Sinewy Two swings in his open palm... Sinewy One releases Crepsley who disappears as Sinewy Two slices open Sinewy One's throat. As Mr. Tiny pulls Darren out the door... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAMBURGER JOINT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD) \nCrepsley appears. Leg Whip hits the floor. Blood splashes the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees. As Leg Whip stands, Crepsley charges, 'shoulders' him halfway through the wall. Patrons SCREAM, react, scatter. As Crepsley grabs a knife... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HAMBURGER JOINT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (FLITTING WORLD) \nDarren struggles as Mr. Tiny pulls him along. Behind, through the diner windows, WE SEE Patrons frozen in flight. Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid swing with the knife in his head. Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH. Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style. \nMURLOUGH Smell the blood. The lovely blood. His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth. Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr. Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view... The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out. Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases him to move to catch it. Darren rushes back toward the restaurant. Mr. Tiny catches his watch. Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly from his side. Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat, lifts him off the ground. Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder. Murlough staggers, lets go. \nCrepsley takes Darren's hand and they flit, disappearing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT (IN THE FLITTING WORLD) \nBeyond the hamburger joint. The world beginning to streak past them. The asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet, passing cars like they were standing still. But Crepsley heaves for breath. In pain. Darren looks back over his shoulder... \nDARREN'S POV Murlough follows. Closing ground. \nDARREN & CREPSLEY \nDARREN It's behind us! Crepsley bears down, the buildings streaking by. But... \nMURLOUGH Closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes. \nCREPSLEY Almost out of gas. But looking ahead. Clocks in an instant: a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN having just crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner. Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from behind... Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears. As Murlough FADES after him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT (REAL WORLD) \nDarren and Crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing. Murlough comes out of flit in the center. WHAM! The headlights Crepsley saw frozen, but coming from the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough! He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield. As Darren and Murlough disappear again... \nThe pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street. A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he wipes it, smearing it across his cheek... \nPICK-UP DRIVER \n(RUSHING OVER) Hey, man, are you okay?! He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough stands, SWATS the driver aside. The Lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him. Murlough climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STATE HIGHWAY - DAWN \nThe sky getting lighter. A SIGN: Now Entering Pennsylvania.

ROOT CELLAR - DAWN \nCrepsley climbs down a few steps, closes the door behind him. Barely any light, but some. \nCREPSLEY Find a blanket. A rug. Cover it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HUNTING CABIN - DAWN \nDarren drags a CARPET over the root cellar door in the floor. \nROOT CELLAR It goes black except for a glint in Crepsley's eyes. He sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out. \nDARREN'S VOICE Are you okay? \nCREPSLEY My arm's broken. But it should be fine in a day or two. \nINTERCUT THE FOLLOWING: Sunlight fills the kitchen. Darren sits, exhausted. \nDARREN Who were they? Vampires? \nCREPSLEY No. The one with the watch was Mr. Tiny. Very dangerous. \nDARREN How dangerous can a man named Mr. Tiny be? \nCREPSLEY Who said he was a man? \nDARREN Then what is he? \nCREPSLEY Mr. Tiny can't be explained. He needs to be experienced. \nDARREN \n(FRUSTRATED) And the purple guy. What was he? \nCREPSLEY A vampaneze. \nDARREN Yeah? Keep talking. \nCREPSLEY Long ago humans were looked upon as animals by some vampires. Cattle to be slaughtered. Laws were passed to forbid needless killing. It made it easier to pass unnoticed among humans if we didn't murder them. Most vampires obeyed... \nDARREN But some didn't? \nCREPSLEY Seventy vampires broke away, declared themselves a separate race. The Vampaneze. Over time their appearance changed, their numbers grew. They believe it's wrong to feed from a human without killing it. \nDARREN What? That's crazy. \nCREPSLEY They believe those of us who feed in small amounts live like leeches. In shame. It led to war. Crepsley touches the scar on his face, remembers. \nCREPSLEY The last one nearly destroyed us all. There's been a truce for many years now. \n(A BEAT) Will you be alright while I sleep? Darren looks around at the dilapidated crap heap he's in. As he tries to hold his heart together... \nDARREN Oh yeah... This is so much better than where I used to be... Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what's best for both of them.. \nCREPSLEY What do you think of rejoining the Cirque du Freak? Until you get on your vampire feet so to speak. \n", "test2_id": 1123, "test3_input": "CREPSLEY \n(INTERRUPTS) It wasn't Darren. Another boy. His blood was bad. I should have killed him, but I didn't. Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all. \nCREPSLEY I met Darren shortly after. His blood was good or I certainly would have killed him. Darren reacts again. \nGAVNER PURL How could a boy find you? Crepsley shrugs. Of course he had help. \nGAVNER PURL Tiny? \nDARREN He tried to kill us. \nCREPSLEY He tried to kill me. What he wanted with you wasn't determined. \nGAVNER PURL Perhaps you chose the wrong boy. In Mr. Tiny's eyes. A moment as they consider the unspoken implications. \nDARREN What are you guys talking about!? No answer as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look. \nCREPSLEY What's important enough to track down an exile? What is your news? \nGAVNER PURL War. \nCREPSLEY I'm not interested in your wars. \nGAVNER PURL Well the other side is interested or they wouldn't be trying to get rid of you. Crepsley gets suddenly very angry. \nCREPSLEY I've had enough killing! No more! You've come to the wrong place. I am the wrong place... Gavner raises his hands in surrender. \nGAVNER PURL Even so, I'm glad you're alive. \nCREPSLEY \n(RELENTING) The sun is coming. Will you stay? \nGAVNER PURL I can still make miles. The war won't wait. And neither will bad news. I have to go. \nCREPSLEY Then travel safely. \nGAVNER PURL Would you mind if I walk a bit with your assistant? \nCREPSLEY Take him with you if you want. He's of little use to me. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - NOT FAR OFF - NIGHT \nDarren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over. \nGAVNER PURL You look sick. Doesn't Larten feed you? \nDARREN I won't drink blood if that's what you mean. I promised myself. \nGAVNER PURL Why? \nDARREN You'll get insulted. As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him... \nDARREN I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll become evil. Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself. \nGAVNER PURL The only thing drinking blood will do to you is keep you alive. \nDARREN That's how it would start. I would swear it was just to stay alive. But what'll I turn into? You're on one side of the fence or the other. My father used to say that and now I know what he meant. The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit. \nGAVNER PURL You've already turned, Darren. You need to accept what you've already become. There's no going back. They walk in silence a moment. Then: \nDARREN Why did Crepsley make himself an exile anyhow? \n", "test3_true": "DARREN With the vampaneze? \nGAVNER PURL Crepsley was once a Vampire General. One of our great leaders. He may seem reluctant, but I assure you, no one is as skilled at killing vampaneze than Crepsley is. I think that's why they'd like to get him out of the way. Kill him off before the new war starts. \nDARREN You've known him a long time? \nGAVNER PURL I was his assistant. He blooded me, as he blooded you. There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know... \nDARREN Why'd he choose you? \nGAVNER PURL To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up until now, it's the only reason he ever chooses anyone. \nDARREN Is it why he chose me? Gavner hesitates, not sure. \nGAVNER PURL That's for Crepsley to say. Not me. Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it. \nGAVNER PURL Do you know what the biggest danger is to a vampire, Darren? \nDARREN The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny? \nGAVNER PURL No. It's that they live so long they no longer care. Everything they love is left behind until they finally have nothing left to live for. Except death. The fact that he's taken an apprentice seems, to me, a good sign. A sign that he's thinking of living not dying. \nDARREN Lucky for me. Glad I could help. All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner, meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead. \nGAVNER PURL A clear run. Good. Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look. \nGAVNER PURL Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him. Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating up. And then he's gone. \nDARREN That part is definitely cool. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

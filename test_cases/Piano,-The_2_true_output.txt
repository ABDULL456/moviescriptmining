The breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing, calling to each other. 
SEAMEN Hold still you smutt! Blast the boat! Look up! Look up! Lay to! Lay to. Up with it you buggerers, hold hard! Damn me won't you hold?! Etc. 
Two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some are drunk. Behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in Scottish dress. She too is carried on the shoulders of seamen. 
ADA is placed on the sand. She looks down at her feet sinking into the wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of her. The sound of sea behind is thunderous. 
Several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand. 
Her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. But ADA's attention is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a huge piano shaped box. They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore but ADA makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher safer ground. The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free hand.

TWO SEAMEN finish carrying the last crate to shore. Trunks and boxes including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the shore. 
The SEAMEN gather together. After a discussion in which they look between ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the men approaches. Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or down on the sand. They don't want to be involved. The sight of the women alone on this beach is too hopeless. 
SEAMEN It's a little rough out there. Could be they can't get through to you in this weather. Maybe they'll come over land. 
ADA nods. 
SEAMEN Have you things for shelter? 
ADA nods. 
SEAMEN What things have you? 
ADA signs to her daughter. The little girl speaks clearly and loudly without emotion. 
FLORA She says, "thank you". 
Puzzled, the man walks off, then turns and comes back. 
SEAMEN Does your mother prefer to come on with us to Nelson? 
ADA signs vigorously to FLORA. 
FLORA She says, No. She says she'd rather be boiled alive by natives than get back in your tub. 
SEAMEN (stunned) You be damn fortuned I don't smack your puppy gob, missy. Damn lucky.

ADA is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face. 
FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play a few notes. The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness. 
2- See notes 
Suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of the piano wetting her shoes. ADA stands, pushing FLORA onto her feet. She is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed. 
They watch three of their boxes float out to sea. One of the hens has escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves.

He stops and looks around  -  sure enough a door displays a small sign:  TOILETS. 
White is sweating profusely.  He now sits on a chair, takes off his shoes, rubs his feet.  He pulls a book from a shelf behind him, looks about, opens the book and tears several pages out, folds them, stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the holes. 
He gets up, tries to backtrack, comes across an elaborate diagram of the library interior.  An arrow points to a section near a wing labelled:  MAPS.  Near the arrow it says:  YOU ARE HERE. 
He keeps walking. 
He finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked, a sign is nailed to it:  WE ARE REMODELLING.  WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE. 
White, annoyed now, tries to force his way in.  Puts his shoulder to the door, pushes several times.  It CRUMBLES under his weight  -  rotten. 
He finds himself in a DUSTY ROOM. 
HIS P.O.V. 
A narrow room, filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of old newspapers. 
TIGHT ON WHITE  -  he steps forward, pulls a folded newspaper off the shelf.  The instant he picks it up, it crumbles to dust in his hands.  He picks up another, and another, each in turn breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness. 
INT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT 
TWO SILHOUETTED FIGURES face each other across a polished black table.  They speak in a foreign language.  A phone rings. Figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively. 
Figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to lock together.  A complex puzzle.  He gets impatient with the puzzle, dashes it to the floor. 
Figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something.  Hands the note to Figure 2, who in turn drops it into A CHUTE. 
CONTROL ROOM 
The note falls from a slot in the wall before Figure 3 (in shadow yet again).  He reads from the note over a silver microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue. 
TIGHT ON A SPEAKER  -  his distorted voice.  A final mysterious person  -  Figure 4  -  listens to the announcement.  He takes a stick and moves a small cut-out figure of a man across a board, away from a large grouping of similar cut-outs.  The board resembles a planning table in a war-room. 
A HIGH ANGLE as the CAMERA PULL BACKS on the grouping of cut out figures.  More and more of them.  Ten.  Twenty.  A hundred. A sinister army. 
INT.  INTERSECTING STREET  -  NIGHT 
White is in a phone booth.  He removes the note from his pocket, dials.  No answer again.  He dials the OPERATOR.  A muffled voice over the line. 
WHITE Iím trying to reach nine zero eight triple two.  I canít get through... (beat) What?!... (angry) Shit! 
He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a coin, puts it into the slot.  Heís sweating again.  He wipes his brow with a trembling hand. 
WHITE It is?...  Which area is that number listed in?...  Is that near the ocean?...  The ocean...  Never mind. Have a Jonathan White listed?... WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I see...  Never mind. 
He hangs up, then removes the business card he found in his wallet.  He is about to dial but decides otherwise.  He steps into the street. 
A HIGH ANGLE 
White walks between tall buildings, towards a narrow street that branches off into two separate routes.  He stops.  He canít decide which branch to take  -  he steps to the left, then steps back, takes a few steps to the right, reconsiders again... 
INT.  POLICE STATION/BUMSTEADíS OFFICE  -  NIGHT 
TRACK ALONG  -  piles of towering files bursting at the seams with paperwork  -  TO FIND Bumstead hunched over notes, photographs and files.  His eyes are rimmed with red.  He doesnít seem to be getting anywhere. 
CRENSHAW O.S. Coffee? 
He looks up.  The secretary stands in the doorway with another big pile of paperwork. 
BUMSTEAD What?  I donít drink coffee.  A cup of tea would be good.  Milk and no sugar. 
Crenshaw puts the paperwork down on Bumsteadís already overcrowded desk. 
CRENSHAW Making progress? 
He looks at her like she just slapped him. 
BUMSTEAD These are the investigations of a madman.  He has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever. (without looking up) This is a mess.  A horrible mess. (looks at her now) Itís the second time now. 
Miss Crenshaw looks concerned. 
BUMSTEAD Look at this! 
He holds up a sheet of white paper  -  a report.  The woman steps over and looks at it. 
BUMSTEAD You typed this report? 
MISS CRENSHAW Yes, sir.  Anything wrong? 
BUMSTEAD Wrong?  Look at this! 
The woman bends down, adjusts her glasses, examines it. 
MISS CRENSHAW It seems fine. 
BUMSTEAD Fine?  Look here! 
His finger points at the bottom of the page  -  a tiny, INSIGNIFICANT ink smudge. 
BUMSTEAD How can I submit this? 
MISS CRENSHAW Iím sorry... 
BUMSTEAD Do you wash your hands before you type things?

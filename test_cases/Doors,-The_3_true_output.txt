Inside, PAM feels the first flames licking up, smoke wafting in. 
JIM leaves the house. 
Pam kicking wildly at the doors, trying to smash her way out as the FIRE crescendoes. She finally shatters the frail molding and bursts out. 
EXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT 
PAM runs out into Laurel Canyon like a terrified doe running from a forest fire. SONG beat NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH continues. 
EXT. STREET - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 
Jim and Mike driving drunk, fucking TWO BLACK CHICKS. Mike in the back seat. Jim drives the car up onto the grass of a Police Station and plows right into it. 
EXT. BOULEVARD - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 
Knowing who's inside, sufficient be it to see the blue Shelby Mustang plow into a telephone pole on Santa Monica Blvd. 
JIM & THE DOORS Dead President's corpse in the driver's car The engine runs on glue and tar C'mon along, we're not going very far To the East to meet the Czar... 
INT. ANNE'S SOHO LOFT - NEW YORK - NIGHT 
A HIGH PRIESTESS, assisted by a HIGH PRIEST, conducts a Wicca wedding amidst a setting of candles, mixing a few drops of JIM and ANNE's blood into a consecrated cup of wine, from which they drink. They all wear long black robes, the only light from the candles, standing inside a circle in front of a table with altar, incense, chalice. 
HIGH PRIESTESS (dimly heard) ...we worship the ancient forces of Nature, the Triple Goddess, the Great Mother and the Lord, the Horned One... when the vow is taken 
INT. LIMO - DAY 
MOTORCYCLE ESCORTS COPS zoom past the limo windows on the LA STREETS. 
INT. ANNE'S SOHO LOFT - NEW YORK - RESUME NIGHT 
The PRIESTESS presses the two cut wrists together, binding them with a red cord. 
HIGH PRIESTESS ...it is a blending of souls on a karmi and cosmic plane that affects your future incarnations on this planet. Death does not part -- only lack of love -- and the vow is forever in the Goddess' sight. 
JIM & DOORS (building faster and faster) Run with me, run with me Run with me, let's run Some outlaws live by the side of a lake The minister's daughter's in love with a snake 
Jim faints. 
EXT. DOORS OUTDOOR CONCERT - NIGHT 
JIM, mind totally gone into his trance, spreading his arms like wings, hopping from one foot to the other like a shaman around his microphone, whirling, yelling out great rewards for the tribe. Plentiful antelope, healthy corn. 
The kids are going wild -- writhing like maenads in his intoxicating embrace. Embers from an enormous BONFIRE drift past the stadium lights into the night. But the KIDS, increasingly frustrated by a barrage of COPS, cannot see their leader and now push against the cops with the very result the authorities seek to repress. 
JIM & DOORS Who lives in a well by the side of the road Wake up girl! We're almost home We shall see the gates by morning We shall be inside by evening Sun, sun, sun Burn, burn, burn Moon, moon, moon! 
RAY, gone into his own trance, happening to look up from his keyboard. His eyes widen. 
His POV -- an INDIAN SHAMAN hovers over the microphone. Cloaked in hides, his face obscured by a horned headdress with colored tails and feathers streaming down his shoulders, rattles in each fist, the BONFIRE glowing... 
JIM & DOORS I will GET YOU Soon -- soooooooon... SOOOOOOONNNN... 
The COPS can't hold. TEENAGE SHOCK TROOPS hitting the stage, clambering up. The stage becoming a riot. Cops wading in with sticks. ROADIES and BODYGUARDS yanking the MUSICIANS from their places... 
JIM (indifferent, to himself) I am the Lizard King I can do anything 
As DOG hauls the shaman king off in a bearhug, smiling stoned, immaculate. 
INT. ALTA CIENEGA MOTEL - DAY 
Start slow CLOSE UP on JIM, he's crying, his head on a pillow, silent, haunted... pull out to see the room, no explanations. A TV GAME SHOW is on, JUDY, 17, and her FRIEND, 16, watching naked, skinny..., piles of murder magazines and books, clothes, and personal items trashed around the thread bare room he calls home. She looks over at him. 
JUDY Man wow -- watsa matter Jim? It was beautiful... wasn't it? Kim? Wasn't it great? 
KIM (2nd girl, studying murder magazine) It was all right 
Jim continues to cry. 
JIM (gently) Hey it's no big deal. I like to cry when I come. It's close to death... maybe you'd better go home now before your mama gets home. 
JUDY She is home Jim (whispers to Kim who goes into bathroom, giggling) 
JIM What? 
JUDY It's a secret. 
JIM (innocently) You know you've always been good to me in bed Judy. And it was nice of you to bring your friend. I want to keep seeing both of you but it can't be all the time y'know. It would be a night every few weeks or so. That's just the way I am, I'm not dependable. I can't be a boyfriend. Would you do that? I mean could you handle it? That way? I don't want you to get hurt. 
JUDY (putting on a tacky dress) I already been hurt enuf' by you Jim, I don't have much to lose do I? 
JIM ...do you love me? 
JUDY ...yes 
JIM ...Well, just think about it awhile. Call me when you get your new number... (Girl 2 comes back in, dressed) Hey that's a really nice outfit you're wearing, you really have good taste in clothes. How long have you two been friends? 
He's so concerned, so solicitous that both girls crack up laughing. 
JIM (grins) What? 
A knock at the door. 
JIM Come back later! (another knock) Who is it! 
VOICE (slurred) It's a secret. 
JIM (recognizes it) Whyn't you come back later. I don't have any clothes on.

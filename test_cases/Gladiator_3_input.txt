COMMODUS It is my responsibility to make the world as it should be.  How is it I have made this world? 
LUCILLA Brother, do not be influenced by the mob.  They are a great, faceless beast -- 
COMMODUS They are not "the mob," Lucilla, they are the people.  They are my children and all I want to do is love them. 
A beat.  He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.  He touches it. 
COMMODUS Our father loved Maximus... and I love him still... yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. And they love him for it.  Just as Marcus loved him for it.  Tell me why, Lucilla. 
LUCILLA They see themselves in him.  They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his.  They think he fights for them. 
COMMODUS And what do I do but fight for them?!  I give them games to please them.  I strangle dissent to give them peace.  I empower the Praetorians to give them order. What more can I do?! 
A beat. 
COMMODUS Say I should fight him, in the arena.  Let my children see who the Gods truly favor. 
LUCILLA And what if he should win? 
A beat. 
Commodus continues to slowly move around the room. 
COMMODUS A God is more powerful than a man... 
This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.  Then: 
LUCILLA Caesar, you let this unduly worry you.  At best he is a passing fancy -- he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral -- he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears -- 
COMMODUS But I need to know -- why do they love him? 
LUCILLA Mercy. 
He stops.  Looks at her. 
LUCILLA He will not kill in the arena.  He is merciful.  As they all wish they were in their own hearts. 
Something in her words has struck a chord in him. 
COMMODUS And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too.  For a moment... they are Gods.  Offering life. 
He looks at her. 
COMMODUS But who can be more merciful than the Emperor of Rome? 
EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY 
Maximus is fighting a thick GIANT of a man.  A few quick blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes to the sand. 
The arena cheers their hero. 
Maximus stands over the beaten Giant.  The crowd waits for the famous act. 
Maximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword, refusing to kill.  He walks away. 
The arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of "Maximus the Merciful" grows to deafening proportions. 
Suddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos -- horrified -- 
The Praetorians surround Maximus.  He is unarmed, but coils for the inevitable battle. 
Then the Praetorians part... 
And Commodus walks through them.  He carries something wrapped in a rich cloth.  Maximus glares at him. 
The Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly. The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last. 
Maximus and Commodus stare at each other.  The crowd cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this incredible confrontation. 
COMMODUS Brother... we've taken a sad path since we were children at Capri, have we not? 
Maximus doesn't answer. 
COMMODUS For my own part... I am sorry it came to this.  And to you alone of all men, I acknowledge my errors. And my regret.  I shall live with my sin for all my days. 
MAXIMUS As will I, Commodus.  As will I. 
Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle.  Inside is a small wooden sword.  He holds it up so the crowd can see. 
A collective gasp.  The wooden sword, prized by all gladiators above all else.  Freedom. 
COMMODUS As the first act of my contrition I offer you the wooden sword of freedom. 
He holds out the wooden sword.  A beat.

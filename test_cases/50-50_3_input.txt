KATIE (EXCITED) Adam! This is fantastic. 
Adam is slightly taken aback by Katie's response. 
KATIE (CONT'D) You know if you're interested, there are some more advanced forms of therapy that I think could be really useful. 
ADAM Sure, if you think it'll help. 
INT. LAUGHTER THERAPY - DAY 
Adam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST Good morning class. Before we begin I'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus. 
The class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid. 
SETH (quietly to Adam) What are they laughing at? 
ADAM (quietly to Seth) Just go with it. 
Seth and Adam laugh along with the others. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (to Adam and Seth) Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter. (MORE) 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life. 
The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at Adam and then Seth. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) We don't tell jokes here, we tell the truth - and we laugh at that truth. 
The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) So let us share. Adam, why don't you tell us what brings you here? 
Adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D) We're all friends here in the Laughter Pagoda. 
ADAM I, ah, have cancer. 
The entire class laughs hysterically. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh. Everyone. Beverly, share - 
BEVERLY Yesterday, I confiscated my son's pornography collection and then used it to masturbate 6 times. 
The class laughs. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST Paul, share, 
PAUL My wife told me she's a lesbian. And then left me for my sister. 
The class laughs. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST JIM - 
JIM (GLUM) I owe two men eight grand by Friday. 
The class laughs. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST SETH - 
SETH My best friend is a giant pussy. 
The class laughs. 
ADAM My best friend's favorite band is Abba. 
Everyone laughs except for Seth. 
SETH (DEFENSIVE) When I was 12. 
LAUGHTER THERAPIST (HYSTERICAL) Abba! Wonderful. I love it. Seth laugh.

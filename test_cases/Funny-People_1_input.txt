IRA You made me the tacky? I'm not a lacky, it's a job. 
GEORGE It's not a job, you're a tacky. You're not even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad. 
IRA Who cares? If being funny means being like you, I rather be a little less funny. 
GEORGE Mission accomplished. 
IRA You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die. 
GEORGE I'm not going anywhere! 
IRA Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything! 
GEORGE Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door. 
IRA Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a huge mistake. 
GEORGE Wake me when we get home. George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed. 
INT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Music up: Ted Hawkins' song "Strange Conversation." Ira drives George home in the dark. Neither one speaks. We see images of different cities going by the window. Ira thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead, 
EXT. GUYS' APARTMENT 
Ira pulls up to his apartment. 
IRA okay, I'm getting out. You have to drive yourself home. I'm getting out here. 
GEORGE Why didn't you drive me to my house? 
IRA Because then I'd still have your car. 
GEORGE You'll drop it off later. 
IRA There is no later! I'm not going to ever talk to you again. So I don't want your car. 
GEORGE So that's how it's going to be. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE 
George enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile has a big post-it note that says: "READ THESE!" 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE 
George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's really bright in his room. George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The room goes dark. Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban. "How to Clean Up Clutter." 
ANCHORWOMAN (ON TV) You know, when you've got a big family, and you've got a lot of clutter... 
INT. GUYS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Ira is talking to Leo. 
LEO We rented out your room to Jay. But you can crash on the couch if you want. 
IRA Oh man, you got jerked off on that couch. 
JONAH I fucking didn't cum on the couch. Just sleep on it for a month, and then we'll find some excuse to boot Jay out. 
IRA Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way for a while. 
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE 
George reads one from a large pack of scripts. A few pages in, he clearly doesn't like it. He puts it down, picks up another one. The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Ira writes at a table. 
EXT. STORE - DAY 
George walks out of a store. A beautiful woman tries to chat him up, but he lets her know he i.s"busy and has to go. He walks off. She looks disappointed. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT

CAMERON I believe we skipped most of that, sir. 
MR. NOLAN All right, then, we'll start over. What is poetry? 
There is a knock at the classroom door. 
MR. NOLAN Come. 
The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn away when hey see it is Keating. 
KEATING Excuse me. I came for my personals. Should I come back after class? 
MR. NOLAN Get them now, Mr. Keating. 
MR. NOLAN Gentlemen, turn to page 21 of the introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on "Understanding Poetry." 
Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny room off the classroom. 
CAMERON That page has been ripped out, sir. 
MR. NOLAN Well, borrow somebody else's book. 
CAMERON They're all ripped out, sir. 
MR. NOLAN What do you mean, they're all ripped out? 
CAMERON Sir, we, uh- 
MR. NOLAN Never mind. 
Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then slaps the open page. 
MR. NOLAN Read! 
As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away. 
CAMERON "Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2)..." 
The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. 
CAMERON "... How important is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph--" 
Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him. 
TODD Mr. Keating! They made everybody sign it. 
Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd. 
MR. NOLAN Quiet, Mr. Anderson. 
TODD You gotta believe me. It's true. 
KEATING I do believe you, Todd. 
MR. NOLAN Leave, Mr. Keating. 
TODD But it wasn't his fault! 
MR. NOLAN Sit down, Mr. Anderson! 
Todd reluctantly returns to his seat. 
MR. NOLAN One more outburst from you or anyone else, and you're out of this school! Leave, Mr. Keating. 
Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom. 
MR. NOLAN I said leave, Mr. Keating. 
Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating. 
TODD O Captain! My Captain! 
MR. NOLAN Sit down, Mr. Anderson! 
Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk. 
MR. NOLAN Do you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This is your final warning, Anderson. How dare you? Do you hear me? 
After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.

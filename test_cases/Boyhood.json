{"train": "BOYHOOD \nWritten by \nRichard Linklater \nEXT.   OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY \nMASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him. \nMOM Hey, love bug. You ready? \nHe is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the car. \nMASON Yeah.     Hey, guess what, Mom? \nMOM What? \nMASON I figured out where wasps come from. \nMOM Oh, yeah?    Where? \nMASON Well, I think it must be if you flick a rock into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp. \nMOM Dang... \nMASON Yep. \nMOM That's cool. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nDriving... \nMOM So how was your day at school? \nMASON Fine. \nMOM Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kinda liked her. \nMASON What did she say? \nMOM Well... she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments. And I told her, \"I know he does them, 'cause I check them every night.\" She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack. \nMASON She didn't ask for 'em. \nMOM Well, baby, she doesn't have to. You're supposed to turn them in. And she said you're still staring out the window all day. \nMASON Not all day. \nMOM And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener. \nMASON Not on purpose. \nMOM Wait, she said that you crammed a bunch of rocks in it. \nMASON I thought if it could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks. \nMOM (stifling laugh) Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks? \nMASON I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection. \nMOM Hm. \nShe glances back at him, with an understanding sigh. \nEXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY \nMason rides his bike across the front yard and heads down the street. Soon he and his friend TOMMY are riding down the embankment of a large drainage ditch. \nEXT. DITCH - DAY \nMason runs up, as Tommy is spray-painting a drawing on the concrete wall of the drainage ditch. \nMASON Dude, when's my turn? \nTOMMY I don't know. \nTommy hands Mason the can of spray paint.     Mason begins to spray-paint a letter on the wall. \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) (calling out) ...Maaason. \nTOMMY Samantha! \nSAMANTHA Oh!    Tommy!    Is Mason down there? \nTOMMY Yeah. \nSAMANTHA Well, tell him he has to come home for dinner. \nTOMMY   (O.S.) Okay. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMason lays on the floor watching a cartoon. \nThere's a knock at the door, and Mom comes out to answer it. It's TED. \nMOM Hey. \nTED Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you ready? Hey, Mason. \nMASON Hey, Ted. \nTED Come on, come on, hurry up.      Let's go. \nMOM What time is it? \nTED It's nine.     Let's go, let's go. \nMOM Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause Janice flaked out. I don't have a sitter. \nTED Why didn't you call somebody else? \nMOM Well, I can't get a baby-sitter now, it's nine o'clock. But you're welcome to hang out with us. \nTED Well, no. I mean we have plans. The guys are expecting me. \nMOM Well... you can go. \nTED (O.S.) All right. Yeah, well, I'll come back in a couple of hours. Is that okay? \nMOM Yeah.   Yes. \nTED All right. \nMOM It's okay. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe kids lie on either side of Mom, as she reads a story aloud to them. \nMOM (Reading) \"Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle.\" \"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. \"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor,\" said Hermione. \"She haunts a toilet?\" (MORE) \nMOM Samantha, I have to go back to college so I can make us a better living. \nSmack. \nMOM (O.S.) (CONT'D) With this job I can't take care of us the way I'd like to. I can't keep going this way. And Grandma said she'd help us out... and it would be nice to be near her. \nSAMANTHA Fine, Mother. You can do whatever you want but (shrugs) We're not moving. (Smacks) \nMason moves his fork around in his bowl. \nMASON What about our friends? \nMOM Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write. We can come back to visit. And guess what? \nShe reaches out to touch Samantha's arm. \nMOM (CONT'D) This place that Grandma found us, you'll each have your own room. Right? \nSamantha shrugs. \nMOM (CONT'D) And there's a pool. \nSamantha shrugs again, clearly not sold on the idea. \nINT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMason and Mom are lying on his bed together. \nMASON Mom, do you still love Dad? \nMOM I still love your father... but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together. \nMASON What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't? \nMOM Oh, that won't be a problem. He can call Grandma and she'll tell him or he can call Information. We won't be hard to find. \nShe pushes back his hair lovingly. \nMASON Is he still in Alaska? \nMOM Well, that's what your uncle says. \nMASON Probably taming polar bears or something. \nMOM Yeah... well, I hope they're taming him. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nThe moving van drives off as mom puts another item in the pile of stuff to be left at the curb. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nMom and Mason are getting ready to paint in the empty bedroom. They're looking at the two lone murals, which look a little odd without the bunk bed in front of them. \nMOM Here, wanna help me out? \nMASON Sure. \nMOM Okay. Take this paint... very carefully... and paint any little smudge or mark or anything on the baseboard there, behind the door, and all around the doorways on the inside. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMeanwhile, Samantha is talking on the phone. \nSAMANTHA (on phone) She says we're gonna come visit and I'm gonna write and call you. Oh, wait, hold on a second. I'm getting another call. (Pushes Flash) Hello? Sorry, Tommy, Mason can't come over today. We're moving. And I'm on the other line. Bye. (Pushes Button) Althea? I'm gonna be sending Sailor Scout instructions. Email, and write back telling me how the other scouts are doing. Well, because you're the leader now. \nDuring the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints over the \"growth chart\" lines on the bedroom door jamb. \nEXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY \nCarrying their final belongings from inside the house, they slowly exit the front door and head over to the car. \nMOM Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get there before it gets dark. \nSAMANTHA Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle, goodbye mailbox. Goodbye box of stuff Mommy won't let us take with us but we don't wanna throw away. Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy as much for making us move. \nMOM Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye to that little horse shit attitude? Okay? 'Cause we're not taking that in the car. \nJust before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the neighborhood. \nMASON Goodbye old lady who listens to rock music and rides a motorcycle. \nSoon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into the distance. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nMason and Samantha are restless     and energetic, letting their childish energy get the best of     them as they wrestle, hit, and squeal at each other in the     back seat of the car. It is all well-intentioned though, as     the two share a laugh after Mom tells them to quiet down. \nSAMANTHA Eeeee!   Don't! \nMOM Hey! Hey, what's happening back there? Stop, put the barrier up. \nSAMANTHA Ahh!   Stop!    No! \nMason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha, while his Mom speaks. \nMOM Hey, put the pillow between you. Make a barrier, come on. Stop. We're gonna play a game called The Game of Silence. Whoever can stay quiet for the longest period of time wins. You guys think you can do that? Okay, go! \nThe family's car moves on toward the Houston skyline just as dusk arrives. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nMason appears grumpy, trying to shove what he needs for the day into his backpack quickly. \nMOM (O.S.) The bus'll be here in ten minutes. \nMOM (CONT'D) (steps into doorway) Put that homework in your backpack! \nMOM (O.S.) (CONT'D) Go eat!    Baby, go eat! \nMASON I am! \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nSamantha places pancakes on their plates while talking to Mason in a cryptic language, reminiscent of pig latin. \nSAMANTHA ...I affatay servay yoohay. \nMASON Speak English! Shut up. Mom! She's speaking that stupid language again! \nMOM Samantha! \nSAMANTHA I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother. You know, he's a little slow in the head. He did officially flunk first grade. \nMOM Sit your butt down. \nSAMANTHA Yes sir, Mother sir! \nShe salutes. \nMOM All right, listen up guys. Grandma's gonna pick you up after school. Your dad is in town for the day so you're gonna spend the afternoon with him. \nSAMANTHA Hmm. \nGRANDMA You got backpacks, your purse. Homework.

Hop in there. \nGRANDMA     (O.S.) Seat belts! \nDAD Seat belts.     Alright. \nHe motions to Grandma that he's got it covered. \nDAD (CONT'D) Seat belts. Not like this car has any seat belts. \nINT.   BOWLING ALLEY - LATER \nSamantha is bowling, her pink ball hurdling down the lane toward the pins. \nDAD (O.S.) Nice...   Nice... Nice... \nStrike! \nSAMANTHA Yay! \nDAD Yeah!    Alright! \nDad is clearly impressed and excited for Samantha, as he stands to embrace her. \nDAD (CONT'D) Come here, come here, yes! That was awesome!

We got something! Ooooh! \nAnother gutter ball. \nMASON Last time I went bowling we had bumpers and it was a lot more fun! \nDad gets up to bowl. \nDAD You don't want the bumpers, alright? You bowl a strike with the bumpers and it doesn't mean anything. Trust me. Just lay it out on the lane. One, two, three and... \nSamantha mimes smoking, points to Dad, as if to say that he smells of cigarettes. It's Dad's turn to bowl. \nDAD (CONT'D) Ka-blam! Let's hear it for the father! Whoo! (To Samantha) Get up there, get in there... \nSAMANTHA Yay!   Great job! \nDAD Get out there, girl, get out there! \nScore-keeping screen flashes an animated alligator that reads: STRIKE \nEXT.

She left a message. \nBILL What'd she say? \nSAMANTHA Nothing much. \nBILL What did she say? \nSAMANTHA She said she'd be back later. \nBILL And that's all? \"I'll be back later,\" click? \nSAMANTHA She said, \"Stay in your rooms.   I'll be back later.\" \nBILL (O.S.) I'll be back later, stay in your rooms. And that's all? Hm? \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nBILL Where is she? \nSAMANTHA I don't know. \nBILL Where is she? \nSAMANTHA She didn't say! \nBILL Alright, everybody get in the car. Hurry up! Get in the car! \nEXT.   LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - DAY \nMindy stands at the ATM. The screen first reads: PLEASE TAKE YOUR RECEIPT. Then: INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. She walks over to Bill's car window. \nMINDY It's still not working. \nSAMANTHA Well, what's gonna happen to them? What happens when their legal guardian is dangerous and abusive? \nMOM You know, I don't know honey. I called their mom. I called the Child Protective Services. You know, I have you and your brother. We were in a dangerous situation. You're my responsibility. \nSAMANTHA Are we ever gonna see them again? \nMOM I don't know. And I hope so. \nSAMANTHA How much longer are we gonna be here? \nMom fights back tears. \nMOM Not long. We're... (starts crying) Oh, I don't -- I don't know. I don't have the answer to everything. \nCAROL Hey, listen. We are happy to have you here as long as you want. As long as you need. This is fun for us, isn't it? \nABBY Mm-hmm. \nCAROL Yeah, it's like having a big sister? Like having a brother. \nMOM We're gonna help out, right? You're not even gonna know we're here. \nCAROL Okay. \nEXT.   SCHOOL - DAY \nMom pulls up to drop Samantha off at the front doors of her new Junior High School. \nSAMANTHA Mom, this is awful. You're dumping me in some parking lot of this school where I don't even know anyone! I'm leaving all my friends and I didn't even get to say goodbye! I don't know where to go! \nMOM Okay, Samantha. You go right through that door. The office is right there. They're expecting you, they're gonna give you your schedule. Here's your lunch money. I will pick you up right here at 3:30. \nSAMANTHA I'm wearing dirty clothes! Because you wouldn't even let us get our stuff! We don't even have a place to live! This sucks! \nSamantha gets out of the car, slamming the door behind her. Mom screams out of the window as she walks away. \nMOM Samantha... I'm doing the best I can! And you're right, it sucks! But it doesn't suck half as much as having a drunk fool slam your head against a wall! So cut your horseshit attitude. \nMom turns to Mason in the back as he climbs toward the front seat. \nMOM (CONT'D) Put your seat belt on! \nINT.   SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nMom is walking Mason to his class. \nMOM You know if you need anything I'm in room 112, right? \nMason nods. \nMOM (CONT'D) Okay. This is Mrs. Darby's room. Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay. Okay? \nMom leans in to kiss him. \nMASON Mom... \nMason walks away, embarrassed at her public affection. \nINT.   SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe students all make small talk as they wait for class to begin. Mason enters and looks to MRS. DARBY for instruction. \nMRS. DARBY Hi!   Are you Mason? \nMASON Yeah. \nMRS. DARBY Hi. I'm Mrs. Darby. I'm glad to meet you. Why don't you sit here? (to Kenny) Kenny! Off! \nKenny climbs down from on top of his desk and takes his seat. \nKENNY Yes ma'am. \nMRS. DARBY Kenny. This is Mason and I want you to show him around today, okay? \nKENNY Got it. \nMRS. DARBY Okay. \nKENNY Hey dude.    Welcome to the suck. \nThe boys trade a casual low five and exchange a smile. \nMRS. DARBY (O.S.) Everybody, listen up. We have a new student joining us today. His name is Mason, he's sitting in the back row. (MORE) \nMRS. DARBY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Kenny's gonna be his buddy, but I want each one of you to take the time today, to introduce yourselves, and welcome him to school. Okay? Alright? Let's get started. \nEXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY \nMason pushes an Obama/Biden campaign sign into the ground, before he and Samantha walk across the street. Samantha waits in the street with more signs, while Mason knocks on the RESIDENT's front door. \nRESIDENT   (O.S.) What? \nThe white-haired Resident is standing to Mason's right, beneath his carport. \nMASON Oh, hi. Can I put an Obama sign in your yard? \nRESIDENT Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama supporter? \nMason shrugs. \nRESIDENT (CONT'D) No. \nMason turns to leave. \nRESIDENT (CONT'D) This is private property. Get off. I could shoot you! \nHe rejoins Samantha at the street. \nMASON What a dick. \nSAMANTHA He had a Confederate flag on his house. \nEXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nSamantha is now talking to a young, BLONDE HOUSEWIFE. \nBLONDE HOUSEWIFE I love it! (MORE) \nBLONDE HOUSEWIFE (CONT'D) Young Obama supporters out on the trail. This is great! Are you doing this through your school? \nSAMANTHA Um.   Our dad's a big supporter. \nBLONDE HOUSEWIFE Oh, that's great. I mean, we've just got to pull together to get this win, right? \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nBLONDE HOUSEWIFE Oh, I just love him so much. I mean I have these dreams where I'm just kissing him because I just love him so much! He's so cute, isn't he? \nSAMANTHA (laughs) Yeah. \nBLONDE HOUSEWIFE Do you know, I made these t-shirts for my kids. \"My Momma's for Obama!\" Do you like it? It's good, right? Yeah. \nSamantha turns to walk towards the street. \nDAD And this is Mason Junior right here. Tammy. \nTAMMY      (O.S.) Mason Junior. \nDAD   (O.S.) Say hi. \nMASON Hi. \nTAMMY Hi, Mason. Nice to meet you.      Heard a lot about you guys. \nDAD Yeah, yeah.     What're you doin' here? You uh... \nTAMMY Oh, I'm just here with some friends. \nDAD Oh, well, uh.... \nTAMMY Yeah.     What are you guys up to? \nDad sits back down at the table. \nDAD Um, we're going camping. Well no, this one is not going camping. This one is going to a party. \nTAMMY (to Samantha) Ohh... Fun. \nDAD We, the men, are going camping. \nTAMMY Boys are going camping. Alright, very nice. Well uh, we still on for tomorrow or...? \nDAD   (O.S.) Yeah -- \nTAMMY Yeah? \nDAD Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'll drop him off at seven and then I'll just call you, alright? \nTAMMY Okay. Great. It was really nice meeting you both. Take care. \nDAD I'll see you. \nTAMMY Talk to you soon. Bye. \nTammy walks away. Mason smirks at his dad. \nDAD Don't -- don't, don't look at me like that, alright? I just -- look, just to finish the point -- okay? I was twenty-three when your mom had you, alright? So was she, alright? And we didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents, and I wish that -- I wish I were a better parent to you guys. Alright? And I, I hope that you can learn from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a condom. Or get Garrett to -- I don't know. Whatever. \nSamantha cringes, as Dad laughs. Mason can't help but smile. \nINT. MOVING CAR - DAY \nDad and Mason are driving along the open road, listening to a song by Wilco. \nDAD Now... listen to this song, alright? \nSings along: \nDAD (CONT'D) \"I try to stay busy\" It's just straight up, the lyrics... it's a straight up old school country song. \nSONG \"I do the dishes, I mow the lawn...\" \nDAD Listen to the production of this. Production's like uh, like \"Abbey Road\" or something. \nSONG \"I try to keep myself occupied\" \nDad sings along. \nDAD \"Even though I know you're not comin' home.\" You know, his old woman's gone... straight up. Nothin' fancy. \nDAD AND SONG \"I try to keep the house nice and neat. Make my bed. I change the sheets.\" \nEXT. RIVERBED - DAY \nMason and Dad walk along the rocks, mid-conversation. They sit down near the water and begin taking off socks and shoes. \nMASON Yeah, I think she's about to get her master's degree. \nDAD Well, then she's gonna start applying for teaching jobs? \nMASON I think she already has. \nDAD Really?   Where? \nMASON (shrugs) All over. \nDAD All over Texas? \nMASON Yeah. \nDAD Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know? It's no big deal. We can handle that. I'll still come get you every other weekend. I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something, it'll just be a little more car time. No big deal. \nMASON I'm just kinda sick of moving. \nDAD Well, I bet you are. But you know, you never know. I mean, I might have to move, right? I'm working for this insurance company now. These places get bought and sold all the time. You know? We'll just roll with it. \nThey take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts. \nMASON I thought you were a musician? \nDAD I am but... life is expensive, you know. Guy's got to be responsible. What do you think? \nMason pushes his Dad into the water, then dives in himself. \nDAD (CONT'D) Hey, hey, you bast -- Oh you, punk kid! You got no respect! \nDad splashes his son and they both begin to swim. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nMason and Dad are now hiking through the woods. \nMASON You know that redhead at the bowling alley? \nDAD Sure.     What about her? \nMASON Do you know her well? \nDAD Ahhh, you know, we've hung out a little bit. \nMASON Is she your girlfriend? \nDAD How do you mean? \nMASON Like... have you kissed her? \nDAD Um... Yeah. Yeah. I've kissed her. What about you? You got a girlfriend? \nMASON Sort of. \nDAD Really.     Have you uh, have you kissed her? \nMASON Not really. \nDAD Yeah.     Well, what have you done? \nBully #2 walks over to join the altercation. \nBULLY #2 I don't think pretty boy's hair's good enough. \nBully #2 tries to mess with Mason's hair. Mason blocks his hand. \nBULLY #2 (CONT'D) Hey!   Don't touch me, faggot! \nAnother student enters. The two bullies start to walk away. Bully #1 shoves Mason and flips him off, as they exit. \nBULLY #1 You're a fuckin' asshole. \nEXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON \nMason leans against the wall of the school, waiting for Samantha to pick him up. When he realizes she isn't coming, he starts to walk away. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN SAN MARCOS - MOMENTS LATER \nMason is now passing through an alley with JILL, who walks her bike alongside him. \nJILL    (O.S.) Hey, Mason! \nMASON Hi Jill. \nJILL So, where are you going? \nMASON Over to the college. \nJILL What's going on there? \nMASON My mom's a teacher. \nJILL Oh, cool!     What does she teach? \nMASON Psychology... I think.      What are you up to? \nJILL Oh, my mom owns Needleworks. (MORE) \nJILL (CONT'D) The arts and crafts store over there? So I'm just kind of hanging out. But I'm supposed to be going to the hospital soon. \nMASON How come? \nJILL You know Courtney? Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring? Wears Hot Topic every day? \nMASON I... think so. \nJILL We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kinda grown apart. She sorta got all emo. She thinks I'm a prep. But, I still consider her a friend! Anyway, she cut one of her wrists. I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit. \nJill glances down at the book in Mason's hand. \nJILL (CONT'D) So what are you reading? \nMASON Oh, it's uh, \"Breakfast of Champions\". Kurt Vonnegut. \nJILL I think my older brother likes him. I'm reading \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" for the third time. My friends make fun of me. I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the \"Twilight\" books. Have you read them? \nMASON Sure haven't. \nJILL I tried... but it was so cheesy!   So how do you like San Marcos? \nMASON I like it alright. It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool. Have you always lived here? \nJILL Yeah. If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin. Have you been there yet? \nMASON I went to San Antonio for a day, but... I haven't been to Austin yet. \nJILL That's where all the high school kids go, on weekends, for shows and stuff. \nMASON That's what I've heard. \nJILL So are you going to Shauna's party next weekend? \nMASON Um... I think I heard about it.    I'm not really sure, though. \nJILL Well you should! \nMASON Why's that? \nJILL Well -- LeeAnn has a big crush on you and I know she was hoping you would go. You don't have a girlfriend, do you? \nMASON Not currently. \nJILL Well then, you should come. I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there. \nMASON Okay. \nJILL But don't tell LeeAnn I told you that. She'd kill me. \nMASON I won't. \nJILL Well, I better get going.   See you later. \nMASON Bye. \nINT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY \nMason walks into his mother's classroom. He takes a seat to observe from the back, while she lectures. \nMOM (O.S.) His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, \"Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!\" Or... \"Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!\" \nThe class laughs. \nMOM (CONT'D) So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment -- oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I -- some of you might have classes with Elena -- she and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by. (pause) I'm not the greatest cook... \nThe class laughs again. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nMason opens the door as he and his mother enter the house. \nMOM Thanks. \nMom drops her purse on the table and then walks down the hallway to Samantha's bedroom. She knocks on the door before walking inside. \nMOM (CONT'D) Samantha! \nSamantha is sitting on her bed, listening to music with a friend, GABY. \nSAMANTHA Okay!    Mom... \nMOM Why in the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would? \nSAMANTHA Mom, I know what you're gonna say. She was running late and we couldn't turn around. \nMOM No, no! No excuses! The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do. You stranded your brother! \nSAMANTHA It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around and go get some kid at the middle school. \nMOM What do you mean \"some kid\"? He's your brother! And you know what? We've helped Janie out before. I mean, she lives right around the corner. It's no big deal. \nSAMANTHA Sorry. \nMOM You know what, Samantha? You need to start thinking long and hard about who you want to be. (MORE) \nSENIOR GUY Yeah, you ever made her, uh, howl into the night? \nMASON A few times. \nTONY (skeptical) Really? \nSENIOR GUY Yeah, right.     What was her name, Lucky? \nMASON Nooo. Jennifer. She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston. \nCHARLIE You're fucking lying. \nMASON I don't care if you assholes believe me or not. \nSENIOR GUY Let me guess -- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here... lefty. \nSenior Guy motions with his left hand. \nMASON Hey, fuck you. I would, but none of the girls here want to. \nCHARLIE Dude, it's not what they want, man. It's what you want. \nSENIOR GUY True dat. \nSenior Guy toasts, as Mason rolls his eyes. \nCHARLIE You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man. \nMASON Oh yeah? \nCHARLIE Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs. (Points to Tony) Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band. \nTONY I'm not in the fucking marching band. \nSENIOR GUY Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute. \nTONY Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night? \nSENIOR GUY Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit! \nSenior Guy throws a beer just past Tony. \nCHARLIE It's all good, man. These little fuzz nuts are going to get their chance soon enough. We got some whores coming by later. \nCHASE Yeah? \nSENIOR GUY Hell yeah! \nCHARLIE Now, I know Chase will fuck anything. I mean, I've seen this kid mount boulders before. But what about you guys? You in? \nMASON Whatever. \nCHARLIE Alright. \nSENIOR GUY Alright, good man. What about you, Peter Puffer? \nTONY I don't know. Maybe. \nSENIOR GUY Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there. \nTONY I'm not gay. \nCHARLIE Give it some time, man.     You'll realize. \nTONY Fuck y'all. \nCHARLIE See, that's exactly my point, man. Nah, but we don't have whores coming over, we were just fucking with you to see what you'd say. \nSENIOR GUY Yeah, and you just earned your Vag Badge. \nCHARLIE Put it next to your bitch card. \nSENIOR GUY Yeah, 'cause you know, you're a bitch. Now hold this, like the bitch you are, bitch. \nThe boys return to breaking boards. \nSENIOR GUY (CONT'D) Alright, this shit is called the Death Punch. \nSenior Guy breaks the board in half with one direct punch. \nBOYS Ohh!    Jesus! \nINT.   MOM'S HOUSE - DAY \nMom is hosting a pre-Thanksgiving get-together with 10-15 people all drinking wine and talking \nMOM (to Mason and Samantha) Hey, you guys made it! Good. \nMom places a cheese plate on the living room table. \nMOM (CONT'D) Oh, there you are. \nPROFESSOR DOUGLAS hands Olivia a glass of wine. \nPROFESSOR DOUGLAS And here you go, hostess. \nMOM Oh, thank you. Hey, can I get you a bite? \nINT.   MASON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMason sits on his bed, chatting with a COLLEGE GIRL, who looks around his room. There is a large graffiti mural on the wall behind him. \nCOLLEGE GIRL (points to the mural) Oh, that's cool. \nMASON Thanks. \nCOLLEGE GIRL You did that? \nMASON Yeah. \nCOLLEGE GIRL Wow. How long have you been doing that for? \nMASON Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer. \nCOLLEGE GIRL They have a camp for graffiti? \nMASON Well, they call it \"urban art\". \nCOLLEGE GIRL Oh. \nMASON So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but... it was really just a way to get free spray paint. \nCOLLEGE GIRL Cool. So is this your tag?     Is that -- do they still call it...? \nMASON Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing. \nCOLLEGE GIRL Oh.   K... \nMASON E. \nCOLLEGE GIRL E.    Z.   J.   O. Kezjo. That's cool. \nMASON It doesn't really mean anything, though. \nGRANDPA CLIFF Good.   Good to see you. \nDAD Ah, it's great to see you. \nGRANDPA CLIFF You made it alright, huh? \nDAD Yeah, we sure did.    We sure did. \nGRANDPA CLIFF (to Annie) How are you, darling? \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nAnnie and Nana quietly light the candles on Mason's birthday cake. \nDAD Alright, we ready? \nANNIE Yeah, yeah, get started -- \nNANA Wait, wait, wait... \nINT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY \nDAD Hey, Sam. \nHe subtly indicates for her to get off her laptop and join the family. They take their seats in the living room. \nDAD (CONT'D) Hey, still sleeping here? \nGRANDPA CLIFF Oh, yeah, sawin' logs. \nDAD You ready? \nThe family sings happy birthday to Mason. Nana brings in the birthday cake, complete with lit candles. \nALL (singing) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Mason... Happy birthday to you! \nDAD Make a wish, make a wish. \nMason blows out the candles. The family cheers. \nNANA Real good! Presents!      Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie. \nNana hands Mason a wrapped gift. \nDAD Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright. \nSam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife. \nNANA I hope you like it. I heard you didn't have one, so. \nHe unwraps the gift. \nNANA (CONT'D) It's a Bible. Is this your first Bible? Look, there's your name... \nMASON Wow. \nNANA ...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait. Look at this. It's a Red Letter edition, and that means that everything Jesus said is in red. \nMASON Thank you. \nNANA Like it?     Alright. I love you, sweetie.     Happy Birthday. \nANNIE And this one's from us. \nAnnie hands Mason a large gift box. \nDAD It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's... \nDad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the box. \nDAD (CONT'D) It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this. \nNANA Wow! \nDAD You've got life ahead of you.   You know -- \nANNIE And the shirt is blue, and I know you like blue. \nDAD You've got dances -- \nNANA It's beautiful! \nDAD -- And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here. \nGrandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun. \nGRANDPA CLIFF Mason? \nDAD (whispers) The Black Album was from me. \nNANA Uh-oh. \nGRANDPA CLIFF Come here, son. Pull that off. \nMason walks over and pulls the case off to reveal a shotgun. \nGRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) There's a 20 gauge shotgun. \nMASON Wow. \nGRANDPA CLIFF Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and well, you're fifteen and I'd like for you to have it. Alright? Here, you hold it. Yeah. \nMASON (taking the gun) Thank you. \nGRANDPA CLIFF Congratulations, son. I'll teach you how to clean it, teach you how to fire it. I'll teach you a little bit of safety. \nThe family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing precariously across the room. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nSamantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets. \nDAD Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here -- \nSAMANTHA Mm-hm. \nDAD Now which one you aiming at? \nSAMANTHA Ah, the middle can. \nDAD The middle can? Alright, alright. Now fire at will, alright? \nSAMANTHA Okay. \nSamantha shoots the can. \nDAD Ho.   Whoa! \nDad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol. \nSAMANTHA Yeah! \nGRANDPA CLIFF Howdy! \nSAMANTHA You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad? \nDAD And what's that supposed to mean, hm? \nANNIE I can hear you! \nDAD Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh. I don't think your mom would love that. \nDad picks up a rock. \nDAD (CONT'D) Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you how it's done. \nDad skips the rock across the pond.   Mason photographs it. \nSAMANTHA Nice, Dad. \nShe laughs. \nDAD Still got the goods, hmm? \nINT. DARKROOM - DAY \nMason is developing a picture in the darkroom.   His teacher, MR. TURLINGTON, wanders in. \nTURLINGTON How long you been in here, Mason? \nMASON I'm not sure. \nTURLINGTON I'm sure. All class. Did you complete your image diary? \nMASON Not yet. \nTURLINGTON Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet? \nMASON Not quite, but... I mean, it's not gonna take me long. \nTURLINGTON Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal. \nMASON Sorry. \nTURLINGTON I'm worried about you, Mason. \nMASON Why is that? \nTURLINGTON I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent. \nMASON Thanks. \nTURLINGTON Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic? \nMason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure. \nTURLINGTON (CONT'D) I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna happen for you, Mason. The world is too competitive. There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard. And a butt-load of morons who are untalented, who are more than willing to surpass you. As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now. Hm? You know what they're doing? They're doing their assignments, which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not. You're in here. Why is that? Are you special, Mason? \nMASON No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times. \nTURLINGTON You like football, Mason? \nMASON Not really. \nTURLINGTON Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this? \nMASON I guess. \nTURLINGTON Who do you want to be, Mason?    What do you want to do? \nMASON I want to take pictures.    Make art. \nTURLINGTON Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can? \nMASON That's what I'm trying to find out. \nTURLINGTON Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, \"Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day.\" (walking away) Get back to class and do your work. \nINT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMason walks back to his computer.    NICK sits at the neighboring computer. \nNICK Hey man.   You're walkin' a little funny. \nMASON Fuck you. \nNICK I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time. Just hope he bought you dinner first. \nMason playfully jabs Nick in the arm. \nINT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY \nJim sits at the kitchen table, opening a beer. Mom and Samantha prepare dinner in the kitchen. Mom walks over to the stairs to call up to Mason. \nMOM Mason!   Honey, come down for dinner. \nOn her way back to the kitchen, Mom notices the screen on an open laptop. \nMOM (CONT'D) Samantha! You didn't post these pictures and their descriptions? Come on, this auction is going to end on Sunday, honey. You've got to get those posted. \nSAMANTHA Why are we even doing this? It's like an online junk shop. I thought you had a good job? \nMOM I do. We're what you call house poor. Everyone's got to do their part. Your brother took the pictures. You have to help. \nSAMANTHA Who even buys this shit? \nJIM Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright? Don't disrespect your mother. You like a roof over your head, don't you? \nMOM Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone? \nSAMANTHA I'm not even gonna be here next year. I'm a senior. I should be having fun. \nMason enters. He sits down at the table.   He has blue nail polish on his fingernails. \nJIM Nice nails. \nMASON Yeah, some girl did that in sixth period. \nJIM You planning on keeping them? \nMASON Until it comes off, I guess. \nJIM Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails. You got a, uh, you got a purse to go with all that? \nSAMANTHA A lot of guys do that.   He's just trying to be cool. \nJIM When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool. \nMOM Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water. \nMason gets up to help set the table. \nEXT. FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT \nAn announcer comments on the game over the loud speaker. The crowd cheers and the band plays. Mason is on the sidelines, photographing details he finds interesting. He scrolls through the images on his camera. \nNICK Hey man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game. So take your lens and point it that way. \nMOM This house is too big for us. I mean, you're going to school eventually... It's too expensive. I'm done. \nMASON Well why did you even buy it in the first place, then? \nMOM Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the (MORE) \nMOM (CONT'D) brink of poverty. I mean, I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff. \nMASON Really?   Like what? \nMOM Like - Well, I got rid of a couple husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage, some maintenance, the tchotchkes, the, the homeowner's insurance, the property tax, the plumbing... Ahhh. You know what? From now on I am gonna be Mommy Monk. Simple. Celibate. \nMASON Don't be gross, Mom. \nMOM Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house. (Laughs) Is that better? \nMASON Okay. \nMason starts to walk away. \nMOM Mason -- Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash. \nMASON I do dishes all day. \nMOM Well, great honey, then you're a professional. Come on, you could do one or two more for you poor old mom. \nMason walks over to the sink. \nMASON Okay. \nMOM Thank you. \nEXT. MOM'S HOUSE \nMason gets in truck, drives away. \nINT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN \nMusic plays in the background. Mason is in uniform, he carries in a bus tub of dirty dishes, one with uneaten battered shrimp on it. He sticks one in his mouth and flirts with APRIL, a waitress. \nMASON You want one? \nAPRIL Ugh. God -- \nMASON (Laughing) She didn't even touch them, seriously. I watched her the whole time. \nApril takes one. \nAPRIL Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you little pervert. (Laughing) It's like we're on a date. Cheers. \nThey clink battered shrimp. \nMASON It's a night of romance. \nAPRIL Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you. \nShe heads back out to the restaurant floor. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) I will blow you, though. \nMason brings the dishes over to the industrial washers.   His boss, MR. WOOD, storms in. \nMR. WOOD Mason!   We are in the weeds out here! \nMASON I'm goin' as fast as I can. \nMR. WOOD Oh! (MORE) \nMR. WOOD (CONT'D) Then I must be confused then, cause I just saw you chattin it up with April when I gotta salad bar that needs a refill, I gotta six top, two four tops I can't use, because they haven't been bused. \nMASON Enrique is not here.   I'm tryin'. \nMR. WOOD Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'! What am I supposed to tell my customers? \"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'. Least that's what he told me, after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp.\" Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share somethin' with you, I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, now that's a lot more responsibility. It's also more money. How's that sound? \nMASON Good. \nMR. WOOD I know you can handle that money... but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down! \nMason exits. \nINT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY \nMason sits on the stairs video chatting with Dad on his phone. \nDAD Well, so it's -- it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore? \nMASON (Holding Phone) No , it's fine. It's up for the trip. \nDAD (Laughing) Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin? \nMASON Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool, and I guess her roommate's out of town so it's no big deal. \nDAD Alright, well, did you apply there yet? Did you get that application in to UT? \nMASON Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much in, though. \nDAD Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing. You know? I mean seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants. \nMASON Yeah. \nDAD A bit of decisiveness goes a long way in this life, alright? \nMASON Yeah. \nDAD Great. And uh, what about work? How's that goin'? \nMASON Uh, I don't know. It's, it's alright. Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world. People are slobs. \nDAD (Laughing) Well, when people ask me about you I say, \"Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up.\" \nMason laughs. \nDAD (CONT'D) (From Phone) Alright, hey, hey, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you? \nDad pans the phone to Annie and baby. \nANNIE Say hi to your big brother.     Hey, big brother. \nMASON Hey, Annie.    Hey, kiddo. \nANNIE Can you say bye-bye? \nBABY Bye-buh! \nANNIE (Laughs) We'll see you soon. \nDAD (From phone) Alright, alright, well, be careful when you're driving, alright? Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. Alright? Just, you're Obi Wan. You're centered, patient, right? You watch three cars ahead, two behind. It takes two bad drivers to have an accident okay? \nMASON Okay. \nDAD (From phone) Right, and listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something. \nMom comes down the stairs and drops a bag at Mason's feet. \nThe girls laugh. \nSAMANTHA (CONT'D) His minor, yeah. \nSHEENA Does he wanna... does he wanna teach? \nSAMANTHA I don't know, I think, I think he's still figuring stuff out. Yeah, he'll figure it out, he's smart, he's smart. So where are you thinking about living when you come here? \nSHEENA Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm. \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nSHEENA Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much. \nSAMANTHA Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn eighteen. I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially. \nThey laugh. \nSHEENA That's what I figured. \nSAMANTHA But I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad. \nSHEENA Yeah. \nSAMANTHA I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun. \nThey laugh. \nSHEENA I'm excited. \nSAMANTHA It's great, yeah. \nEXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT \nThe sidewalk is populated with college students. The teens walk together in couples and pass a street musician and a woman hoola-hooping. \nBOYFRIEND Watch out. \nSAMANTHA Oh! \nThey laugh. \nINT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT \nA four man band plays as our guys watch from the audience. \nMUSICIANS (singing) \"On the day that I was born I started growin' old. No one told you life would be so lonesome and cold. I had a grey hair by the age of 23, this hard-luck livin's gonna be the end of me. The old black crow leaving tracks all across my face, and everywhere I go I seem to be in the same damn place. Hard livin's gonna be the end of me.\" \nEXT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT \nSheena and Mason wander out of the club and walk up the street. \nINT. CAFE - NIGHT \nSheena and Mason are seated at a table at a late-night diner, full of a variety of people. \nMAN ALONE IN BOOTH The last death at the Hoover Dam construction site was his son, Patrick Tierny, who died on December 20th, 1935, exactly thirteen years to the day. \nSheena notices a table of sorority girls and practically whispers to Mason. \nSHEENA See those sorority girls over there? I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging. \nMASON Yeah, in just a few years that's you (Indicates Girls) And that's gonna be me. \nHe subtly indicates the Man Alone guy, still sitting at his booth, giving a lecture of some kind, with data, etc. \nMAN ALONE IN BOOTH ...Also inlaid into the terrazzo floors was a star map, a celestial map of heavenly bodies so accurately displayed that one could chart the procession of the Pole Star fourteen thousand years into the future, such that future generations upon... (Continuing Indistinct Under) \nSHEENA (O.S.) I wonder what his deal is. I mean, he obviously has money to eat here. \nMASON (O.S.) He just said. He's a UT professor, tenure and everything. \nSHEENA Look at all these people. What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning? \nMASON What are WE even doing here at 3:00 in the morning? \nSHEENA We know what we're doing here. \nShe dips a chip into a bowl of queso. \nSHEENA (CONT'D) Queso.   We have a purpose. \nMASON Hell yeah. \nSHEENA HELL yeah. \nMASON You know, by, like, next summer this'll just be our lives. \nSHEENA Mm-hm. \nMASON Stayin' out all night and goin' to shows... whatever we want. \nSHEENA We ever gonna go to class? \nMASON Sometimes. \nSHEENA When it feels right.     When the inspiration hits. \nMASON Only then. \nA WAITRESS comes by their table. \nWAITRESS Anything else? \nSHEENA Uhhh... more queso? \nMASON (nodding) Yeah. \nWAITRESS Mm-hm. \nShe leaves, and Mason just takes it all in. \nMASON Ah, Jesus. \nSHEENA What? \nMASON I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative experience. \nSHEENA I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step. \nMASON But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills... \nSHEENA Well, I like your mom. \nMASON Well, I like my mom, too. I just mean, basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am. \nWaitress drops off more queso. \nSHEENA (to Waitress) Thank you. \nMASON Thanks. \nMason and Sheena dip chips into the bowl of queso. \nMASON (Bitter Laugh) Of course you don't. \nSHEENA You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity. \nMASON (O.S.) It's great that you can think that way. And you know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind. \nSHEENA He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship. \nMASON Great.   I feel so much better now. \nSHEENA We're just having fun. \nMASON I bet he's having fun. \nSHEENA Grow up, Mason. \nMASON It's not like I haven't been with anyone else. \nSHEENA Who? \nMASON What do you care? \nSHEENA Who? \nMASON Does it matter? \nSHEENA You're the one who brought it up. \nA pause. \nSHEENA (CONT'D) This is pointless. \nShe gets up and starts to walk away. \nSHEENA (CONT'D) Now you're just trying to be an asshole. \nEXT./INT. NICK'S CAR \nNick drives Mason home from graduation. \nNICK Holy Crap, I would rather have my balls clawed off than ever sit through anything like that ever again! \nMASON Well, we never, ever have to. \nNICK Oh my god, thank you. \nMASON Gimme that. \nNick hands him a flask. \nNICK Dude, it's all you. Drink up. So you coming out with me tonight, brother? Should be some pretty awesome stuff happening. \nMASON Naw, dude, I'm goin' to this like, show with my dad in Austin. His friend's playing. \nNICK Gosh, have fun with that, I guess. \nNick pulls into Mason's driveway and parks. \nMASON Fuck, there's so many cars here.    I don't wanna go in there. \nNICK (sarcastic) Dude, you will have so much fun. Your family loves you. You'll have a swell time. \nMASON Fuck you.   You're coming in with me. \nNICK Oh, no.   Shit no.   No. \nMASON Yes!   Yes, you are. My mom loves you.   You have to say hi. \nNICK Just -- \nMASON Do you want to hurt her feelings? \nNICK Mm-mm. (Shakes head slightly) \nMASON Well then, let's go get 'em. \nNICK Just for a second.    Just a second, seriously. \nNick \"tests\" his breath in his hand. They get out of the car. \nINT. MOM'S HOUSE - GRADUATION PARTY - DAY \nFamily and friends chit chat throughout the house. Mom prepares snacks, while Dad and Annie talk with UNCLE STEVE. \nUNCLE STEVE You know you're in sort of in enemy territory here. \nDAD (laughing) We're aware. \nINT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS \nCake graphic: \"Congratulations Mason!\" \nOlivia and Carol prep food.   Nick and Mason come in the front door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS \nDAD Uh, look who's here! \nALL (cheer, applause) ...Whooo! \nMOM Hey! \nShe hugs Mason. \nUNCLE STEVE Get a job! \nMason takes off his graduation cap. \nMOM No-no-no-no, wait. We're gonna take pictures. Put it back on. (To Carol) Hey, can you get a camera? (To Nick) Hey Nick! \nGrandma comes over and hugs Mason. \nGRANDMA Oh! Back on. Oh... Congratulations, baby. (to Nick) I don't know you, but congratulations! \nShe hugs him too. \nGRANDMA (CONT'D) Oh, pictures, pictures, Carol. \nMOM (O.S.) Quick, put your hat on. \nCAROL Alright, look here... \nThey pose and Carol takes the picture with a phone. \nMOM Smile. \nCAROL Here we go. Oh, that's a good one. And... good! Got it. \nGRANDMA (O.S.) Oh, we need -- Sam, where are you? Samantha! \nMOM Sam! \nGRANDMA And where's Mason senior?   I'm feeling generous. (to Dad) Come here. \nMOM Thanks. \nERNESTO You guys should listen to her.   She's a smart lady. \nMOM Thank you. \nErnesto walks back toward the kitchen, leaving the three seated at the table. \nEXT. APARTMENT - MORNING \nMason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's new apartment. \nINT. APARTMENT - MORNING \nMason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is seated in another room. \nMASON ...Isn't that kind of crazy though, that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world. \nMom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug. \nMASON (CONT'D) I mean there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are. \nMOM Have you even talked to this guy yet? \nMASON No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes... so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer. \nMOM Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then. \nMASON Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked. \nMason walks back into the living room, carrying a box.   He holds up a framed picture. \nMASON (CONT'D) Did you -- Did you put this in here again? \nMom laughs. \nMASON (CONT'D) I don't want it. \nMOM Come on, it's the first picture you ever took. \nMASON Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right? \nMason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom suddenly breaks into quiet sobs. \nHe comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying. \nMASON (CONT'D) What? \nMOM (crying) Nothing. \nMASON No, what is it? \nMOM Nothing! \nMASON Mom... \nMOM This is the worst day of my life. \nMASON What are you talking about? \nMOM I knew this day was coming. I just -- I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving. \nMASON I mean, it's not that I'm that happy. What do you, what do you expect? \nMOM You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones. Getting married, having kids, getting divorced, the time that we thought you were dyslexic, when I taught you how to ride a bike, getting divorced AGAIN, getting my masters degree, finally getting the job I wanted, sending Samantha off to college, sending YOU off the college... You know what's next? Huh? It's my fuckin' funeral! \nA beat. \nMOM (CONT'D) Just go, and leave my picture! \nStunned, Mason doesn't know what to say. \nMASON Aren't you jumping ahead by like, forty years or something? \nMOM I just thought there would be more. \nMom sits at the table crying.   Mason does not know how to comfort her. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nMason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and mountains of West Texas. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nMason stops at a gas station to fill up.   While he waits, he takes pictures. \nEXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY \nMason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks. \nINT. DORM - AFTERNOON \nMason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room. He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack and get situated. DALTON enters. \nDALTON Hey, you must be Mason. \nMASON Yeah.   Dalton, right? \nDALTON Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you. \nMASON Definitely. \nDALTON Are you cool with this side of the room? \nMASON Yeah. \nDALTON Got in this morning, just moved my shit in, man. \nMASON (laughs) Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care. No worries. \nHe unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going. \nDALTON Cool. Can I help with anything, man? Any bags? Any last stuff you need brought in? \nMASON I just got like one... box left, I packed pretty light. But I appreciate it. \nDALTON My pleasure, man. Of course. \nMASON Um, are you goin' to the orientation mixer thing? \nDALTON Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no, man! I'm not goin' to that and neither are you, by the way. We got way better stuff to be doin', dude. \nBARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room. \nBARB You ready? \nDALTON Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate Mason. Mason, Barb. \nThey shake. \nMASON Hi. \nBARB Hey.   You comin' with us? \n", "test1_input": "MASON ...And this is dried Canadian grass... \nDAD Uh-huh.   What position do you play? \nSAMANTHA Um, guard. \nMASON This is dried Canadian grass... And, and uh... \nDAD Uh-huh.   Wait, you scoring any points? \nSAMANTHA Well, about eight or ten a game. \nDAD Eight or ten a game?     That is awesome! \nSAMANTHA Yeah! \nMASON Once she didn't score any and she cried! \nDAD You cried? \nSAMANTHA Well, only a little bit. \nDAD Awww. \nDad kisses Samantha's forehead. \nINT.   FRONT ENTRY - MOMENTS LATER \nMOM Hello! \nSAMANTHA Oh, Mason, Mom's home! \nMASON Mom's home! \nDad quickly shifts from playful to nervous. \nDAD Hey, Mom's home. \nSAMANTHA Mom, hi! \nMOM Hey. \nSAMANTHA Oh, look at this owl Daddy gave me! Isn't it cool? See, its head spins! And look at this bracelet! It was made by Indians in Alaska. \nMASON And Mom, Daddy made this cool hand carved grizzly bear and this tiki. \nMOM It's a totem. Wow. \nSAMANTHA And guess what else? We went bowling and I made four strikes! \nMASON Yeah, and we got to ride around in Dad's car! \nMOM   (O.S.) Wow. \nDAD Hey, Liv. \nMOM Hey. \nDAD I know you wanted me to drop them off at your mom's. I just thought it'd be easier if I brought 'em over here. \nMOM Well, it really screwed up my plans. \nMASON Well, we just wanted to show him our rooms. \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nMOM Did you guys eat anything? \nSAMANTHA Well, we had some french fries at the bowling alley. \nMOM Did you do your homework or... \nMASON No. \nSAMANTHA Not yet. \nMOM Okay. Can I talk to you outside for a second? \nDAD Yeah. Sure. (as he exits) They had more than french fries. \nThe children scramble to find a suitable spot for eavesdropping but their parents are inaudible. \nINT.   UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nSamantha and Mason look out the window, down at their parents having an argument below. \nMASON Do you think he's gonna spend the night? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Doesn't look like it. \nMom walks away from Dad. He stands there for a beat, then saunters off. The kids are visibly disappointed. \nEXT.   COLLEGE - DAY \nMason and Mom walk across the campus lawn. \nINT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY \nA professor, BILL, lectures to the class.     Mason and Mom are seated in the classroom audience. \nBILL (V.O.) Okay. An unconditioned stimulus, something that produces an unlearned, involuntary, unconditioned response. (MORE) \nBILL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus, that he used? Come on now, people! Tough weekend? What's the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat. Meat powder, actually. Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog. Okay. He put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was? Salivation. Alright. Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus-response pair that happens to you everyday. It's probably happening to some of you right now. (pause) How about sex? Sure, you know. You see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response. You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about... Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog. \nClass laughs. \nBILL (CONT'D) Thank you very much. Class dismissed. \nStudents leave, as Mason and Mom approach the professor. \nMOM (O.S.) Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason. \nBILL Ohh. \nMOM Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock. \nBILL Your son. Now see, I thought this was a boy genius who was taking my college course. \nMason laughs.    He and Bill shake hands. \nMOM He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me. \nBill touches Mason's forehead. \nBILL Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I can tell because I have a nine year old son, he pulls this all the time. Same kind of deal. Hey, you play soccer? \nMASON Mm, no. \nBILL Neither does my boy. He hates soccer. He likes computers. My 11-year-old daughter, loves soccer. Who can figure? Hey, maybe we can get all you guys together sometime, huh? \nMOM Maybe, yeah.     Well, you ready to go? \nMASON Yeah. \n", "test1_true": "MASON Nice to meet you, too. \nBILL And thanks for coming to my class. \nMason walks ahead of them as Olivia and Bill speak a little more intimately. It's clear that they have more than just a professor-student relationship. Mason notices a bit of this and looks on, confused. \nBILL (CONT'D) Olivia. \nMOM Hm? \nBILL Nice kid. \nMOM Thanks. \nBILL So you think, uh, Grandma might be available for a little baby-sitting? \nMOM        (O.S.) (giggles) Maybe. \nBILL Really?   Well, great. \nEXT.   BACKYARD - DAY \nMason and Samantha play an outdoor trampoline game with Randy and Mindy, their new stepbrother and stepsister. They are in the big backyard of their new home, where Dr. Welbrock and his children have lived. \nGRANDMA Hey kids, they're here! \nKIDS Oh, they're home, they're home! \nGRANDMA Hurry!    Hurry! \nThey all scramble inside and quickly assemble for a big welcome home ceremony in the front entryway. A sign reads, \"Welcome Home Honeymooners, We Love You Mom & Dad\". Olivia and Bill open the door to enter the house. \nMOM Hey! \nKIDS Mom!   Daddy! \nBILL Oh!    We're here!     Hey, we've returned! \nHugs all around. The family talks over one another.      Bill notices the \"Welcome Home\" sign the kids made. \nSAMANTHA AND MASON Hi Dad! \nBILL Samantha, Mason, look -- Thank you. That's very nice. \nMOM (to Randy and Mindy) Hey guys! \nThe group all speaks at once. \nBILL (To Grandma) Hi, Mom. How are you? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Look at the sign we made! \nBILL (To Grandma) They give you any trouble? \nMINDY Samantha and I made it all ourselves. \nBILL (O.S.) I know the boys helped you with that a lot. \nMINDY No, not at all! \nThe group continues to speak at once. \nBILL That's good... Oh, pass out the goodies. \nMom passes out a bag of presents to each of the kids. \nMOM This is for the girls, this is for the girls... \nBILL (to Grandma) Don't worry, we got you some absinthe or something. \nGRANDMA Oh, let's pour it. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe family sits around the table, swapping fun stories and pictures from their time apart. \nMOM You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off. \nRANDY (O.S.) And what happened? \nMOM    (O.S.) It flew! \nBILL (O.S.) It flew away. It went for miles. Went onto the Arctic Trail. \nThey laugh. \nSAMANTHA Oh, did you guys kiss under the Bridge of Sighs? \nMOM Yes. \nBILL Yes, we did. \nBill leans in to kiss Olivia. \nMINDY Hey, Mom, can we see your wedding ring? \nMOM    (O.S.) Oh, sure. \nMom hands over her wedding ring. The boys look at a 20 Questions game. \nMINDY (O.S.) (Eyeing the ring) Wow. \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) (Holding the ring) Technically that's a fancy step cut surrounded by miniature brilliant. \nMASON I wish we could've gone to Europe. \nRANDY Yeah. \nBILL Yeah, we'll go as a family next time. But you didn't miss much, really. We just stayed in the hotel room the whole time playing video games. \nMom laughs. \nMASON Really? \nBILL And the hotels are really small and really old. Squeaky. \nThe WAITER comes over. \nWAITER Can I get you anything else? Would you like to see a dessert menu? \nBILL (To Randy) Listen, I told you to put that away. (To Mom) Would you put that in your purse, please? Computer games at the table. (To Waiter) Yes, uh, please, another bottle of wine. \nMASON (to Waiter) Um, Coke. \nMOM Um, you know what? Mason, you're okay with water. No more Cokes. (to Waiter) Thank you. \nBILL (O.S.) (To Randy) Now how 'bout you? Did you finish your science project? \nRANDY Not quite yet. \nBILL Well, did you work on it? I mean, did you build anything, or plan anything, or..? \nRANDY A little. \n", "test1_id": 2184, "test2_input": "MOM Yeah, a little.     Have you? \nMASON A little bit. \nMOM Have you been...? \nMom mimes smoking reefer. \nMASON A little bit. \nMOM Oh... okay. \nMASON I'm gonna go to sleep. \nMOM Talk in the morning, huh? \nEXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - DAY \nDad and Jim stand around in front of the house. ANNIE opens the doors to the new mini-van, so the kids can load their overnight bags. \nSAMANTHA Hey, Dad! \nDAD Hey!   How you doing? \nDad kisses Samantha on the cheek. \nSAMANTHA Good!    Whose car is that? \nDAD That's our car.    Hop on in there. \nSAMANTHA (to Annie) Hey! \nANNIE Hey, sweetie. \nAnnie give Samantha a hug. Samantha peeks in the side door of the mini-van, finding baby COOPER in a car seat. \nSAMANTHA Hey Cooper! Hey, how's it goin'? Hello little brother! (to Annie) He's so cute. \nEXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS \nMom talks with two workers about an exposed pipe in the yard. \nMOM Can we just replace that part of the pipe? \nWORKER No, no it's no good.      Everything is no good. \nMOM (attempting Spanish) Todo... Total? \nWORKER Everything, yes... Mira. \nHe shows the broken pipe with his shovel. He asks the other worker to demonstrate the strength of the replacement pipe by standing on it. \nWORKER (CONT'D) See this one is... \nMOM Gusto... it's stronger? \nWORKER Yes.    It's better.   Yes, yes, yes. \nEXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS \nDAD (to Jim) Hey listen, uh, thanks for that camera you got Mason. \nJIM Oh,   yeah... Mason's -- \nDAD He's loving that thing. \nJIM He's all into the photography thing right now. \nDAD Yeah, I know. \nJIM He's actually talking about turning his, uh, his closet into a dark room. The red light and developing, the whole nine... \nDAD Yeah?   You alright with that? \nJIM I probably won't see him for a week... \nDAD Yeah... Right... Well... \nJIM But, you know. He's having a good time. \nDAD At least he's focusing on something. \nJIM Yeah, yeah. \nDAD You know?     That's what I like. \nJIM Yeah, he's all about it. \nEXT.   JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS \nMOM (pointing to the pipe) Okay... Let's go grande. \nWORKER It's good? \nMOM It's good. \nWORKER It's good.    It's better.   Yes. \nHe instructs the other worker on how to get started. Mom turns to join the others in front yard. \nMOM Hey, you know, you're smart.    You should be in school. \nWORKER I like school, I need school, but it's hard. I work all day... \nMOM Go to night school. At community college. It's -- It's pretty affordable. \nEXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS \nDAD You're doing a nice job with the house though, it's looking great... really great. \nJIM Thanks. Yeah, you know, some fix- its here and there, you know. We got a good deal on the foreclosure... So, now I'm finding out why. You know? \nDAD (laughs) Yeah. Right? \nMason walks outside, carrying a duffel bag. \nDAD (CONT'D) Hey bud!     Hey, Happy Birthday! \nThe mini-van catches Mason's attention. \nMASON What's that? \nDAD What's that?     That's our new car! Get in it. \nDad gives Mason a hug.    Jim shakes Mason's hand. \nJIM Alright, have a good weekend. \nMom arrives at the front yard and greets Dad with a hug. \nMOM Hi. \nDAD Hey, how you doing?      Good to see you. \n", "test2_true": "ANNIE Hey, how are you? \nMom gives Annie a hug. \nMOM You look great. \nANNIE Oh, thanks. \nMOM Aww, look at him!      Ooh.   He's got Mason's nose. \nSAMANTHA Yeah, isn't he cute? \nMOM Yeah. \nDad gets into the van, as the family closes all the doors. \nDAD Alright! \nMASON Love you guys. \nDAD We got a big drive ahead of us. \nMOM Bye, Sam. \nJIM You guys drive safe. \nDAD Alright.     Well, we'll be back tomorrow night. \nMOM Bye, honey.     I'm so glad you were born! \nDad, Annie, and the kids drive off for Houston. Mom and Jim are left standing in the front yard, as they watch the van drive away. \nINT.   MINI-VAN - DAY \nMASON So, this is like Annie's car and... and you drive the GTO? I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing. \nDAD Yeah, no...     But I had to sell that anyway. \nMASON You what? \nDAD Yeah, I had to sell that. \nMASON So... so it's gone? \nDAD Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there. (MORE) \nDAD (CONT'D) But... if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, you know, the value starts going up again. I mean shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra. \nAfter a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quiet. \nDAD (CONT'D) What? \nMASON You don't remember? \nDAD Remember what? \nMASON Really? You said that was going to be my car when I turned sixteen. \nDAD (laughs) What? No, I didn't.       I never said that. \nMASON I remember. I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday... and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block. And he was talking about how much he loved your car and so you were all like \"Oh. This is going to be Mason's when he turns 16.\" \nDAD What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never. \nMASON Yeah.   You did though. \nDAD What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the? (MORE) \nDAD (CONT'D) (laughs) Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean, you're not... Ughh. Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, alright, but bottom line is that was my car. Alright? I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it but when you get older you can save up and buy a car of your own. And be cool like I used to be. Or... you can get a mini-van. \nAnnie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Samantha's cell phone in the back seat. \nANNIE Does your mom actually let you watch this? \nSAMANTHA Yeah.     She likes it too. \nANNIE (laughing) Oh, my god... Okay, well. \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nANNIE Have you ever seen her in concert? \nSAMANTHA No. But she's coming to Houston in April. \nANNIE She's coming to Houston? \nSAMANTHA Mm-hmm. \nANNIE Oh you know, your dad and I could get you tickets, and you could stay with us. \nSAMANTHA That'd be great. \nANNIE Yeah. \nDAD Hey, hey, Annie? Will you get me the, the little birthday present for Mason? \nANNIE Yeah, babe. \nAnnie hands a small wrapped present to Dad.   Mason unwraps the gift to reveal a CD set. \nDAD Alright. This one, this one needs a little explanation, okay? Open it up. I call that \"The Beatles' Black Album\". Alright, what it is, is the best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo solo, post-break up. \nMASON Thanks. \nDAD Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you. \nAnnie Laughs. \nDAD (CONT'D) You know, whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know? But you put 'em next to each other, alright, and they start to elevate each other... and then you can hear it. Huh! It's The Beatles. You know? \nMASON I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best. \nDAD It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. Alright? (MORE) \nDAD (CONT'D) And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father. \nANNIE Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father. \nDAD Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks... You've got \"Band on the Run\" into \"My Sweet Lord\", into \"Jealous Guy\", into \"Photograph\". I mean, come on. It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it? It's a good record. I shit you not. \nMASON Cool. \nEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nThe mini-van drives along a dirt road lined with trees and parks outside of a small ranch home. GRANDPA CLIFF and NANA come outside to greet their guests. \nDAD Hey there, Cliff. \nGRANDPA CLIFF Hey, how you doin'? \nDAD Oh, good.   How you doin'? \nNANA (to Mason) Oh, hi, birthday boy!   It's good to see you. \n", "test2_id": 2185, "test3_input": "ANNIE Yes, that's right. \nGRANDMA And with your little one.    Where is he? \nANNIE Oh, he's at home. \nDAD Yeah, yeah. Remember, he was such a pain at Sam's thing that, you know... \nGRANDMA Oh, I would love to see him. \nANNIE Well, we have a special weekend this weekend, so... \nGRANDMA I'm so glad you found her. I really am. (to Annie) You, you've got him at a good time, I think. \nANNIE I think so, too. \nGRANDMA Yeah.   It's good to see you two. \nDAD Nice to see you, too, Catherine. \nGRANDMA I'm so proud of your boy. \nDAD Yeah, yeah we all are. \nGrandma walks off.    Dad whispers to Annie. \nDAD (CONT'D) If you think she's a bitch now, you should have seen her fucking twenty years ago. \nThey laugh. \nINT. DEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS \nLater, Uncle Steve, Dad, and Mason have a manly discussion. \nUNCLE STEVE You got to remember, you're going to college, though, alright? And if you're anything like me or your old man, you're gonna be pulling down some serious wool. You're gonna be tapping some masterful gap. \nDAD Steven... \nUNCLE STEVE You're gonna be doing some good work out there. Think about it, awful lot of flowers in that bouquet. But, you gotta do me a favor. You're going to be vulnerable this summer, alright. Remember to use protection during breakup sex. \nHe puts his hand on Dad. \nUNCLE STEVE (CONT'D) This guy knows exactly of which I speak. Look what happened to him. Viola'. \nUncle Steve gestures to Mason. \nDAD Steven... \nUNCLE STEVE (laughing) Cheers. \nDAD It's not that simple. \nUNCLE STEVE (chanting) Four more years. Four more years. I'm just saying. \nINT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS \nLater Dad enters the kitchen where Mom happens to be. \nDAD Do y'all recycle?   Should I -- \nMOM I have one started there. \nDAD Oh, yeah, right. Okay, great. Okay. Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this party? \nMOM Yes, but I'm not your only wife here, though. \nDAD Yeah. \nMOM Can you believe they're both out of high school? \nDAD No.  No, I can't. (a beat) You did a great job with both of them, by the way. \nMOM Thanks for saying that. I never thought I'd hear you say that. \nDAD Well, it's true.    Thank you. \nMOM And you're doing it all over again, huh? \nDAD I know, I know, right? It's gonna be uh, fifteen years till I have an empty nest. But hey, I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could. (MORE) \nDAD (CONT'D) I mean, it's so great that you did this. I was just going to give you a little. I'd appreciate it if I could. \nHe pulls out his wallet. \nMOM Sure.   Yeah. \nDAD Yeah. But I don't have any cash. It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right back. \nINT. ANTONE'S - EVENING \nMason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while the band is doing a sound check. \nDAD ...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a college lacrosse player. I mean, what are you gonna do? \nMASON She didn't even like sports. \nAn iced-down bucket of drinks beckons. \nDAD You want a beer? \nMASON No, that's alright. \nDAD You can have one. \nMASON It's okay. \nThey continue their conversation out of the green room to a little area overlooking the stage. \nDAD Yeah, well, for what it's worth, we've all been through the exact same thing, at one point or another. \nMASON It's not the same, though.     I mean, you never got to know her. \nDAD No, I know, I know.    It's not the same. \nMASON I just don't know what I did wrong. \nAt this point Dad yells down to Jimmy, his roommate from years before, briefly interrupting the sound check. \nDAD Hey, Jimmy.    Hey, man.   Hey -- \nJIMMY Hey, Mason. \nDAD We're up here raiding the green room. Hope that's okay. \nJIMMY That's totally cool. \nDAD Alright. \nJIMMY Wow!   Is that M.J.? \nDAD Uh-huh.    Right? \nJIMMY Unbelievable. \n", "test3_true": "JIMMY That's cool man, let me finish up, I'll be up in a minute. \nDAD Alright, alright. \nHe and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue. \nDAD (CONT'D) (back to Mason) I guarantee you, you didn't do anything wrong. These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here. (MORE) \nDAD (CONT'D) I mean, everyone's just changing so much. The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are... \nMASON Yeah, but still -- \nDAD Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time. \nMASON She wasn't a silly girl, though.   I mean, she's a serious person. I really thought we were -- \nDAD What? \nMASON I don't know. \nDAD Here's the truth. Women are never satisfied. Ok? They're always looking to potentially trade up and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you my fine feathered friend. \nMASON What does that even mean? \nDAD It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila. \nMASON Sheena. \nDAD Alright. It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me. You. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door. \nMASON Great. \nDAD Yeah, you know, you just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way. Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter when them front-running hussies start sniffing around. \nMASON So what you're saying is, I should take up lacrosse. \nDAD Exactly. Or you could, you know, start a band. Worked for me a long time ago. I think it's still working for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking pictures. \nMASON She hated the pictures I took of her. \nDAD Alright. I'm sick to death of her, okay? I only met her a few times and yes she was cute, alright. But, truth be told I always thought she was a little bit, you know, a little bit too square for you. Y'know, not quite the same vibe. \nMASON You really thought that? \nDAD On some subtle, lower level. I mean, uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned out she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay? I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things. Y'know. I mean, uh, take your mom and me. Y'know I think I probably turned into the boring castrated guy she wanted me to be fifteen or twenty years ago, y'know? And man I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed. I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know, she could have been a little more patient... a little more forgiving. \nMASON Would've saved me that parade of drunken assholes. \nDad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing. \nMASON (CONT'D) So what's the point? \nDAD Of what? \nMASON I don't know, any of this. Everything. \nDAD Everything? What's the point? I mean I sure as shit don't know. I mean, but, neither does anybody else. Okay, we're all just winging it, you know? I mean the good news is you're feeling stuff. You know? And you got to hold onto that. You do. I mean you get older and you don't feel as much. You're skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took. Thousands of submissions from all over the state and you won. \nMASON Well, I got silver.   And nine other people did, too. \nDAD I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, y'know? \nJimmy's at the mic. \nJIMMY (O.S.) Hey, this next one goes out to a young man in the house -- \nDAD Woo-oho! \nJIMMY Known him since he was just a small boy, now he's all graduated from high school, making me feel old. Happy high school graduation, Mason. \nHe plays his guitar, and the band kicks in... sounding pretty great. \nINT. CAFE - DAY \nMom, Mason and Samantha sit down at a table.     A waitress places menus. \nMOM Thank you. Okay guys, let's be clear. I'm going to break this into four categories. One. Anything you wanna keep from your childhood and your taking with you. Two. Throwing away. Three. Donating. Four. Whatever you wanna try to sell at the garage sell next weekend, whatever we don't sell, we're donating. \nMASON Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something? \nMOM No. You're missing the point. We're not going to drag a bunch of crap to mom's tiny apartment. \nSAMANTHA Can't believe we're moving again. \nMOM No, I'm moving! You moved two years ago. You have an apartment in Austin. Mason is moving the fall. I'm done. This will be great for me. I'll have all these options. I could take a sabbatical. I could get some writing done and try to get published. \nMASON What about Christmas, though?   What are we gonna do? \nSAMANTHA I'm not sharing a room with him. \nMOM One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress. \nSAMANTHA How am I supposed to do my laundry? \nMOM Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest. (MORE) \nMOM (CONT'D) And on your way down you may magically find some quarters that you use to do laundry in your own apartment. Come on! You guys are adults. You need to take some responsibility! And what do you want? \nMom puts her glasses on. \nMASON I'm gonna get the veggie burger. \nSAMANTHA I'm not having anything, not hungry. \nMom takes her glasses off. \nMOM What's wrong with you? \nSAMANTHA I'm sick. \nMOM What is it, your head?   Do you have a fever? \nMASON She's pregnant. \nSAMANTHA (weak laugh) No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night. \nMOM You weren't driving, were you? \nSAMANTHA No. No. Carrie's back home, too, and we just hung out. You know, peach Smirnoffs, they just go down so easy. \nMOM No, no. Hey - that's not an excuse. You can still pack boxes. These people want to move in as soon as possible. \nThe assistant restaurant manager, who'll we'll come to know as ERNESTO, approaches the table. \nERNESTO Hi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you? (to Mom) Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago. \nMOM Oh, yeah. \nERNESTO Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice! I signed up for English classes and then a year later I went to community college and I got my associates degree. And I'm working on my bachelors now at Texas State. And I'm also one of the managers here. \nMOM That's great. \nERNESTO Uh, it's good to see you. Because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that. Gracias. It really meant a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do. \n", "test3_id": 2186}

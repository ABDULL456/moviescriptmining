That is awesome! \nSAMANTHA Yeah! \nMASON Once she didn't score any and she cried! \nDAD You cried? \nSAMANTHA Well, only a little bit. \nDAD Awww. \nDad kisses Samantha's forehead. \nINT.   FRONT ENTRY - MOMENTS LATER \nMOM Hello! \nSAMANTHA Oh, Mason, Mom's home! \nMASON Mom's home! \nDad quickly shifts from playful to nervous. \nDAD Hey, Mom's home. \nSAMANTHA Mom, hi! \nMOM Hey. \nSAMANTHA Oh, look at this owl Daddy gave me! Isn't it cool? See, its head spins! And look at this bracelet! It was made by Indians in Alaska. \nMASON And Mom, Daddy made this cool hand carved grizzly bear and this tiki. \nMOM It's a totem. Wow. \nSAMANTHA And guess what else? We went bowling and I made four strikes! \nMASON Yeah, and we got to ride around in Dad's car! \nMOM   (O.S.) Wow. \nDAD Hey, Liv. \nMOM Hey. \nDAD I know you wanted me to drop them off at your mom's. I just thought it'd be easier if I brought 'em over here. \nMOM Well, it really screwed up my plans. \nMASON Well, we just wanted to show him our rooms. \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nMOM Did you guys eat anything? \nSAMANTHA Well, we had some french fries at the bowling alley. \nMOM Did you do your homework or... \nMASON No. \nSAMANTHA Not yet. \nMOM Okay. Can I talk to you outside for a second? \nDAD Yeah. Sure.

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nSamantha and Mason look out the window, down at their parents having an argument below. \nMASON Do you think he's gonna spend the night? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.)

COLLEGE - DAY \nMason and Mom walk across the campus lawn. \nINT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY \nA professor, BILL, lectures to the class.     Mason and Mom are seated in the classroom audience. \nBILL (V.O.) Okay. An unconditioned stimulus, something that produces an unlearned, involuntary, unconditioned response. (MORE) \nBILL (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus, that he used? Come on now, people! Tough weekend? What's the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat. Meat powder, actually. Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog. Okay. He put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was? Salivation. Alright. Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus-response pair that happens to you everyday. It's probably happening to some of you right now. (pause) How about sex? Sure, you know. You see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response. You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about... Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog. \nClass laughs. \nBILL (CONT'D) Thank you very much. Class dismissed. \nStudents leave, as Mason and Mom approach the professor. \nMOM (O.S.) Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason. \nBILL Ohh. \nMOM Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock. \nBILL Your son. Now see, I thought this was a boy genius who was taking my college course. \nMason laughs.    He and Bill shake hands. \nMOM He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me. \nBill touches Mason's forehead. \nBILL Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I can tell because I have a nine year old son, he pulls this all the time. Same kind of deal. Hey, you play soccer? \nMASON Mm, no. \nBILL Neither does my boy. He hates soccer. He likes computers. My 11-year-old daughter, loves soccer. Who can figure? Hey, maybe we can get all you guys together sometime, huh? \nMOM Maybe, yeah.     Well, you ready to go? \nMASON Yeah. \n", "test1_true": "MASON Nice to meet you, too. \nBILL And thanks for coming to my class. \nMason walks ahead of them as Olivia and Bill speak a little more intimately. It's clear that they have more than just a professor-student relationship. Mason notices a bit of this and looks on, confused. \nBILL (CONT'D) Olivia. \nMOM Hm? \nBILL Nice kid. \nMOM Thanks. \nBILL So you think, uh, Grandma might be available for a little baby-sitting? \nMOM        (O.S.) (giggles) Maybe. \nBILL Really?   Well, great. \nEXT.   BACKYARD - DAY \nMason and Samantha play an outdoor trampoline game with Randy and Mindy, their new stepbrother and stepsister.

Hurry! \nThey all scramble inside and quickly assemble for a big welcome home ceremony in the front entryway. A sign reads, \"Welcome Home Honeymooners, We Love You Mom & Dad\". Olivia and Bill open the door to enter the house. \nMOM Hey! \nKIDS Mom!   Daddy! \nBILL Oh!    We're here!     Hey, we've returned! \nHugs all around. The family talks over one another.

That's very nice. \nMOM (to Randy and Mindy) Hey guys! \nThe group all speaks at once. \nBILL (To Grandma) Hi, Mom. How are you? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Look at the sign we made! \nBILL (To Grandma) They give you any trouble? \nMINDY Samantha and I made it all ourselves. \nBILL (O.S.) I know the boys helped you with that a lot. \nMINDY No, not at all! \nThe group continues to speak at once. \nBILL That's good... Oh, pass out the goodies. \nMom passes out a bag of presents to each of the kids. \nMOM This is for the girls, this is for the girls... \nBILL (to Grandma) Don't worry, we got you some absinthe or something. \nGRANDMA Oh, let's pour it. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe family sits around the table, swapping fun stories and pictures from their time apart. \nMOM You take this big elevator up, and when we got to the top, we flew a paper airplane off. \nRANDY (O.S.) And what happened? \nMOM    (O.S.) It flew! \nBILL (O.S.) It flew away. It went for miles. Went onto the Arctic Trail. \nThey laugh. \nSAMANTHA Oh, did you guys kiss under the Bridge of Sighs? \nMOM Yes. \nBILL Yes, we did. \nBill leans in to kiss Olivia. \nMINDY Hey, Mom, can we see your wedding ring? \nMOM    (O.S.) Oh, sure. \nMom hands over her wedding ring. The boys look at a 20 Questions game. \nMINDY (O.S.) (Eyeing the ring) Wow. \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) (Holding the ring) Technically that's a fancy step cut surrounded by miniature brilliant. \nMASON I wish we could've gone to Europe. \nRANDY Yeah. \nBILL Yeah, we'll go as a family next time. But you didn't miss much, really. We just stayed in the hotel room the whole time playing video games. \nMom laughs. \nMASON Really? \nBILL And the hotels are really small and really old. Squeaky. \nThe WAITER comes over. \nWAITER Can I get you anything else? Would you like to see a dessert menu? \nBILL (To Randy) Listen, I told you to put that away. (To Mom) Would you put that in your purse, please? Computer games at the table. (To Waiter) Yes, uh, please, another bottle of wine. \nMASON (to Waiter) Um, Coke. \nMOM Um, you know what? Mason, you're okay with water. No more Cokes. (to Waiter) Thank you. \nBILL (O.S.) (To Randy) Now how 'bout you? Did you finish your science project? \nRANDY Not quite yet. \nBILL Well, did you work on it? I mean, did you build anything, or plan anything, or..? \nRANDY A little. \n", "test1_id": 2184, "test2_input": "Mason nods. \nMOM (CONT'D) We all agree, everybody agrees, right? Tomorrow, chores? \nSamantha nods. \nBILL Well, they don't hear it, you know. It goes in one ear and out the other. \nSAMANTHA But Dad, I mean, dusting is pointless. \nBILL It's not pointless, you just don't like to do it. \nSAMANTHA But I mean, who dusts anymore? \nBILL You do when we ask you to! And don't -- Olivia, don't let her back-talk me in front of the other kids, please. Thank you. \nMOM Samantha, please... \nSAMANTHA Whatever! \nSamantha turns to walk away from the conversation. \nBILL (O.S.) Bye-bye, have a wonderful weekend. \nMOM (O.S.) Mm.    Okay.   Bye, guys. Love you. \nThe other kids follow Samantha as she exits.       Bill sits down at the table with Mom. \nBILL I'm sorry, but I thought we talked about it. You have to draw a line, you have to back it up. \nMOM Okay. It's just... you have so many lines Bill. Everything's a line. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nDad is parked in the drive way.

CITY STREET - DAY \nThey drive down the street in Dad's car. \nDAD You guys ready for the big game? \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nDAD Sam, who are the Astros playing tonight? \nSAMANTHA I don't know. \nDAD Milwaukee Brewers. Alright, get to know 'em, get to hate 'em. Mase! How you been, huh? How was your week? \nMASON Pretty good. \nDAD Yeah?   What you been up to? \nMASON Not much. \nDAD (O.S.) No? You still hangin' with that kid Joe? \nMASON Yeah. \nDAD Yeah, he's still your best friend? \nMASON Yeah, I guess. \nDAD Okay. (To Samantha) How 'bout you? How was your week? \nSAMANTHA Fine. \nDAD (O.S.) What you been up to? \nSAMANTHA Nothin' really. \nDAD You um, you still working on that sculpture project? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Yeah. \nDAD   (O.S.) Yeah? \nSAMANTHA Almost finished. \nDAD   (O.S.) What's it of? \nSAMANTHA Nothing. \nDad pulls the car over and parks. \nDAD Alright, no-no-no-no-no. Nope, that is not how we're going to talk to one another. Alright? Now, I will not be that guy. You can not put me in that category, alright? The biological father who I spend every other week with and I make polite conversation, you know, while he drives me places and buys me shit. No! Talk to me. \nHe turns to Samantha in the passenger seat. \nDAD (CONT'D) Samantha, how was your week? Uh, I don't know Dad, it was kind of tough. Billy and Ellen broke up, and Ellen's kind of mad at me because she saw me talking to Billy in the cafeteria. And you remember that sculpture I was working on? Well, it was a unicorn and the horn broke off. So, now it's zebra. Okay? But I still think I'm going to get an 'A'. Alright? \nDad turns around to address Mason in the back seat. \nDAD (CONT'D) Mason, uh, how was your week? Well Dad, you know it was kind of tough. Joe, he's kind of a jerk, actually. He stole some cigarettes from his mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em. But I said no, cause I knew what a hard time you had quittin' smokin', Dad. How 'bout that? Is that so hard? \nSAMANTHA Dad, these questions are kind of hard to answer. \nDAD What is so hard to answer about what sculpture are you making? \nSAMANTHA It's abstract. \nDAD Okay. Okay, that's good. See, that's, I didn't know that. I didn't know you were even interested in abstract art. \nSAMANTHA I'm not.   They make us do it. \nMASON But Dad, I mean why is it all on us though? You know, what about you? How was your week? You know, who do hang out with? Do you have a girlfriend? What have you been up to? \nDAD I see your point. \n", "test2_true": "DAD (CONT'D) So we should just let it happen more natural, right? That's what you're sayin', right? \nMason nods. \nDAD (CONT'D) Okay.   That's what we'll do.    Starting now. \nEXT. BUTTERFLY MUSEUM - DAY \nDad, Samantha, and Mason are pointing out different butterflies they find, using a nature chart. A butterfly lands on Mason's shoulder. \nMASON Hey, check this out. \nSAMANTHA That would be a... That would be a Magnificent Owl. Caligo Atreus. \nDAD What's that one?    Look at this. \nDad opens his hands and shows them a butterfly in his palms. \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Whoa. \nDAD What kind is that? \nSAMANTHA That looks like a Zebra Longwing. \nDAD Alright. \nSAMANTHA Cool. \nDAD This one's incredible.     That's the owl one, right? \nSAMANTHA Yeah.   Magnificent Owl. \nDAD I think he went pee-pee on you, bud. \nDad laughs. \nEXT. SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY \nDad, Samantha, and Mason play tag around a large outdoor sculpture. \nMASON One, two, three, four, five... \nSoon they are running in circles around it. \nDAD Ahaa! Ahh! Get away from me! Get away from me! Get your sister -- Ahh! \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nDad is tossing a football with Mason and Samantha. \nDAD Yo, Mase, look at me here. Make a diamond with your hands, alright? Fingers and thumbs. Keep your hands soft. Hey, Sam. \nSamantha throws the football to Dad. \nDAD (CONT'D) Very nice. That's how you want to catch it, just like that. Even when you're runnin', that's what you're thinkin' about, that diamond. That diamond, and soft hands. \nDad throws the ball to Mason. \nDAD (CONT'D) There it is. \nMason throws the ball back to Samantha. \nEXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER \nDad, Samantha, and Mason crouch down into starting line positions. \nDAD Down!   Set!    Hut!   Ahhhh! \nDad releases the ball down the hill and the three of them chase after it. \nDAD (CONT'D) No no no no no! \nThe ball kicks up and into Samantha's hands.   They are now chasing after her. \nSAMANTHA Yes! \nDAD Don't let her get -- No no no no no! \nINT.   BASEBALL STADIUM - NIGHT \nDad, Samantha, and Mason watch a live baseball game. \nDAD (O.S.) Let's go, Roger! \nThe crowd reacts to the game. \nDAD (CONT'D) Guy's incredible. He's unhittable this year! Now just so you know, what we're watching here, is history. Now you see this guy out here? This dude is like forty-three years old and he's strikin' out guys half his age. This guy's ERA is 1.47, alright, can you believe that? Now if the Astros could just get a few runs maybe we'd win a game. \nMASON Dad, do you have a job? \nDAD Ha!   Why would you ask me that? \nMASON I don't know. Mom wanted to know and I didn't know what the answer was. \nDAD Mom wanted to know. Alright. Well, you can tell mom that I just happen to have passed my second actuarial exam, alright? So... you tell her that. How's she doing? \nSAMANTHA Great. \nDAD She finishing school? \nSAMANTHA Yep, all 'A's. \nDAD All 'A's huh? Like mother, like daughter, right? \nThe kids leave to get hot dogs, etc.   Mason puts mustard on his. \nThey return to the game. A clutch Astros home run and the crowd is cheering. Our guys celebrate with high fives, etc. \nDAD (O.S.) (CONT'D) You got this! That's outta here! That's out-- Oh! Oh! \nFireworks go off.   The crowd stands to their feet. \nDAD (CONT'D) Yeah!!   Fuckin' A! \nINT.   DAD'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe TV is playing the horror film HOSTEL.

I mean, you're going to school eventually... It's too expensive. I'm done. \nMASON Well why did you even buy it in the first place, then? \nMOM Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the (MORE) \nMOM (CONT'D) brink of poverty. I mean, I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff. \nMASON Really?   Like what? \nMOM Like - Well, I got rid of a couple husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a mortgage, some maintenance, the tchotchkes, the, the homeowner's insurance, the property tax, the plumbing... Ahhh. You know what? From now on I am gonna be Mommy Monk. Simple. Celibate. \nMASON Don't be gross, Mom. \nMOM Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house. (Laughs) Is that better? \nMASON Okay. \nMason starts to walk away. \nMOM Mason -- Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash. \nMASON I do dishes all day. \nMOM Well, great honey, then you're a professional. Come on, you could do one or two more for you poor old mom. \nMason walks over to the sink. \nMASON Okay. \nMOM Thank you. \nEXT. MOM'S HOUSE \nMason gets in truck, drives away. \nINT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN \nMusic plays in the background. Mason is in uniform, he carries in a bus tub of dirty dishes, one with uneaten battered shrimp on it. He sticks one in his mouth and flirts with APRIL, a waitress. \nMASON You want one? \nAPRIL Ugh. God -- \nMASON (Laughing) She didn't even touch them, seriously. I watched her the whole time. \nApril takes one. \nAPRIL Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you little pervert. (Laughing) It's like we're on a date. Cheers. \nThey clink battered shrimp. \nMASON It's a night of romance. \nAPRIL Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you. \nShe heads back out to the restaurant floor. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) I will blow you, though. \nMason brings the dishes over to the industrial washers.   His boss, MR. WOOD, storms in. \nMR. WOOD Mason!   We are in the weeds out here! \nMASON I'm goin' as fast as I can. \nMR. WOOD Oh! (MORE) \nMR. WOOD (CONT'D) Then I must be confused then, cause I just saw you chattin it up with April when I gotta salad bar that needs a refill, I gotta six top, two four tops I can't use, because they haven't been bused. \nMASON Enrique is not here.   I'm tryin'. \nMR. WOOD Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'! What am I supposed to tell my customers? \"Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'. Least that's what he told me, after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp.\" Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share somethin' with you, I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, now that's a lot more responsibility. It's also more money. How's that sound? \nMASON Good. \nMR. WOOD I know you can handle that money... but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down! \nMason exits. \nINT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY \nMason sits on the stairs video chatting with Dad on his phone. \nDAD Well, so it's -- it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore? \nMASON (Holding Phone) No , it's fine. It's up for the trip. \nDAD (Laughing) Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin? \nMASON Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool, and I guess her roommate's out of town so it's no big deal. \nDAD Alright, well, did you apply there yet? Did you get that application in to UT? \nMASON Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much in, though. \nDAD Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing. You know? I mean seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants. \nMASON Yeah. \nDAD A bit of decisiveness goes a long way in this life, alright? \nMASON Yeah. \nDAD Great. And uh, what about work? How's that goin'? \nMASON Uh, I don't know. It's, it's alright. Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world. People are slobs. \nDAD (Laughing) Well, when people ask me about you I say, \"Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up.\" \nMason laughs. \nDAD (CONT'D) (From Phone) Alright, hey, hey, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you? \nDad pans the phone to Annie and baby. \nANNIE Say hi to your big brother.     Hey, big brother. \nMASON Hey, Annie.    Hey, kiddo. \nANNIE Can you say bye-bye? \nBABY Bye-buh! \nANNIE (Laughs) We'll see you soon. \nDAD (From phone) Alright, alright, well, be careful when you're driving, alright? Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. Alright? Just, you're Obi Wan. You're centered, patient, right? You watch three cars ahead, two behind. It takes two bad drivers to have an accident okay? \nMASON Okay. \nDAD (From phone) Right, and listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something. \nMom comes down the stairs and drops a bag at Mason's feet. \n", "test3_true": "DAD Alright, buddy!      You have a good one. \nMASON Bye, Dad. \nMOM (Motioning to the bag) Hey, honey, take this to your sister. Throw it in the truck, okay? \nMASON Okay, I will. \nMOM So where is Sheena staying? \nMASON At her friend Emily's. \nMOM Is Emily a real person? \nMASON (Laughing) Yeah. Yeah, she's a sophomore.    She has an apartment. \nMOM (Holding out money) Okay, this is in case of emergency. Don't spend it. I want it back. \nMASON Okay.   Thanks. \nMOM Did you do your homework? \nMASON Most of it, but... I can finish tomorrow night. \nMOM Honey! Eleventh grade is really important for college. Don't blow it. \nMASON I know! I know. I mean, we're going to UT and everything. \nMOM I know, and don't you want me to come? Come on, Sheena, road trip with Mom! I'll pay for gas. \nMASON Umm... \nMOM I'm just kidding.      I have work. \nShe kisses his forehead. \nMOM (CONT'D) Call me when you get there. \nMASON I will. \nMOM Have fun! \nMason exits. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/ INT. TRUCK \n\"Suburban Wars\" plays.    Mason drives, Sheena is in the passenger seat. \nSHEENA ... That sounds to me like just another extreme Mason view of everything. \nMASON Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots... I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right now. \nSHEENA Oh, right now? \nMASON Yeah! I mean, why not? There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything. We don't cost anything. I mean we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly. And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrades. \nSHEENA How? \nMASON Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked. \nSHEENA So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone. \nMASON I still make fun of Trevor, though. \nSHEENA But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something. \nMASON That's just 'cause they did that lame story about it in the school paper. \nSHEENA And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later. \nMASON That's the thing though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to try and not live my life through a screen. I want, like, some kind of actual interaction. A real person, not just the profile they put up. \nSheena's looking at her phone. \nSHEENA Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying something? \nShe laughs. \nMASON Yeah, okay, I know you're joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so... it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything. \nSHEENA It's not an experience, it's just information. Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight. Thank you very much, Facebook. And I just texted my mom back. \nMASON Oh, that's -- that's groundbreaking. She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes? \nSHEENA Oh! Oh my god, most importantly, Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig. \nSheena hands him the phone. \nMASON (looks at phone photo) Hm! (Laughs) Okay, you're right.    That is a -- \nSHEENA Right? \nMASON That is a really cute, tiny pig. Our lives can go on. \nSHEENA I want one. \nINT. POOL HALL \nGotye's \"Somebody That I Used To Know\" plays. Patrons chatter. Mason plays pool with Samantha's BOYFRIEND. Samantha and Sheena sit and talk. \nBOYFRIEND Nice shot. \nSAMANTHA Yeah, just give the lady at the front y'all's I.D.s and, uh, she should let you in. \nSHEENA I see.   Cool. \nSAMANTHA Yeah. \nSHEENA It's room 2-0-6, right? \nSAMANTHA Mm-hm. \nSHEENA Awesome. It's not like weird that we're staying there? \nSAMANTHA No, it's fine. Have fun. (Laughs) \nSHEENA (O.S.) Thank you. So how long have you guys been dating? \nSAMANTHA About three months. Yeah, we met at a party and it's been, ya know, chill. \nSHEENA Yeah, he seems cool. \nSAMANTHA Yeah.    He is. \nThe guys are shooting pool. \nSHEENA (O.S.) Does he go to UT too? \nSAMANTHA (O.S.) Yeah. \nSHEENA Cool.

DEL T'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup, but you live out in the woods, and Mr. Jingles, he be scared to live out dans la foret. 
PAUL He whisper that in your ear? 
Del nods, tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter skitter. Paul is completely out of ideas. But then: 
BRUTAL How about Mouseville? 
DEL Mouseville? 
BRUTAL Tourist attraction down in Florida. Tallahassee, I think. Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee? 
PAUL (level) Yeah, that's right. Tallahassee. Just down the road apiece from the dog university. 
Brutal's mouth twitches, but he manages to keep a straight face. He gives Paul a look--don't blow this. 
BRUTAL You think they'd take Mr. Jingles? You think he's got the stuff? 
PAUL Might. He's pretty smart. 
DEL Hey! What dis Mouseville? 
BRUTAL Tourist attraction, I said. They got this big tent you go into-- 
DEL Like a cirque? You have to pay? 
BRUTAL You shittin' me? Course you pay. Dime a piece, two cents for the kids. And inside the tent there's this mouse city made out of boxes and toilet paper rolls... 
Percy is drifting up the block, listening too, but nobody's really paying him much mind. 
BRUTAL ...plus they got the Mouseville All-Star Circus. There's mice that swing on trapeze, mice that roll barrels, mice that stack coins... 
DEL Dat's it! Dat's da place for Mr. Jingles! You gonna be a circus mouse after all! Gonna live in a mouse city down in Florida! 
Del tosses the spool extra hard--it takes a bad bounce off the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the Mile. The mouse goes after it like a shot, too intent to notice: 
His old enemy Percy. 
BRUTAL Percy, no! 
Percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on Mr. Jingles. There's a SOFT SNAP as the mouse's back breaks. 
Del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing the mouse's name. Percy looks to Brutal and Paul, smiles. 
PERCY Knew I'd get him sooner or later. Just a matter of time, really. 
He turns and strolls up the Mile, leaving Mr. Jingles dying in a tiny pool of blood. Up at the duty desk, Dean and Harry get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious. 
Percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. Del is still screaming, all his pent-up terror and grief pouring out at the dying mouse. And then comes a soft, urgent voice: 
COFFEY Give'm to me. 
They turn. Coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one massive hand spread open. 
COFFEY Give'm to me. Might still be time. 
Paul hesitates, scoops the mouse up off the floor, wincing at the feel of it. Splintered bones are poking at the hide. 
BRUTAL What are you doing? 
Paul doesn't answer, just lays Mr. Jingles into Coffey's hand. Coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. All we see now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly. 
BRUTAL Paul, what the hell-- 
Paul motions him quiet. Del is pleading softly at his bars: 
DEL Please, John. Oh Johnny, help him, please help him, s'il vous plait. 
Harry and Dean join the group. Everybody watching now. 
Coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands, inhales sharply. The world hangs suspended for a moment. Coffey raises his face, contorting as if desperately ill, starts making those horrendous choking sounds in his throat... 
BRUTAL (softly) Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at the tail. 
They do. The tail is no longer weak and dying. It's snapping briskly back and forth, as if ready to play. 
Coffey makes that retching/gagging sound...and again exhales a cloud of swirling black "insects" from his nose and mouth. The men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and disappear. 
Coffey bends down, opens his hand. Mr. Jingles bounds off his fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. They turn to see Del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying. Dean turns back to Coffey with a stunned whisper: 
DEAN What did you do? 
COFFEY I helped Del's mouse. He a circus mouse. Goan live in a mouse city down in...down in... 
BRUTAL (numb) Florida? 
Coffey nods, remembering. 
COFFEY Boss Percy's bad. He mean. He step on Del's mouse. (softly) I took it back, though. 
And with that, he lies back on his bunk and faces the wall. The others look to Paul, don't even know what to say. 
PAUL Brute, come along with me. (to Harry and Dean) You fellas go on back to you cribbage game. 
Harry nods numbly. Paul leads Brutal up the Mile... 
EXECUTION CHAMBER 
...and they enter to find Percy polishing Old Sparky's arms.

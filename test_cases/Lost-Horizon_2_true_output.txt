It is quiet. All are asleep. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY until it reaches the glass panel leading to the cockpit. The pilot's face turns. Instead of Fenner we see a strange, Mongolian face - with sharp, piercing eyes. A half-smile plays across his mouth. 
EXT. SHOT OF PLANE 
41. LONG SHOT OF PLANE 
Flying at high speed against a moonlit sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes, a mere speck, over the horizon. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SHOT - DAWN 
42. LONG SHOT 
The morning sun peeks over a mountain top. From the same direction, as if arriving with the sun, the ship looms up, and comes roaring toward us. 
INT. PLANE 
43. FULL SHOT 
All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets on his seat. Then Barnard stirs - opens his eyes - and stretches. As he does so, he sees that Lovett is awake. 
BARNARD 
Good morning, Lovey. 
LOVETT 
I beg your pardon. 
BARNARD 
I say, good morning, Lovey. 
LOVETT 
Good morning혰 
(catches himself) 
Look here, young man. 
BARNARD 
Eh? 
LOVETT 
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P. 
BARNARD 
I see. 
LOVETT 
I see. 
BARNARD 
Well, it's a good morning, anyway. 
LOVETT 
I'm never conversational before I coffee. 
Barnard glances out of the window, looks around outside thoughtfully. 
BARNARD 
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we? 
LOVETT 
Why, of course. Yes. 
BARNARD 
Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling west. 
LOVETT 
That's ridiculous. 
BARNARD 
Is it? 
LOVETT 
It certainly is. 
BARNARD 
Look here혰 
LOVETT 
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south혰 
BARNARD 
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed. 
LOVETT 
Oh, really? 
BARNARD 
Yes. 
LOVETT 
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is혰 
(tries to explain - gets confused and irritated) 
What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north! 
BARNARD 
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it. 
LOVETT 
Now you're irritating and absurd! 
44. CLOSE SHOT - LOVETT 
As he sulks by himself, looks around - locates the sun in back of him - smiles - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending glance over at Barnard - then suddenly his face clouds - the whole thing dawns on him. 
LOVETT 
(jumps up shrieking) 
Oh, my word - of course - yes. Boy! Boy, we're travelling in the wrong direction! Wake up! We're going in the wrong direction! 
45. FULL SHOT 
Conway is still asleep. 
GEORGE 
(concerned for Conway) 
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise? 
LOVETT 
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here! 
GEORGE 
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing. 
LOVETT 
(not quite reassured) 
It's Fenner. 
BARNARD 
He might have lost his way.

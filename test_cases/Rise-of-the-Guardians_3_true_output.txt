JACK (CONT'D) Now for the last time, leave me alone. 
Pitch looks confused and hurt. This is not the response he was expecting. Then...his eyes flame with anger. He made himself vulnerable, and Jack rejected him. No more negotiating now. 
PITCH Very well. You want to be left alone? Done. But first... 
Suddenly Jack hears a familiar twitter. Pitch reaches into his coat to pull out... 
JACK Baby Tooth! 
Jack charges forward. There's terror in Baby Tooth's eyes. She squeaks as Pitch clenches her tight with his fist. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 99. 
PITCH The staff, Jack. 
Jack settles and the winds and snow subsides. 
PITCH (CONT'D) You have a bad habit of interfering. Now hand it over. (BEAT) And I'll let her go. 
BABY TOOTH (twitters - Don't give it to him!) 
Baby Tooth struggles to get loose, but Pitch only tightens his grip. She can hardly breathe. Jack has no choice. Jack...hands over...the staff. 
Pitch twirls the staff. 
JACK (re: Baby Tooth) Alright, now let her go. 
PITCH No. You said you wanted to be alone. (BEAT) So be alone! 
Baby Tooth squirms until she's finally able to peck Pitch in the hand with her beak. Pitch shrieks and throws Baby Tooth in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse. 
JACK No! 
Jack, enraged, can't believe what he's seeing. Pitch lifts the staff, and breaks it over his knee, cracking it in two. Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain. 
Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the chasm below. 
Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws the broken shards of Jack's staff down into the crevasse and casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon.

SEQ. 2308 - JACK'S MEMORY 
EXT. ICE FISSURE - NIGHT 
It's cold and dark down here, and Jack is more alone than he's ever been. Battered from the fall, Jack slowly looks up and notices Baby Tooth, lying lifelessly on the ground. 
JACK Baby Tooth! 
He pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands. 
JACK You alright? 
Baby Tooth nods, but she's hurt, and cold. Jack does his best to shield her from the cold. 
JACK Sorry, all I can do is keep you cold. 
Jack sits up and holds Baby Tooth in his hands. 
JACK Pitch was right - I make a mess of everything. 
Jack is devastated. Baby Tooth's never seen him like this; it's heart breaking...then she gets a thought. Her expression hardens with determination. 
She wriggles deep into his pocket. 
JACK Hey? 
Jack leans back and begins to close his eyes when he hears SOMETHING -- 
VOICE FROM A MEMORY Jack... Jack... 
-- and then he FEELS something. Looks down: There's a SOFT, GOLDEN GLOW coming from his pocket. 
Jack jumps, taken aback. He reaches in and pulls out the TOOTH BOX -- it's pulsing with light. 
VOICE FROM A MEMORY Jack... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 101. 
Baby Tooth gives him a reassuring look. 
Baby Tooth motions to the box, then looks back at Jack. Jack reaches to touch the box, but as he does its top magically UNFOLDS to reveal a handful of BABY TEETH - then the box and everything else glows BRIGHT WITH INTENSE LIGHT - 
The WALLS of the fissure seem to suddenly fall away. In brief FLASHES we see: The COLONIAL SETTLEMENT Jack visited. Children running playfully down a hill. 
JACK'S MOTHER Come on Jack, you can't have fun all the time. 
CHILDREN'S LAUGHING FACES as a familiar BOY hangs upside down from a tree limb. 
JACK'S SISTER Jack, get down from there! 
A HAPPY FAMILY at a roaring fire as the same boy jokes around with antlers on his head. 
COLONIAL BOY (O.S.) You're funny, Jack. 
Jack walks toward the woods with his sister. His mother, face unseen, calls out to him. 
JACK'S MOTHER Be careful. 
Jack shakes his head like he's heard it a million times but never pays it any mind. 
JACK (LAUGHING) We will.

On one condition. \nJOSH What's that? \nGWEN That you tell me your name. \nJOSH Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire. \nShe laughs. \nINT.

That all the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size? \nJOSH People are jealous. \nGWEN I can imagine.

You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you don't know... \nHe puts his mind to it-- \nFADE OUT: FADE IN: \nINT. GWEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nGwen and her mother JOANNE are in the living room looking at samples of fabric.  At sixty, Joanne is robust and shrewd. \nGWEN Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think of...the vibrant colors of Haiti. \nJOANNE Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind me of that trip. \n(beat) \nAnyway, quit changing the subject. \nGwen puts down the swatches. \nGWEN Alright.

It can be quite detrimental. \nGwen begins to pace in exasperation. \nJOANNE Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late 30s.

Are you free for coffee...or something? \nJOANNE Pick up the phone. \nGwen just stares at the machine. \nVOICE I have no idea what you're up to...I hope life is treating you well.  I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that you're still married.  Congratulations.  If you want, give me a call.  I'm crashing at my sister's.  The number is -- hold on-- the number is 235-4511.  Hope to hear from you. \nCLICK. GWEN Wow. \nJOANNE How long has it been? \nGWEN College. \nJOANNE Have you ever seen his show?  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never miss it. \nGWEN If Josh isn't home, I'll watch it. \nJOANNE Hmm.  It's Kismet, then. \nGWEN What? \nJOANNE A brief liaison with an old flame.  The perfect way to deal with your anger. \nGWEN You're insane.  You're an insane mother. \nJOANNE It'll be good for your self-esteem. \nGWEN Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee? \nJoanne crosses to the answering machine.  Rewinds the tape. Hits play. \nDAVID'S VOICE ...on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.  Are you free for coffee...or something? \nShe hits stop. \nJOANNE \"Coffee...or something.\"  He's flirting, admit it.  Coffee...or something. \nGWEN He's stammering.  He's nervous.  He's calling out of the blue! \nJoanne gathers her purse. \nJOANNE You're wrong.  I'm right, and I'm going.

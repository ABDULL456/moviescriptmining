{"train": "SEXUAL LIFE \nWritten by \nKen Kwapis \nDraft: 08/03 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CITY SKYLINE - DAY \nFrom an AERIAL VIEW we see the outline of a city.  Any city will do.  Mirrored high rises.  Sprawling apartment complexes.  A lot of people live here...whoever they are. \nAs we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at all, but a scale model of one. \nEverything is in miniature -- the buildings, parks, and freeways. GLIDING over this tabletop metropolis, we find that none of the buildings have roofs, allowing us to peak inside. \nVARIOUS CLOSE ANGLES We FLOAT through miniature coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms, where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life \nA man dines alone.  A woman walks her dog.  Two kiss on the street. One waits for a bus. \nOver this we HEAR Marianne Faithful's smoky-voiced cover of the standard \"When We're Alone\" \nJust picture a penthouse Way up in the sky, With hinges on chimney For stars to go by, A sweet slice of heaven For just you and I, When we're alone. \nFrom all of society We'll stay aloof, And live in propriety There on the roof, Two heavenly hermits We'll be in true, When we're alone. \nAs the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature bed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LORNA'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY \nA cramped one-room studio.  Asleep on a futon is a slender girl of nineteen -- LORNA.  Her blood red toenails give the place its only color. An alarm clock rings it's twelve noon.  Lorna uses her foot to turn it off. \nLORNA Terri.  Why did you let me sleep so late? \nLorna looks over to an empty pull-out sofa, its only occupant a skinny kitten. \nLORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) \nTerri? \n(to the cat) \nShe must already be at work, huh? \nThe cat meows -- very non-committal. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LORNA'S KITCHEN - DAY \nStill in her T-shirt and panties, Lorna opens a can of cat food as the kitten looks on. \nLORNA She probably forgot what day it is, right Arthur?  Some friend she turned out to be.  Not like you.  You remember what day it is, don't you? \n(off the cat's blank stare) \nI'm not giving you any food until you tell me. \nArthur the cat responds with a pitiful meow.  Lorna smiles and sets down the food. \nLORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) \nThat's right.  I knew you'd remember. \nCUT TO OMITTED \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nLorna, dressed casually, walks to the bus stop.  Reading the crossword puzzle in the paper, she doesn't see the curb and trips, spilling her purse. \nEmbarrassed, she gathers her things, then takes a seat next to a Latino Woman.  Lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle. \nStumped by a clue, she turns to the Woman. \nLORNA Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts? \nThe Woman shrugs and looks off. \nSuddenly, Lorna's phone rings.  She reaches into her purse but it's not there.  Then, she spots it...in the street.  But the moment she goes to get it, a truck roars past and smashes it to smithereens. \nLORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) \nOh my god. \nLORNA A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign. \nTerri pops a cigarette in her mouth as the Waitress delivers the toast. \nWAITRESS (to Terri) \nCan't do that here, Miss. \nTERRI I know, I know.  I'm not going to light the damn thing. \n(beat) \nFuck me. \nLORNA Look, I'm good for next month's rent. \nThis takes Terri by surprise. \nTERRI What, you're leaving too? \nLORNA Maybe.  Get out of town for a while.  I really feel good about this. \n(beat) \nI appreciate everything you've done for me this year, Terri. \nTERRI I wish you'd talked to me first. \nLORNA I didn't because...I knew you'd try to talk me out of it. \nTERRI That's because I'm looking out for you.  It's because there is so much opportunity here. \n(beat) \nAnd it's because I'm your friend. \nLorna fiddles with her toast. \nLORNA I know. \n(beat) \nListen, I'm late. \nLorna leaves some change on the counter, picks up her gift and gives Terri a hug. \nLORNA Thanks. \nTERRI Well...Happy Birthday. \nAs Lorna goes, the Waitress reappears. \nWAITRESS Your friend comin' back? \nTERRI Hard to say. \nCUT TO \nINT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY \nSomeone is flipping through a stack of wedding photos.  Festive shots of various couples.  At the altar.  Cutting the cake. Posing with relatives. \nCUT TO We're in -- \nA living room, Lorna sits on the couch browsing the wedding photos. She has a quizzical look, as if the photos were of some incomprehensible alien culture. The apartment is cluttered but not dirty.  The decor suggests an occupant of modest means and bohemian taste. \nThe occupant is TODD, who ENTERS counting a wad of money.  Late twenties.  Unshaven.  By turns, cocky and nervous. \nHe sets the money in front of Lorna. \nTODD Seventy-five, right?  For the half-hour. \nLORNA Not including tip. \nShe smiles.  Todd paces uneasily. \nTODD And, typically, the size of the tip is... \nLORNA Depends on how generous you feel. \nTODD Of course. \nLORNA Is...this your first appointment? \nTODD No.  I've done this before. \nLorna thinks otherwise.  She pats the seat next to her. \nAlone, Lorna prepares.  She tears open a condom wrapper, stares into the mirror and runs her lines. \nLORNA Oh, you really have a big cock...My, you really have a big cock...God, what a big cock you have. \nCUT TO \nINT. TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY \nLorna and Todd are having sex.  She's on top, her movements slow and hypnotic.  Occasionally, Lorna offers a moan, some are more convincing than others. \nNOTE: Throughout the scene, our ANGLES generally exclude Todd from view.  We may HEAR him, but our focus is on -- \nLORNA As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions. In fact, puzzles are on her mind. \nLORNA Forty-two across...Simon & Garfunkel hit...eight letters...begins with 'I'...I...I'm A Loser...Did they sing that?...Susie used to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time...I scratched one once and she pulled my hair...I haven't spoken to her for almost a year...Her little kid must be walking by now...Maybe I should give Susie a call...Nah, fuck that!  She's perfectly capable of calling me...I mean, I'm listed...I'm...I am a rock...that's it!...I Am A Rock, that's the answer...I am a-- \nSuddenly, Lorna remembers the job at hand. \nLORNA (flatly) \nGod, you really have a big cock. \nLike Pavlov's proverbial dog, Todd MOANS and the whole thing is quickly over. \nLorna gives Todd a look -- it's an astonishing impersonation of tenderness. \nLORNA Wow.  That was something. \nTODD Yeah...was it? \nLORNA Let me tell you...that was something. \nTODD Really. \nLORNA Cut the modesty.  You really know what you're doing. \nCUT TO \nINT. TODD'S KITCHEN - DAY \nLorna, dressed, is dialing the kitchen phone.  From the kitchen window she can see a school playground across the way.  It's recess.  Girls in uniforms perform a jump rope cadence. \nLORNA (into phone) \nHey, it's Lorna...I'm clocking out for the last time...No, I'm not done for the day, I'm done...Wait, I don't think you heard me...Well, just give it to one of the other girls.  Give it to Terri...I don't care if he's an important client, I told you I'm...Well, you'll just have to cancel it, won't you?...I don't care what it pays, it's not my fuckin'-- \nShe turns to find Todd in the doorway, listening. \nLORNA (into phone) \nHold on... \n(to Todd) \nWhat? \nTODD Nothing.  Are you alright? \nLORNA I'm fine.  The cab fare will be another twenty. \nTODD You never said anything about cab fare. \nLORNA Of course I did.  Are you calling me a liar? \nTODD No.  I swear, you didn't say a word about it. \nLorna slowly brings the phone to her ear. \nLORNA (into phone) \nAlright.  Where is it? \nCUT TO \nINT. TODD'S CAR - MOVING - DAY \nTodd is at the wheel of his vintage Buick.  Lorna sits on the passenger side.  She looks off, distracted.  On the seat between them is the gift from Terri, still unopened. \nTODD You haven't told me where we're going yet. \nLORNA Make a right at the light. \nHe does. \nTODD Can I ask you a question? \n(without a beat) \n(off Todd's look) \nWhat?  You've never had a Lorna Doone? \nTODD No. \nSARAH Terri and Lorna.  Sisters, maybe?  Lovers, more like it.  Or...witches. And this bracelet is some sort of talisman. \nTODD You have a perverse mind. \n(beat) \n...which I like, by the way. \nSARAH Or...perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this \"gift\" provides her with an alibi. \nTODD Maybe you should put it back. \nSARAH What, aren't you a little curious? \nTodd pulls over and stops. \nTODD Sarah...I don't know how to put this.  This is our fourth night out, and I feel a lot of pressure...for this to work. \nSARAH I want it to work, too. \n(off his look) \nOh.  Is this about sex? \nTODD Don't you think we're being a little...methodical about the whole thing?  Maybe we should just... \nSARAH What?  Get it over with? \nTODD Not exactly. \nSARAH Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first? To have a little bit of trust? \nSarah absently fingers the bracelet that's not hers. \nTODD You can trust me. \nSARAH I know, I know. \n(beat) \nBut you're not sleeping with anyone else, right? \nTODD Of course not. \nSARAH It's not such a strange thing to ask.  Sometimes relationships...overlap. I just need to feel-- \nTODD I told you.  I'm not. \nBeat. \nSARAH You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone. \nTODD Is that bad? \nSARAH It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine anyone being interested in me. \nTODD What?  You should be flattered I don't ask.  I respect you enough to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone. \nSarah considers this. \nSARAH Hmm.  Ask me, anyway. \nTODD Are you serious? \n(off her look) \nAlright.  Are you seeing anyone? \nSARAH Absolutely not. \nTodd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss Sarah. \nSARAH I do want to make love tonight. \nTODD I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity-- \nShe presses her finger to his lips-- \nSARAH I think spontaneity is overrated. \nCUT TO \nSARAH These walls, they're paper-thin.  This building is so poorly built.  Everyone can hear you. \nTodd rolls off of her. \nTODD Is that why you're so quiet? \nSARAH Yes, the walls are...What are you saying? \nTODD It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this. \nSARAH Of course, I am.  I'm sorry if I'm not vocal enough for you. \nTODD That's not what I...Sarah, I just want to make sure I'm doing something right here. \nSARAH There's no right or wrong way to do this. \nTODD I know.  I just want to make sure I'm...you know, in the ballpark. \nSarah stares at him. \nSARAH Todd, I don't expect you to do everything right the first time...Sorry, that didn't come out the way I meant it... \nThey roll away from each other and stare at the ceiling.  We hear a distant siren -- a fire engine, maybe.  Somewhere there's a five-alarm fire blazing.  Not here. \nTODD You didn't like it. \nSARAH No, I didn't say that.  I was just...Let's be still for a while. Alright? \nFADE OUT: FADE IN: \nINT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT \nSarah and Todd haven't moved.  It's not clear how much time has elapsed. \nSARAH Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it.  But that's just a myth. \nTODD A myth.  You're right. \nSARAH Let's not be too hard on ourselves. \nTODD I agree. \nSARAH Our expectations were a little high, that's all. \nTodd nods his agreement. \nTODD And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture. \nSARAH True.  What do you mean? \nTODD I know this couple. They had nothing in common but good sex. They went at it like a pair of rabbits.  And guess how long it lasted?  A month.  They were hot for each other...but there was nothing else. \nSARAH Right. \n(beat) \nThere's got to be something else. \nAnd they stare at the ceiling. \nFADE OUT: FADE IN: \nINT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - STILL LATER - NIGHT \nThey still haven't moved, but unbeknownst to Sarah, Todd has fallen asleep. \nShe looks at him.  She caresses his face.  Then, her hand slides down under the sheets.  She tries to arouse him, but after a while she stops.  He's very much asleep. \nSarah lies back.  She slides her hand between her legs and begins to touch herself. \nQuietly. \nFADE OUT: FADE IN: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nEarly morning.  The air is cool and crisp as Sarah, wearing sweats and a T-shirt, jogs through the neighborhood. \nShe turns down a side street, heading for-- \nEXT. SARAH'S GRANDPARENTS HOUSE - DAY \nA nondescript house with a faded American flag hanging off the front porch.  Sarah climbs the steps where an elderly man -- her GRANDFATHER, sits with the morning paper in his lap, unread. \nSarah gives him a kiss. \nSARAH Morning, Pappy.  How's she doing today? \nSARAH No small feat. \nGRANDMOTHER It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how I got out of that pickle? \nSARAH You lied. \nGRANDMOTHER Damn right.  I said, \"What, you don't remember giving me this?\" He said, \"No.\"  And I said, \"Well, you were so fired up last night, it's a wonder you can remember anything.\" \n(beat) \nAnd the beast was tamed. \nSarah considers the story. \nSARAH And you've never been tempted to... \nGRANDMOTHER What?  Come clean with your Pappy?  Why should I tell him?  He had nothing to do with it. \nSARAH Right. \nGRANDMOTHER It's mine.  Not his. \nSARAH I wonder what became of that boy. \nGRANDMOTHER Never saw him again.  I don't regret a thing, if that's what you're wondering. \nSARAH I was, in fact. \nGRANDMOTHER Look what I have.  I have you. \n(beat) \nAnd you know what else?  I have the tall grass by that river. And those clouds.  From where I was laying the clouds looked really beautiful that day. \nCUT TO \nINT. THE MODEL CITY/OFFICE - DAY \nThe same model we saw at the start of our story.  We glide toward a miniature suburban development.  Row upon row of houses, each no different than the next. \nOver this -- \nSARAH I don't believe it.  You're actually asking my opinion.  You really want to know what I think? \nWe TILT UP to reveal that we're in-- \nThe well-appointed office of the well-heeled JOSH, an architect in his early 40s.  Josh studies the model like a boy with a train set.  Sarah stands beside him. \nJOSH To tell you the truth, no.  I just wanted to hear your voice. You've barely said \"boo\" to me all morning. \nSARAH (shrugs) \nBoo. \nJOSH Alright, what do you think of it? \nSARAH You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood. \n(off his look) \nHey, what do I know?  I'm just the assistant. \nJOSH What are they going to think?  That's all that matters. \nSARAH To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on. Not the women, of course. \nJOSH You haven't met these women. \nSarah laughs, catches herself and stops. \nCUT TO \nINT. OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY \nSarah and Josh move down a hall toward the elevators.  Josh is in micro-management mode -- \nJOSH The champagne order? \nSARAH Done.  Dom Perignon.  Fifteen cases. \nJOSH Invitations? \nSARAH A messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs. \nJOSH Good. \nHe reaches behind her and pats her butt. \nAs she hangs up the construction supervisor exits.  Sarah and Josh are alone. \nSARAH Guess I'll be heading back... \nJOSH Wait. \n(beat) \nAbout the other day...Are you having any second thoughts? \nSARAH (shrugs) \nNo.  None. \nJOSH You're angry I called it quits, aren't you?  You can admit it. \nSARAH No.  In fact, I want to thank you. \nJOSH For what? \nSARAH For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever had in my life.  For that, I thank you. \nJosh raises his hands in surrender. \nJOSH Touch\u00e9. \nSARAH Are you having seconds thoughts? \nJOSH No.  I say, let's make a clean break.  Let's just walk away from it. \nSarah smiles.  She extends her hand. \nJOSH What are you doing? \nSARAH Let's seal the deal.  Shake. \nIt's a little awkward, but they do. \nJOSH Alright.  Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem left. \nSARAH What? \nJOSH Where do we put the bed? \nJosh gestures to the empty room.  Sarah smiles -- it's a familiar game. \nSARAH Oh, the bed.  Let's put it against this wall.  Away from the morning sun. \nJOSH Wrong.  It's got to go here.  So you can see the hallway. \nThey head out. \nAs Josh and Sarah leave the house, they \"decorate\" several rooms. \nINT. ANOTHER BEDROOM -- DAY \nSARAH Not enough height for bunk beds. \nJOSH Why do you assume there will be two children? \nSARAH There has to be.  They need to keep each other company. \nINT. THE KITCHEN -- DAY \nSARAH Definitely not enough space for two people to cook. \nJOSH I prefer to eat out. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nThey size up the space, enjoying their play.  Sara walks around imaginary furniture. \nSARAH Oh, no.  I wouldn't put the ottoman there. \nJOSH Where would you put it? \nSARAH It needs to go over... \nShe waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest. She lets her hand linger... \nSARAH Hmmm. \nJOSH What? \n...and linger.  They both know what's happening. \nSARAH We have another problem. \nHe'll answer, anyway. \njoSH \nIf my hands weren't tied...it might have made all the difference. \nBeat. \nsarah \nI said I wasn't asking.  And that's the worst answer you could've given. \ncUT TO \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nJosh and Sarah get into their respective cars -- her BMW, his Navigator. \nJosh looks at himself in the rear-view mirror.  He reacts-- \nJoSH \nWhat the hell is this? \nSarah looks over. \njoSH (cont'd) \nYou bit me on the neck!  I've got a goddam hickey! \nSure enough, there is a bright red mark on his neck. \nSarah comes over.  She reacts with shock, embarrassment, then...laughter. \njoSH (cont'd) \nWhat's so goddam funny?  You did this on purpose, didn't you? \nsarah \nI did not.  I was just...I didn't mean to...I was caught up in the moment. \nAnd she laughs again. \njOSH \nWhat the hell are we going to do about this? \nsARAH \nJosh, you are a big boy.  You can take care of this on your own. \nJosh glares at her, starts his engine, and leaves her in the dust. \ncUT TO: \nINT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY \nTodd is on the kitchen phone.  Lorna's bracelet sits on the counter. \nTODD (into phone) \nNo, no, no.  You don't understand.  I don't want an appointment, I just need to get in touch with her...She left a package here by mistake, a gift...No, I'd rather give it to her myself...Lorna, but I assume none of you use your real names...What?  But she was working last week?...And you don't have a forwarding number? ...Look, it's really important that I get this back to her, so-- \nThe line goes dead. \nTODD Dammit. \nHe dials again.  Then, a knock at the door.  Todd reacts -- he's not expecting anyone. \nHe opens the door and finds-- \nSARAH Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier.  She holds a small paper bag. \nTODD Sarah... \nSARAH I brought you something. \nShe hands him the bag.  He looks inside. \nTODD Pickles.  Huh. \n(beat) \nWhat's in your hair? \nShe touches her hair. \nHe gets into bed next to her. \nJOSH I've been under a lot of stress. \nGWEN You don't have to apologize.  There's nothing wrong with the slump we're going through.  In fact, it's a good thing. \nJOSH How's that? \nHe turns off the side light.  We can't see them -- the room is completely dark. \nGWEN Too much passion can ruin a marriage.  Look at Eric and Sylvia. At the beginning, you couldn't pry them apart.  They were joined at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love again. \nShe snuggles up to him, strokes his back. \nGWEN In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you. \nJOSH I can feel that. \nGWEN You're welcome to reciprocate. \nJosh turns on the light and sits up. \nJOSH I can't. \nGWEN It's alright. \nJOSH To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise. I know all your moves.  You know mine.  How can there be any surprise? \nGwen sits up, throws back the sheet. \nGWEN Rub my feet. \nHe does. \nGWEN I think we should have an affair. \nJOSH What? \nGWEN With each other. \nJOSH That makes no sense. \nGWEN You pick me up at a bar... \nJOSH And, what?  Pretend I don't know you? \nGWEN (ignores him) \nOr we could meet at a hotel.  I'll register under my maiden name. Just like THE GRADUATE. \nJOSH THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a college boy. \nGWEN When I met you, you were a college boy. \nJOSH Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock.  As I recall, it turns out rather badly for her. \nGWEN Alright.  Bad example. \n(rethe foot rub) \nYou can stop. \nJOSH Actors pretend.  That's what they do.  I'm not an actor.  And I love you the way you are. \nGWEN I love you, too. \nAnd he turns out the light again. \nJOSH Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem. \nBeat. \nGWEN Who said there was a problem? \nCUT TO \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT \nA cocktail party at Josh's firm.  Josh is the center of attention, greeting investors, fielding compliments.  Gwen stands beside him, drinking champagne -- Dom Perignon, after all. \nJOSH'S POV Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd. \nGWEN Your lovely assistant is here. \n(reTodd) \nYou didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend. \nAs Josh and Todd sidle up--. \nJOSH (to bartender) \nGin.  Straight up.  Olives. \n(Todd) \nWhat are you having? \nTODD I'm fine, thanks. \nJOSH So...Sarah's an attractive girl. \nTODD Very. \nJOSH You two serious? \nTODD (shrugs) \nHard to say. \nJOSH She wants to play the field, right? \nTODD No, that's not it. \nJOSH I see.  You want to fuck around. \nTodd reacts. \nJOSH C'mon, we're guys.  I know the drill. \nTodd considers his audience, then decides to open up-- \nTODD We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about Sarah.  I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove. Then, a couple weeks ago, her grandmother died.  Things changed. \nJOSH I didn't know. \n(beat) \nShe didn't say a thing about it. \nTODD It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard.  So where did that leave me?  I was ambivalent about things, right?  But then my ambivalence had to take a back seat.  I had to be there for her.  Completely.  And, ready or not, our relationship became...a real relationship. \nJosh simply listens. \nTODD You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody.  I don't know...Death has a funny way of making you get outside yourself. \nJosh looks past Todd-- \nJOSH'S POV Gwen is still chatting with Sarah.  Gwen makes eye contact with Josh and sends him a warm smile. \nCUT TO \nINT. JOSH'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT \nJosh and Gwen drive home in silence.  Gwen notices something out the window. \nGWEN You missed the on-ramp. \nJOSH I know. \nGWEN Why? \nJOSH Somewhere we need to go first. \nCUT TO \nEXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe Mercedes pulls up to the \"Happiness Chinese Restaurant.\" Josh and Gwen get out and take in the sight-- \nGWEN We don't have to do this tonight. \nJOSH Yes, we do. \nShe peers in the window. \nGWEN We can't go in here.  Everything's different. \nHe opens the door for her. \nJOSH That's okay.  We're different, too. \nCUT TO \nINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nShe glances across the street.  A shop window sign reads, \"Bail Bonds.\" \nGWEN My name is Gail.  Gail Bonds. \nJOSH Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may I take you to my car and ravish you? \nGWEN Hmm.  On one condition. \nJOSH What's that? \nGWEN That you tell me your name. \nJOSH Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire. \nShe laughs. \nINT. JOSH'S CAR -- NIGHT \nThey get into the back seat and begin to kiss. \nGWEN Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires?  That all the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size? \nJOSH People are jealous. \nGWEN I can imagine.  It must be so lonely at the top. \nHe reaches between her knees. \nGWEN What are you doing? \nJOSH What do you think I'm doing? \n(beat) \nThe fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success...in bed. \nGWEN We're not in a bed. \nJOSH You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally. \nJosh swings Gwen onto his lap.  They go at each other like...a couple of college kids. \nCLOSE ON JOSH As he makes love to his wife, he thinks-- \nJOSH ...Can anyone see us?...Is anyone looking?...Why should it bother you?  You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you don't know... \nHe puts his mind to it-- \nFADE OUT: FADE IN: \nINT. GWEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nGwen and her mother JOANNE are in the living room looking at samples of fabric.  At sixty, Joanne is robust and shrewd. \nGWEN Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think of...the vibrant colors of Haiti. \nJOANNE Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind me of that trip. \n(beat) \nAnyway, quit changing the subject. \nGwen puts down the swatches. \nGWEN Alright.  I didn't say anything. \nJOANNE Because you're not sure? \nGWEN No, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's sleeping with her. \n(beat) \nAnd I may have to kill him. \nJOANNE Hmm. \nGWEN What?  You think I should just forget about it? \nJOANNE Yes, I do. \nGWEN Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage? \nJOANNE It depends.  It can be quite detrimental. \nGwen begins to pace in exasperation. \nJOANNE Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late 30s.  Lonely. \nGWEN No, you don't understand. \nDESK CLERK Yes.

I was just about to take my break. \nCUT TO \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nThe Desk Clerk and Gwen ride in the elevator.  Silently.  There is no discernible connection between them. \nCUT TO \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Desk Clerk leads Gwen to the room.  It couldn't look more business-like. \nCUT TO \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nThey enter.  He locks the door.  She surveys the room. \nDESK CLERK Something from the mini-bar? \nGWEN No. \nDESK CLERK How's the air conditioning? \nGWEN Fine. \nDESK CLERK Shall I pull down the covers? \nGWEN I suppose. \nDESK CLERK Do you want to know my name? \nGWEN No. \nHe takes her in his arms. \nDESK CLERK You're shaking. \nGWEN I'll be fine. \n(beat) \nThis could get you in trouble.  You could lose your job, right? \nDESK CLERK I don't care. \nGWEN You don't even know me. \nDESK CLERK You're right. \nGWEN We have nothing in common. \nBeat. \nDESK CLERK That's where you're wrong. \nHe begins to unbutton her blouse.

A maid vacuums the carpet as the Desk Clerk emerges, followed by Gwen.  They cross to the elevator, as business-like as before. \nDESK CLERK (to the Maid) \nINT. EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - DAY \nDavid hangs his uniform shirt in his locker.  He gathers his personal things.  A jacket, a knapsack, and...a violin case. \nThe HOTEL MANAGER approaches. \nHOTEL MANAGER Yo, fiddler on the roof. \nDavid reacts -- this is the last person he wants to deal with. \nHOTEL MANAGER (regards the violin) \nWish I could play an instrument.  Chicks really dig that stuff. Tried the guitar in high school.  What can I say?  No discipline. \nDAVID Discipline.  Always a struggle. \nHOTEL MANAGER I hear you.  For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock... \n(shrugs) \n...you shouldn't fuck the guests. \nDavid was not expecting this. \nHOTEL MANAGER (cont'd) \nYou want to bring your girlfriend here on your day off?  That's a different story.  I'll even give you the corporate rate on a room. \n(beat) \nJust don't do it while you're on the clock.  You hear me? \nDAVID It won't happen again. \nHOTEL MANAGER Good. \nDavid marches away. \nCUT TO \nINT. MUSIC CONSERVATORY - DAY \nIn a sun-lit practice room, a string quartet rehearses.  Four men -- David included, perform an energetic movement from a Beethoven quartet. \nNOTE: Throughout the film, we've heard this string quartet as underscore.  Now...we meet the soundtrack. \nDavid plays with emotion and a physicality we haven't seen in him -- truly, this is where he lives. \nCUT TO \nINT. CONSERVATORY HALLWAY - DAY \nAfter the rehearsal.  Violin at his side, David trudges through the exit.  Music emanates from every room.  He turns a corner, runs smack into-- \nROSALIE. She's been waiting. \nDAVID Jesus! \nShe simply picks up where they left off-- \nROSALIE I want you to be there on Sunday. \nDAVID No. \nROSALIE You told me we'd always be friends. \nDAVID I lied. \nROSALIE You're an important part of my life, David.  There's so much history between us.  I don't want to trash it simply because-- \nDAVID Because what?  Because you're getting married? \nBeat. \nDAVID Rosie, I want you to be happy.  I do.  And someday, we'll be friends.  Someday, we'll all go out to dinner.  The four of us. \nROSALIE The four of us? \nDAVID Sure.  Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you I can dig up to be my date. \nROSALIE Stop it. \nBut he's on a roll-- \nDAVID And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and I'll protest, but not too much.  Then, you'll give me a kiss on the cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long. And we'll say, \"It was great to see you.\"  And it will be great to see you... \n(beat) \nRosalie gives him a kiss. \nCUT TO \nINT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAmidst a clutter of unpaid bills, take-out cartons, and laundry, David practices the violin.  He plays a Bach Partita -- not for the easily intimidated. \nThe phone rings.  He lets it ring a while before picking up. \nDAVID (into phone) \nWhat do you want, Rose? \nROSALIE Were you sleeping? \nDAVID Yes.  I was. \nROSALIE Liar.  You're practicing.  I can hear you. \nHe moves to the window. \nDAVID'S POV Rosalie -- on her cell -- waves to him from the sidewalk, three stories below. \nROSALIE It's so sad.  Why do you always play sad songs? \nDAVID I don't write 'em, Rose. \n(beat) \nIs our conversation over now? \nROSALIE Please let me in. \nDAVID No. \nShe laughs mischievously. \nROSALIE You don't trust me? \nDAVID No. \n(beat) \nStay there.  I'll be right...Wait a minute.  This is insane. I'm not coming down.  Go home, Rose.  I mean it. \nROSALIE I'm going to wait here for one minute.  Sixty seconds. \nDAVID You do that. \nROSALIE Then, I'm gone.  You won't see me again. \nShe hangs up.  He hangs up. \nDAVID'S POV Rosalie sits on the front steps.  Stubborn. \nDAVID (to himself) \nBe my guest.  Sit there all night. \nDavid turns from the window.  He accidentally knocks his metronome to the floor, setting it off.  Click...click...click... \nDavid shuts it off, goes to the door. \nHis hand on the knob-- \nDAVID If I go down those stairs...it will only lead to one place...right back here...the two of us...a short, brilliant moment...one more to add to the gallery...then, empty-handed again, with nothing to show for it but an emotional hangover...I'm not going to open this door... Discipline... Like the man said, don't fuck the guests... \nCUT TO \nEXT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRosalie is on the front steps.  She smiles as she hears the door open -- it's David. \nHe joins her. \nDAVID I've got nothing to say to you. \nROSALIE Fine.  I'll talk... \nA beat. \nROSALIE The reason I won't just leave you alone is not because I'm \"confused.\" My feelings are perfectly clear.  I know you find it incomprehensible that I can love Jerry and love you.  And that one love has nothing to do with the other.  But it's true. \nDAVID Rose... \nROSALIE What? \nCUT TO \nINT. ROSALIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAfter midnight.  Rosalie slips inside the door.  No sign of Jerry. She removes her shoes and tiptoes into-- \nINT. ROSALIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe television is on -- the sound is muted.  An infomercial is playing.  Jerry is sleeping. \nON ROSALIE She nudges him.  He doesn't stir.  Rosalie sits at the foot of the bed.  She grabs the remote and \"un-mutes\" the sound. \nINT.

Slowly, he wakes. \nJERRY Hey... \nROSALIE Hey... \nJERRY What time is it? \nROSALIE Late. \nHe looks at the time. \nJERRY It is late.  What happened? \nROSALIE Oh.  The girls.  Wedding talk.  We could've gone on all night. \nShe rubs his chest. \nROSALIE Jerry... \nJERRY What? \nROSALIE We need to make love now. \nJERRY Okay...why now? \nROSALIE I can't explain it.  We just need to make love now. \nHe nods.  He kisses her neck, her breasts. \nSuddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands. \nJERRY What's the matter? \nROSALIE I just need to fix this moment in my mind. \nA long beat.  She studies his face. \nROSALIE I love you.  Totally.  Completely.  I don't want to spend another minute of my life without you. \n(off his reaction) \nYou don't have to say anything. \nShe climbs on top of him. \nJERRY You're forgetting something. \nROSALIE No, I'm not. \nHe laughs uncomfortably. \nJERRY Don't you think... \nROSALIE No, I don't.  Let's not use it tonight. \n(beat) \nI'm ready. \nA beat. \nJERRY If you're ready, so am I. \nShe straddles him, rocking back and forth.  With grim determination. \nJerRY \nRight. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOBACCO SHOP - DAY \nJerry accompanies his FATHER -- late 50s, on a cigar-buying expedition. Tobacco enthusiasts relax in leather chairs.  Wafts of smoke hang in the air -- expensive smoke. \nJerry's Father finds a brand he likes. \nFATHER Here we are.  Bahia Gold.  Two hundred a box. \nJERRY You don't have to do this, Dad. \nFATHER If I can't come to the bachelor party, I want to be there in spirit. \n(beat) \nThe boys will like these.  Classic. \nJERRY Thank-you. \nFATHER I remember my bachelor night.  Frankly, I wish I didn't.  Not a night I'm particularly proud of...I'll leave it at that. \nJERRY Why are you sharing this? \nFATHER Reminiscing.  That's all. \nJERRY Or warning me. \nFATHER Nonsense.  I know you.  You won't make an ass out of yourself. \n(beat) \nOh...A little something from your mother and me. \nHe reaches into his pocket, hands Jerry a key. \nJERRY What's this? \nFATHER It's a key. \n(smiles) \nThere's a new housing development, just west of here.  I've been giving the developer a lot of breaks, and...now he's giving me one in return.  I'm almost embarrassed to say how little this cost me. \nJERRY I can't accept this. \nFATHER Yes, you can. \n(beat) \nC'mon.  Make your old man happy. \nJerry says nothing. \nFATHER Uh-huh.  I get it.  This is Rosalie's domain.  She should have a say in where you two settle down.  But don't worry, you won't be forcing her hand.  Know why?  Because she's going to love it. \nJerry just nods. \nFATHER Let's ring these babies up. \nCUT TO \nINT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nBachelor party in progress.  In the living room, a dozen guys smoke Cuban-rolled cigars, drink shots of Tequila, and watch a Stripper perform. \nThe least boisterous of the group is Jerry, who watches the action with a drunken glow. \nThe party's host, Jerry's BEST FRIEND, enters and summons Jerry into-- \nINT.

Wait... \nBut Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral. \nCUT TO \nINT. CATHEDRAL VESTIBULE - DAY \nLorna and Terri enter.  The vestibule looks empty.  Suddenly, they are startled by a FLASH. \nThey turn to find a photographer checking a bulb -- it's Todd. \nTERRI Lorna, we shouldn't be here. \nHearing her name Todd looks up.  Then, he gathers his gear and starts inside. \nBut Lorna intercepts him. \nLORNA Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in... \n(beat) \nHey, I know you.  The wedding guy. \nTODD I'm sorry. Have we met? \nLORNA Yeah.  You don't remember me? \nTODD You must be thinking of somebody else. \nLorna reacts.  Stops herself. \nLORNA Right.

Sorry. \nTODD Excuse me... \nAnd he disappears into the church. \nTERRI What was that all about? \nLORNA Nothing. \nTERRI Nothing, my ass. \nLORNA Alright, alright.  I slipped. \nTERRI Slipped?

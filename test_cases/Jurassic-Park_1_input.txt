GRANT What is it? 
LEX I hear something. 
GRANT Come on. 
Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another. 
LEX Hear it now? 
TIMMY You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta get back and warn them about the boat. 
Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw een Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it. 
HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry. 
TIMMY What's going on? 
GRANT They're agitated. 
The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the young ones to protect them. 
With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away straight toward the hadrosaurs. 
LEX I told you I heard something! 
The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids. 
GRANT Outta the way, kids! Run! 
Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like a football.  Timmy runs beside them. 
Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant hears the crashing of trees. He takes a glance over his shoulder. 
GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM. 
BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM - 
The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive presence affects all in the room. 
Arnold looks at his illuminated watch. 
ARNOLD Memory should be cleared by now. 
He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on. 
ARNOLD Damn. 
Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow. 
ELLIE What's wrong? 
ARNOLD Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches back on before I restart the power. 
Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers. Holding his breath, he turns on the main power switch. 
First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly. 
ARNOLD Thank God! 
The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone. 
ELLIE Arnold!  They're still not working. 
ARNOLD No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually. 
Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns. 
WU (to Hammond) Arnold's about to get the phones up. 
Arnold pushes the chair back. 
ARNOLD Okay, we're up again! 
Ellie grabs the phone back up. 
ELLIE No we're not.  Phones still dead. 
Arnold swings her way. 
ARNOLD Can't be - 
HAMMOND My God, look at this, Arnold. 
Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl. 
ELLIE What's happening? 
ARNOLD (tonelessly) The duckbills. 
WU My good God. 
ELLIE What? 
ARNOLD It's the Rex ...

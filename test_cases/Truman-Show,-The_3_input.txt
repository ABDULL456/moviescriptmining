EXT.  VACANT LOT.  DAY. 
TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud. 
He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags. Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn. 
EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  DAY. 
TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge. Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car approaching.  As it nears, we recognize a police car. 
Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in the search.  The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER looking straight into Truman's blackened face. 
POLICE OFFICER Any sign of him? 
TRUMAN (deliberately gravelling his voice) Not yet. 
The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.  After what seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on. 
POLICE OFFICER (to Truman, as the car pulls away) Take it easy. 
EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  DAY. 
We pan down one concrete canyon after another.  The usually bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted. 
Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street. Then another and another. 
PEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted at a crime scene.  The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS, HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.  On one occasion we glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst the searchers. 
A building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and shrubbery. 
We focus on one of the waves of searchers.  TRUMAN has linked arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up. 
A swarm of helicopters fills the sky. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. 
While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and ROMAN. 
MOSES (to Christof who is still studying the faces in a row of SEARCHERS) Rumors are circulating he's dead. 
ROMAN (pacing nervously) The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts. 
CHRISTOF (unconcerned, referring to the static "STAND BY" graphic, now accompanied by soothing classical music) Why?  We're getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series. 
INT.  BARROOM.  DAY. 
The television behind the bar carries the still graphic. BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks. Some place bets with each other over the outcome. 
EXT.  ELECTRONICS STORE.  DAY. 
A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY. 
The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the graphic on their televisions. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. 
The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to make another sweep. 
CHLOE (referring to the empty streets) When we flush him out how do we explain this? 
CHRISTOF (deadpan) We tell him the truth. 
Chloe looks askance at Christof. 
CHRISTOF (joking darkly) We're making a movie. 
SIMEON (hopeful) We'll get him on this next sweep. 
CHRISTOF What have we missed? 
SIMEON It's just a matter of time. 
CHRISTOF No.  We've missed something.

{"train": "PRETTY WOMAN \nFINAL SCRIPT \nby Jonathan Frederick Lawton \nFrom the original script written by J.F. Lawton, with the help of Stephen Metcalfe, Barbara Benedek, Robert Garland and probably Garry Marshall (the director of the film) himself. This original script itself was adapted from Lawton's first script called \u00abThree Thousand\u00bb, which was a much darker story about prostitution and drugs. \nBLACK SCREEN \nIn white letters on the black screen : \nTOUCHSTONE PICTURES \nPRESENTS \nAND THEN : \nIN ASSOCIATION WITH \nSILVER SCREEN PARTNERS IV \nWe hear voices over of people chattering and laughing. \nMAN (voice over) Broke in right on the two of them. Caught them. \nMAGICIAN (voice over) No matter what they say, it's all about money. \nFADE TO : \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY \nWe are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills. Apparently, a party is in progress. \nClose Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands. \nMAGICIAN (voice over) So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ? \nOn lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his hand and closes it. \nCredits appears in white capital letters on the screen. \nMAGICIAN (voice over) You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all four. Just take a look. \nHe opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's hand, which contains the four coins. \nWOMAN (voice over) Oh ! \nMAGICIAN (voice over) But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this one's only worth about a penny. \nHe takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny coin. \nEnd of the first set of credits. \nMAN (voice over) Hmm. \nMAGICIAN (voice over) And if you wonder where the other one went, watch. \nHis left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing penny out of it. \nPHILIP A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ? \nPhilip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his joke. Philip moves toward a young man. \nThe camera follows Philip. \nPHILIP Have you seen Edward ? \nTHE YOUNG MAN No, I haven't. Great party, Philip. \nPHILIP Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a caterer. \nHe walks to a group of guest gathered around a large buffet table. Behind the table, the balustrade of the patio, and in the background, Hollywood Hills. \nPHILIP Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you ? \nHOWARD Philip, good. Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse Industries. \nPHILIP Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan. \nHOWARD Can I get in on it ? \nPHILIP Yeah. Call me. \nHOWARD When ? \nPHILIP Just call me. \nHe turns to another guest and shake hands with him. \nPHILIP Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer. \nTHE GUEST Hey, where's the guest of honor anyway ? \nPHILIP Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner somewhere charming a very pretty lady. \nHe turns to a charming lady talking with a man. \nPHILIP How are you ? \nHe gives her a kiss. \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - STUDY - INTERIOR DAY \nVery modern design. An artistic picture of a nude girl on the wall. \nMedium shot of Edward Lewis standing near the desk, talking on the telephone. He is a very handsome man in his early forties. He is very elegantly dressed, apparently with a very expensive suit. \nEDWARD I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she call you ? \nJESSICA (voice over on the telephone) Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you. \nEDWARD I see. \nJESSICA (voice over on the telephone) I have my own life too, you know, Edward. \nEDWARD This is a very important week for me. I need you here. \nHe walks to the large bay window, overlooking Hollywood Hills. \nJESSICA (voice over on the telephone) But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at your beck and call. \nEDWARD I do not believe that you are at my beck and call. \nJESSICA (voice over on the telephone) Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I should just move out. \nEDWARD If that's what you want, yes. \nJESSICA (voice over on the telephone) All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it. \nEDWARD Now is as good a time as any. \nJESSICA (voice over on the telephone) That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye. \nShe hangs up. \nEDWARD Good-bye, Jessica. \nEdward looks down, through the bay window, to the party still going on on the patio on the floor below. We can hear the chatter from the party. \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - STAIRWAY - INTERIOR DAY \nEdward is going down the stairs followed by a young blonde man, wearing a very elegant suit. \nYOUNG MAN Phil suggested that maybe I should take a lawy... \nEDWARD Phil is just my lawyer, okay ? \nYOUNG MAN Yes, sir. \nEDWARD How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei ? \nYOUNG MAN I don't know. \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nThey have reached the downstairs hall. Edward looks at his watch and then turns toward the young man. He is looking slightly angry. \nEDWARD You don't know ? Tokyo opened maybe ninety minutes ago. You have to keep on top of these things, all right ? \nYOUNG MAN Done. \nAerial shot of the car coming to a dead end in a parking lot. \nEDWARD (voice over) Oh, shit. \nThe car backs up. \nHOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nAerial overview of Hollywood. \nThe last set of credits starts in white capital letters on this overview. \nThe music keeps on playing. \nLYRICS We were never carved in stone. If I don't listen to the talk of the town. Then maybe I can fool myself. I'll get over you I know I will. I'll pretend my ship's not sinking. And I'll tell myself I'm over you. \nThe overview now shows Hollywood Boulevard. \nLYRICS 'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking. \nHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT Full shot on street level on Hollywood Boulevard. \nThe credits are still appearing and disappearing on the screen. \nA man is selling maps, advertised by a huge board he is carrying, and on which is written in red letters : \u00abMaps of the Stars Homes\u00bb. \nTHE MAP VENDOR Maps here. Maps. \nClose Up on two hands exchanging money and drug. Then Close Up on the faces of the two men. \nTHE DRUG DEALER (voice over) Have a good one. \nMedium shot of two prostitutes cruising on the sidewalk. A car drives along the sidewalk, but doesn't stop. \nMAN IN CAR (voice over) What do you say, blondie ? \nONE OF THE PROSTITUTE Hi, honey, want some fun ? \nClose Up on the \u00abCarole Lombard\u00bb Star on the Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk. \nMedium shot on two other prostitutes cruising on the sidewalk. \nONE OF THE PROSTITUTE Hey, baby, you looking for a date ? \nLarger shot on a car stopping near the prostitute \nMAN IN CAR Yeah, honey, we're looking. \nPROSTITUTE Well, here I am. \nMAN IN CAR I'm Al and this is my friend Joe. Get in the car. \nAnother very short view of Hollywood Boulevard, showing a Close shot on a Chinese Restaurant. An then, a very fast horizontal panning of the camera, which gives us a blurred picture. The panning stops in : \nSIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium long shot on a very quiet side street near Hollywood Boulevard. The street seems even much quieter after all the noise and the hustle we've seen on the Boulevard itself. \nThe credits are still appearing and disappearing on the screen. \nAn ambulance is driving very fast along the street, with its siren wailing. On the side of the ambulance is written : \u00abLos Angeles Fire Department\u00bb, and below : \u00abParamedic\u00bb. \nThe camera lets the ambulance go and moves to show us a shady- looking building with a vertical neon sign saying \u00abHOTEL\u00bb, but only the \u00abH\u00bb and the \u00abO\u00bb are lit, the others letters being out of order. \nThe music fades out. \nThis building actually is partly a regular hotel, and partly a place that rents small apartments on a monthly basis. \nVIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nWe are in the small apartment rented by Vivian Ward and Kit De Luca, two young prostitutes, whom we are going to know better later on. \nClose Up on a pretty woman buttocks, just covered by a very small black lace panty. \nAn alarm clock is ringing. The woman turns around, and shows us her stomach and her navel, showing from under a pink T-shirt. \nThe camera pans up to the woman's arm and hand stopping the alarm- clock. \nClose-Up on several familial pictures pinned on the wall. \nClose-Up on the woman putting on a white sleeveless close-fitting T-shirt over her black lace bra. But we don't see the woman's head. \nClose-Up on the woman's hand picking up cheap jewels from a table, and putting them on. On the table there is also an empty bottle of a strong alcoholic beverage. \nLOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose Up on Edward's face, driving the car. He seems a bit lost. \nHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium long shot on the Lotus driving on Hollywood Boulevard. \nWe hear the song \u00abReal Wild Child\u00bb, performed by Christopher Otcasek. \nCredits keeps on appearing and disappearing on the screen. \nLYRICS Well, I'm just goin' to school like I'm real, real cool. Gotta dance like a fool Got the message. \nVIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-Up on a black stiletto-heel boot. The woman's hand is using a black felt-pen to hide the clear spots on the heel of the boot. \nLYRICS And I gotta be a wild one Ooh, yeah. I'm a wild one. \nClose-Up on the woman's hand pulling the zipper up along the side of the boot. \nLYRICS Gonna break it loose. Gonna keep on moving wild. \nClose-Up on the face of the woman, putting mascara on her eyelashes. The woman is named Vivian Ward, and her head is covered by a blonde wig. \nLYRICS Gonna keep on swinging, baby I'm a real wild child. \nHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe Lotus is driving through a crossroad. The tires screech, and the car swings a little. Apparently, Edward is still having problems with his gear shift. The camera follows the car for a couple of seconds. \nVIVIAN'S HOTEL STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose Up on Vivian's legs going down the stairway. Then the camera moves backward and we see her in full. Another woman is going up the stairs. \nHOTEL MANAGER (voice over) Now, wait a minute. You don't seem to understand me. \nVivian stop in mid-stairs. \nHOTEL MANAGER (voice over) That's my job. At the end of the month, I collect everybody's rent. \nQuick shot, through the bannister, of the manager talking to an Afro-American woman. \nBack to Vivian still standing on the stairs. \nHOTEL MANAGER (voice over) Now give me the money, or you're outta here. \nVivian goes back up the stairs. \nVIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose-Up on the toilet water tank, and Vivian's hands taking the lid off. She then takes a green plastic box out of the water. She opens the box and looks at the money hidden inside the box. There is only one one-dollar bill left. \nLYRICS Gonna meet all my friends. Gonna have myself a ball. Gonna tell my friends. Gonna tell them all. \nVIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nVivian crosses the room. \nLYRICS That I'm a wild one. Ooh, yeah I'm a wild one. \nVivian opens a window and gets out of the room. \nVIVIAN'S HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nHigh angle shot of Vivian going out of the window and on the emergency exit. \nLYRICS Gonna break the news. Gonna keep on moving wild. Gonna keep on swinging, baby. I'm a real wild child. \nVivian starts going down the emergency stairway. \nSIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT A dark street around Hollywood. The Lotus is driving slowly. The engine is revving, as the car turns around the corner of the street. \nLOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nEdward looks around him, visibly a bit anxious : he know he is completely lost. \nThe music fades out. \nTHE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nVivian and Kit are walking down the staircase. \nVIVIAN You took it while I was sleeping ? \nKIT You were unavailable for consultation. \nKit walks to the bar, and makes Vivian follow her. \nKIT Hey, let's go. Snack ! Snack ! She has reached the bar and starts picking bits of food in plates on the counter. \nKIT Besides, it's my apartment. \nVIVIAN Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit. \nKIT Look, you came here. I gave you some money. I gave you a place to stay... \nClose Up on Kit's hands picking food (olives, onions, cherries...) in the snack plates, and putting them on a paper napkin. \nKIT ...and some valuable vocational advice. He was on my case. I had to give him something. \nBack to the two girls behind the bar. \nKIT So don't irritate me. \nPOPS This ain't a buffet, Kit. \nKit moves around Vivian, sits on a stool at the bar, and starts eating. \nVIVIAN Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster. \nShe sits down on another stool. \nKIT I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a... a flake. She was a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for months. \nWe hear people shouting in the background and glass being broken. The two girls turns their heads around for a second and then come back to their conversation at the bar. \nWOMAN (voice over) Leave her alone ! \nMAN (voice over) Leave her alone ! \nWOMAN (voice over) Come on, Blake ! \nVIVIAN Don't you want to get out of here ? \nKIT Get out of where ? Where the fuck you wanna go ? \nSIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nA very quiet street. \nClose shot on a tramp looking though some junks left over on the sidewalk, in front of a house. \nTHE TRAMP Aah, nothing but garbage. \nFull shot on the street, seen from the other side of the street. The Lotus Esprit stops at the tramp's level. \nEDWARD (voice over) Uh, excuse me. \nThe tramp lifts his head. \nTHE TRAMP Huh ? \nEDWARD (voice over) Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills ? \nTHE TRAMP You're here ! \nClose Up shot on Edward's face behind the wheel on his car. \nTHE TRAMP (voice over) That's Sylvester Stallone's house right there. \nHe snickers. \nBack to the full shot of the street with the Lotus and the tramp behind it. EDWARD (voice over) Thank you. \nTHE TRAMP You're welcome. \nThe car moves away. \nHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium full shot on Vivian and Kit standing near a table on which a man is selling some souvenirs. Another prostitute is leaning on a tree. Kit walks toward the prostitute. \nKIT Hey, yo, Rachel. \nRACHEL What ? \nKIT Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe ? She is mentioning the stars of the Walk of Fame, embedded in the sidewalk of the boulevard. \nRACHEL Yeah. \nKIT Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz Brothers, we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to Ella Fitzgerald. This is our turf. We got seniority. You better get off our corner. \nRACHEL Forgive me. I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. \nKIT Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson. \nRACHEL Williams. \nKIT Esther Williams ! Where you belong ! \nRACHEL Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch. \nShe walks away on the boulevard. Kit turns toward Vivian. \nKIT Am I really a grouch ? \nVIVIAN Yes. Sometimes. \nKIT Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat. \nWe hear someone whistling, and then : \nMAN (voice over) Hey, girls. \nKit turns toward the boulevard, where the voice is coming from. \nKIT Hey, yo, baby ! \nMedium shot on an open convertible red car driving along the boulevard. In the car, three young men, two in the front, one in the back. The man sitting next to the driver, yells to the girls. \nMAN IN THE CAR How about a freebie ? It's my birthday. \nThe car keeps on moving on the boulevard and out of view. Back on Vivian and Kit. \nKIT Dream on ! \nVIVIAN It's looking really slow tonight. \nShe takes her cap off. \nKIT Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you. \nVIVIAN And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No. \nKIT You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much. \nVIVIAN Do you think I look like Carol Channing ? \nKit puts her hands on Vivian's blonde wig. \nKIT No ! I love this look. It's very glamorous. Glamour choice. \nWe hear brakes screeching. Kit turns around toward the noise. \nKIT Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this ! \nFull shot on the boulevard. The Lotus is driving along the boulevard. The car bounces a little, while the gears are grinding. \nBack to the two girls watching the car. Vivian points to it. \nVIVIAN Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit. \nWe see the car passing in front of the girls. Apparently, it has stopped a little further on the boulevard, because we hear its brakes screeching. \nReverse angle shot showing the two girls with the stopped car behind them. \nKIT No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot tonight. Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through. Take care of you. \nClose Up on Edward's hand trying to change gears. It doesn't really succeed, and we hear a grinding noise. \nHOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBack on the shot through the windshield. \nEDWARD You know about cars. Where did that come from ? \nVIVIAN Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs, Corvettes. \nEDWARD Ah. \nLOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nVIVIAN They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention. So how is it you know so little about cars ? \nEDWARD My first car was a limousine. \nVIVIAN Oh. \nEDWARD So where is this... \nHe tries to shift gears and gets another grinding noise. \nEDWARD ...heavy metal... home ? \nVIVIAN Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is a standard \u00abH\u00bb. \nEDWARD Standard \u00abH\u00bb. Like I know what that means. \nShe laughs. \nEDWARD Have you ever driven a Lotus ? \nVIVIAN No. \nEDWARD You're gonna start right now. \nHOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nBack on the shot through the windshield. \nVIVIAN You're joking. \nEDWARD No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat. \nMedium shot on a lingerie shop. \nWe see Vivian's head, and then the camera follows her as she climbs into the driver's seat. Edward closes his door on the passenger's side. Vivian closes her door and puts her seat belt on. \nVIVIAN Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready ? \nEDWARD I am ready. \nVIVIAN Hang on. \nEDWARD Okay. \nVIVIAN Here we go. \nShe adjusts the back-view mirror. \nMedium close-up shot of the car seen from the back with the camera set on the road. The car starts very fast, but also very smoothly : it is now driven by very expert hands. \nSeveral shots of the car racing along the streets. \nShot of the the couple through the windshield. \nVIVIAN This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size nine. \nLOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nVIVIAN You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ? \nShe shows her arm to Edward, who chuckles. \nVIVIAN Did you know that ? \nEDWARD No, I didn't know that. \nVIVIAN It's a little bit of trivia. \nEdward looks at her and smiles. \nHOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nShot of the couple seen through the windshield. \nEDWARD Tell me, what kind of... what kind of money you girls make these days ? Ballpark. \nVIVIAN Can't take less than a hundred dollars. \nEDWARD A hundred dollars a night ? \nVIVIAN For an hour. \nEDWARD An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking. \nLOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT \nVIVIAN I never joke about money. \nEDWARD Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff. \nShe puts her right hand on Edward's zipper. \nVIVIAN Well, no. But it's got potential. \nEdward doesn't react, but he looks at her in such a way that she feels she has better take her hand off his zipper. \nBERVERLY HILLS - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nSeveral shots of the car driving fast in Beverly Hills. \nREGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nThe tires of the car squeal as it makes a last fast turn to stop in front of the hotel. \nFull shot. The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is a very luxurious hotel, certainly one of the most expensive hotel of the Los Angeles area. Medium shot on a uniformed attendant, who is standing near the entrance of the hotel, and rushes to Edward's car. \nMedium full shot on the Lotus parked in front of the hotel. The attendant opens the passenger's door of the car, while Vivian comes out of the car on her own. \nHOTEL ATTENDANT Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car anymore tonight ? \nEDWARD (LAUGHING) I... I hope not ! \nHe gets out of the car. The attendant closes the door and then moves away, while Vivian joins Edward on the sidewalk. \nVIVIAN Ah. You're here. \nEDWARD Yeah. He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again. \nEDWARD So you'll be all right ? \nVIVIAN Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks. \nEDWARD Go back to your office. \nShe laughs. \nVIVIAN Yeah. My office. Yeah. \nEDWARD Well, thanks for the ride. \nVIVIAN See you. \nEDWARD Good-bye. \nEdward starts turning around to go inside the hotel, but doesn't do it, and instead looks back in Vivian's direction. \nMedium shot on Vivian seated on the backrest of a public bench, with her feet resting on the bench itself. She puts her cap back on. \nEDWARD (voice over) No taxis ? \nVIVIAN No, I like the bus. Edward walks to the bench on which Vivian is sitting. \nQuick medium shot on the uniformed attendant watching the scene with curiosity from the entrance of the hotel. \nBack to Vivian and Edward. \nEDWARD I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an hour ? \nVIVIAN No ? \nEDWARD I hadn't exactly planned this. \nVIVIAN Well, do you plan everything ? \nShe takes her red jacket off. \nEDWARD Always. \nVIVIAN Yeah. Me too. She sits down on an armchair. \nVIVIAN I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of \u00abfly by the seat of my pants\u00bb girl. You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's... Yeah. \nEdward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done something very wise in bringing Vivian with him. \nVIVIAN Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe break the ice. \nEDWARD Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable. \nHe takes his wallet out of this jacket. \nVIVIAN Cash works for me, yeah. \nShe stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money in one of her high boots. \nEDWARD You're on my fax. \nVIVIAN Well, that's one I haven't been on before. \nShe doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way. Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's suggestive movements. \nEDWARD Cute. Very cute. Thank you. \nShe laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper. \nVIVIAN All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you say ? Hmm ? \nEDWARD A buffet of safety. \nVIVIAN I'm a safety girl. \nEdward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his zipper. \nVIVIAN All right, let's get one of these on you. \nEDWARD No, no. I... \nHe laughs awkwardly. \nEDWARD Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ? \nHe takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk chair. \nVIVIAN Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure ? \nEDWARD Business, I think. \nHe walks away from the desk across the room. \nVIVIAN Business, you think. \nShe zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the room. \nVIVIAN Well... let me guess. \nEdward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair. \nVIVIAN That would make you... a lawyer. \nShe sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair. \nEDWARD A lawyer ? \nVIVIAN Mm-hmm. \nEDWARD What makes you think I'm a lawyer ? \nVIVIAN You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you. \nEDWARD I bet you've known a lot of lawyers. \nVIVIAN I've known a lot of everybody. \nThe doorbell chimes. They both stand up. \nVIVIAN What is that ? \nHe turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and seems a little disturbed by it. \nEDWARD Champagne. \nVIVIAN Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load off. \nThe doorbell chimes again. \nVivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian closes the door behind him. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT Good evening. \nVIVIAN Hi. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT Uh, where would you like it ? \nVIVIAN Where would we like it ? \nEdward has seated himself back in the armchair. \nEDWARD Uh, over by the bar. \nThe attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but, being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice, and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down, he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing behind him. \nVIVIAN Excuse me ! \nShe giggles. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nThe attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian, staring at her. \nVIVIAN What are you looking at ? \nThe attendant clears his throat. \nVIVIAN What is he looking at ? \nEdward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money. \nEDWARD Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night. \nThe attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar. \nVIVIAN A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh. (in a much softer voice) Stupid. \nEDWARD Don't worry about it. Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar. \nVIVIAN You mind if I take my boots off ? \nShe sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it in two slightly different levels. \nEDWARD Not at all. \nVIVIAN So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ? \nShe zips one of her boots down. \nEDWARD I have both. \nVIVIAN Where are they ? Shopping together ? \nShe takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle cork popping off. \nEDWARD My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home... with my ex-dog. \nHe brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the floor besides her. Vivian is taking her other boot off. \nEDWARD There you go. \nVIVIAN (voice over) You know, I never saw this episode. \nEdward chuckles. And then he stands up. \nVivian is still lying on the floor, laughing. Edward sits down on the sofa next to her. \nShot on the TV screen, where Lucy is stomping the grapes, with a disgusted face. We hear Vivian laughing very loudly. \nClose Up on Vivian's face laughing and holding the glass of Champagne. She looks up at Edward, still seated on the sofa. \nClose shot on Edward looking at Vivian \nClose Up shot on Vivian's face. She has a strange smile on her face. \nClose Up shot on Edward's face looking at Vivian. \nBack to Vivian. We hear the recorded laughs coming from the TV set. Vivian stands up on her arms and knees and walks on all four toward the sofa. \nQuick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and the other woman are stomping the grapes. \nHigh angle shot on Vivian on her knees near the sofa. She puts a hand up inside Edward's pants leg. Edward snorts. \nOn the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes stomping. \nStill resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it. \nOn the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the grapes, but the sound shuts off. \nBack to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig. Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are now dancing on the grapes. \nBack to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it. \nClose Up on their two faces, very close to each other. \nVIVIAN What do you want ? \nEDWARD What do you do ? \nVIVIAN Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth. \nEDWARD Neither do I. \nShe bends on his chest and starts kissing him on the chest, going down. She stops to look at the TV. \nOn the TV screen, the Italian lady is throwing grapes in Lucy's face. \nBack to Vivian, who smiles and resumes her kissing job on Edward's chest. \nClose Up shot on Edward's face : he is inhaling very strongly. \nPENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nEdward is in the shower, hot water pouring on his head.

He bends on the armchair, and picks up one of Vivian's bracelet. The camera pans away from the armchair, showing Vivian's clothes and stuff scattered around, including her blonde wig. \nEdward looks at Vivian's things, then turns his head around toward the bed. He looks at the bed for a couple of seconds without moving, then starts walking toward the bed. \nReverse angle shot, showing Vivian asleep on her stomach in the bed, her long red hair scattered around her head. \nEdward walks away from the bed. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Medium full shot in the dark room.

Edward enters the room, wearing a dark-colored night-robe, and with a wireless telephone receiver stuck between his head and his shoulder. \nEDWARD Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected. He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery. \nEdward signs the bill the waiter has shown to him. \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot of Philip sitting behind the breakfast table.

Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him. \nA middle-aged maid walks behind him with a glass jar of coffee, fresh from the percolator. She wants to pour some coffee in Philip's cup, but, with his free hand, he moves her away. \nPHILIP Definitely not alone. \n(HE CHUCKLES) You know ? He's a feisty old guy. You know, we say the wrong thing... (He snaps his fingers) ...we could wind up in court. \nThe maid walks out of the room. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nEDWARD Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong. \nThe waiter leaves the room, and Vivian walks in from the bedroom, wearing a white bathrobe. \nEDWARD That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car. \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nSuddenly, Philip has a worried look on his face. \nPHILIP Oh, God. What ? \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nVivian stops in the middle of the room, behind Edward's back. \nVIVIAN I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I go ? \nEDWARD Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end. He goes out of the bathroom, followed, a couple of seconds later, by Vivian. \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nThe breakfast has been cleared away. Philip's expensive leather attach\u00e9-case is lying on the table, supporting a big agenda. Philip is on the phone. \nEDWARD (voice over on the phone) Hello ? \nPHILIP Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door. \nPENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot.

VIVIAN (singing in voice over) Uh-oh ! \nEdward walks out of the bedroom, carrying the telephone set. \nPHILIP (voice over on the phone) You know ?

PHILIP (voice over on the phone) Edward ? Did you hear me ? \nEDWARD Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here. \nHe walks to the bathtub, where Vivian is immersed in a foam-bath. She has earphones on her ears, and she is singing with her eyes closed. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) If you want to impress me... \nPHILIP (voice over on the phone) What is that ? \nEdward is standing near the bathtub, but Vivian, because of the loud music in her earphones and her closed eyes, doesn't seem to notice him. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) Oh-oh-oh... \nEDWARD Housekeeping is singing. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) Got to be too flirty, Mama... \nPHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nPhilip seems a bit surprised by what he hears over the telephone. \nVIVIAN (singing in voice over in the phone) I know how to undress me... \nPhilip tries to concentrate on what he is saying to Edward. \nPHILIP Yeah... listen. \nPENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nEdward is still standing near the bathtub with the telephone to his ear. \nPHILIP (voice over on the phone) Edward, I know a lot of nice girls. \nEdward snorts. \nEDWARD No, you don't. \nMedium shot on the bathtub, where Vivian is still singing with her eyes closed. We see the yellow walkman lying on the bathtub edge near her head. She is holding the water faucet with one hand. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) I just want your extra time and your... She makes loud kisses with her mouth. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) Kiss... \nBack to Edward standing near the bathtub. \nEDWARD Besides, I already have one. \nVIVIAN (singing in voice over) If you want to impress me... \nEdward starts walking around the bathtub to get closer to Vivian's head. \nEDWARD You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) Uh-uh, you can't be too flirty, mama. \nEDWARD I'm on my way. \nHigh angle close-up shot on Vivian's head. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) I know how to undress me Mm-hmm... \nSlight low angle shot of Edward. He has put the telephone set down somewhere, and he is looking at Vivian, smiling. \nVIVIAN (singing in voice over) Yeah, baby... \nHe sits down on the bathtub edge. VIVIAN (singing in voice over) I want to be your fantasy. Well, maybe you could be mine. \nBack to Vivian singing in the bathtub. \nVIVIAN (SINGING) Mm-hmm You just leave it. All up to me. \nShe opens her eyes and notices Edward sitting on the edge of the bathtub close to her. She laughs. \nEdward also laughs looking at her. \nVivian takes off her earphones, and puts them on the edge with the Walkman. \nVIVIAN Don't you just love Prince ? \nEDWARD More than life itself. \nVIVIAN Don't you knock ? \nEDWARD Vivian, I have a business proposition for you. \nVIVIAN What do you want ? \nEDWARD I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend the week with me. \nVivian smiles, not believing what she just heard. \nVIVIAN Really ? \nEDWARD Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you consider spending the week with me ? \nShe laughs awkwardly. \nEDWARD I will pay you to be at my beck and call. \nVIVIAN Look, I'd love to be your \u00abbeck and call girl\u00bb, but, uh, you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million girls free. \nEDWARD I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles this week. \nVIVIAN If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost you. \nVIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY Kit enters the kitchen and puts her soda cup on the table. The room is a mess. Dirty dishes in the sink. Table covered with food and junk. Clothes hanging to dry in the shower cubicle. \nKIT Three thousand. Really ?

And, Kit ? \nShe sits on the bed. \nVIVIAN I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you.

Near the reception desk, the hotel manager, Barnard \u00abBarney\u00bb Thompson is talking with an Italian male guest and an older lady seated in a wheelchair. The Italian guest is showing a business card to Barney and talking in Italian. \nVivian crosses the lobby, dressed in the same prostitute outfit as the day before, but without her wig. She has her large handbag across her shoulder and her red jacket is tied around her waist. Barney gives her a quick look, but goes back to his conversation with the Italian guest. He takes the card the Italian is holding. \nBARNEY Ah ! \nMedium shot on the reception desk. Miss Wilson, a blonde bespectacled receptionist girl is behind the desk. \nVIVIAN Hi. \nMISS WILSON Yes, ma'am. May I help you ? \nVivian puts an envelope on the desk. \nVIVIAN Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up. \nThe receptionist takes the envelope and looks at it. \nVIVIAN Don't open that. \nMISS WILSON No, ma'am. \nBack on Barney and the Italian guests. \n[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] \nTHE ITALIAN GUEST Multo Grazie. Arrivederci. \nBARNEY Arrivederci. \nVivian walks near them, with the high heels of her boots clicking on the floor. The Italian starts pushing the wheelchair. Barney looks at Vivian. \nTHE ITALIAN GUEST Andiamo. \nReverse angle shot on the lobby. Vivian keeps on walking quite fast, and barely avoids bumping into an uniformed hotel attendant loaded with luggage. \nReverse angle shot on Barney still standing at the same place.

She is very neatly dressed and looks a bit snobbish. \nVivian enters the shop. The saleswoman seated on the sofa looks up at her. \nLYRICS Oh, wild women show what they're going through. \nA third saleswoman, wearing a black jacket and standing behind a counter, looks up at Vivian. The saleswoman, who is arranging the flowers, also looks at Vivian. \nLYRICS Oooh-whoo ! Ooh, yeah. \nVivian stops to look around and then walks to dresses hanging on a rail, and starts looking at them. \nLYRICS Wild women do what you think you'll never. \nBarney bends his head down, and Vivian also bends her head down before answering. \nBARNEY Relative ? \nVIVIAN Yes. \nBARNEY Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his... \nSame game of bending heads down. \nVIVIAN Niece ? \nBARNEY Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles here. \nVivian shakes her head. She suddenly seems a bit tired by the situation. \nBARNEY Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately. that'll be all. Vivian raises her hands and her voice. \nVIVIAN No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no dress ! \nVivian takes the loose jumbled banknotes from her bag and shows them to Barney. \nVIVIAN Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody will help me. \nBarney takes the money out of Vivian's hands, then takes a white handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket and gives it to Vivian. Then he gives her her money back. \nHe walks around his desk, and picks up his telephone. \nVIVIAN Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi. \nBARNEY Women's clothing. \nVivian looks up, a bit surprised. \nBARNEY Bridget, please. \nVivian looks at him, and then takes the handkerchief and loudly blows her nose. \nBARNEY Yes, Bridget.

This film shows an aerial overview of the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles, with a lot of industrial buildings along the wharves. \nPHILIP (voice over) Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown : prime industrial properties straddling the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles. Full shot of the meeting room, with the screen in the background. Because of the dark in the room, people around the table are only shadows. Edward is standing up near the screen. \nPHILIP (voice over) The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the yard we'll just level. \nA young man, one of Philip's assistants, walks into the room and to the place where Philip is seated. He bends down to whisper to Philip. \nTHE YOUNG ASSISTANT We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey. \nPHILIP Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please ? \nThe projection stops. Philip stands up and switches the lights on. He sighs and turns toward the young man. \nPHILIP Yeah, what ? Speak. \nTHE YOUNG ASSISTANT Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a 350 million dollar contract to build destroyers for the Navy. \nEdward looks very pensive. \nPhilip snickers, and looks at the young man. \nPHILIP Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper on this one ! \nTHE YOUNG ASSISTANT I thought they didn't. \nShot on another man, named Mark, seated at the table. \nMARK Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more. Those stocks could go through the roof. \nPHILIP Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. \nThe young man walks toward Edward, still standing up. \nTHE YOUNG ASSISTANT Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir. See, we can still walk away from it. \nEdward doesn't answer and remains pensive. \nPHILIP Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man- hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything ! \nPhilip sits down at the table, next to Mark. \nMARK Philip, I think he's right. \nPHILIP (raising his voice) Forget it, Mark. \nThe two men start arguing, and since they are talking loudly together, we don't understand what they say. \nEdward, with a glass of water in his hand, comes to the table and raises his voice. \nEDWARD Gentlemen, relax ! \nThe arguments between Philip and Mark stops \nEDWARD Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee ? \nPHILIP Senator Adams. \nEDWARD All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is. \nPhilip stands up and the young man sits down in his chair. \nEDWARD The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on anything without going to Appropriations first. \nHe drinks his water. \nPHILIP I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen. \nThe young man is on the phone, trying to reach someone. \nTHE YOUNG ASSISTANT Hello ? \nEDWARD That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me. \nHe picks up his briefcase. \nEDWARD I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals ? \nBOB (voice over) No problem. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nHe goes out of the room.

Yes, I have him right here. \nREGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - WOMEN'S CLOTHING SHOP - INTERIOR \nDAY \nVIVIAN I'm sorry too. \nEDWARD Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you ? \nJAMES MORSE Leave my company alone. \nEDWARD I can't do that. I own ten million shares. \nJAMES MORSE I'll buy your stock back. \nEDWARD You don't have the money. \nDAVID MORSE We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers. \nEDWARD There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there. \nDAVID MORSE And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ? \nJAMES MORSE (voice over) Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David. \nQuick shots at Edward with a slight ironical smile on his face, and then at Vivian, looking embarrassed. \nJAMES MORSE Mr. Lewis plays hardball. \nEDWARD Yes, yes, I do. \nDavid slams his napkin on the table \nDAVID MORSE I've heard enough of this.

I'm gonna tear you apart. \nEDWARD I look forward to it, sir. \nHe walks away. \nVivian looks more and more embarrassed. \nEDWARD Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ? \nHe sits down. \nVIVIAN He seems like a nice man. \nEDWARD I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does it ? \nVIVIAN I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson. \nTwo waiters puts down plates in front of Edward and Vivian. \nEDWARD Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does. \nHe makes a sign to the waiters who were wondering about the missing guests. \nEDWARD No, just the two. \nTHE WAITER (voice over) Yes, sir. \nFrom her purse, Vivian takes out a little ketchup sealed pack, as found in fast food restaurants, and starts tearing it open. \nEdwards looks at her and smiles. \nClose Up on Vivian's plate, where there are a piece of meat, a cob of corn, a jacket potato sliced in two halves, and some salad.

You thinking about dinner ? I was a maniac. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nMedium shot of the terrace seen from the open French window. \nVIVIAN I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ? \nVivian sits down on the balustrade of the terrace. \nVIVIAN He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to let it go. \nEDWARD Thanks for the recap. \nVIVIAN The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse. \nPENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nEdward points his finger toward Vivian. \nEDWARD What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're making me very nervous. Please come down. \nVIVIAN It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this ? \nShe starts leaning back a little. \nVIVIAN Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ? \nEDWARD Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking. \nVIVIAN It's really high. \nShe takes her hands off the balustrade, and waves them up in the air. \nVIVIAN Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe terrace seen from the open French window. \nShe sits back and holds the balustrade with both hands. \nEDWARD The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I like this man or not. \nPENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nVIVIAN They were mean to me. \nEDWARD Mean to you ? \nEdward looks very surprised. Vivian nods \u00abYes\u00bb. \nRODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY \nMedium full shot of Edward and Vivian crossing the street, holding hands. Vivian is still wearing her blue very short skirt, but the upper half of her body is covered by a white shirt, knotted at the waist and with the sleeves rolled back on her arms. She is also wearing regular woman's shoes, so she doesn't look like a prostitute any more. \nVIVIAN People are looking at me. \nThey now walk on the sidewalk. \nEDWARD They're not looking at you. They're looking at me. \nVIVIAN The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it. \nEDWARD Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit cards. \nHe stops walking and Vivian also stops. \nEDWARD Okay, stop fidgeting. \nVIVIAN All right. \nEDWARD Get rid of your gum. \nShe spits her gum, almost hitting two female pedestrians. One of them jumps up. \nEDWARD I don't believe you did that. \nEdward pulls her by the hand and they enter an expensive clothing store. \nCLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot of Vivian and Edward standing near a hanging rail full of dresses. Edward is holding Vivian's hand, who seems a little embarrassed. A young well-dressed man approaches them : he is Mr. Hollister, the manager of the store. \nEDWARD Yes ? \nHOLLISTER I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ? \nEdward shakes hand with him. \nEDWARD Edward Lewis. \nHOLLISTER Ah, yes, sir. \nEDWARD You see this young lady over here ? \nVivian joins the two men with a broad smile. \nHOLLISTER Yes. \nEDWARD Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ? \nVivian puts her head on Edward's shoulder. \nHOLLISTER Oh, yes. \nHollister understand he has made a blunder. \nHOLLISTER Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that. That's why when you came in... Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away. \nEDWARD Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ? \nHOLLISTER ...we knew from the first... \nEDWARD We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You understand that. \nVivian smiles behind Edward. \nHOLLISTER Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the right city for that matter. \nLater. Medium shot of Vivian seated in a comfortable armchair with a catalogue on her laps and Hollister kneeling at her side. \nHOLLISTER Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun. Okay ? \nVivian smiles. \nVIVIAN Okay. \nHollister makes a sign with his hand. \nFull shot of the store. In the forefront, Edward is standing behind a counter with a cordless telephone in his hand. He dials on the telephone. \nHOLLISTER Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it ! \nHe stands up. A saleswoman is running toward Vivian with a dress in her hands. She puts it on Vivian's laps, who puts the catalogue away. \nHOLLISTER Come on. Bring it out, girls. \nTHE SALESWOMAN Oh, this is absolutely divine. \nAnother saleswoman, also with a dress in her hand, is coming from the other side. \nMedium shot on Edward behind the counter. In the background, we hear female voices, but we don't understand the words. Hollister walks toward Edward. \nHOLLISTER Excuse me, sir, uh, \nEDWARD Yeah ? \nHOLLISTER Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ? Just profane or really offensive ? \nEDWARD Really offensive. \nHOLLISTER I like him so much ! \nEdward takes the phone to his ear, and Hollister walks away. \nWe hear the orchestral music from the title song : \u00abPretty Woman\u00bb Vivian is still seated on her armchair, looking at all the clothes that the saleswomen are bringing to her. \nShe has a very bright red dress in her hand and she looks at Edward. \nEdward makes a face and nods \u00abNo\u00bb. \nA saleswoman put a black hat on Vivian's head. \nEdward smiles and nods \u00abYes\u00bb. \nHollister sits down near Vivian and a saleswoman brings a grey dress. Vivian points to the dress and looks at Edward. \nEdward makes a face and a \u00abSo-So\u00bb sign with his hand. \nSlightly later. \nEdward is standing near the counter, drinking coffee. In the background, we see Vivian surrounded by saleswomen. Hollister walks toward Edward. \nThe music stops. \nHOLLISTER Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty well, I think. \nEDWARD I think we need some major sucking up. \nHOLLISTER Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with... \nEdward has put the coffee cup down and has taken the telephone again. He turns toward Hollister. \nEDWARD Hollister. \nHOLLISTER Yes, sir. \nEDWARD Not me. Her. \nHe points toward the group of saleswomen surrounding Vivian. \nHOLLISTER I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. \nHe walks away from Edward and toward the group of saleswomen. \nHOLLISTER How we doing, ladies ? \nEDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - PHILIP'S ROOM - INTERIOR DAY Philip sits down behind his desk and talks into the hand-free telephone. \nPHILIP Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you ? The word's all over the street. \nCLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY \nClose shot of Edward on the phone, with Vivian trying on new clothes in the background. \nPHILIP (voice over on the phone) Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium shot. Vivian has put the bags she was carrying on the table, but has kept her purse, a vey elegant black leather item. She opens it, takes some money out of it, and gives the money to the uniformed attendant, who helped her carry her shopping bags. The attendant smiles. \nVIVIAN Wait... Thank you. \nThe attendant walks away. Vivian takes her hat off and falls into an armchair. \nLYRICS Oh, oh, pretty woman. \nEnd of the music. \nEDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY \nThe modern building, where Edward's office in L.A. is located. The number above the main entrance says \u00ab333\u00bb. We hear male voices over. We don't understand everything they are saying. \nMAN (voice over) Mister Lewis. \nEDWARD (voice over) Gentlemen. \nEDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY \nEdward is standing up with his briefcase, smiling to the men of his team around him. He moves to his chair at the meeting table. Philip is trying to herd all his assistants out of the room. \nPHILIP Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ? \nEdward sits down. A blonde secretary joins the leaving group. \nPHILIP Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two- thirty, would be good. \nThey all go out, leaving Edward and Philip alone. \nPHILIP You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from the bank. \nHe sits down next to Edward. \nPHILIP And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ? \nEDWARD Hmm. \nEdward seems to be very pensive. \nPHILIP So, it goes without saying... that your business means a lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you gotta do is call the bank. \nHe puts his hands on the telephone. \nEDWARD Yeah. \nStill, a very tepid reaction from Edward. He just takes a small glass and puts it in front of him on the table. \nPhilip looks at Edward with a worried look. He stands up. \nPHILIP Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to get away ? \nEdward has put another glass on top of the first one, and now he puts a third one on top of the two other ones. \nEDWARD You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ? \nHe puts a fourth glass on top of the other ones. Philip sighs. \nPHILIP What ? \nEDWARD Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets. \nPHILIP So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the point ? \nEDWARD We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything. \nPHILIP We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal. It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you. \nEdward looks up at Philip. \nPHILIP Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's finish this. Call the bank ! \nHe moves the telephone toward Edward. Edward just smiles but doesn't pick up the phone. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose Up on a big Hi-Fi tuner-amplifier. We see Vivian's hand setting the power on. Lights appear on the amplifier screen. A sign says \u00ab102.70 Mhz\u00bb. We hear some soft easy music. Vivian's hand sets the volume a little higher. \nMedium shot on a table, on which everything has been set for a dinner for two. Three candlesticks with lighted red candles in them are also set on the table. Vivian is seated on one of the chair by the table. We see her from the back, but she seems to be almost naked, except for what looks like a tie around her neck. \nWe hear a door opening, and then closing. Vivian puts her feet up on the table. She is wearing black shoes. She puts the end of the tie on the table : it is the tie she took from the salesman in the store. \nEdward crosses the room, without apparently noticing Vivian. \nVIVIAN How was your day, dear ? Edward stops and looks at her. \nEDWARD Nice tie. \nVIVIAN I got it for you. \nPENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose up shot on the bathtub faucet. We see Vivian's foot reaching for the faucet, and the thumb of the foot trying to fit inside the faucet. \nEDWARD (voice over) Well, my mother was a music teacher... and married my father... \nClose Up on Edward naked chest floating in the bathtub. Vivian's hand is rubbing a washcloth on the chest. EDWARD (voice over) ...whose family was extremely wealthy. \nMedium shot on Vivian lying in the tub with Edward lying on top of her. Her legs are spread open and her knees comes out of the water on either side of Edward's body. \nEDWARD Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he took his money with him. \nVivian puts the washcloth down on the edge of the tub. She takes a sponge. \nClose Up shot on Edward's chest. Vivian rubs it with the sponge. \nEDWARD (voice over) And then she died. I was very angry with him. \nMedium shot of the tub seen from the foot of the tub. \nEDWARD It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that sentence : \u00abI was very angry with him\u00bb. I do it very well, don't I ? I'll say it again. \u00abI was very angry with him\u00bb. \nVivian laughs, and Edward smiles. \nEDWARD Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father. \nThe camera moves slowly around the bathtub. \nVIVIAN I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars. \nEDWARD My father was president of the third company I ever took over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece. \nVIVIAN What'd the shrink say ? \nEDWARD He said I was cured. \nNow the camera has come near the faucet. \nEdward takes Vivian's hand in his. \nVIVIAN Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy. \nMedium shot of Edward and Vivian in the tub. \nVIVIAN Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so, basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy... \nShe brings her feet up and wraps her legs around Edward's body. \nVIVIAN ...wrapped around you for the bargain price of... \nEDWARD & VIVIAN (together) ...three thousands dollars. \nVIVIAN Yeah. \nFADE TO : \nLOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - EXTERIOR DAY \nClose Up shot on the lawn of the polo field. We hear an air-horn blowing, and horses galloping. \nThe small polo white ball is in the middle of the shot. We see the hooves of several horses approaching the ball. Then a mallet comes down and strikes the ball away. \nMedium shot on horse-backed players galloping on the field. \nWe hear the announcer on the Public Address. \nANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan. \nFull shot of the field, with the camera on ground level, showing the horses coming toward us. \nHe walks behind her. \nEDWARD Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here ! \nPENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING \nVivian was ready to enter the bathroom, but she turns around. \nEDWARD I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker ! And you are my employee ! \nVIVIAN Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say when. I... I say who... \nEDWARD I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it ! \nVIVIAN I'm sorry I ever met you. She walks away into the bathroom \nVIVIAN I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car ! \nHe walks toward the bathroom, enters it and starts taking his tie off in front of the mirror. \nEDWARD As if you had so many more appealing options. \nVivian comes back to the bathroom door, carrying a bunch of clothes. \nVIVIAN I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today. \nEDWARD Somehow, I find that very hard to believe. She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she tries to pick up a larger handbag. \nClose shot on the handbag, stuck under an armchair. We notice that Vivian is bare feet. \nVivian finally succeeds in picking up the bag and put the straps over her shoulder, on top of the smaller bag. Edward walks out of the bathroom and joins her. \nEDWARD Where are you going ? \nVIVIAN I want my money. I want to get out of here. \nShe crosses her arms on her bunch of clothes. She has a very sullen, sad face. Edward doesn't move for a couple of seconds, then walks to the bed, to pick up his jacket. He gets his wallet from the inside pocket of his jacket. He opens the wallet, and gets a large wad of banknotes out of it. \nClose up shot on the bed. We see the wad of banknotes falling on the bed. They are all hundred-dollar bills. \nEdward walks away toward the living room, and Vivian remains without moving with her sullen sad face. She looks down at the bed. \nClose up shot on the wad of banknotes on the bed. \nBack to Vivian, who hasn't moved. She starts walking away toward the living room, without taking her money. \nPENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING \nEdward is standing near the desk, looking at his mail. Vivian walks behind him, coming from the bedroom and going away toward the front door. We hear the door opening. Edward looks up toward the door. The door closes, and Edward looks very pensive. He looks back into the bedroom. \nPENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING \nClose up on the bed, where the wad of banknotes is still lying. \nREGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - INTERIOR \nEVENING \nMedium shot on Vivian, standing near the elevator, and nervously pressing on the elevator call button. \nVIVIAN Come on ! \nMedium close shot on Vivian. We hear the penthouse door opening, but Vivian doesn't look at it and keeps looking at the elevator in front of her. Larger shot. Edward is coming out of the penthouse, and he has left the door open. He walks toward Vivian. \nEDWARD I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us. It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you to go. Will you stay the week ? \nVIVIAN Why ? \nEDWARD I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it. \nVIVIAN We were just talking. \nHe chuckles. \nEDWARD I didn't like it. \nThe elevator bell dings. The elevator door opens, and a smiling Dennis appears. \nDENNIS Down ? \nClose shot on Edward's face, and then on Vivian's face. \nDennis feels some tension between Edward and Vivian and stops smiling. He goes back into the elevator, presses a button and the door closes. \nVIVIAN You hurt me. \nEDWARD Yes. \nVIVIAN Don't do it again. \nThey look at each other for a couple of seconds, then slowly, Vivian walks back to the penthouse. Edward follows her and takes one of her handbags from her shoulder. They both enters the penthouse and he closes the door behind him. \nPENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHigh angle shot above the bed. Edward and Vivian are lying in the bed, presumably naked, but covered by a sheet from their waist down. They are facing each other and talking. \nVIVIAN First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three. Slowly, the camera moves closer to them. \nEDWARD Mm. \nVIVIAN So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum. \nEDWARD So then you chose this as your profession ? \nVIVIAN I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and made it sound so great. So one day I did it. \nThe camera stops moving forward, having reached a medium close shot, showing Vivian and Edward's heads and shoulders. \nVIVIAN I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and, you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your childhood dream. \nEDWARD You could be so much more. \nClose shot on Vivian's face. \nVIVIAN People put you down enough, you start to believe it. \nReverse shot on Edward's face. \nEDWARD I think you are a very bright, very special woman. Reverse shot on Vivian's face. \nVIVIAN The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ? \nEDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY \nLong shot on the building, seen from across the street. \nEDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY \nMedium full shot on Philip, standing in front of the desk, and talking to the receptionist girl. \nPHILIP No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him on Monday. \nHe walks away from the desk. \nTHE RECEPTIONIST Yes, sir. \nA blonde female secretary walks into the room, carrying a thick pile of documents. \nPHILIP Where are you going ? Did he sign these ? \nTHE SECRETARY No, he said he had to leave. \nPhilip walks nervously across the room. \nPHILIP He had to... \nHe meets Edward coming out of an office. \nPHILIP Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep. \nEDWARD Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning. \nHe stops at the reception desk. \nEDWARD Did you send the tickets to the hotel ? \nTHE RECEPTIONIST Yes, sir. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nHe starts walking out of the room. \nThe third box is empty, but an usher shows Edward and Vivian through the door of the box. \nUSHER Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir. Vivian enters first, followed by Edward. Vivian looks down from the balustrade of the box. Edward shakes hand with Doris, an old lady in the next box. \nEDWARD Doris. \nDORIS Edward, how are you ? \nEDWARD How nice to see you. Nice to see you. \nThe camera starts going away and down from the box. \nEDWARD Sir. \nHe shakes hands with Doris' husband. \nDORIS' HUSBAND Good evening, Edward. \nEDWARD Wonderful news. Congratulations. \nMeanwhile, Vivian has moved to the corner of the balustrade. \nVIVIAN Hey, come here. You gotta look at this. \nMedium close shot on the box. Edward, who, as we already know it, is afraid of heights, doesn't want to move any closer to the balustrade. \nEDWARD It's all right. I've already seen it. \nVIVIAN If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ? \nEDWARD Because they're the best. \nHe sits down, and Vivian also sits down. The ushers, who had remained behind them, slightly bends down toward Edward. \nUSHER Is there anything else, sir ? \nEDWARD No, thank you. \nHe shows them something underneath the balustrade, and then moves away. \nUSHER The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera. \nVIVIAN Oh ! \nShe picks up the opera glasses. \nVIVIAN So, you said this is in Italian. \nShe tries to look through the glasses, but doesn't succeed in setting them right on their handle. \nEDWARD Mm-hmmm. \nVIVIAN So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are broken. \nEdward takes the glasses from Vivian's hand. \nVIVIAN Mine are broken. \nEDWARD No, no. That's okay It's all right. \nHe sets them right on their handle, and gives them back to Vivian. \nVIVIAN Oh. \nEDWARD You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand. \nVivian looks through the glasses, while the lights are switching off and on, to warn the spectators that the opera is about to begin. \nEDWARD The music's very powerful. \nMediums full shot on the two next boxes on the right of Edward's box. The spectators, who understood the lights signal, are sitting down. \nBack to Edward's box. Medium close shot on Vivian and Edward. Vivian is looking through her glasses. \nVIVIAN There's a band ! \nMedium shot on the two other boxes. The light are definitely switched off, and ushers are closing the curtains on the exit doors. \nBack to Vivian and Edward. We hardly see them in the dark. \nEDWARD People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul. \nVIVIAN Mmm. \nThe orchestra plays the overture of \u00abLa Traviata\u00bb. \nThe lights, coming from the stage, enable us to see Vivian and Edward's faces. Vivian is smiling broadly. Edward is concentrated on the music and serious. \nClose shot on Vivian's face. Still smiling broadly, she turns briefly toward Edward, and then goes back looking at the stage. She bends down on the balustrade to have a better look at the stage. \nSAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - STAGE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe sets and the costumes are beautiful and very classic in their design. We see and hear the Love Duet of Act One in Violetta's sitting room. \nVioletta walks to the forefront of the stage, and the camera moves away from her, showing, seen from the stage, Edward and Vivian in their box. \nThe picture and the music dissolve to the Second Act in Violetta's garden.

The two husbands are standing up behind them and also applauding. \nBack to Edward's box. Close shot of Vivian standing up. She still has tears in her eyes. She walks away from her seat, coming near Doris' box. \nDORIS Did you enjoy the opera, dear ? \nVIVIAN Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants. \nDORIS What ? \nShe seems a bit surprised by what she just heard. Vivian walks away, and Edward turns toward Doris. \nEDWARD She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance. \nDORIS Oh ! Edward walks away, leaving a very pensive Doris. Apparently she doesn't completely believe Edward's translation of Vivian's words ! \nEDWARD Yes. Good-bye now. \nStill very pensive, Doris absently waves her hand to him. \nREGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT \nLong shot from across the street. We see the limousine parking in front of the hotel. \nMedium long shot on the limousine parking. We hear Edward and Vivian's conversation in voices over. \nEDWARD (voice over) No, don't touch.. \nVIVIAN (voice over) I moved the queen. I like the queen.

She stops when she gets near Edward. Among the tough-looking guys around Edward, we recognize Carlos, still wearing his eternal hat, and another guy, one of Carlos' lieutenants, wearing a leather jacket, and holding a long stick in his hands. \nVIVIAN What's going on out here ? \nEDWARD I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of West Side Story. \nCARLOS I think you owe me some money, baby. \nTHE GUY WITH THE STICK Two hundred dollars. \nEDWARD Why don't you go to school tomorrow ? \nA girl, standing behind the group, starts giggling very stupidly. \nCARLOS Now I hear you got yourself a new job ? \nVIVIAN Let's just leave. \nShe starts walking away, but Carlos puts himself in her way. \nCARLOS You ain't going no place. \nEdward takes a step forward. \nEDWARD Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... \nThe guy, standing next to Carlos, takes a very long knife out of his skateboard. \nCARLOS You're out of your neighborhood, home boy.

You believe that this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ? \nCARLOS That's right. \nEDWARD Why ? \nCARLOS Because this is my block. \nEdward turns toward Vivian. \nEDWARD His block ? \nVIVIAN He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go, Edward. \nShe starts walking away. But Carlos is in their way. \nCARLOS Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick ? \nEDWARD I am not a trick. This is a trick. \nHe points his hand toward Darry. \nEDWARD Darryl ! Left pocket. \nMedium close shot on Darryl, standing near the limousine. He opens his jacket, revealing a holster with a gun inside. \nBack to the group around Vivian and Edward. \nEDWARD Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit.

Edward was with me, he didn't blow off billion dollar deals ! \nHe walks to the bar and helps himself for a drink. \nPHILIP I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think. Mind if I have a drink ? \nHe pours whisky in a glass without waiting for Vivian's answer. \nVIVIAN No. \nHe holds the glass toward her. \nVIVIAN No, thank you. \nShe walks away from him. \nPHILIP Well, I'll just wait. \nShe sits down on the sofa, crosses her legs on the couch and starts writing in a notebook. Behind him, Philip sits down on a stool near the bar. \nVIVIAN Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home. \nMedium shot on Philip at the bar. He stands up and slowly walks toward her. The camera follows him. \nPHILIP You know... \n(HE CHUCKLES) ...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh, you are not... the little woman. \nHe sits down on the sofa, next to Vivian. She uncrosses her legs and lets them down on the floor. He puts his glass on the low table, crosses his fingers and snickers. \nPHILIP You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know ? She puts her notebook on the low table. \nPHILIP Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with you right now, Vivian. \nHe moves slightly closer to her. She seems very tense by the situation. \nPHILIP Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am really pissed, you know ? \nHe moves his hand toward her bare leg. She glares at him. \nPHILIP Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you, huh... \nHe puts his hand between her legs. She moves it away. \nPHILIP ...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward. \nHe keeps on trying to fondle her, and Vivian keeps on trying to get rid of him. \nVIVIAN Hey, get off me ! \nThey start fighting. He stands up. \nPHILIP Hey, hey ! Goddamn it ! \nShe bites his hand. \nPHILIP Ow ! \nHe slaps her face very hard. She falls down on the floor. \nVIVIAN Ow ! \nHe kneels down beside her and grabs her. \nPHILIP Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it. \nVIVIAN (SCREAMING) Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me ! \nPHILIP How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ? \nVIVIAN (SCREAMING) Get off me ! Get off me ! \nPHILIP Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ? \nEdward, who has come silently into the room, grabs him from behind, and forces him to stand up. \nPHILIP What are you doing ? Get off ! \nQuick shot on Vivian slowly getting up from the floor. \nBack on Philip and Edward fighting. \nEDWARD Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it ! \nPHILIP I don't know how to tell you this. You already did, Edward ! \nEdward pushes him toward the front door, which is still open. \nPHILIP All right, all right. \nEDWARD Out. Out of here. \nPhilip falls down on the floor. He slowly stands back up \nPHILIP Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah ! \nEdward very violently punches him in the face. Philip falls down on the floor. \nQuick shot on Vivian, seated on the sofa. She starts when she sees Edward punching Philip. \nPhilip slowly stands up, his hand on his face. Edward looks at his hand, who seems to hurt him after the violent punch he gave to Philip. \nEDWARD Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn ! \nHe picks up Philip's briefcase and throws it through the open door. It falls on the floor of the hallway. \nPHILIP I think you broke my nose. \nEDWARD Get out of here. \nPHILIP (SCREAMING) What is wrong with you ? Come on, Edward ! I gave you ten years ! I devoted my whole life to you ! \nShe slaps him on the arm and walks away.

Dinner napkin. \nWe see Vivian's hand taking the napkin. \nVIVIAN (voice over) Dinner napkin... \nBARNEY (voice over) \nMM-MMM \nVIVIAN (voice over) ...laid gently in the lap. \nThe camera pans away and we discover Vivian seated at the table in front of the plate. She puts the napkin on her laps and then her elbows on the table \nBARNEY (voice over) Good. Elbows off the table. \nShe takes her elbows off the table. \nBARNEY (voice over) Don't slouch. \nThe camera moves away from the table and we get a larger shot of the dining room. Uniformed waiters are setting tables behind Vivian and Barney, who is standing up behind Vivian. He points to the different forks on the table. \nBARNEY Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork. \nVIVIAN I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the silverware is a little confusing. \nThe camera moves back again giving a full view of the dining room, with Barney and Vivian's table in the forefront.

He stops to look around, expecting to see Vivian waiting for him. He starts walking again, still looking around him. Barney catches up with him. Edward doesn't stop walking, and Barney has to talk while walking. \nBARNEY Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of the hotel. \nEdward stops at a marble shelf with a row of courtesy telephones on it. He hardly listens to what Barney is telling him. \nEDWARD Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call. \nHe picks up a telephone but keeps looking around him. He seems a bit worried. \nBARNEY Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir. \nEDWARD From who ? \nBARNEY From your niece, sir. \nEdward, for the first time, looks at Barney. His finger is on the dial of the phone, but he doesn't dial. \nEDWARD My what ? \nBARNEY The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir. \nEDWARD Oh. Hmm. \nEdward smiles and puts down the telephone receiver which he had already put to his ear. \nEDWARD I think we both know that she's not my niece. \nBARNEY Of course. \nEDWARD The reason I know that is that I am an only child. \nBARNEY Yes, sir. \nEDWARD What's the message ? \nBARNEY She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian. \nEdward remains pensive for a couple of seconds before answering. \nEDWARD Intriguing. \nEdward picks up his briefcase which he had put on the telephone shelf. \nBARNEY Have a good evening, sir. \nEDWARD Thank you, Mr... ? \nHe walks away. \nBARNEY Thompson. I'm the manager... \nHe takes his business card out of the pocket of his vest to give it to Edward, but Edward is already gone. \nBARNEY ...manager of the hotel, sir. \nREGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT \nThe lounge of the hotel is a cosy place with potted green plants, comfortable armchair and soft piano music.

There are not many people at this early time of the evening. \nMedium shot of the bar. Only one person is seated on a stool at the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking around for her. \nAs Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian. \nMedium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's eyes when he recognizes Vivian. \nBack to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark- colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly styled. Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds. \nShe stands up from the bar and walks toward him. \nVIVIAN You're late. \nEDWARD You're stunning. \nShe laughs. \nVIVIAN You're forgiven. \nEDWARD Shall we go to dinner ? \nHe gives her his arm. She puts her arm inside his arm and they walk across the lounge toward the exit. \nRESTAURANT \u00abLE VOLTAIRE\u00bb - INTERIOR NIGHT \nHigh angle shot of the whole restaurant. It looks like a very expensive place. Tables are scattered around the room and on the gallery, but not too close to one another. In the middle of the room, a larger table used only by the waiters. \nWe see Edward and Vivian crossing the room, with a maitre d'hotel walking in front of them. \nMAITRE D'HOTEL This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting. \nEDWARD Stop fidgeting. Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated. \nEDWARD Mr. Morse. \nThe two men stand up.

David. \nShe shakes hands with both men. \nEDWARD Please, sit. \nThe maitre d'hotel pulls the chair for Vivian. The men wait for Vivian to be seated to sit down. Vivian has James Morse on her right, Edward on her left, and David in front of her. \nVIVIAN (SOFTLY) Excuse me. \nShe stands up. Immediately, the maitre d'hotel pulls her chair, and the three men stand up, to Vivian's surprise. \nEDWARD Where are you going ? \nShe smiles to the two other men. \nVIVIAN I'm going to the ladies' room. \nThe two Morse men smile back to her. \nEDWARD Upstairs, to the right. \nVIVIAN Okay. Excuse me. \nShe starts walking away. \nEDWARD Shall I order for you ? \nShe turns around. \nVIVIAN Yeah. \nShe stops, exhales, and says, in a more polite tone : \nVIVIAN Please do so. Thank you. \nEDWARD I'll do that. \nShe walks away. The three men sit down. Close Up shot on a plate being laid in front of one of the guests. On the plate, four appetizers, actually four canap\u00e9s. \nDAVID MORSE (voice over) Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a company... \nThe camera moves up from the plate to the guest's face. The guest is Vivian, and she looks a bit worried by what has been brought to her. \nDAVID MORSE (voice over) ...should control its destiny. \nVivian turns to Edward. \nVIVIAN Where's the salad ? \nDavid looks at Vivian, a bit surprised by what she just said. \nEdward whispers to Vivian \nEDWARD Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal. \nVIVIAN That's the fork I knew. \nDavid smiles. \nVivian takes one of her forks and looks at it, then she puts it back. \nDAVID MORSE (voice over) Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions are. \nSensing Vivian's embarrassment, James Morse smiles to her. \nJAMES MORSE I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure which goes with what ! \nHe points to the different forks around his plate. Vivian laughs. \nDavid seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps on deviating on menial subjects. \nJames Morse takes one of the canap\u00e9s with his fingers and eats it. Vivian smiles, and also takes the canap\u00e9 with her fingers. She wipes something out of it before eating it. \nEdward smiles. He is happy that Vivian and James are getting along so well. \nClose Up on the table in front of Vivian. We see the waiter's hand putting down a plate of snails in their shells. DAVID MORSE (voice over) You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of cities. Men like my grandfather made this country. \nVivian looks at the snails and then at the waiter. \nVIVIAN Who ordered this ? \nDavid seems more and more annoyed by the situation with Vivian. \nTHE WAITER (voice over) The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon app\u00e9tit. \nEdward looks at Vivian. \nEDWARD These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy. Try it. David ? \nDavid bends down on the table. His grandfather looks at him. \nDAVID MORSE Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the company ? \nVivian is trying to figure out how to work the snail pincers. \nEdward looks at David \nEDWARD Break it up and sell off the pieces. \nEdward is trying to mime to Vivian how to use the snail pincers. \nCloser shot on James Morse. \nJAMES MORSE I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea... of your turning forty years of my work into your garage sale. \nVivian is still fighting with her snail pincers. \nClose Up on Vivian's plate and her hands trying to use the snail pincers. \nEDWARD (voice over) At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are going to be a very rich man. \nJames Morse looks at Edward. \nJAMES MORSE I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard. \nEventually, Vivian had succeeded in fitting one snail into the snail pincers, but it flies away from the pincers. The waiter, a white-hair man with a gentle face, catches it. \nEdward looks at the waiter and then at Vivian. \nVIVIAN SMILES \nVIVIAN Slippery little suckers. \nBoth Morse gentlemen smile. \nTHE WAITER (smiling) It happens all the time. \nClose Up on the table in front of Vivian. A ball of green ice cream, in a silver cup, is being put down on the table. \nMedium shot on the Morse gentlemen. \nJAMES MORSE I met your father.

Carter Lewis. \nMedium shot on James Morse. Then medium shots on whomever is talking. \nJAMES MORSE He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is. \nEDWARD No, I have the franchise on that. \nJAMES MORSE Does that make him proud ? \nEDWARD I doubt it.

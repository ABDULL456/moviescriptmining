She sits down on an armchair. \nVIVIAN I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of \u00abfly by the seat of my pants\u00bb girl. You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's... Yeah. \nEdward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done something very wise in bringing Vivian with him. \nVIVIAN Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe break the ice. \nEDWARD Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable. \nHe takes his wallet out of this jacket. \nVIVIAN Cash works for me, yeah. \nShe stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money in one of her high boots. \nEDWARD You're on my fax. \nVIVIAN Well, that's one I haven't been on before. \nShe doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way. Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's suggestive movements. \nEDWARD Cute. Very cute. Thank you. \nShe laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper. \nVIVIAN All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you say ? Hmm ? \nEDWARD A buffet of safety. \nVIVIAN I'm a safety girl. \nEdward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his zipper. \nVIVIAN All right, let's get one of these on you. \nEDWARD No, no. I... \nHe laughs awkwardly. \nEDWARD Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ? \nHe takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk chair. \nVIVIAN Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure ? \nEDWARD Business, I think. \nHe walks away from the desk across the room. \nVIVIAN Business, you think. \nShe zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the room. \nVIVIAN Well... let me guess. \nEdward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair. \nVIVIAN That would make you... a lawyer. \nShe sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair. \nEDWARD A lawyer ? \nVIVIAN Mm-hmm. \nEDWARD What makes you think I'm a lawyer ? \nVIVIAN You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you. \nEDWARD I bet you've known a lot of lawyers. \nVIVIAN I've known a lot of everybody. \nThe doorbell chimes. They both stand up. \nVIVIAN What is that ? \nHe turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and seems a little disturbed by it. \nEDWARD Champagne. \nVIVIAN Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load off. \nThe doorbell chimes again. \nVivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian closes the door behind him. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT Good evening. \nVIVIAN Hi. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT Uh, where would you like it ? \nVIVIAN Where would we like it ? \nEdward has seated himself back in the armchair. \nEDWARD Uh, over by the bar. \nThe attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but, being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice, and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down, he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing behind him. \nVIVIAN Excuse me ! \nShe giggles. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis. \nEDWARD Thank you. \nThe attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian, staring at her. \nVIVIAN What are you looking at ? \nThe attendant clears his throat. \nVIVIAN What is he looking at ? \nEdward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money. \nEDWARD Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much. \nROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night. \nThe attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar. \nVIVIAN A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh. (in a much softer voice) Stupid. \nEDWARD Don't worry about it. Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar. \nVIVIAN You mind if I take my boots off ? \nShe sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it in two slightly different levels. \nEDWARD Not at all. \nVIVIAN So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ? \nShe zips one of her boots down. \nEDWARD I have both. \nVIVIAN Where are they ? Shopping together ? \nShe takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle cork popping off. \nEDWARD My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home... with my ex-dog. \nHe brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the floor besides her.

In the bowl are some fresh strawberries. \nEDWARD Why don't you try a strawberry ? \nHe takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her. \nVIVIAN Why ? \nEDWARD It brings out the flavor in the champagne. \nVIVIAN Oh, groovy. She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool. \nVIVIAN Pretty good. Don't you drink ? \nEDWARD No. \nVIVIAN Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing, okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along ? \nEDWARD Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you. \nHe stands up. \nEDWARD Why don't we just get through that right now ? \nVIVIAN Great, let's get started. \nEDWARD How much for the entire night ? \nVIVIAN Stay here ? \n(SHE SNICKERS) You couldn't afford it. \nEDWARD Try me. \nVIVIAN Three hundred dollars. \nEDWARD Done. Thank you. Now we can relax. \nHe takes the glass off her hand. She stands up. \nVIVIAN Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way. \nShe walks to the bar, where Edward is filling the glass with Champagne. \nEDWARD To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone tonight. \nHe gives her the glass, and she immediately drinks it. He sits down on the stool. \nVIVIAN Why ? Is it your birthday or something ? \nEDWARD No. \nVIVIAN I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays. \nEDWARD I bet you have. \nVIVIAN So what do you want me to do ? \nHe doesn't answer immediately, remains pensive for a couple of seconds, and then looks at her. He laughs. \nEDWARD I don't know. I really don't know. \nPENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT \nClose Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed. She turns the faucet off and takes an white towel to dry her hands. \nThe camera tilts up to Vivian's face, who walks to the door. \nVIVIAN I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me. \nShe closes the door, and goes back to the sink. Edward re-opens the door and enters the bathroom. \nEDWARD I didn't hear you. What did you say ? Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror. \nVIVIAN Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute. \nEdward looks worried. He points to her \nEDWARD What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What are you hiding ? \nVIVIAN Nothing. \nHe walks toward her and sighs. He grabs her by the arm and moves her toward the door. He takes her hand bag \nEDWARD All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want any of this. Get your things and your money and please leave. She gets rid of his hand. \nVIVIAN I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs when I was fourteen. \nEDWARD What is this ? What is this ? \nClose Up on Vivian's hand, which Edward is opening by force. She was hiding a little box of dental floss. Edward has put Vivian's bag under his arm. \nEDWARD This is dental floss. \nShe takes her dental floss back. \nVIVIAN Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you shouldn't neglect your gums. \nEDWARD I'm sorry. Please continue. \nVIVIAN Thank you. \nShe walks to the sink. He start walking across the room, but stops in his tracks, and looks at her. She turns around from the sink and looks at him. \nVIVIAN Are you gonna watch ? \nEDWARD No, I'm going. He gives the handbag back to her. \nVIVIAN Thank you. \nEDWARD It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me. \nVIVIAN Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out of me. \nHe nods his head. She goes back to the sink and brings a piece of dental floss to her mouth, stops, and brings it down.

You'll need something to wear. \nVIVIAN Like what ? \nEDWARD Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy. \nHe stops at the breakfast table, put some documents back in his brief-case and closes it. \nEDWARD Conservative. You understand ? \nVIVIAN Boring. \nEDWARD Elegant.

A blonde secretary joins the leaving group. \nPHILIP Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two- thirty, would be good. \nThey all go out, leaving Edward and Philip alone. \nPHILIP You were right about Morse.

So, all you gotta do is call the bank. \nHe puts his hands on the telephone. \nEDWARD Yeah. \nStill, a very tepid reaction from Edward. He just takes a small glass and puts it in front of him on the table. \nPhilip looks at Edward with a worried look.

Are you giving Morse a chance to get away ? \nEdward has put another glass on top of the first one, and now he puts a third one on top of the two other ones. \nEDWARD You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ? \nHe puts a fourth glass on top of the other ones.

Don't fidget and smile. \nShe makes a broad smile, and walks behind him. \nClose shot on the players on the field. \nANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Humboldt's coming around to this side. \nOn the edge of the field, two well-dressed gentlemen, a young one and and older one, are watching the game. \nANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play. \nThe two gentlemen walk away from the field. The camera follows them around a platform with a canopy above it. On the platform, the announcer, a white-haired gentleman, is sitting at a table in front of a microphone. On the other side of the platform, the camera lets the two gentlemen go on their way and stops on a group of four people : Edward, Vivian, Gwen and Gretchen. The two last ones are the Olsen sisters, two very elegant blonde women, known to be the gossip champions of Los Angeles upper class society. Gwen is seated on a chair on the platform, next to the announcer, when Gretchen is standing at the foot of the platform. \nEDWARD This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who have made marrying well an art form. \nGWEN Edward. \nEDWARD Be back in just a second. Hold on. \nHe walks away and Vivian remains with the Olsen sisters. In the background, a waiter is working on a buffet table. \nGWEN So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm. \nShe turns back to the man seated in front of the microphone. Vivian looks a little disturbed by what Gwen just said. \nGRETCHEN Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible bachelor. Everybody is trying to land him. \nVivian nods her head and answers Gretchen with a sardonic tone. \nVIVIAN Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for sex. \nShe walks away. Gretchen laughs. \nMedium shot on the edge of the field. A middle-aged couple is seated on two chairs and looks at the game. Edward is standing behind them. The couple claps their hands and yell to support their favorite team. Vivian joins Edward behind the couple. Edward claps his hands. \nEDWARD Well done. \nVivian claps her hands louder than Edward, and then yells with wide movements of her hand. \nVIVIAN Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo ! \nClose shot on the couple, who turns around to look at her. \nClose shot on Edward and Vivian \nVIVIAN Tell me again why we're here. \nEDWARD Business. \nVIVIAN Business mingling ? \nEDWARD Yeah. \nWe hear an air-horn blowing noisily. \nClose Up on the field. We see the legs of a horse galloping on the field. \nANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) That's the chukker, ladies and gentlemen. \nLarger shot on the field with the horses galloping on it. \nANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.) Falcons, seven. Gems, four. \nMedium shot on a group of spectators under an open tent. Among them, Philip, with sunglasses on his nose, and a glass of Champagne in his hand. He leaves the group. \nPHILIP Excuse me. Edward ! \nLarger shot on another open tent across the lawn from the other one. Philip comes in and joins his wife. \nPHILIP Edward. Over here. \nEdward walks in with Vivian. He shakes hands with Philip. \nEDWARD Phil. \nPHILIP Ah, good to see you. \nEDWARD Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward. \nPHILIP Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife, Elizabeth. \nVivian shakes hands with Philip, then with Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls. \nA very elegant blonde lady walks toward them and then away from them. Elizabeth turns around to look at her. \nELIZABETH Oh, my God ! It's Tate Whitley Wallington. She runs after Tate. \nELIZABETH Tate ! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World. \nThe two men and Vivian watch her go. \nPHILIP Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay ? \nHe gives his Champagne glass to Vivian. \nPHILIP I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ? \nEDWARD Mm-hmm. I asked him. \nPHILIP That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm ! \nHe walks away. \nVIVIAN Real genuine guy. Who is he ? \nEDWARD He's my lawyer. He's all right. \nVIVIAN You could freeze ice on his wife's ass. \nEDWARD Maybe we'll try that later. \nVIVIAN Are these people your friends ? \nEDWARD I spend time with them, yeah. \nVIVIAN Well, no wonder. \nEDWARD No wonder what ? \nVIVIAN No wonder why you came looking for me. \n", "test3_id": 29}

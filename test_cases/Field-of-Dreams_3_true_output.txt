43 SPRINGTIME - DAY A baby robin tries to pull a worm out of the around. Inside the house, Annie is doing spring cleaning. She looks out the window to see: 
44 THE BASEBALL FIELD Ray mowing the outfield grass. He stops, looks around, listens, hears nothing, and continues mowing. 
45 ANNIE 
just watches him. 
CUT TO 
46 TV SCREEN 46 We see the first exhibition game of spring training from Florida, as the announcer talks about a "southpaw" pitcher. 
47 INT. RAY AND ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 47 
Little Karin watches the TV, while Annie and Ray sit at the living room table, financial ledgers spread out before them as they struggle with their accounts. 
KARIN Daddy, what's a southpaw?

47 CONTINUED 
RAY A left-handed pitcher. 
(TO ANNIE) How bad is it? 
ANNIE Well, given how much less acreage we have for corn, I'd say we'll probably .almost break even. 
RAY Jesus. 
ANNIE We've spent all our savings on that field. 
KARIN (O.S.) Daddy.. 
RAY Just a minute, Karin. 
(TO ANNIE) So what are you saying? We can't keep the field? 
ANNIE 
(SADLY) It makes it real hard to keep the farm, Ray. Ray closes his eyes. 
KARIN (O.S.) Daddy... 
RAY (a little testy) In a minute, Karin. 
KARIN (O.S.) There's a man out there on your lawn. Ray opens his eyes and turns to see Karin kneeling on the kitchen counter, looking out the window. Ray and Annie exchange a quick glance, and Ray walks to the window. 
48 EXT. THE WINDOW 
seen from outside, as Ray's head appears and looks out. He sees something out there and just looks at it. 
49 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW 
There is a Man standing on the edge ofthebaseballfield. Hi es wearing a baseball uniform. Anold-fashionedone. 
50 INT HOUSE 
Ray turns to Annie. She looks out and nods thoughtfully. Annie stays very calm in emergencies. 
ANNIE We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead. Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The night sky seems close enough to touch. 
51 EXT. HOUSE 
On the porch wall, Ray finds the switch, holds his breath, flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life. 
52 THE MAN 
steps onto the field. On his uniform is a large "S" with an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve. 
53 RAY 
walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field. 
54 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW 
Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the waist, hands on hips, he waits. 
55 RAY 
Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.

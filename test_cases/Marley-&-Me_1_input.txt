MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) Rein in that dog! All right, everyone, line up again. Demonstration. Mr. Grogan? Pay attention. She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into line with the other dogs. 
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) It's a simple question of confidence in one's own authority. Shall I demonstrate a simple walk? 
JOHN Be my guest. 
MS. KORNBLUT Class? Even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader. Marley? Heel. And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward. Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park. She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a walking tug-of-war. With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down, and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee. John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid. 
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) That's it! He's out! 
JOHN He usually just does this with poodles. (looking at her bad perm) Maybe it's the hair. 
MS. KORNBLUT He's a bad influence on the others. Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes hold in a group - he has to go! 
58 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 
As they follow Marley back into the house. 
JOHN Well, that was fun. (to the dog) Congratulations, Marley. You flunked obedience school. 
JENNY You know, John, there is something else we can do-- 
JOHN (looks at her) No, no, I'm not doing that to him. 
JENNY It's painless. And he'll be a lot more comfortable. It'll calm him down. 
JOHN Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer? Because he'll have nothing to look forward to. 
JENNY What're you talking about? There are plenty of other things that'll make him 
HAPPY-- 
JOHN That's where you're wrong. Trust me, Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah, lots of things make us happy, but the only thing we really look forward to is sex. Runner up: the possibility of sex. 
JENNY Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live 
LONGER-- 
JOHN It'll just feel longer. 
JENNY John, he's out of control. It's the right thing to do. John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed "goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy. 
59 INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY 
Jenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the back, his front paws balanced on the center console. 
JOHN It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see. Sex is overrated. Marley looks-at him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know that... so maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it. Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Poor son-of-a-bitch. A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap... 
JOHN (CONT'D) Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here... Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to catch the fresh air 
JOHN (CONT'D) Least I can do. John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Here you go... John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like he's drunk. 
JOHN (CONT'D) He's so happy. He has no idea what's about to happen to him. Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of the car. 
JENNY He's making me nervous. 
59 CONTINUED: 
JOHN He's fine. He just wants a little 
FRESH-- Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until his front armpits are resting on the glass. 
JENNY John, grab him! Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and scrambling out the window of the moving car. 
JOHN He's onto our evil plan, and he's making a break for it! But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for a foothold... 
60 EXT. INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY BRIDGE - SAME 
As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws... 
61 INT. CAR - SANE 
Jenny gets the car stopped, HORNS HONKING BEHIND THEM. 
JOHN Uh, little help here... John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on for dear life... 
JENNY I got him! 
62 EXT. BRIDGE - SAME

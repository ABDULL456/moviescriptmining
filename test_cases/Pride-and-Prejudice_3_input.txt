BINGLEY Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn. 
117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117 
The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in. despair. 
JANE Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now meet as indifferent acquaintances. 
ELIZABETH 
(LAUGHING) Oh yes? Jane, take care. 
JANE You cannot think me so weak as to be in 
danger now. 
ELIZABETH I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever. 
JANE I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr Darcy. 
ELIZABETH 
(BLURTS OUT) Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I been in love, I could not have been more blind! 
JANE 
(STARES) What do you mean? The door bell rings. 
KITTY (at the window) It is him. He's back. He's come again. â¢ A stunned reaction. 
CUT TO: 
Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear 
Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with embarrassment. 
BINGLEY I, erm, I know this is all very embarrassing, but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane - They all look at him. 
BINGLEY (CONT'D) - alone. 
MRS BENNET Girls. Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so good to see you again so soon. She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other with extreme embarrassment. 
BINGLEY Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say, I have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would like to ask you - 
CUT TO: 
118 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 118 
Mrs Bennet, Kitty, Mary and Mr Bennet are all jostling for a position at the door in order to overhear events inside. 
MARY Ssssshhh! Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the house. 
- CUT TO: 
119 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 119 
â¢ Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause. 
JANE â¢ Yes. A hundred times - yes. Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane beam at them. 
MRS BENNET Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen. 
120 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 120 
Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying. 
121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OVER LOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 121 
Darcy looks down at Longbourn. 
122 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 122 
Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed. 
MR BENNET I am sure they will do well together, 
their tempers are much alike. They will be cheated assiduously by their servants, and be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income.

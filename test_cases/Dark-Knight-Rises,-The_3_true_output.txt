Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he folds into a makeshift shoulder pack. 
PRISONER Supplies for your journey? Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down below the Prisoners start a low chant. As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They circle up to the opening above... Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up again...then he jumps. 
Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing. And Wayne GRABS the ledge above. The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM. 
EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS 
Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation. He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away... 
INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY 
A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders, industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is Stryver, Daggett's functionary. 
STRYVER I want to see Bane! There's been a mistake! Take me to Bane! Fox watches him dragged upstairs... 
INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - MOMENTS LATER 
A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd. 
STRYVER There's been a mistake! Where's Bane?! 
VOICE (O.S.) There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver. 
Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane. 
CRANE You are Philip Stryver, executive vice-president of Daggett Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.) The same Philip Stryver who for years lived like a prince off the blood and sweat of people less powerful? 
STRYVER Call Bane! I'm one of you! Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane. 
CRANE Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing. The choice is yours, death or exile. Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts 'Death'. 
STRYVER Exile. 
CRANE 
(SMASHES GAVEL) Sold...to the man in the cold sweat! Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock... 
EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY 
Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering. 
BLACKGATE INMATE Follow the tick ice. Try to swim - you're dead in minutes. 
STRYVER Has anyone made it? The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking... Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him. 
INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch. 
GORDON Where the hell are they? It's not like we have a lot of time, here. 
COP How long? 
GORDON The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've got about eighteen hours to do something. 
COP To do what? 
GORDON We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake. 
GORDON 
(LOW) That's it? Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes. 
GORDON Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door. 
BLAKE You shouldn't be out on the streets 
EXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY 
Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell. 
FOLEY'S WIFE Jim. He's not here - 
Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her. 
GORDON You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under occupation?! Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed. 
FOLEY Wait in the kitchen, honey. 
GORDON What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard? 
FOLEY Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces. 
GORDON You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned? 
FOLEY This is different and you know it. These guys run the city - the government's done a deal with them 
GORDON Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal - 
FOLEY You move against Bane, the triggerman's gonna hit the button - 
GORDON You think he's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people'?! You think this is part of some revolution? There's one man with his finger on the button - Bane. 
FOLEY We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this. If you still had family here maybe you'd - 
GORDON This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look, I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues. But we've got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell. 
FOLEY I'm sorry Jim. I gotta - 
GORDON Keep your head down? What's that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows? 
FOLEY You don't know that's going to happen. Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there. 
MIRANDA (O.S) I hear you're looking for men, Commissioner. Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs. 
MIRANDA How about me, instead?

Maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights on.  She spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door.  She holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand-written label.  It says "Miles Davis" on it.  She pockets the tape.  She walks to the living room. 
MAGGIE'S POV: 
Ike has placed post-its on a framed picture, using the frame as a bulletin board.  Post-it notes lay out the information he has gathered under headings and subheadings.  Parents "Mother" deceased, subheaded by "Walter" and there is one for "Brian", "Gill", and "Bob".  Maggie smiles and shakes her head.  She rips one post-it down and reads it to herself. 
MAGGIE (reads) "How does she get all these guys to propose?  She's not that beautiful." (snorts) Bite me, paper boy. 
She begins ripping many of other post-it off the picture frame. 
MAGGIE (cont'd) (as she takes post-its) Rude... 
She's ripping them down, fast and furious, then shoves them in her shoulder bag. 
INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUING 
Ike comes down hallway as Harvey puts his shoes out to be shined. 
BACK INSIDE THE ROOM 
Maggie, looking around, discovers the wedding video on the coffee table and grabs that, too. 
MAGGIE (cont'd) Thief! 
THE SOUND OF A KEY IN THE DOOR makes Maggie jump.  She flees to the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door.  Just as Ike enters, he sniffs and looks around the room, instantly knowing something is up.  He sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of Maggie as she closes the bathroom door.  Ike is steaming.  A BUMP sounds from the bathroom.  He goes over to the door and tries the handle. It's locked.  He starts to pound on the door. 
IKE All right, I know you're in there... You steal my research... You're messing with the first amendment now.  Open up. Open up.  You got no place to go. 
INT. IKE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUING 
Ike's wrong.  Maggie is already trying to open the first bathroom window.  It's stuck.  She climbs over the bathtub, opens that window and starts to climb out. 
IKE I want to have a very serious discussion with you as to why you're such a pain in the ass. 
We HEAR Ike slamming his body against the bathroom door. 
As Ike breaks in, he runs to the window and yells after her. 
EXT. IKE'S HOTEL WINDOW - CONTINUOUS 
IKE (cont'd) That's breaking and entering.  I'll call the sheriff. 
MAGGIE You do that.  And remind him he's bringing the wine to the luau.  Thanks. 
She disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off. Ike's neighbor, Harvey, sits reading near his window. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Establishing. 
INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON:  A CASSETTE PLAYER.  We see the familiar handwritten label: "Miles Davis."  "Kind of Blue" plays as Maggie listens in a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she stole from Ike's room.  We see as she reads them: "Father, two- fisted drinker," "Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn't totally trust Maggie," "Bob" -- doesn't love him.  Overwhelmed, she finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music. 
The CAMERA MOVES on the last note on the floor next to her chair. It reads: "SHOWS NO REMORSE". 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. MAIN STREET/BEAUTY PARLOR - NEXT DAY 
It's early morning.  Mrs. Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee to go.  Peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door and goes in. 
INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY 
Peggy enters and starts about her opening duties.  She turns on the lights and turns and sees her friend, Maggie. 
MAGGIE Do you think I flirt with Cory? 
Peggy stops in her track.  Maggie is sitting curled up in a salon chair.  She looks like she hasn't slept. 
PEGGY Good morning to you, too.  You look good. 
MAGGIE Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory? 
PEGGY Yes. 
Maggie looks miserable. 
MAGGIE I don't mean it. 
Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of coffee. 
PEGGY I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.

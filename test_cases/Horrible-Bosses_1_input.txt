NICK Okay, stay close. (CONTINUED) 122 CONTINUED: 122 
KURT (NOT LISTENING) Gotcha. 
The three of them head toward the study. 
123 INT. HARKEN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 123 
Just as Nick and Dale enter, Harken looks up and sees them. 
HARKEN What the hell are you doing here? (TO DALE) You come to stab me a few more times, you lunatic? (TO NICK) And my wife invited you? Are you fucking her too? 
Nick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be cool and threatening. 
NICK We know what you did, Harken. 
HARKEN What does that mean? 
NICK We were there. We saw you kill him. 
HARKEN (TURNING DEAD SERIOUS) So what is this? A shakedown? You think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wife's lover? 
Nick winces. So close. 
DALE (BLURTING OUT) Say his name. 
Nick and Harken turn to Dale. 
HARKEN What? 
(CONTINUED) 123 CONTINUED: 123 
DALE The guy you killed. What was his name? 
HARKEN Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't matter anymore. 
NICK There it is! (turning to Dale) Let's go, guys -- 
He freezes as he sees for the first time that Kurt didn't accompany them into the study. It's just him and Dale. Nick looks around, panicked. 
HARKEN Yeah, I killed Pellit -- 
NICK Hang on. Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend, KURT -- 
HARKEN I walked right up to his door and I shot him in his fucking chest, and I'll tell you something: I liked it. So if you think I'm a pussy who won't do the same exact thing to some half-assed blackmailer, guess again. 
NICK (looking back at the LIVING ROOM) You know who really thinks you're a pussy is my friend Kurt. Let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just -- 
HARKEN You're pathetic, Waters. You come into my home, on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit? Well, guess what? You're a dead man. You... (TO DALE) ... you, and your friend Kurt, whoever the fuck he is. Dead. Men. 
(CONTINUED) 123 CONTINUED: (2) 123 
DALE (SOFTLY) We didn't know it was your birthday. 
Harken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small safe. He begins turning the combination lock. 
NICK What are you doing? What's in that? 
HARKEN My gun. Just give me a second. 
Nick and Dale exchange a look, then quickly rush out of the room. 
124 INT. HARKEN'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 124 
looking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their way through the partygoers. 
NICK We had him! We had the whole thing. What happened to Kurt? 
Just then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in the face. 
KURT Oh, hey. 
NICK `Hey'?! Where were you?! 
KURT Uh, I had to go to the bathroom. Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to record Harken? 
NICK You're too late, Kurt! He confessed the whole damn thing! 
DALE More than once! Then he told us we were dead men! He's getting his gun right now! 
KURT Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked up. (CONTINUED) 124 CONTINUED: 124 
NICK Yeah, you -- 
Suddenly, the bathroom door opens again and out steps Mrs. Harken, also looking disheveled. She adjusts her dress then rejoins the party.

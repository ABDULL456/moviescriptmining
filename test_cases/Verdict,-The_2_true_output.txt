He is manhandling Galvin toward the back of the funeral parlor. The Son calls after him: 
SON Who the hell do you think you are? 
EXT. SECOND FUNERAL PARLOR - AFTERNOON 
The Funeral Manager and Galvin standing in the cold. 
FUNERAL MANAGER I don't want you coming back here. Ever. Do you understand? 
GALVIN I was just talking to... 
FUNERAL MANAGER Those are bereaved people in there. 
The Funeral Manager gives Galvin a small shove, and goes back to his post at the door, greeting the entering mourners. 
"Good evening..." 
ANGLE 
Galvin, the ground cut out from under him. Standing watching the mourners enter. 
EXT. SECOND FUNERAL STREET - DUSK 
Galvin walking down a residential street. He has been walking a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic. 
Lights a cigarette. The light changes. He looks both ways and irresolutely starts across the street. He stops. He checks his watch. He sighs, and starts back in the opposite direction. 
INT. O'ROURKE'S BAR - NIGHT 
Galvin holding forth at the bar of a seedy drinking-man's establishment, THREE DRINKERS, acquaintances, standing around him, appreciative. 
GALVIN Pat says, 'Mike... there's a new bar, you go in, for a half a buck you get a beer, a free lunch, and then take you in the back room and they get you laid.' 
The bartender, JIMMY, comes up to Galvin. 
JIMMY Another, Frank...? 
GALVIN (gestures to include group) ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...' (gestures to Jimmy) Everyone. Buy yourself one too. 
INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files, carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass. 
He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing. Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so. 
He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..." He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still- ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink. 
As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention. 
Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of degrees. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
The empty wall. Galvin's P.O.V. The telephone heard Voice Over insisting, "Frank..." 
INT. GALVIN'S OFFICE ANTEROOM - NIGHT 
MICKEY MORRISSEY, a man in his late sixties, dressed in suit and overcoat, looking worried, unlocks the door to the dark anteroom. Looks around. Sees something in the next room. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
Galvin asleep on his couch, clothed as before. Covered in his overcoat, the bottle and glass next to the couch on the floor, the sound of the phone off the hook. 
ANGLE 
Mickey walks into the office. Stands looking at Galvin. 
MICKEY (harshly) Get up. (beat, more harshly) Get up. 
Galvin wakes up. Looks around. Swings his legs over the couch. Drinks from the glass. Vacantly: 
GALVIN Hi, Mickey... 
MICKEY What the hell do you think you're doing...? (surveys the wrecked office) What's going on here...? 
GALVIN Uh... 
MICKEY Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...

Simon forces his attention to Jackie. 
SIMON Sorry. What are those cards? 
JACKIE (a bit embarrassed) Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you. 
SIMON (scared shitless) Terrify me? 
JACKIE See, he's right. I need the cards. (reading from cards) Simon, you're broke. 
ANGLE ON VERDELL 
as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed. 
JACKIE (O.S.) The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you. 
SIMON (O.S.) Well, I can't reach them. 
Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns for: 
SIMON (to Verdell) Here, baby...  what is it, Verdell?...  You miss the tough guy... (trying to be Melvin-like) Well, here I am, you little pissant mop, happy to see me? How about another ride down the chute? Oh, God...  I don't mean it, sweetheart... (on Jackie's look) I'm sorry. I know... 
Verdell hides behind a chair. 
JACKIE Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that -- (reading from card) -- as a businessman, with limited resources... 
SIMON I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me. 
As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card. 
SIMON (overwhelmed) Wow... 
Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet the dog and the dog ducks. 
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset. He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits. 
INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY 
We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering phone calls, "Premier Publishing." 
FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.) Yes, you write more than anyone else. Yes, you make us a lot of money, but isn't there someone more appropriate to... 
MELVIN (O.S.) I need this. Just say, "Melvin, I'll try," okay? 
FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.) (resigned) Melvin, I'll try. 
They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She pauses at the elevator. 
FEMALE EXECUTIVE Now, on a pleasant note, our son got accepted at Brown. My husband... 
MELVIN (curtly) Great, wonderful. I don't need you to wait with me. 
She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe summons her moxie. 
ZOE I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me. 
MELVIN What's it mean? 
ZOE That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... (taps her head and heart) in here. 
MELVIN Oh God, this is like a nightmare. 
ZOE Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that? 
As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button etc. 
ZOE How do you write women so well?

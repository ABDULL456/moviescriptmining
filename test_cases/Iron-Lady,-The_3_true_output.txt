She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has found in Denis's cupboard. There is a programme from `The King and I' and a faded blue rosette from some long forgotten election campaign. A small flyer `Margaret Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford' and some childrens cards "to the world's greatest Daddy love Mark and Carol." 
MARGARET V/O All I wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy - happier than I was certainly. And I wanted you to be happy of course. Were you happy, Denis? Tell me the truth. 
There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the room. 
Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags. 
As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis - 
His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera. 
Laughing on the beach in Cornwall. 
At the door of Number 10, smiling at her. 
Sharing her bed. 
MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it on the top of the case. 
MARGARET Denis? Denis? 
And there he is by her side. 
MARGARET V/O Here's your bag. You're all packed, sorted. 
She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle kiss. DENIS starts to walk away. 
MARGARET (seeing he is walking away in his socks) Denis wait...Where are your shoes? You can't go without shoes! Not yet. 
DENIS straightens his hat. 
DENIS Steady. 
MARGARET Yes...Steady... 
DENIS Steady the buffs - 
MARGARET Steady...Steady the buffs... 
DENIS heading out. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) 154d                 NO...Not yet...Denis. Wait...I              154d said I don't want you to go yet. The endless corridor, MARGARET calling after DENIS- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Denis...Please...No...Not...Don't. ..NO...I don't...I don't want to be on my own. DENIS turns back for a moment - 
DENIS You're going to be fine on your own, love. (beat) You always have been. MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the very far end of the house and appears to disappear into the white light- MARGARET (calling out) Denis!! 
INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAWN From above we see MARGARET lying dead asleep on the bed on a pile of DENIS' clothes. The bed is surrounded by bulging black bin bags. 
CAROL OOV Mummy- CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified. CAROL My God, Mum. Are you alright? (opening the curtains) Mummy you should have called for help, silly old sausage. Have you not even been in your bed properly? You've done all this? MARGARET Yes, all sorted. Finished. MARGARET looks around her. 
CAROL Yes well don't worry about all this. June and I will crack on with it. MARGARET I was just going to get dressed. 
CAROL ...Shall I call someone, see if anyone can come over and do your hair? MARGARET looks at her warmly. MARGARET Oh. No, you do it. 
CAROL reacts, surprised but pleased. 
INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. MARGARET sit finishing a cup of tea. Hears Carol's bustle in the downstairs hallway.

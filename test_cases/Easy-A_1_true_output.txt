RHIANNON I think I speak for all of the female students and faculty - and maybe a couple of males - when I say that I liked Todd much better when he was shirtless. I actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of -- what do they call it? 
OLIVE School spirit. 
RHIANNON Yeah. That's it. 
OLIVE Even dressed as a meerkat, I still fantasize about him. 
RHIANNON Ha! What are those people called again? The ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it? 
OLIVE Communists. 
Rhiannon laughs. 
RHIANNON Shhh. Don't let Marianne hear you say that word. The last thing we need is McCarthyism at Barbara Bush. 
OLIVE Isn't high school already a hotbed of just that? 
RHIANNON True. (Beat.) Yeah, I'd totally fuck Meerkat Todd. 
They both get lost in the thought. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Into the webcam -- 
OLIVE So, of course, immediately I knew that the little white lie I told to my then-best-friend in the ladies room would come back to bite me on the ass. However, even I - who my fourth grade teacher stated on my report card `has an imagination that should be quickly expunged' - had no idea how quickly this article of fiction would spread. So, now we move on to Part Two: The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude. 
INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Olive loads books into her locker. She sees Marianne walk past with Nina. They give her a repulsed look. 
Olive decides to nip this in the bud. She catches up to them. 
OLIVE Hey Marianne, can I talk to you for a second? 
Nina, reluctantly, gives them a moment alone. 
MARIANNE (EXASPERATED) What? 
OLIVE Listen, what you heard in the bathroom, that wasn't true. It's actually a funny story. Do you ever watch `The Brady Bunch'? 
MARIANNE Olive - that's your name, right? 
Olive knows that Marianne knows her name, but obligingly nods. 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) I'm not the one you have to answer to for your depraved behavior. There is a higher power to judge your indecency. 
OLIVE (JOKINGLY) Who? The guidance counselor? 
MARIANNE (ICILY) I hope for your sake, God has a sense of humor. 
OLIVE Oh, I have sixteen years worth of anecdotal proof that He does. 
Olive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of GUYS, who are looking at Olive, intrigued. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) (SOTTO VOCE) Damn it. 
Marianne sees what her friend is doing and smiles at Olive, coldly. 
MARIANNE Look. You've made your bed. I just hope for your sake, you cleaned the sheets. 
She turns on her heels and leaves Olive behind. 
OLIVE (TO HERSELF) Did I just get saved? 
She shakes off her attempt and continues on her way, walking past the guys who smile at her. This alarms her. 
GUY IN HALL Hey Olive. How's it going? 
Without stopping -- 
OLIVE I'm swell, guy-I've-never-laid-eyes- on-before. Thanks for asking.

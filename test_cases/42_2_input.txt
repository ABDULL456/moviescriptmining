164 INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - BROOKLYN - DAY 164 
Rickey looks up as Reese enters. He holds a LETTER. 
RICKEY What can I do for you, Pee Wee? 
REESE Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this, the series in Cincinnati next week. 
RICKEY It's an important road trip, we're only three games out of first. 
REESE Yes, sir. You know, I'm from Kentucky. 
RICKEY Cincinnati's nearly a home game for you. 
REESE I got this letter, sir. I guess some people aren't too happy about me playing with Robinson. Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the letter, scans it, reads the highlights... 
RICKEY Nigger lover. Watch yourself. We will get you, carpetbagger. (holds it out) Typical stuff. Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt. 
REESE It's not typical to me. 
RICKEY How many of these letters have you gotten, Pee Wee? 
REESE Just this. Ain't that enough? Rickey looks Reese over a moment. Pushing back his chair he steps over to a filing cabinet. 
WHITE 3-14-12 101. Motioning Reese to join him, he pulls open a drawer, pulls out a 4-inch stack of flattened letters, then another, then a third. He looks to Reese. 
REESE (CONT'D) What are those? 
RICKEY I'll tell you what they aren't, they aren't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club. Here -- He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands. As Reese flips through the stack of hate, reads: 
REESE Get out of baseball, or your baby boy will die. 
(NEXT ONE) Quit baseball or your Nigger wife will be... Reese trails off, won't say it out loud. Skips to another. 
REESE (CONT'D) Get out of the game or be killed. He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not utter it. Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked. 
REESE (CONT'D) Does Jackie know? 
RICKEY Of course he knows. And the FBI. They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously. So excuse me if I'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger. You should be proud of it! 
REESE We'd just like to play ball, Mr. Rickey. That's all we want to do. 
RICKEY I understand. I bet Jackie just wants to play ball. I bet he wishes he wasn't leading the league in hit by pitch. I bet he wishes people didn't want to kill him. But the world isn't so simple anymore. I'm not sure it ever was. We just, baseball ignored it. Now we can't. 
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 102. 
REESE 
(QUIET) Yes, Sir. I gotta get to practice. 
CUT TO: 
A 10-YEAR OLD BOY 165 165 In the stands. Freckled, cute. Looking at the men around him, his own FATHER SHOUTING at Jack as the Dodgers take the field (the Reds coming off it). Jack headed for first. Pee Wee out to short. 
FRECKLES Nigger! (then...) We don't want you here! INSERT: Crosley Field, Cincinnati, June 21, 1947. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE Cincinnati fans expressing their displeasure as the Dodgers take the field. Jackie Robinson at first. The Brat Eddie Stanky at second. Spider Jorgensen at third. And the captain Pee Wee Reese at shortstop. 
(A BEAT) Ask any man and they'll tell you that the Gillette Superspeed razor is a honey. Maybe the sweetest shaving razor you'll ever use.

168 EXT. INFIELD - CROSLEY FIELD - DAY 168 
Jack reaches first, throws the ball around the infield. Many in the crowd beyond rise to jeer and heap abuse. COON! SHINE! Jack tries to let it wash over him. At short, Reese receives the ball, moves to throw to first when he pauses. Deciding, he suddenly moves to trot across the diamond until he's alongside Jack. 
JACK What's up? Now cries of CARPETBAGGER! cut through. PEE WEE, HOW CAN YOU PLAY WITH THIS BLACK BASTARD!? Reese stares up at the worst hecklers along the first base line. He looks a little sad. 
REESE They can say what they want; we're here to play baseball. 
JACK Just a bunch of crackpots still fighting the Civil War. 
REESE Hell, we'd a won that son of a gun if the cornstalks had held out. We just ran out of ammunition. Jack laughs. Reese has a funny way of saying it. 
JACK Better luck next time, Pee Wee. Reese impulsively puts his arm around Jack's shoulder, stares into the Cincy dugout. 
REESE Ain't gonna be a next time. All we got is right now. This right here. Know what I mean? Walker reacting out in right. The crowd shuts down, some in shock at the gesture. Jack surprised also. 
REESE (CONT'D) Thank you, Jackie. 
JACK What're you thanking me for? 
REESE I've got family here from Louisville. Up there somewhere. I need âem to know who I am.

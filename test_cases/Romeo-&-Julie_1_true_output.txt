ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. 
Romeo leaps from the car. Benvolio yells after him. 
BENVOLIO Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo! 
EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. 
Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate. At the gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles. Romeo uses the traffic to shield himself from view. 
Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base of the high stone wall that borders the compound. 
EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. 
Mercutio's car prowls back along the bridge. The last guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut. The convertible halts in front of them. 
BENVOLIO He ran this way. Call, good Mercutio. 
MERCUTIO Nay, I'll conjure too. 
Mercutio leaps from the car. He postures like a magician in a low-budget variety special. The boys cheer him on. 
MERCUTIO Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh. And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us! 
EXT. CAPULET WALL. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: Romeo's fake chain mail shirt tangled in the barbed wire at the top of the wall. 
PAN DOWN: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by the wire. 
Mercutio's cavorting echoes from the bridge. Romeo smiles ironically. 
ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound. 
Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet estate. 
EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT. 
The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the bridge in imitation of a love sick fool. 
MERCUTIO O Romeo, that she were, O that she 
WERE An open-arse and thou a poperin pear! 
The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam. The sound of automatic weapons cocking pierces the night. 
CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He's brave but not stupid. He gets back into the car. 
MERCUTIO (CONT.) Come, shall we go? 
EXT. THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. 
CLOSE ON: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining wall of a terraced garden. Romeo's face appears between them. 
Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco- Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes with light. Romeo takes cover. 
ROMEO But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? 
Romeo's question is answered as out onto the verandah comes Juliet. She is still clad in her angel robe, but without the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level. 
ROMEO It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with 
GRIEF That thou her maid art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs. She is directly below Romeo as he whispers. 
ROMEO (CONT.) Cast it off! 
Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the water. 
ROMEO (CONT.) It is my lady. O, it is my love! O that she knew she were! 
Juliet sighs. 
JULIET Ay me! 
ROMEO 
(WHISPERS) She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel! 
Juliet looks longingly toward the stars. 
JULIET O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet. 
CLOSE ON: Romeo. Incredulous. 
ROMEO Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 
JULIET 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou are thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is not hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. 
Romeo wildly calls: 
ROMEO I take thee at thy word! Call me but love, and I'll be new baptised. Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

BENI (struggling) Why do you like to fight so much? 
O'CONNELL 'Cause I look good doin, it. 
Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them. 
A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone. 
Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, she hears something coming up behind her and spins around. 
A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises his scimitar, about to strike. 
Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins. 
At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune. 
Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them. 
Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams. 
JONATHAN Let 'em have it, boys! 
Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins. 
JONATHAN I say, bloody good show. 
And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat. 
O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES! 
Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray points his scimitar at O'Connell's head. 
ARDETH RAY LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE OR DIE! 
Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her and holds her close. 
O'CONNELL You alright? 
Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too. 
EVELYN Yes,... fine,... thank you. 
Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and Burns help Daniels to his feet. 
DANIELS See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand! 
HENDERSON For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there. 
O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied. 
O'CONNELL These men are a desert people. They value water, not gold. 
Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried. 
EVELYN Where's Jonathan? 
EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open. 
Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk. 
O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly -- 
EVELYN Unlike my brother, sir, I know when to say no. 
O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away. 
O'CONNELL Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew. 
EVELYN I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this? 
O'CONNELL Something like that. 
EVELYN Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself 
O'CONNELL Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here? 
Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet. 
EVELYN I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am. 
O'CONNELL And what is that? 
Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins and proudly lifts her head high. 
EVELYN ...I am a librarian!

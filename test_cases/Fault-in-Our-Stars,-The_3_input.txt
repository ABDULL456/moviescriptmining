MICHAEL That's fantastic. 
GUS I'm very lucky. ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to like what she sees a lot more than before. BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs: 
MICHAEL Son, you have to understand... Hazel's still pretty sick. She will be the rest of her life. ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what she's doing and listens. 
MICHAEL She'll want to keep up with you - she's that kind of girl - but the truth is, her lungs -- 
HAZEL You ready Gus? Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO: 
EXT PARK - LATER Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together. 
HAZEL Is this where you bring all your romantic conquests? 
GUS Every last one. 
(BEAT) Probably why I'm still a virgin. Hazel laughs, elbows him. 
HAZEL You're not a virgin. (off his look) Are you really? Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it. 
GUS See this? This circle is virgins... Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle. 
GUS And this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg. Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play. 
GUS 
(EXPLAINING) "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout. 
HAZEL He sounds Dutch. 
GUS And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And tulips. Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket. 
GUS Sandwich? 
HAZEL Let me guess -- 
GUS 
(NODS) Dutch cheese. And tomato. (she takes one) The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry. They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play on the bones. 
GUS How cool is that? A skeleton being used as a playground. 
HAZEL You do love your symbols. 
GUS Speaking of which... Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He clears his throat. 
GUS You're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a Rik Smits jersey. 
HAZEL It has crossed my mind. 
GUS Hazel Grace, like so many before you - and I say this with great affection - you spent your Wish... moronically. 
HAZEL I was thir-- 
GUS Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here. 
HAZEL Sorry. Please, continue... 
GUS You were young. Impressionable. The Grim Reaper staring you in the face. And the fear of dying with your one true Wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little Hazel Grace, having never read "An Imperial Affliction" ever know that her one TRUE wish was to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile. Hazel nods in agreement. 
GUS If you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self. 
Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused. 
HAZEL But I... didn't save it. Gus smiles. 
GUS Good thing I saved mine. Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about? 
GUS Got it in exchange for the leg.

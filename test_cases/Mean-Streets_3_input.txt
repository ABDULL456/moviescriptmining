The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian. 
SINGERS Good night...Good night...thank you...good night! 
The band plays a few bars of "Home Sweet Home." The singers throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go in.

MICHAEL'S CAR - PARKED 
MICHAEL'S car is parked in a deserted area on the docks. He has his head in his hands. The BOY with him says nothing. 
CUT TO: 
STREET CORNER 
CHARLIE is still in shock, sitting on the curb. 
The police are still walking around in a businesslike manner. 
CHARLIE stares down at his feet. The wrecked car is being pulled away. 
CHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to himself and seems shocked and bewildered. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Early morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens. CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing something a little ominous. 
CHARLIE My uncle didn't come? 
MARIO says nothing, just nods at him to step outside. CHARLIE goes out into the street. MARIO follows. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
There is practically no one on the street. The early morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits at the bottom of the steps. 
MARIO (pauses for a moment) Giovanni says now he done enough. He got you outta jail. Now... (reaching in pocket) he wants you outta the way. 
MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket. 
MARIO He says use it. Don't sell it. He says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe. 
CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously uncomfortable. 
MARIO (ABRUPTLY) Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - DAY 
TONY'S car. He is driving CHARLIE to the airport. A suitcase can be seen in the back seat. 
TONY Where to? 
CHARLIE (PREOCCUPIED) Kennedy. 
TONY (trying to be jolly) I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'? 
CHARLIE It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350. 
TONY So? 
CHARLIE (EDGY) So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.

ANCHORWOMAN This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes ten years ago. Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on screen. 
HOLLIS Well, forced all of you guys out except one. 
(BEAT) Next week? Dan nods, then leaves. 
EXT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Dan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment reads: "MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!" 
INT. SUBWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him. ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far. 
GANG LEADER Move your leg. 
DAN What? 
GANG LEADER I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass. 
EXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert. His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED. There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house. 
INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS. 
INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find-- 
DAN Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN 
OF BEANS. 
RORSCHACH Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind? 
DAN No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you? 
RORSCHACH No need. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but at the same time, Dan is wary. 
DAN You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop. 
RORSCHACH Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization. 
DAN Other than that . How have you been keeping? 
RORSCHACH Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH. 
DAN This little stain, is that bean juice or-- 
RORSCHACH Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead. 
DAN The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. DAN (cont'd) Let's talk downstairs. 
INT. DAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Rorschach follows Dan to a CLOSET, at the end of the hall. Dan opens the closet, revealing an old BOOKSHELF. With some difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark. 
INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT 
The two men descend into Dan's WORKSHOP--the dusty remnants of a hero's LAB; Old computers and an OWL-COSTUME, hanging in a locker. No-one has been down here for years. In the center of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship. 
DAN How did it happen? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH Murder. Someone threw him out a window. 
DAN Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was.

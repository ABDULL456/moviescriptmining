{"train": "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels \nBy Guy Ritchie \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT \nThis whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, tapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright  pair of eyes. One is bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their clarity. \nEDDY Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one. So you want to play? \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. \nFADE IN: \nWhat have you got? \nWe cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good hand. A flush beats my pair. What about you? \n* Cut from completed film. \nAnother pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards: a run is revealed. \nAnd here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all hustlers! \nWe cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You got some real money? \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN. \nFADE IN: \nEd scoops up a large pile of money. \nOdds chaps, you gotta remember the odds. \nThere ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman who has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players are also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with embarrassment. \nSERG I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward? \nEDDY I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can feel a case of the flu coming on and . . . \nSERG (interrupts) All right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need to know what's going on, son. \nEDDY If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded. \nDISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS. \nWe pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in the inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK STOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We wait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then see one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS joins the sentence.] \nEXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY \nWe open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery on a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming volume at which he is advertising his wares. \nBACON See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny- by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you here today I would make more money with me measuring tape. \nA well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd waving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it. \nEDDY Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you say? I'll have five. \nCertainly sir. I'll just wrap. \nChanging his attention. \nBACON Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that. \nEd looks in bag. \nEDDY Are you sure you can afford twenty-five? \nSOAP Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon? \nTom looks on with suspicion. \nTOM Who's this fat man, then? \nEDDY Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nA hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk. On this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a judge's hammer. Harry is obviously in the sex game. Cluttered up in a hazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc. A cabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind. We have a split screen involving EDDY and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with one hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun. \nHATCHET You got it all? \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY. \nEDDY A hundred grand. \nFREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET \nTOM (voice-over) You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters. \nEDDY (voice-over) The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him. \nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET \nHATCHET Well if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . . \nThe phone is slammed down. \nSHOT OF HATCHET \nSOAP (voice-over) When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons. \nBACON (voice-over) Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart. \nCut from completed film. \nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET \nHATCHET What's this EDDY like, then? \nThe camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting opposite Hatchet. Meet Barry the Baptist. \nFREEZE SHOT OF BARRY \nEDDY (voice-over) Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist. \nBACON (voice-over) The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet. \nTOM (voice-over) But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled and jobs get done. \nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY \nBARRY EDDY been shaking the knees of a lot of good players. The boy has a rare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow . . \nHATCHET (interrupts) All right, all right, so we can say he is good. \nBARRY Better than good, he is a fucking liability. \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - EVENING \nEd, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they pass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other, and go to their separate doors. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBACON places a pile of money on a table. The rest are eating, Tom keeps looking at his plate distastefully. \nBACON Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it. \nEDDY I still will, if you don't mind. \nTOM (eating) So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences. \nSOAP That's going on optimism. \nTOM Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course. \nSOAP You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not. \nTom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact. He examines himself to see if something has developed. \nTOM Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about? \nThe light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to cower in a sharp defensive action. \nJesus! It's good in here, ain't it! Trains overhead, walls exploding . . . Why the hell did you move in? \nEDDY Because it's cheap like a budgie. \nBACON And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know. \nBACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall. \nTOM What do you mean? \nEDDY He means they're thieving dogs. \nBACON I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs. \nBACON opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips. The noise from next door immediately gets louder. \nNot exactly thick, these walls. \nDOG (off) No you prat, that's for me. \nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nDog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his lads. \nDOG How many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job worth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you have a problem with that? \nHe obviously doesn't. \nINT. ED AIVD BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nTom raises his eyebrows and frowns to Bacon. \nEXT. BIG BOY'S GYM/SOLARiUM - NIGHT \nMeet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old). \nBIG CHRIS How long has he been in there, son? \nJOHN O'DRISCOLL I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there. \nBIG CHRIS Son, have a look in his locker. \nJOHN O'DRISCOLL No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there? \n* Cut from completed film. \nBIG CHRIS Yeah, all right. \nBig Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again. Now, you want me to lift it up again? \nLittle Chris pipes up. Obviously familiar with counting money he has flown through it. \nLITTLE CHRIS He's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his wallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in your pocket? \nThe expression on Big Chris's face changes. \nBIG CHRIS Oi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't! \nLITTLE CHRTS Sorry, Dad. \nBIG CHRIS Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in a plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan has faded, you want to have paid. \nChris punches John unconscious and turns the time dial up. \nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT \nJD's bar is an impressive sort of uptown-downtown establishment with pretty girls serving a laddish clientele. The boys are propped up at the bar, looking straight ahead in silence. They look nervous. The silence is broken by Ed. \nEDDY I am going to the john. \nHe walks off. \nTOM What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in. \nSOAP Tom, you're all heart. \nTOM Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests. \nJD (the bar owner and Ed's father) All right lads? How's things? How's it going, Soap? Cooking all right? Where's that son of mine? \nEach time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left with their mouths open, which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks through the bar (Daisy). \nINT. SLOANES' HOUSE LABORATORY - NIGHT \nWe cut to a small, humid, artificially lit, illegal forest being cultivated for profit. Someone is smoking a joint and raising his eyebrows at his friend. These two characters are J and Charles; they have got hair down to their shoulders, small try-hard goatees and science-lab coats, with nothing much underneath. \nJ (coughing) This gear is getting heavier you know, Charles. I got a suspicion we should have been rocket scientists, or Noble Peace Prize winners or something. \nA horn blows (the door bell). \nCHARLES Who the hell is that? \nINT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe door opens to reveal Willy. Under each arm is a large bag of fertilizer. \nWILLY Give me a hand Charlie, I could break sweat at any second. \nA voice comes from behind them. At the top of the stairs stands Winston. He slowly starts to walk down. \nWINSTON Charles, why have we got this cage? \nDEAN Like what? \nBARRY Like antiques. \nDEAN Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques? \nBARRY If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place. \nGARY So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for? \nBARRY You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know. \nGARY I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it? \nBARRY Careful, remember who's giving you this job. \nA bit of confused eye-rolling goes on. Barry eventually looks at his watch. \nI am off, it's all yours now. Call me when you're done. \nAs he leaves, the two Scousers eye him distastefully. \nGARY (to Dean) I hate these Southern shites. \nBARRY (on his way out, whispering to himself) Fucking Northern monkeys. \nEXT. BOXING CLUB ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nEDDY and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their appearance. They are met by a doorman. \nDOORMAN Invitations. \nEDDY Invitations? \nDOORMAN Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it. \nEDDY Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do? \nDOORMAN All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door. \nEDDY Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . . \nDOORMAN Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one. \nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT \nEDDY enters the boxing gym on his own, and raises his eyebrows at the thought of climbing into the ring. Everybody else is sitting down counting their money and converting it to chips. Ed takes the only empty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind. \nEDDY Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it supposed to be symbolic? \nPHIL/DON All right Ed. Apparently it's for security. \nEDDY I would have brought my gloves if I had known. \nHATCHET You must be Eddy. JD's son. \nEDDY Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father. \nHATCHET Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that. \nThere is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards. EDDY \nEvening Tanya, it has been a while. \nHATCHET Four hundred open. \nFRAZER Eight hundred. Like that, do ya, son? \nEDDY When my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind. \nINT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT \nBarry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch monitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table. The camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts. Barry zooms in, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to view his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind. He hasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do. We cut to Barry's other hand. He is pressing a button on a remote control. We cut straight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse. \nBOXING GYM - NIGHT \nHATCHET Listen ladies, this is cards. Men play cards, you want to talk soft you should be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play. (dramatic pause) I fold. \nFRAZER Two thousand open. \nEDDY One thousand blind. \nDON Two thousand open. \nFRAZER Deep end, eh? Fold. \nEDDY Two thousand blind. \nDON You what? \nThere is a pause as Don examines Ed's brow looking for a trace of nerves. \nTwo grand? You're still blind. You have been eating too much English beef, mate; honkers, mad. \nHATCHET Well, you going to play? \nCut from completed film. \nDON Fucking right I am going to play. Three thousand, there. \nCROUPIER Four thousand to an open man, you know that. \nWe can feel the confidence emanating from Eddy. Don continues to search Ed's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry as a desert disco. \nEDDY Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the anti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold. \nSilence. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT. \nDon is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing. \nEXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT \nThe Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large house. \nDEAN OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right? \nGARY All right, Kenny. \nDean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking pulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an artificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top. \nDEAN Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny? \nGARY It just cost me fifty quid to have this done. (Lovingly rearranging his hair) If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny. \nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT \nDOG What they like then? \nPLANK Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite. \nINT. JD'S BAR - DAY \nSoap is finishing off his suggestion for raising money. \nSOAP And you keep all the money' \nPause. BACON and Tom frown at Soap. \nTOM I have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes Bacon's sound inspired. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nEd fumbles with his keys at his front door. He enters his house in a sort of zombie state, takes off his jacket and opens the cupboard doors. He hangs his coat up (it promptly falls off\" the hanger) and he collapses in a pile on the floor. The cupboard doors now being open, he can clearly hear next door's discussion. We track in very slowly on Ed. \nPLANK They ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks. They're just good at growing weed, that's all, and business has got bigger than what they can keep up with. \nINT. JD'S BAR - DAY \nSOAP If you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion? \nBACON I am thinking, I am thinking. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nDOG (off) Listen, they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash sitting in shoe boxes, a skip-load of Class A gear and you don't think there is anybody sensible involved. \nWe reach the end of our track. Ed's head is on a pitiful angle in full close-up. It straightens and his dark eyes widen immediately on this news. \nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY \nDOG \nWhat about security? \nPLANK There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it. \nDOG What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then? \nPLANK I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff. \nDOG Is there no way they can get back to you? \nPLANK Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots. \nIN'T. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nBarry and Harry are talking. Harry is polishing a shotgun. It is very different in appearance to the hammer-locks. \nHATCHET \nIs Big Chris on his way? \nBARRY Should be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry. That's a lot of money for Chris to be running after. I wouldn't trust him to bring it back here. \nHatchet's speech is laced with cut-aways of Big Chris in action, and on the ascent (with Little Chris) of Hatchet's stairs. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY \nHATCHET (voice-over) What do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he will make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way. His dad used to collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy will after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old Nick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never nicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the bow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he found ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a runaway train, and he hits twice as hard. Heaven protect anyone who touches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting. \n* Cut from completed film. \nWINSTON Hello. \nDAISY (she is upset) Winston? \nWINSTON Yeah. \nDAISY It's Daisy. \nWINSTON I know who it is. What's the problem? \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe situation has been explained. There are thoughtful frowns on all foreheads. There is a pause. \nSOAP Well, what do you want us to do about it? \nEDDY Hit the fuckers. \nPause while this is digested. \nI know it sounds a bit heavy, but it's not like you are doing anything illegal. \nBACON I don't know how you've reached that conclusion. \nEDDY They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they? \nTOM How heavy are the fellas anyway? \nEDDY \nThey don't look all that. \nSOAP \nHitler didn't look all that. \nEDDY All right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the silver spoon. If you can think of another way to get out, let me know. It's not like we've got all the time in the world either . . . Dig? \nSilence falls over them.] \nBACON \nI am game. \nTOM \nMe too. \nS0AP \nOh, god! \nEDDY Well, we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and prepared for them. \nPause as Ed's voice drops a little. And they are armed. \nSOAP What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what? \nEDDY Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit! \nSOAP Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . \nNICK Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am? \nTOM I think you're Nick the Greek. \nINT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY \nThere's a cacophony of seventies funk and football filling the room. We meet Rory Breaker. Rory is a very well-dressed cool-looking black dude. He is in his own way sophisticated, considering what he does for a living. His help, however, are less well-informed. Rory has Nick the Greek in front of him. \nRORY Nick, I don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is what he says it is, I'll give him three and a half thousand a key, that's if it is what he says it is. I don't want to see it after a sample, I don't want to touch it after a sample. I'll leave you in the capable hands of Nathan here. He will work out the details, but let me get this straight. If the milk turns out to be sour, I ain't the kind of pussy who will drink it. Know what I mean? \nINT. GARAGE UNDER THE ARCHES - DAY \nThe Scousers are handing over all the shotguns from their previous job to Barry and assistant. Dean has got a complicated hair arrangement to disguise his accident with the butler. Barry raises his eyebrows at this new look. \nBARRY Is your hair supposed to look like that, then? \nGary ignores this question. \nDEAN Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars. \nBARRY Where're the others? \nBarry is looking with same concern for the hammer-lock Purdeys. \nDEAN There are no others. \nBARRY Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones? \nDEAN I don't know what you mean. \nBARRY (dead serious) There were two old guns there; where are they? \nDEAN Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em! \nBARRY Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish. \nDEAN They were . . . \nBARRY (interrupts) I am not fucking interested. \nShouting. If you don't want to end up counting the fingers that you haven't got, or sharing a bed with the anti-Christ, I suggest you get those guns, quick. \nINT. BACK OF VAN - DAY \nWe are facing Nick's large behind, builder's cleavage poking out of the top of his trousers. Nick is unwrapping two long implements from a sheet: the hammer-lock Purdeys. \nTOM Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from? \nNICK I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect. \nTOM They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets? \nNICK Seven hundred each. \nTOM What's that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know they're antiques, but I ain't paying antique prices. Pause. \nAnd they're a bit long, aren't they? \nNICK Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays. \nTOM Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean. \nNICK Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary. \nThen devastation slaps him hard. \nKeep the gates locked now, do you? \nJ Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days. \nPLANK I know. (Suddenly turning very nasty whispering.) Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left. \nJ (confused and believing it's a joke, until he sees the gun.) What are you doing, Plank? \nPLANK What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate. \nJ has found it all too much and has passed out with fear, collapsing on the floor in an awkward contorted position. Plank is desperately trying to find the right key. Things are not going as well as planned. Dog, in the meantime, has decided it's time to start the show \nEXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY \nDOG Go! Go! Go! Fucking run, you two. \nThey all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into Plank. The keys go flying out of Plank's hands and through the cage. Plank cries with frustration, reaching out with his hand to retrieve them. Dog, finding the gate locked, is none too happy They are also still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between the outside door and the inside cage. \nINT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY \nDOG (mesmerized} The fucking gate's shut, you prick. \nPLANK Just hold on, I got the keys. \nHaving clawed them back with the end of his shotgun. \nDOG (seeing an unconscious man at his feet) What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy? \nPLANK (fumbling and panicking) I didn't touch him, he just passed out. \nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY \nWINSTON J, what's going on out there? (Realising) Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked. \nINT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY \nDOG Get the sodding gate open now, Plank. \nPlank is busy fumbling about, not really getting anywhere because of the pressure being applied. \nPLANK (trying to convince himself, as much as Dog) It must be this one. \nDOG Just give me the keys. \nThe gun with which Plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at Dog's groin. \nPoint your gun in there, dick, not at me. \nMick has unwrapped his gun from his case. Dog turns and looks amazed at the size of the weapon. \nWhat the fuck is that? \nMICK It's a bren gun. \nDOG You could have brought something a bit more fucking practical, couldn't ya? \nPop! We hear the sound of an air gun pellet hitting the bars. \nPLANK (trying to salvage some credibility) Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya. \nDOG (amazed by this stupidity) Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there. \nDOG OK, open the gate. \nNo sooner said than done. Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs. 97 \nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY DOG \nUp boy, up, up. \nThey reach the top of the stairs. \nTie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me. Where's the money? \nPLANK There, in those shoe boxes. \nDog opens them. There is nothing in them. If looks could kill Plank would be pushing up daisies. \nDOG (gun to the head of Winston) Where? \nWINSTON Out the back. \nDOG And the weed? \nWINSTON Out the back. \nMICK Point. \nWINSTON With what? \nMICK Your hands, now! \nWINSTON I can't, I am tied up. \nMICK Well, well, shake your head or something. \nDOG All right Plank, get Paul out of the van. \nThis is done on a walky talky. \nINT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY \nThe door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He turns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight into Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger as he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming uncontrollably \nDOG (to Plank) Give us your knife. \nDog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to its source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand. \n(the point of the blade resting on William's throat) Enough! Mick, how you doing? \nMICK How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off. \nDog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly packed and stacked. \nPAUL (in doorway visibly shocked Gordon Bennett! What's been going on in here? \nDOG Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in? \nPAUL There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get this all in the van. \nDOG Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips. \nEXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY \nA traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up. \nINT. DOG'S VAN - DAY \nDog turns to admire a full van. \nTRAFFIC WARDEN You won't get away with it. \nDog turns around and sees the tragic warden. \nDOG Paul, what's that? \nPAUL That's a traffic warden. \nDOG (looking straight at Paul) What's he doing in the van? \nDog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly \nPAUL He was about to call the cozzers. \nPaul hits him again, sending him back into unconsciousness. \nDOG We will deal with him later. \nEXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY Tom is on the mobile phone. \nTOM They're here. \nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY \nDog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and is met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing his chest. Dog sighs and turns to get more bags. The action starts. It's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas. The lads jump out of their positions. \nBACON Down, down, get fucking down now' \nThis is like d??vu. There is no response as the three of them seem not to believe what's going on. BACON hits Dog with the butt of his gun, establishing who's boss. Dog does down with a thud. Plank hits the floor immediately. \nEXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY \nPaul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is met by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead pipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged in screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly \nEDDY Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys. \nDOG I'll find you. \nBACON Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble. \nEDDY I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there. \nINT. DOG'S VAN - DAY \nThere is silence. For a few seconds all we can hear is the noise of their breathing. \nTOM Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it? \nSOAP When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know. \nEDDY Bacon, see what we got. \nBACON Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden. \nTOM A what? \nBACON A traffic warden. Look, what's this? \nHe holds up the hat. \nNATHAN Fuck you funny man, you go first. \nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nNATHAN Shit! \nWinston is tied up and squirming. \nWINSTON For Christ's sake, get us out. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nEDDY Well, not a bad day's work. That takes care of Harry. \nPushing a massive pile of notes to one side. \nSOAP What's left over?' \nTOM Hold on, give us half a chance to count it. \nSOAP What about all the gear? \nBACON 'Ere, have a pull of this. \nPasses Ed the joint. \nEDDY I don't want that horrible shit. Give it to Soap. Can we just lock up and get drunk now, please? \nINT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nWe see Winston, Nathan and the torso of Lenny, standing in front of Rory Like naughty schoolchildren. \nWINSTON We had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through. Poor bloody J got shot; it was a right mess. \nThe gravity and reality dawns on Rory. \nRORY It will cost you more than your life's worth if you jest with me. \nLENNY Some girl took one of 'em out, but he's a bit of a mess. \nWINSTON (proudly j We shot one of them in the throat. \nRORY What do you want, a fucking medal? I'll shoot you in the fucking throat if I don't get the gear back. \nHe pauses, rubs his forehead and continues, slightly calmer. You shot the one that's in there now? \nWINSTON \nNo, another one. \nRORY This is more like it. So where's he? \nWINSTON They took him with them; he was still alive. \nRORY Well, what did you shoot him with, an air gun? \nThere is an embarrassed pause and a look of `how did you know?' Rory doesn't need an answer and slaps his forehead. \nWINSTON We grow weed, we're not mercenaries. \nRORY \nYou don't say. \nPLANK Dog, we have been up all night. It's no one round here! We have had them all against the wall. \nJOHN If it was a toe rag from the area we would know. \nDog starts slapping his troops round their heads. \nDOG You wouldn't know if it was the next-door fucking neighbours, you prick! You find 'em, you hear? And find 'em quick! Now get out and start looking! Out! Out! \nDog Loses his temper and throws Plank across the room. Plank's head breaks effortlessIy through the wall. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S CUPBOARD - MORNING \nA dust-covered Plank blinks in confusion as he looks on to a heap of recording equipment. \nINT. JD'S BAR - DAY \nRecovering from the night before. \nBACON Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface! \nEDDY That inspires confidence, that does. \nTOM This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse? \nSOAP I would take a pain in the arse for half a million. \nTOM You would take a pain ? the arse full stop. \nSOAP Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get. \nEDDY Jesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute . . . After we pay Hatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each. Not bad for a day's work, I think you will agree. \nINT. SPLTT SCREEN. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY \nA seventies-style split screen. A very shaky Nick answers his cartoon telephone. \nNICK Yeah? \nINT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY \nDEAN That's no way to answer the phone. \nNICK Is that you, Dean? \nDEAN Sure is. \nNICK What can I do for you? \nDEAN You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back. \nNICK Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again. \nDEAN I got the money to pay for 'em. \nNICK I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again. \nGary looks at Dean. \nDEAN If we can't get 'em, we can't get 'em. \nINT. SPLIT SCREEN. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY. Barry is on his mobile, moments later. \nBARRY You fucking well have to get 'em! \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nRory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door. The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with gun) prepares to do his worst. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nThere is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a large black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as both gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the machine gun to explore further. \nPLANK (under his breath) What the fuck is going on here? \nDog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use them. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.' \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nWe see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY \nDog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than aware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then checks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit. \nEXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nBig Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks straight into him. \nBIG CHRIS Got something here for me, have ya? (Dog is stunned by this) Come on, chop chop. \nBefore Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much. \nOn reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on the back seat. \nCount that son, and put your seatbelt on. \nINT. SCOUSERS' CAR - DAY \nDEAN Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nEd's place has been shot to pieces. Only Rory and Winston (in shock) seem to be left. Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his van, then he kicks over one of the bodies. It's a blood-covered Plank. \nRORY BREAKER This is one of them. \nWinston nods in confirmation. \nLucky, that. \nBang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and Plank despatch each other simultaneously. \nINT. ED'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nTom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving. 126 \nTOM There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them? \nSOAP Six. \nTOM How many wings have they got between them? \nSOAP Twelve. \nTOM How many feet? \nSOAP Er, well, twelve. \nThe Scousers watch Big Chris walk out of Hatchet's empty-handed \nDEAN We gotta get those guns. \nGARY This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there. \nDEAN Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet. \nGARY Furry muff, let's go. \nEXT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) - DAY \nSOAP I hope this is the right move. \nEDDY It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him. \nBACON As if he'll care. \nEDDY He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone. \nBACON Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY \nThe two Scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs. There's only one door in front of them. Dean gets ready to kick it open. Gary leans against the wall and delivers a Professionals-style kick. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHarry is in his offtce playing with his guns. The phone rings. \nHATCHET That you, boy? \nEDDY (on phone) It's Ed, if that's what you mean. \nHATCHET It's pay day, ain't it? \nEDDY (on phone) I wanted to talk to you about that. \nHATCHET I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now! \nINT. ED'S CAR - DAY \nEd puts the phone down after a pause. His state of shock is obvious to the rest of the lads. \nBACON Well? \nEDDY Well what? \nTOM (impatiently) Well, what did he say? \nEDDY He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now. \nSOAP You what? What are you on about? \nEDDY Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him. \nBACON I think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start making sense. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nWe cut to a time Lapse. Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his bum on the front of his desk. He is ecstatic with the guns. He loads and plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds. \nThe door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a Scouser standing in the door. Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying through his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the decision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is he holding a shotgun'. Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the doorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver, holding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail. The pair are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer. Hatchet Harry has effectively contracted his own demise. The pause is eventually shattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers. There is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective targets. Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest. The Scourer is airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges. One of Dean's bullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder. Gary can do nothing to stop this atrocity. He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past him. \nBig Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and starts the car. \nDOG What are you doing? \nBIG CHRIS Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive. \nDOG You had better be careful. \nBig Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife. Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle. BANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen. \nINT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY \nAnother time lapse. \nSOAP Well, what's going on? \nEDDY I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear. \nBang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash goes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked unconscious. \nINT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY \nBig Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing so. \nBIG CHRIS Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to me as you have. \nDog is being thrown around like a rag doll. \nINT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE \nWe are looking through a two-way mirror. \nSERG Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need to know what's going on, Edward. \nEDDY If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded. \nThe camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a policeman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he shakes his head. \nTRAFFIC WARDEN No, that's not one of them. \nThe policeman then knocks on the door. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nThe SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on his own. After a short pause the door bursts open. \nSERG All right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here. \nFADE IN TO BLACK. \nFADE IN. \nINT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT \nAll the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is interested in whatever he has to say. \nEDDY The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us. \nBACON Apart from those shotguns. \nEDDY And Tom took care of them. \nPause while Tom looks embarrassed about something. \n", "test1_input": "DEAN I thought you said no staff, Bazza! \nBARRY You get the guns? \nDEAN You should see what they did to poor Gary. \nGary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state. He obviously doesn't know what day of the week it is. \nDEAN Gary, get back into the van! \nBarry frowns down the telephone. Yeah, yeah, we got 'em. \nBARRY Good. I'll speak to you later. \nBarry clicks the phone off. Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as if speaking to a deaf person. \nDEAN Gary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the van now, OK? \nDean takes his arm and guides him back into the van. \nBOXING GYM - NIGHT \nStakes have increased dramatically. There is a pause as Frazer looks at his cards. \nEDDY Twenty thousand open. \nPHIL OK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going on here. I fold. \nHATCHET Got some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy? \nHatchet looks impatiently at the door. \nEDDY Fifty grand. \nHatchet scours Ed's forehead. It is still dry. \nHATCHET Eighty grand. \nBOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT \nBarry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly zooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just enough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards! \nEd's got nothing but a pair of sixes. Barry excitedly starts tapping away. \nINT. BOXING GYM - MGHT \nEDDY One hundred grand. \nFRAZER Hold on fellas, I know . . . \nHATCHER (interrupts j I know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know. Two hundred and fifty. \nHatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a nervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills frame. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the pause is broken. \nEDDY That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred. \nHATCHET Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY \nAs you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough to continue. \nPause. \nCROUPIER We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to continue. It's a loan or we see both your cards. \n", "test1_true": "It doesn't look . . . \nHATCHET (interrupts) I will. \nEDDY You will what? \nHATCHET I will loan you the money. \nSilence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a second, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its long silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's cards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this worrying news. \nEDDY I think I would rather just turn them over. \nHATCHET I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow. \nEDDY I need two hundred and fifty grand. \nHATCHET No, you need five hundred grand to see me. \nEd's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat. \nEDDY That's if I want to see you. \nHATCHET Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha. \nThe pause is painful. \nCRUOPIER You can still fold. \nEDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice. Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier pleads with Eddy. \nEDDY I'll see ya. \nHATCHET For half a million? \nEDDY Unless you are going to accept twenty quid. \nHATCHET And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold. (Pause) OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK? \nThese last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He is committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet turns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY ushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; then the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a loud pause . . . \nCROUPIER Is that it? \n* Cut from completed film. \nFRAZER He was bluffing! \nHatchet looks content and rather nonchalant. \nHATCHET Let's see your fucking cards. \nNobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY expectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They contract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever. \nFREEZE SHOT OF EDDY \nEDDY (voice-over) I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million. \nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY \nHarry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear. \nHATCHET I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give you all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what? \n", "test2_input": "Ed gets up. We stumble with him in slow motion. He is hardly able to stand. He wobbles over to the door. Harry continues to talk over the top. \nBusiness is business, and I am good at making mine work. I like your dad's bar, JD's, so don't get clever or lethargic. If you can't pay in a week, a few fingers and a bar for starters. \nEd stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door. \nINT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT \nEd has made his way into the bar. All his friends have fallen asleep. One of Bacon's eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up. \nBACON This doesn't look good. \nThe others wake on this statement. We cut between the lads and their frozen reaction. \nFREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK \nEDDY (voice-over) I then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was no way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie. \nRELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS \nEDDY Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own. \nTom drops his drink and rushes Eddy. \nTOM I'll kill him! \nBACON (intercepts Tom) Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do? \nSOAP What's all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment? \nThey all look at Soap like he is mad. \nINT. HATCHET HARRY'S' OFFICE - NIGHT \nBACON (voice-over) Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe. \nEDDY I'll think of something, don't worry. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nEd, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets. He stumbles along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket. He stops outside JD's, looks at the entrance and decides not to go in. \nINT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY The ridiculous door-bell horn blows. \nJ Who the hell's that. It's only twelve. \nWINSTON Use that cage, that's what it's there for. \nWILLIAM (off) Who is it? \nPLANK (off) Plank, open up. \nThis is done without the use of the steel-caged security door. \nThis weed is getting quite a reputation, you know, fellas. Gloria remains motionless in her chair. Plank waves his hand about in a sort of `how you doing' way to everyone and goes to take a seat. At the last minute, poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to sit on this girl. \nJesus! Never saw you there. Hello, love. Enjoying yourself? \nGloria doesn't respond. Plank waves his hand over her face. Still no response. Plank looks around for some acknowledgement. \nIs she, er, compus? \nWINSTON (doesn't look up) What do you think? \n", "test2_true": "GIRL BOO! \nPlank jumps back, completely taken by surprise, knocking over a pedestal of shoe boxes stacked up against a wall, full of fifty-pound notes. \nPLANK Fuck me! \nCharles, pissed off, looks at William like it's his fault. \nCHARLES Fod God's sake. \nWILLIAM Clean that up, Charles. \nCHARLES Sod you, you clean it up. \nPLANK Sorry fellas, but that stupid cow! \nWILLIAM Never mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way. \nWINSTON Anyway, how much do you want? \nPLANK (trying to look like the money hasn't had an impact on him) I am after a half weight. \nWINSTON That's one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out the gear, Charlie. Any chance of seeing your money? \nINT. JD' S BAR - DAY \nCut to Bacon, Soap and Tom sitting and talking in the back of JD's bar. They don't look a lot better than Ed. \nBACON The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand. \nSOAP I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas? \nBACON At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard. \nSOAP It's hit us all hard! \nBACON Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar. \nTom, who has not really been listening, suddenly interrupts. \nTOM Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er . . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques! \nThere is a long pause while BACON considers this. \nBACON So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return? \nTOM Probably no longer than four weeks. \nBACON A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days? \nTOM Well, it's still a good idea. \nSOAP Listen to this one . . . \nINT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY \nWe see the back of a head. \nDOG So do you know these geezers well? \nPLANK Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years. \n", "test3_input": "DOG And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy? \nALL TOGETHER Yup. \nDOG Right, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it. Apparently these stags don't get out of bed till midday, lowest ebb and all that, and that's how I like it. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY \nBACON is now lit by candle. \nBACON Jesus. \nDOG (off) So no messing around tonight. We leave eight a.m., OK? \nEDDY Yes? \nBACON It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSOAP (staggering) Where did you get those from, a museum? \nTOM Nick the Greek. \nBACON How much did you part with? \nTOM Seven hundred for the pair. \nSOAP Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good. \nBACON Jesus, Tom, do they work? \nTOM I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em. \nEDDY Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look. \nSOAP Ladies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only got two real guns . . . apparently that's what they are. We find a good place to hide next door. When it sounds like the right time, we jack in the box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here. As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last thing they'll expect. If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them around a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt any one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think knives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones that look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because they don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to use them. That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros. \nThere is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion. \nTOM Is there something we should know about you, Soap? \nBACON I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past. \nINT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - MORNING \nEd and Bacon, etc, are all mounted up on top of one another looking out a crack in the curtain. They are observing Dog's party en route to work. They are dressed as kebab shop assistants. \nSOAP Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery. \nEDDY Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom? \nTOM Well, not exactly like that. \nINT. DOG'S HOUSE (VAN) - MORNING \nDog and troop load up. \nINT. SLDANES' SITTING ROOM - MORNING \nCut to Sloanes. They are up and unusually awake. Today is the day to move the money so they are comparatively alert. There is lots of activity. \nWINSTON You fucking jelly-heads, move it. You have been up for two hours, you should have got somewhere by now. The gear and the money has got to be out of here before twelve. \n", "test3_true": "Who's that? J, don't you dare open the door until you use that cage. I am serious, and find out who it is first. \nINT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY \nJ (raising his voice for the door) Hello, can I help you? \nPLANK All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there? \nJ No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment. \nPLANK Well, perhaps you can help? \nJ Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean. \nPLANK Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting? \nJ I can't help you, Plank. \nPLANK I think you'll find it is in your interest. \nINT SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY \nJ Hold on. OK. (Whispering inside.) Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest. \nWINSTON I don't care if it's King fucking Kong, he is not coming in here, not today. \nWILLIAM Hold on: we are in business and correct me if I am wrong, but that is business? \nJ Corrected; that's a walking accident that we can do without. \nWILLIAM Jesus, he's OK; he knows only to buy weights now, so we are looking at least a couple of thou; just one last time. \nJ What do you think, Winston? \nPause. \nWINSTON Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do. \nEXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY \nDOG (frustrated) What the fuck is going on? \nMICK Do you want me to have a look, Dog? \nDOG No, you silly fucker, stay still. (Whispering) What's going on? \nPLANK Come on, I can't wait out here all day. \nStarting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off Plank looks down the stairs and waves at Dog as some kind of reassurance. \nJ (off) All right, just coming. \nJ unlocks the door after getting the cage ready. There's an external door, and then a small corridor before the cage. J is inside the cage. Two, or at a push, three people could fit in this space before they would be poking out on the outside world. \nINT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY \nPLANK I thought you were going to leave me out there all day. \nJ I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank. \nPLANK (taking the piss) Lives and learns doesn't one. \n"}
